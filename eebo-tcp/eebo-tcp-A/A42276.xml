            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst many other times that I have had the <hi>honour</hi> to wait upon <hi>his Royall Majestie,</hi> who now lives (and whom God long preserve, and speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store to all his <hi>Due Rights</hi> and <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives,</hi> I humbly beseech him) it was my fortune once to attend him, when a young Nobleman that was then going to travell, came to kisse his Majesties hand, and to take his leave of him. To whom the King was graciously pleas'd to give this sound though succinct councell, <hi>My Lord, keep alwayes</hi> the best company, and be sure never to be Idle. As King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory, did deservedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title his Booke dedicated to the then so hopefull Prince <hi>Henry</hi> ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟN&amp; gr; ΔΩΡΟΝ <hi>A Kingly guift.</hi> I thinke I may safely stile this his Sonnes advice, ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ  ΒΟΥΑΗΜΑ  <hi>A kingly Councell.</hi> It doth indeed containe very much in very little; I am sure it made such impression in mee, as I hope shall not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be effaced. <hi>Cum his versare qui te meliorem facturi sunt</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca</hi>) And where is this conversation better to be had then in the best company? <hi>Dimmi con quien tu vai, e sapro quel che fai,</hi> saith the Spaniard. There is no better touch-stone whereby to know the worth of a mans actions, then to observe what company he usually keepes. Our English <hi>Seneca</hi> (Doctor <hi>Hall</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:55221:3"/>
sayes; <hi>Next to being good, 'tis good to converse with them that are so: if we be not better'd by their example, we are blest by their protection,</hi> and as for <hi>Idlenesse,</hi> the same man saies <hi>The idle man hath neither leasure, nor power to avoid sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To apply this to my selfe, and to the occasion, since it hath pleased Almighty God to seat me in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as for the present and for some yeares last past, I am not onely debarr'd the attendance upon his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty</hi> (a happinesse which from his infancy and mine, till of late yeares, I have enjoy'd) but also am inhibited to sit and vote in the house of <hi>Peeres,</hi> (the next best of Companyes) for having obey'd his <hi>Maiesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> upon no lesse penalty then the <hi>forfeiture</hi> of my <hi>allegeance</hi>; and for not having obey'd the Summons of the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> when I was not in a <hi>condition</hi> or <hi>capacity</hi> of doing so, (A fault which mee thinkes, and I wish I could perswade others to thinke so too, <hi>Five yeares deprivation of birth-right</hi> might be able to expiate) I have betaken my selfe to converse with Bookes, which if good in themselves, certainely are no bad company. Amongst these, lighting upon this my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (which if not too much injur'd by my <hi>Translation,</hi> I presume may be admitted into the number of good bookes) that I might the better evade <hi>Idlenesse</hi> (the Kings second <hi>Cautelous Councell</hi>) and that I might in some sort be serviceable, to my <hi>Country,</hi> since I am not permitted to be so, the way I would; I betooke my selfe to put it into our <hi>Idiome,</hi> and have now adventur'd it, and my judgement in the <hi>Choise</hi> thereof, to the censure that usually waites upon the presse. The subject thereof is Warre inter-laced with other occurrences; as <hi>Treatyes, Leagues, Embassies, Councells, Discourses, Geographicall descriptions</hi> of <hi>Countryes, and Rivers, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon actions, Characters. &amp;c.</hi> The Warre here treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, is, that which hath befalne <hi>Germany, France, Italy, Flanders, Holland, Lorreine, Piemont, Leige, Montferrat the Grisons,</hi> and other adiacent parts of so late times, as there is none who hath arrived at maturity of yeares, but may remember somewhat of them, and whose
<pb facs="tcp:55221:3"/>
eares have not been acquainted with the Names of the <hi>Princes,</hi> and other <hi>chiefe Personages,</hi> herein mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so as it may serve to recall into their memoryes, that little which they may have heard thereof before; and compleate their understandings with the <hi>full</hi> and <hi>satisfactory</hi> knowledge of what may not as yet have been so perfectly deliver'd unto them. And all this in a well-woven History, which may be termed a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi> the <hi>Scean, Christendome,</hi> the <hi>Actors,</hi> the <hi>Princes</hi>; and as many as have been famous in this our age as well for the conduct of Civill, as of <hi>Martiall</hi> affaires. There is a second volumne of this History already published by the <hi>Author</hi>: whether I shall trace him in that or no lam not yet resolved; according as this shall take I may be more or lesse, perswaded thereunto. But if my <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> proceed further upon this subject, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall upon our troubles (for his second part ends just where our miseries began) he must pardon me if I tread no farther in his foote-steps, since they are such as I could wish were rather buried in <hi>Oblivion</hi> then record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto <hi>memory</hi>; being by all parties, interessed, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be <hi>unnaturall. The Lord of his infinite mercyes put a Happy a spedy,</hi> and <hi>a lasting period</hi> unto them: and let all true hearted <hi>Englishmen say, Amen.</hi> And that <hi>I</hi> may perswade them so to do, by putting their helping hand to an happy accommodation, I shall referre them to what <hi>Guicchiardin</hi> sayes. <hi>In tutte le attioni humane e nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le guerre massimamente, bisogna spesso accommodare il consiglio alla necessita, ne per ottenere quella parte ch' e troppo difficile e quasce impossible, esporre il tutto a manifesto pericolo: non essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do manco officio del Ualoroso capitano, far operatione de savio, che d' animoso,</hi> in English, thus; in all humane actions, and especially in warre, men ought oftentimes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise which necessity, and put on their resolves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and not expose the whole to manifest danger out of a desire of obteining a part, which is to hard to compasse, and almost impossible: it being no lesse the duty of a worthy commander to be advised then vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in his proceedings. And to what the same Author
<pb facs="tcp:55221:4"/>
saies in another place, <hi>La prima laude nella disciplina mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare consiste piu nel rendere con la industria con la patientia e con</hi> s' <hi>arte Uani i conati degli anversarij, che nel combattere feroce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,</hi> which may be more breifely Englished in Mr. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> words, Not <hi>Fury,</hi> but <hi>Discretion</hi> must be the guide of war. And lastly I shall recommend unto them the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Cicero; <hi>Quem discordiae, quem caedes civium, quem bellum civile delectat; eum ex numero hominum eijciendum, e fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus humanae naturae exterminandum puto.</hi> I am of opinion that he who takes delight in discord, murther of fellow Citizens, Civill Warre, ought to be thrown out from conversing with men and not to be admitted within the precincts of <hi>humane</hi> nature.</p>
            <p>For the truth of what is herein written; you heare the Author say in his Epistle, part of it is drawn to the Life, as actions whereof he himselfe hath been an eye witnesse, the rest he termes a <hi>Copy</hi>; yet such a one as is copied from the best hands: he having been very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the choise of those whose relations he hath list'ned unto and made use of; so as at least you may afford him an <hi>Historicall</hi> faith.</p>
            <p>All that of my selfe I shall say concerning my Author is, that in my life time I never mett with lesse appearing <hi>Partiality</hi> in any Treatise of the like nature, partiality being a corruption wherein usually the greatest escape. But to keep thee no longer from tasting better <hi>Viands</hi> by a homely break-fast; I leave my <hi>Author</hi> to thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and my selfe to thy <hi>Favourable Interpretation.</hi>

            <p>These rough draughts of mine coming to the sight of some of my friends, afforded them occasion to perswade mee, or to say better, to constraine mee to print them, promising me that if they could not be admitted into the narrow path of praise, they would at least passe the gate of gratitude, whether he sometimes gets, who without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of merit, doth by the sincerity of his will make amends for the faultinesse of his effects, I confesse this their invitation seemed a dreame to me, for to carry the splendid tables which in these dayes are so imbellished, a dish ungarnished with the amber of invention, and wanting the flowery garlands of stile, is no better then to nauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the guests. But these my friends perswading me, that men doe differ in their tasts, that some like better what is tarte and sharpe than what is sweete, and that the greediest understandings doe oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times distaste meats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too artificially cooked, they did perswade me into this errour, I say errour; for if whosoever differs from the generall custome, goes astray, I who write (my beard not being gray, and without <hi>Horace</hi> his nine yeares rule) shall peradventure be blamed for putting moderne actions to the presse written by a young head, They freed mee also of this feare, telling me that <hi>Horace</hi> was a <hi>Poet,</hi> and that he spake of <hi>Poems, Orations,</hi> and other quaint com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures; not of History, since that she, (which ought alwayes to be the picture of truth, and without the attendants or imbellishments of witt) is alwayes one and the same, when the draught is made by the life; and is much more comely naked, then when cloathed by invented adornments drawne from time, And they added hereunto; that those who writt things which were acted many ages agoe, doe it, for that there being none to oversee them, they may boldly tell some untruthes without feare of reprehension; and if they compose with their hand upon the planke, and their foot in the ditch, they doe it, least they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come spectators to the anatomies of their owne workes. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yeilded to slip, yet but with one foote. For though I have written all the warres of <hi>Bohemia, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which have fallen out in my time, I publish onely the successe of things, from the moving of the King of <hi>Sweedes</hi> forces, to the taking of <hi>Turin.</hi> And have done this, for that I thinke if what hath hapned in these eleaven yeares, and which peradventure will be fullest of curiosity, please not, my former discourses will be lesse taking, so as I may spare the labour which would be troublesome to me and tedious to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Those actions where I was an eye witnesse, are pictures drawne by the life, that which I have received from the relation of others, is a copy, If such be not truely drawne, the fault lyeth not in me, who have copyed things as they have been discribed to me, but in those who related them unto me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55221:5"/>It can hardly be made good that Copyes drawne from others hands conteyne in them a perfect forme, for many overcome by passion, or overswayed by affection, speake as they would have it be, Nor doth it avayle that things doe come from, or be reported by great persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or well reputed Ministers of State, for lyes like flyes flocke every where, and where they most smell the sweete of curiosity, there they take their station.</p>
            <p>I have notwithstanding indeavoured to have the relations of what hath hapned, from who have been present in the actions, but not from every one that hath been so, for many although they see, imbroyle the relation, as not being of Capacity either to understand, or to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what hath hapned, and so all foundations grounded thereupon prove vaine.</p>
            <p>A batttle sought betweene the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> will not without some alteration, be related either by a <hi>Frenchman</hi> or a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Affection is of a nature not unlike to wine, it tastes of the caske; the private passion of the minde, pertakes of the quality of <hi>Torrents</hi>; it is troubled and growes cleare againe answerable to the raine by which it is fed.</p>
            <p>If any shall say, that pen takes a precipitate and dangerous course which writes of present emergencyes, unbridled by adulation, tis granted. But he who writes in times when the government of the present Princes is not to be blamed, need not feare to fall upon the unpleasing off-spring of truth. The Princes of this age are knowne to be ruled by justice, and governed by reason. And if through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of state, or by the advice of their councell, they doe any thing which is not acceptable to all men, they are not therein blameable, for the greatnesse of men of might, is not seene in the peacefullnesse of minde, but is discerned in their sprightly thoughts, and vast intents.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Encomiums</hi> of the worthy Princes, even of these ages are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with no greater titles, then so many <hi>Caesars</hi> or <hi>Alexanders.</hi> Greatnesse loves greatnesse, The <hi>Danuby, Rhyne</hi> and <hi>Po</hi> are great, because the concourse of many Rivers goes to make them great; <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalityes</hi> are likewise plants, which branch forth and increase in hight more or lesse accordingly, as the ground is fertill where they are planted. The desire of glory and greatnesse, reignes not onely amongst the better, but amongst the inferiour, yea the basest sort of men, The private who neighbours upon an inferiour, rests not content till he hath joyned his neighbours land unto his owne. Such a genious labours to get the priority amongst those who are esteemed lovers of rarityes, the souldier fights, and looseth his life, to increase his fame amonst men; humane desires not unlike to torrents, by how much they are more swolne with the waters of glory the more headlong doe they run, &amp; oft times breake the banks or bounds of faith and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Those who have not been conversant in any other nation then their owne, and yet governed by a certaine Sympathy, professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to side sometimes with this, sometimes with that stranger, may peradventure wry the neck, when they shall heare of any bad accident which hath befallen one that they liked; and may perchance

say I am in some places too free spoken. If it shall so fall out; I would have them to know, I writ not to give satisfaction to any one save to truth it selfe; and that men write ill, when they omitt writing what is ill, fortune is not alwayes favourable, and therefore when she frownes she cannot be said to smile. Who apprehends the satisfying of all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does by his owne beliefe begin to prejudicate what he writes. Bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in relation, freedome in judgment, discretion in words, and wisedome in contriving, are the reynes which ought to governe the pen of an Historian.</p>
            <p>If others who may be of an opinion that such events as are written, whilest the actors themselves are yet living, are usually written par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and with adulation, and not adaequate to the times, and to the persons, and shall therefore blame me for writing so early, let them remember that the force and credit of truth is so much the greater, by how much it hath the more witnesses. That writings which are kept lockt up in a chest, are like some plants which kept in their own originall earth never grow, unles they be tane from thence, and placed some where else no lesse then these ought past events in History to be transplanted, whilest the bowes remaine in memory, for that if any bastard plant be given for legitimate, by the inocculation of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the second impression it may become legitimate. Nor is it at any time a fault, which is occasioned by the faultinesse of an other.</p>
            <p>I have thaught it fitting in these my labours to describe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of such Princes, and chiefe Commanders as have perished, that they may serve for looking glasses to such as succeede them. If it be objected, I onely writ their praises, and that <hi>Encomiums</hi> belong not to the weaving of a History, I would have it knowne, I make not use of such spectacles, or prospective glasses whereby men discerne spots in the Moone, That the praises fall not from my pen, but from their merit.

in <hi>Germany</hi>;<note place="margin">LIB. 1. 1629.</note> a Kingdome not onely divided by the dissonancy of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but exasperated by the new Government of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Officers of State; who after the Peace made at <hi>Lubec,</hi> though they seemed to have received some sort of reliefe by the Disbanding of Eighteene Thousand of <hi>Walestein's</hi> Souldiers, which was done by the command of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and at the Peoples intreaties; yet notwithstanding there being great store of Forces, remaining under the said <hi>Walestein,</hi> and those dispersed through every Province, with an unwonted forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, though feare kept the hatred and suffering of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects concealed, yet did not they, as likewise the Princes, cease to cast about how they might withdraw themselves from that yoake, the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties whereof they could not endure.</p>
            <p>But the greater their Conceptions were, the greater Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did they require, which made the King for the present forbeare to act his Resolves, and though by <hi>Walesteins</hi> (aforesaid) disbanding, and the <hi>Polachs</hi> alike disbanding the <hi>German</hi> Forces, he had furnish't himselfe with the best Souldiers of all those Troops; and though he were fully informed of the condition, strengths, and inclinations of his neighbouring Potentates, having himselfe in Person not many yeares before gone unknowne to search out the estate of <hi>Germany</hi> and other Provinces, that he might discover how people stood affected, and of what strength the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Haunce</hi> Townes were, yet he knew it was not yet time to take up those unripe resolutions, which being unadvisedly undertaken by the <hi>Prince Elector Palatine,</hi> by the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and others, had not brought forth that good effect, which doubtlesse was by many expected: being made more cautious by the said examples, (though his desire painted forth these difficulties, as slight ones, and his hopes upheld by apparent grounds, egg'd him on to this enterprise,) yet not suffering himselfe to be led by these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections out of the road of reason, but moderating the ardency of his Genius, by the remembrance of past errours, he kept his Name and Fame, as it were cancell'd out of the <hi>Germans</hi> memory. But if the Fire of this Princes desires lay for some time wrapt up under the ashes of patience and simulation, insomuch as there remained not the least suspition of him, it is no wonder if afterward unexpectedly breaking forth, and laying hold on the fittest occasions, it were able to rekindle the inconstancy of those Provinces, who under a feigned fidelity, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ill satisfied with the <hi>Austrian</hi> government; for most part of the people, remembring the liberty they had enjoyed, and not able to tollerate the command and subjection of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, and more particularly of such as were strangers, coveted nothing more then such like novelties.</p>
            <p>The King this meane while held good Intelligence with diverse Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and principall Protestants of <hi>Germany,</hi> by whom hee was not onely faithfully advertised of the chiefe proceedings of the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, but by frequent solicitations much importuned to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. The King was likewise much troubled at any longer delay: For his inclination leading him to Warre, he could not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with peace; but well weighing afterwards, that to carrie his

            <p>Humane Resolutions varying with the times, hee had afterwards this into particular consideration; that not onely the Protestant Princes and people, but the very Roman Catholiques were exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and fill'd with jealousie of the Emperours excessive greatnesse, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned through <hi>Walesteines</hi> haughtinesse, who thought by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at that time of more then a hundred Thousand foot, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thousand Horse, of divers Nations, dispersed over all <hi>Germany,</hi> he kept the Majesty of <hi>Caesar</hi> in reverence, his Subjects in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, his Tributaries in their devotion, and Strangers in feare, yet treated he the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> indifferently, not as free Princes but as Subjects; whereupon, for that the excessive authority of private men, and over-much greatnesse of Neighbouring Potentates is never liked by great ones, the Electors which pretend to keep the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Condition within its limits, could not suffer either the burthen they lay under upon this so just an occasion, nor that so many souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers should be maintained in <hi>Germany</hi> in the time of peace, to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples so great grievance, nor that the Throne of <hi>Caesar</hi> should be raised so high, they therefore privately sought out all opportune meanes, how they might unarme him, &amp; take from the Empire such a support, which if it had been made good, many are of an opinion the King had come no further then <hi>Pomerania. Walestein</hi> certified of these grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and incens'd thereat, gave not over his Imperious manner of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and threatning: But crying out the Emperour was betrayd, and that the chiefest Jewell in <hi>Caesars</hi> Crowne was taken away onely to put him downe, he justly fore-told the succeeding Calamities. By this meanes discovery was made, that this Commander was highly dista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and it was further foreseen that the reputation which those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had acquired by the Valour of <hi>Walestein</hi> being lessened, notable prejudice was thereby betokened to the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Crowne. The King likewise saw that by the Counsells of some Italian and Spanish Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State, chiefely by the advice of <hi>Caesar</hi> Duke of <hi>Vastella,</hi> then Embassadour from the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to the Emperour, assisted to that purpose by <hi>Villany</hi> the Spanish Resident, sent thither to moderate the greatnesse of <hi>Walesteines</hi> expeditions, the Forces were divided, part of them being sent into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Count <hi>Rambaldo de Colalto,</hi> who being desirous of such an employment, was a meanes to <hi>Caesar</hi> that <hi>Walestein</hi> formerly declared Generall in <hi>Italy,</hi> should be invested with the Dukedom of <hi>Mechelburg,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55221:8"/>
for that if that, could be effected, <hi>Walesteine</hi> had promised him, hee would refuse the Command in <hi>Italy,</hi> and procure the imployment for him. So <hi>Walestein</hi> as well to acquit himselfe of the favour recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as likewise that his intention was not to stirre out of <hi>Germany,</hi> that he might not grow lesse in authorities, and for the feare hee had le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t his Corrivalls might in his absence plot somewhat to his preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, procured that imployment for the said <hi>Colalto,</hi> to which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour easily condiscended; not so much out of the affection which hee bore to <hi>Walestein</hi> and <hi>Colalto,</hi> as to satisfie the Spaniards; who liked better of <hi>Colalto</hi> (as one lesse haughty, and who depended more upon them) and set themselves close to this Warre, for that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Italy</hi> consisting in the Counterpoising of the Forces of <hi>France,</hi> alwayes desiring to assist that side where they would get foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, if they should have wonne <hi>Casall,</hi> (a place of Retreat for the French Forces, and a Fortresse able to keep the State of <hi>Millan</hi> in continuall Motion, and the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> being weakned by the losse of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which Common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> as Arbitrator of all actions in <hi>Italy,</hi> by piously backing Justice, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a helpe to the weakest, and doth in part keep the Subjects of <hi>Italy</hi> alive) they did not onely hope to secure the <hi>Millanneses,</hi> but thereby to open the way for their Conquering the remainder of that Kingdome: a Designe of all others alwaies most studied of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. He moreover knew that those of the Nation were ill-apaid that imployments should be conferred upon Strangers: that the <hi>Haunce</hi> Towns &amp; Princes of the Empire, little affected with the <hi>Austrian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, were jealous of the greatnes of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and did mainly endeavour the weakning of it, which hee observed might easily be effected; for that the Emperour, in likelihood, would be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to give way to the disbanding of the supernumerarie Forces, or else to the sending of them out of the Empire upon some other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, thereby to make Electors at the Election of the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> willingly adhere to favour the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and not more to exasperate those Princes.</p>
            <p>Hee was likewise certifi'd that such Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour might hope for helpe from against the Protestants, were not well contented to see the Imperiall power screwed up so high, and were much troubled at the comming of the Army to <hi>Reine</hi> in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy.</hi> He hoped well in assistance, and diversions from <hi>France,</hi> which by the victories of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, was brought into a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and triumphant condition. He hoped likewise for helpe from the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was not well satisfied with the <hi>Austrian</hi> party for their usurping of the states of the Count <hi>Palatins</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes. He was no lesse confident of <hi>Holland,</hi> a growing Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, enricht by many Forces both by Sea and Land. Hee then saw the occasion was fitting, which he knew was not to be neglected; but that he was to reassume that Warre, which being with little successe begun by others had no other hopes but from his try'd valour. To the effecting of these Designes of the yeare 1629. Many Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were well received in <hi>Swethland,</hi> who had been returned from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55221:8"/>
the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Army, and from that Army which was sent to assist the King of <hi>Polonia</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Harnem,</hi> which was given out to be done by the good will of <hi>Walestein,</hi> who intirely hating every one that did but speak of Reformation, desired such Innovations as might make the Emperor know how ill he was advised in lissening to those who by a peacefull way did cunningly lead him to a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Warre. Having received good Intelligence by these, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them speedy Commissions to raise Forces; and on the other side, having gathered together the remainder of the Army which was brought back from the Warres of <hi>Livonia,</hi> and having taking such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as was requisite for the Souldiers pay in <hi>Gothland, Finland,</hi> and <hi>Smoland,</hi> hee in a few Moneths space found himselfe ready to bee served and obeyed by a strength of old Souldiers to the number of above twelve Thousand Foot and Horse. And now hee thought himselfe to bee in a good posture, to have ground enough to raise his plotted Designes upon, and to hoise Saile for <hi>Pomerania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pomerania</hi> extends it selfe along the Shore of the Baltique Sea, it is bounded on the East by <hi>Poland,</hi> and on the West by the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Mechelberg,</hi> inlarged afterwards by fruitfull Territories even to the Confines of the Marquisate of <hi>Brandemburg:</hi> She receives into her selfe the Noble <hi>Oder,</hi> one of the famous Rivers of <hi>Germany,</hi> which falling from the utmost parts of <hi>Moravia</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Silicia,</hi> runnes into the Lake called <hi>Grosse Haffe.</hi> The King having to this purpose called all his Captaines and Officers together, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the chiefe of his Kingdomes, (out of the which the King by a Fundamentall Law, cannot upon what pretence soever goe without the consent of all the Orders) at <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus being all in the great Hall of his Court, hee demonstrated unto them with valid reasons the necessity of this Warre, as well for the preservation of his owne Kingdome in quiet, as for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Faith, and in a very feeling manner enlarged himselfe to this effect:
<q>That the Empire was now growne to that height, as that the thirsty ambition of the greatest therein, exceeding their owne limits, would spread their Resolutions, even over his State, since it was evidently seen how he was injur'd by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists, who never having had any thing to doe with the Baltick Sea, had now declared <hi>Walestein</hi> to be Admirall thereof; an Usurpation not to be endured by a couragious King; that the Princely name of <hi>Swethland,</hi> had in their Imperiall Diets beene villified with scurrilous Writings and Hostill Edicts; that he suffered in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the <hi>Austrian</hi> Ministers of State; that his vast mind cryed for revenge; that the occasion of enlarging, and securing their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought not to be let slip by Princes, who had their wits about them; that Honour, Religion, and Greatnesse were the things now in question; that his Forces did not now differ from them of former times, so much dreaded, which had brought under the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55221:9"/>
fairest Nation of <hi>Europe</hi>; that the World would say the same of times past; that the like Fortune, as <hi>Alexander, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> had, would not be wanting to one of as undaunted a Courage; that it did not misbecome a King to quit his owne Countrey, whose minde being bent upon Glory, Greatnesse, and his Subjects Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, should not bee imbased by the leasure of Courts; that to spend his Talent in the Luxuries and Pleasures of Peace, did not become a Prince who had been brought up in Martiall Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and lastly, hee with a loud voyce said, that he would either Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice himselfe to the Negligence of his Fortune, or else returne unto his Kingdome loaded with Glory and Triumphes, having made himselfe knowne to be a King worthy of so valiant a People. Then making a little pause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and finding the affection of all the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by, by the cheerefulnesse of their Aspect, for as if they had been immoveable, they could not sufficiently shew their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of what he had so well said, hee invited them to follow him, promising that he would not onely be their Lord and King, but their Brother and Companion.</q>

            <p>Dismissing the Councell, he employed the ensuing days in hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the provisions of Victualls, Munition, and Artillerie: till such time as answer being returned from my Lords the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> by whose Intelligence all these Machinations were made and encouraged every day more, by that Common-wealth, which of all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, as well in respect of the Interest of State as also of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was desirous of this noveltie, and invited thereunto, and heartned therein, by Letters from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> having recommended the leavying of eight thousand other Souldiers to <hi>Auxilius Oxasterne</hi> Lord Chancellour of that Kingdome, and taken order for all things that concerned the good government of the Kingdome, which in his absence he left under the protection of the Queen his Wife, with the unspeakable applause of all the Nobility and People, who in great numbers floct to bid him farewell, He imbarqued himselfe, and all his Army on the thirteenth of June,<note place="margin">

            <p>He sayled from the said thirteenth of June, till the foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the same,<note place="margin">

            <p>The King leaving 500 Foot in this Island<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and two men of War
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55221:9"/>
for the safeguard of the Passage, and having made it a Store house for his owne Militarie Provisions, he took Ship againe on St. <hi>Peters</hi> day, the 29. of the same Moneth, and with a good Winde came to <hi>Vsedon,</hi> an Island dis-joyned from the firme Land of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> by two Armes of a Lake or Moorish ground called <hi>Frish Haffe,</hi> into which the <hi>Odor</hi> bisburthens it selfe, where there not being Foot able to withstand the on-set of a strong and fresh Enemy, the Imperialists who were there in Garrison resolved to abandon it, that they might not come to triall with the Swedish Forces; leaving onely two hundred Foot for the defence of certaine Sconces. They got to <hi>Wolghast,</hi> a City not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible for its situation and fortifications, standing upon that Arme of the Channell which divides the said City or Island on the West side from <hi>Pomerania,</hi> called the River <hi>Pene,</hi> by the making good whereof, it had been no hard matter to have driven away the Swedes from <hi>Vsedon,</hi> and the adjacent Sconces weakly situated, and not well fortified. But the King let slip no time, wherein the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques found themselves much straightned, and by consequence their Forces were weak, and their Counsells confused, their hope of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour uncertaine, and the effects of so suddaine an Incursion full of fears and frights. For at this very time, at the Diet which was held at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone,</hi> for the affaires of the Empire, instead of providing for this new Warre with the King of <hi>Swethland,</hi> whom they esteemed a pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prince, the aime of all the Electors tended onely to the disarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Emperour, and the putting the hatefull and insufferable <hi>Walestein</hi> out of his charge; which they did effect. For about this very time the Emperour was unadvisedly perswaded to write to <hi>Walestein,</hi> that having considered that the Generall was in the power of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and that he himself was in the power of the Generall, his pleasure was that he should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> himselfe into his owne Countrey. <hi>Walesteine</hi> being thus dismiss'd, readyly laid aside his staffe of Command, and writ back a respectfull Letter to the Emperour, wherein hee told him that his Imperiall Majestie was not in the power of his Generall, but in the hands of his treacherous Ministers of State; and so fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling all the ruine just as it fell out, he betook himselfe to a private life in <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being minded to make himselfe Master of some Fort, which might serve for a Retreat for his Army in case of need, before Resolutions and Counsells should bee taken for the defence of their Provinces by fresh Forces, having advanced some of his Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Vsedon,</hi> he without any manner of contestation took almost all the Townes thereof, which were plundered by the souldiers; and the people that were therein, were without respect put to the sword. The King at the beginning used much severity to his Enemies; for that well knowing of what force punishment is with those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to defend themselves, it was not to bee doubted, but that the souldiers despairing of all hope of succour, and affrighted by their owne danger, would lay aside all stubbornnesse, which flattered by good usage, doth oft-times grow the greater. Leaving a thousand Foot there for a Guard, and for the recruiting of some weakned places,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55221:10"/>
he forth-with re-imbarqued, and came into the River of <hi>Pand,</hi> where unshipping his Armie, he instantly sate downe before the Walls of <hi>Wolghast,</hi> against the which he planted foure Batteries, hee invested it on three sides, by speedy Approaches, and caus'd so much feare in the Defendants, as forsaking the City at the first on-set (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of Protestants, made the Imperialists jealous of the defence thereof) and retiring themselves into the Castle, wherein for six dayes they resisted the Swedes Assaults, at last despairing of succour, they yeelded upon Condition of comming forth with their Armes and Baggadge; these souldiers were so well pleased with the Kings dealing with them, who used much Clemency towards them, that as benefits where unexpected are most welcome, they thought they got more by losing then they did by overcomming, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved rather to try the acts of Clemency then blowes of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; many of them invited by the Kings new fortune, forsook the Imperiall Banners, and listed themselves under the Swedish.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Wolghast</hi> did so dishearten the <hi>Austrians,</hi> that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more by their owne beliefe then the Enemies Armes, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the necessaries of Warre they were in great confusion; so as the King in six dayes more, without any difficulty took <hi>Penemondt</hi> and <hi>Divenan</hi> in the utmost Northerne parts of the said <hi>Vsedon</hi>: for they were quickly surrendered by the Imperialists, who withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>Cammin</hi> upon another Channell towards the East, whither many of those people retired in safety.</p>
            <p>The King found himselfe feared, and his souldiers Couragious, who impatient of delay, with cheerefull voice said they must advance even to the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi>; this confidence begotten in the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, was much advantagious to the King, for they fought with the resolution of still over-comming; he brought his Forces under <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and caused his Horse to make excursions over all the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Villages, spoyling the Countrey; this he did to the end that those Countrey people, who had withdrawne themselves to strong Holds, perceiving their Farmes to be wasted, might finde that by fearing to lose they lost indeed; his Approaches and Batteries being made, he so plyed the Walls with his Cannon, and Mathooks, as at the end of eight dayes he was got close underneath the Wall, and was ready to assault the breach which he had made, and was large enough and fit to be set upon; and though the Imperialists mought bravely have made good, and maintained the Towne for some time, yet things unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and bold proceedings causing usually confusion, the Defendants, not hearing of any succour in readinesse for those parts, surrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the City unto the King, and 1500 Foot, and 400 Horse, with their Armes, Baggadge, and two Piece of Cannon marched out.</p>
            <p>This unexpected Swedish Invasion into the States belonging to the Emperour gave Allarme to all the neighbouring Countrey, and newes being sent thereof to <hi>Caesars</hi> Court, his Councell was aware of their error in having seconded them, by whose advise those Forces which had upheld the Imperiall greatnesse were disbanded, and whereby this ruine in <hi>Germany</hi> was caused, and that therefore it was requisite to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55221:10"/>
provide for the preservation of those Provinces, and strong holds, which not being well defended by the Imperialists, if they should fall into the power of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> would much prejudice the reputation of <hi>Caesars</hi> Forces: that the courage and Forces of the Enemies were grown greater, and that they had caused some important novelty amongst the Protestants, and other discontented people; who seeing a help at hand, and a safe place whereunto to have refuge, would boldly make known their evill intentions, though more then ever covered up under the ashes of weakenesse. Posts were speedily sent to <hi>Torquato Conti</hi> an Italian, who as then commanded the Imperiall Forces in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> that he should use diligence in mustering together the people of those Provinces, whereby he might oppose the <hi>Swedes</hi> further advancement, and stop the course of their proceedings, till such time as a powerfull succour might be raised, which should chase them backe into <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Directions were likewise sent to Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> who was then in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> and in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with the Forces of the Catholique League; that mustering the people of the neighbouring parts, he should draw neare <hi>Misina</hi> (a chiefe Province of <hi>Germany</hi>) in the Center whereof stands <hi>Bohemiah,</hi> placed between the Rivers of <hi>Sal</hi> and <hi>Elve,</hi> bordering on the North side upon the upper <hi>Saxony,</hi> and watered by <hi>Mulda,</hi> a River which taking its rise from those Mountaines which inviron <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> runs in pleasant streames into the <hi>Elve</hi> neare to <hi>Desseau,</hi> and other two uncontemptible Rivers, namely <hi>Plais</hi> and <hi>Elste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Austrian</hi> greatnesse, would peradventure at that time have altered their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency and friendship with the Emperour; wherewithall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly fomented the <hi>Austrian</hi> proceedings they had raised the Imperiall Authority to such an height, that repenting afterwards when there was no remedy, they were aware of what prejudice Princes do unto themselves when they foment the most powerfull. To this purpose likewise Letters were sent unto them, exhorting them to re-confirme their good intelligence, and to adhere unto the Emperours Forces, thereby to drive out of the Empire the disturbers thereof. The like negotiation full of prevalent exhortations, and enriched with quaint conceptions was held with the Duke of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> who was more then any other suspected to hold correspondency with the King: For this Prince being on all sides opprest by the Imperiall Garrisons, did not only desire to regaine his former authority, but could not light upon a fitter occasion then this, to revenge himselfe of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Officers; and indeed being become a Protestant, he did ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>The Emperour likewise writ to the King of <hi>Swethland,</hi> complaining of the Invasion he had made into the Imperiall territories, whereunto he had not any the least right or claime; that he expected not he should under faigned pretences,

have medled with the affaires of <hi>Germany,</hi> whereof the Emperor was the supreme Lord, that therefore he did friendly exhort him to desist from that enterprise, and not to irritate those Arms, which not long since had won gainfull and glorious victories over the perturbers of the common tranquility.</q>
This Letter being brought to the King, and the bringer thereof, which was a <hi>Bohemian</hi> Gentleman received with all civility, it was opened. The King seemed to be well pleased at the contents thereof, said unto the Gentleman:
<q>That he very much thanked his Master, for that he had vouchsafed to write unto him; that he would consider upon the contents; and that when his arme was well, which he yet wore in a Scarfe, by reason of a scratch given him therein by an Eagle in <hi>Slavonia</hi> (alluding therby to the assistance granted by the Emperor to the K. of <hi>Polonia</hi>) he would send him an answer:</q>
And without any more adoe, knowing that the Emperours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions was to entertaine him with Treaties, till such time as he had got Forces able to contest with him; he marched on, and set upon <hi>Stet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> a City well fortified with Wals, Towers, and Ditches; the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> seated in the midst therof, &amp; watred by the <hi>Oder</hi>: the first onset with lowd mouthed cannon was so furious, as that Col. <hi>Demitz,</hi> who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in chief in the town, though he knew that with those people he had in the Town, he was able for some while to defend it; yet perceiving the falshood of the people and Citizens, (who were almost all of them Protestants, and such as were ill affected to the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarians,</hi> and desired nothing more then a hand to pull the yoake from off their necke) and finding there was no remedy for it, resolved since he found Enemies aswell within as without, to go in his owne person and speake with the King, and perswaded him to take some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, but all he could say was but so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> who being in the City oppressed by the Imperiall Forces, came forth, and was received with extraordinary demonstrations of good will, many particulars were discoursed on between him and the King.
<q>Who said, his passing over the Sea was with intention not to take from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men what was theirs, but to put every man into his owne pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; that the scope and drift of his Forces, was to ease the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to lessen the immoderate greatnesse of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and to restore <hi>Germany</hi> to its felicity which formerly it had enjoyed in freedome and peace, not subject to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Government: He invited him to renue the correspondency, which had been held between the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and Dukes of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and to imploy in the continuation of this warre, such Moneys and Forces, as he knew that King deserved who had not spared his owne Crown, his owne Subjects, nor yet his owne life, for the common liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These speeches from a Prince, who parlyed with his Sword in his hand, sound easie accesse to the heart of one, who having the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, coveted nothing more then such an overture: He therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der writ their ancient alliances; he undertooke to pay Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Souldiers, for the common Designe; obliged himselfe to yeeld up <hi>Stettin,</hi> and moreover to pay unto him a Hundred Thousand Dollars,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55221:11"/>
which was presentely done. <hi>Demitz</hi> was forced to go forth of the Towne, with the Imperiall Garrison, cursing the Duke, and laying Fellony and Treason to his Charge; which was after made good by the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Decrees; wherby also all Commanders under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour were inhibited upon any whatsoever occasion to give quarter to the Inhabitants of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> for that they were Rebells, and guilty of High-Treason.</p>
            <p>The King being entred <hi>Stettin,</hi> with the great applause of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Citizens, by whom he was received with all demonstration of expressible affection that might be; having viewed the Fortifications, and left fitting order for the preservation of the Towne, which he made very much account of, for that it was in the midst of those Provinces against which he was to fight; he presently sent part of his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Stangart,</hi> a Towne girt about with Walls, and Bastions, after the ancient manner; placed upon the shoare of <hi>Ina,</hi> a River which taking its head from under the Wood <hi>Mariewaldt,</hi> having made a course of about twenty Leagues, runs into <hi>Oder</hi> neare <hi>Stettin</hi>; this Towne was defended by about eight hundred Souldiers; part men of the Country, part Imperialists, who at the first appearing of the Swedish Forces, not thinking themselves able to defend the Towne, retired themselves into the Castle, whether being followed, they yeilded themselves; the Garrison marching forth with their Armes and Baggage, went to <hi>Garis,</hi> a Towne upon the <hi>Oder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The losse of <hi>Stettin,</hi> upon which many and great consequences did depend, caused such fear and confusion in the Inhabitants of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces; who fearing every houre to heare newes of the Swedish incursions; and being at this time setled in a good condition, began some of them to run away, others to waver in their resolutions, and many to consult touching their agreeing with the King: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Imperialists much apprehending that this was occasioned by the peoples evill disposition, and the hatred they bore aswell to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Government, as to the Roman Catholique faith, they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try whether they were reduceable to their duties or no, by force of Armes; they therefore ran over those Countries, and sacking every where as they went, seizing on all things they could lay their hands on, not forbearing any thing which might afflict those people, or make them despaire. Many are of opinion that they did this, rather for that they knew they could not subsist, and that therefore they would first ruine all to prevent their Enemies, then for the other reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged in their excuse, they likewise surprized <hi>Wolghast,</hi> taken but a little before by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and with all possible diligence fortified themselves within the Castle, hoping by the preservation thereof to bridle the Kings proceedings against the other Forts of <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> and <hi>Pomerania.

               <hi>Saxony, Brandeburg,</hi> and other States, (upon whose declaring of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a well grounded advantage lay) seeing that the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces were farre off, and the Imperialists neere at hand, would be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised before they put on resolutions; which taken upon weake ground might promise them little advantage, and much ruine: he therefore thought it best by some meanes or other to keepe <hi>Tilly</hi> aloofe from him; and seeing no better way to effect this, he agreed with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrator of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> who was then at <hi>Strayhand,</hi> that he should returne into his City: This City is well inward in the State of the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandeburg,</hi> of a wonderfull strong scituation upon the River of <hi>Elbe; Elbe</hi> takes its head from the Mountaines of <hi>Resingbrig,</hi> or Gyant Mountaines between the confines of <hi>Bohemiah</hi> and <hi>Slecia,</hi> and usefully watering diverse Provinces and Principalities, after a very long course wherein she takes in into her self divers other Rivers, becomming Navigable for great Barkes, she disgorges her selfe into the North Sea. This City was very well furnished with all manner of provisions for defence, very populous, and extreamely ill affected to the Romish Catholiques; and if the King could get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he should not only easily draw the Electors and other Protestant Princes to side with him, who forbeare the doing thereof, only out of feare of the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> but would have brought his Forces to their desired end; he charged the Administrator that he should declare to the chiefe Magistrates thereof, that his Forces aymed at the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the common liberty, and of that Religion, which being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest by the Roman Catholiques, they must, or lose their lives and goods, or betray their consciences; this was forthwith, with much efficacy performed by the Administrator, a man of great authority, and a declared ill-willer of the Roman Catholiques; and finding no repugnancy in the people, desirous of novelty, and resolute in the maintenance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

This place was furiously set upon with Mattockes and Cannon, the bullets whereof found passage through their Parrapats not yet wholly finished: after a contention of sixe dayes, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants being so obstinate in the defence thereof, as that they despised all advantagious conditions: And though they saw their ruine at hand, yet still persevering in their weake defence, they were by a furious assault made by the <hi>Swedes</hi>; the King looking on, forced to forgoe their Parrapats; upon which the <hi>Swedes</hi> mounted, and without delay closely following the fugitives, they without mercy slew as many of them as they overtooke.

Wherefore he resolved upon a brave enterprize, which was, to march forward whilst <hi>Tillie</hi> was aloofe off, whilst For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune smiled upon him, and whilst the Romanists fled: He therefore marched with his Army to <hi>Landsperg,</hi> a Towne environed with good and strong Walls, in a very considerable situation, and a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Passage, whereby an Ingresse was opened to the heart of <hi>Sletia,</hi> standing upon the Bankes of <hi>Wartha,</hi> a gallant River, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from forth the utmost parts of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> neare to a Village called <hi>Crowlant</hi>; after a long course through the Countrey, falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Oder,</hi> between <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and the Fort <hi>Castrin.</hi> But finding that this Enterprize would be very severe, for that it was fraught with men and all things requisite for defence, he altered his minde, and went from those parts, leaving the Martiall <hi>Tod</hi> there with some Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot and Horse, to suppresse the Sallyes which the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists of that Garrison made, and marched forward to effect what he had long desired upon <hi>Franckfort</hi>; conceiving, that the winning thereof, would not onely put him in peaceable possession of <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania,</hi> and <hi>Marca nova</hi>; but (that which most imported) that thereby his Passage being opened into <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Marquisat of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg, Sletia,</hi> and <hi>Lusatia,</hi> (all of them great and rich Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and fit to maintaine his Army a long time) hee should ease the Townes already taken, of quartering his Souldiers; so as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free to traffique and husband their grounds, he from thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected requisite Provisions for his Army, and that it would bee easie for him to lead his Forces into the Emperours owne Countrey, and that of <hi>Walesteines,</hi> where he might encrease his Army, and proceed to greater Conquests, since that the People of those Provinces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fierce and Warlike People, and desirous of their liberty of Conscience, would flye as fast to him, and to his succour, as doth the Bee unto the Flower.

Having taken such Order as he thought fitting for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the City, and having brought all his Forces, as likewise them of <hi>Shamburgs</hi> into <hi>Baltagtion</hi>; he Mustered them in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Fields; and finding them to be 34000 fighting men, hee gave them double pay, and marched straightway towards <hi>Landsperg,</hi> aswell to dislodge the <hi>Swedes</hi> from thereabouts, as to provide for his owne preservation. The <hi>Swedes</hi> did not stay his comming, but at the first newes of his Marching they raised their Tents, and joyned themselves with the Kings Army: which observing what way the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists Forces took, kept neare <hi>Kastrin,</hi> a Fort belonging to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>; where those that were within, refusing to give them passage, though it were earnestly by the King desired of their Master, he fell to build a Bridge over the River, thereby to render the passage at <hi>Wartha</hi> unusefull to the Romanists. <hi>Castrin</hi> is seated in the middest of <hi>Marca nova</hi> upon the Banks of <hi>Oder,</hi> not farre from <hi>Wartha,</hi> which commanding all the neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, makes it selfe Arbitrator of the passage on that side of those two Rivers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Austrians</hi> having brought succour to these places, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving regained the courage which they had lost by the <hi>Swedes</hi> prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings: <hi>Tilly</hi> not thinking it to purpose to advance further to win those holds, which being well guarded by the Kings re-inforced Garrisons, backed by the Army in the Field, and secured by the deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of the Countrey, he could promise nothing to himselfe but the disbanding of his Army, which was already discontented for the want of necessaries, and moneyes, returned to his former Quarters of <hi>Magdeburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, who likewise thought it not now fitting time to try the issues of his first resolutions, for that he had understood what Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions <hi>Tilly</hi> had sent into those Cities; and not thinking it advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for him to stay any longer in those parts, betooke himselfe to thinke how he might yet take any Townes belonging to the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> or upon the Confines of the Dutchy of <hi>Mechel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>; he therefore raised his Camp from <hi>Lochinitz,</hi> a little Towne, which not long before had yeelded it selfe upon Conditions, and turned his march towards <hi>Mechelburg</hi>; hoping either to withdraw <hi>Tilly</hi> from his designe of <hi>Magdeburg</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or (if he would not be brought off it) to make himselfe Master of some places and passages of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, by the winning whereof he might put <hi>Pomerania</hi> in safety, and cause no small feare of his Forces in the Inhabitants of <hi>Meckel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> He returned to <hi>Stettin,</hi> and bringing his Army underneath <hi>New-Brandenburg,</hi> he demanded the City of the Garrison thereof, which consisted of five Companies of Foot, and three of Crabbatts; who not thinking themselves able to contest within their unperfect wals, with an Army of twenty thousand souldiers, presently condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55221:16"/>
and yeelded the Towne, which was only fortified after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient manner, with Towers, and Wals without Rampiers. The like did <hi>Loice</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> towards <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> upon the banks of <hi>Pene,</hi> which having sustained two hundred Cannon shot, accorded; where, whilest the King tarried two dayes, to learne in what condition the <hi>Romanists</hi> were, <hi>Malchin</hi> fell likewise into his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, a little Town watred by the River <hi>Pena,</hi> environed with Wals, Towers and Ditches, after the ancient manner, but well guarded and strengthened by Trenches and Earth-workes. This Towne was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by a Captaine using a stratagem of fires which he there made, whereby it seemed as if the whole Army had been there, when indeed he had with him but three hundred Foot, and one Company of Horse; by meanes whereof, the Defendants being scared, wanting their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who was then with <hi>Shamburg,</hi> and terrified by the meanes of this Captaine, who summoned the Towne, protesting that any the least delay would so incense the King, as that he would put them all to the sword, they yeelded. The King comming afterwards out of <hi>Lotz,</hi> on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> came before <hi>Dammin,</hi> a Fortresse of great importance, very well fortified; well stored with all provisions requisite to the maintaining of a strong place, and seated upon a very considerable passage, upon the <hi>Pene</hi>; between the Confines of <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Mechelburg.</hi> Vpon this Towne <hi>Tilly</hi> did much relye: for when this Towne (as he perswaded himselfe it would) should have held the King play, it would be a fitting time for him to encounter with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and draw them to battell upon disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, on the event whereof the Totall of all affaires depended; but the King drawing near the Towne with covered Trenches, erected three Batteries upon certaine platformes of earth, battering the walls with much violence; so as the souldiers within the Castle, who were five disheartned Foot Companies; for all that Duke <hi>Savel</hi> could say or do, to perswade them to defend the place, and expect succour (which might very easily be brought them) basely apprehending the <hi>Swedes</hi> violence, were the cause why <hi>Savell</hi> bethought himselfe to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as he did, being sorely tormented with the frequent shot, which scattered all their defences and houses in peeces, insomuch as the affrighted Inhabitants, rather desired to yeeld up the City, then to be lyable to the sufferings and danger they underwent by keeping it. <hi>Tilly</hi> was very ill satisfied with the surrender of this place, who not able to containe his anger, which too apparantly might be read in his countenance, considering that 17. Companies of old experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Souldiers had so woefully surrendered this strength, which was held one of the best of all those Provinces, accused <hi>Savell</hi> of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, though the fault was in some other Captaines; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in those that had the charge of the Castle; and was so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed against him, as that he dismist him out of the Army, and sent him to plead his justification at <hi>Vienna. Tilly</hi> taking his way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence towards the Dutchy of <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> with above Twenty Thousand Souldiers came before <hi>New-Brandenburg</hi>; he tooke it by storme, and put all that were in it to the Sword, for their having so cowardly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55221:17"/>
surrendred the Towne to King <hi>Gustavus</hi>: He did the like at <hi>Faldisburg,</hi> the defendants whereof not yeelding presently to his threates, and to the offers he made them; he made a gallant on-set, forced the few <hi>Swedish</hi> defendants that were therein, the greatest part whereof were by his men slaine; a cruelty not formerly used by <hi>Tilly,</hi> who being very religious, could not chuse but use clemency: but for that anger, like fire throwne into disposed Materialls, consumes what withstands it. The ill usage the Imperialists had at divers encounters received from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> made him alter his accustomed clemency, thinking the losses and injuries he had received were not to be revenged by Charity.</p>
            <p>But if those successes did please this ancient Commander, the newes of the losse of <hi>Coleburg</hi> for want of Victualls did much displease him; for this being a Fortresse of great consideration upon the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Sea, the Mastership whereof was held by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Fleet, the <hi>Swedes</hi> might so well nestle themselves therein, as it would be very hard for the Forces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, though seconded by good fortune to drive them thence, since they might be easily succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Victuals, or what else they wanted by Sea. <hi>Tilly</hi> therefore desirous that his fame which he had so gloriously won, should not be obscured by the peoples murmuring; who not beleeving the juncture of times, nor the alterations of worldly affaires, are only pleased or displeased according to the successe of what presents it selfe before their eyes; and very wisely foreseeing what lets he might meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all if he should march forward with his Forces to regaine what was lost in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> where he should not only find the people resolute in their owne defence, but likewise many Troopes of <hi>Swedes</hi> there, he turned his thoughts upon <hi>Magdeburg</hi>; an undertaking, which by how much the more difficult it was, so much more would his glory appeare therein, and the Protestants be the more terrified; since he should not onely thereby free himselfe from the frequent Incursions, which from thence was made upon such neighbouring parts as were well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to <hi>Caesar,</hi> but by this Sanctuary, he should stop the Carriere of the Kings vast Designes; but that which chiefely concerned him was, that by winning this place, and making it the seat of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, since it stood in the Centre of those Provinces, he might easily lead his Men into what part he best liked: and the Protestant Electors and other <hi>Haunce</hi> Townes, who might peradventure stagger in their wonted friendship and obedience to <hi>Caesar</hi>; their intentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this Key lockt up, and their affection to the <hi>Swedes</hi> concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they could neither so easily foment the Kings proceedings, nor refuse the desires of the Roman Catholiques; raising therefore his Campe from the aforesaid Townes, hee within a few dayes pitcht his Tents in the sight of <hi>Magdeburg</hi>: And being advertised that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had built a Fort upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> a League distant from the City, thereby to receive the succour more easie which they expected from <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Elector whereof, though he had not yet declared himselfe for them, they hoped that for his owne Interest he would not suffer the City to be lost; and this being to the advantage of the City,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55221:17"/>
               <hi>Tilly</hi> thought fit to lodge some men between this Fort and it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the intercourse between the one and the other being hindred, and succour thereby inhibited, the Fort could not be maintained; which fell out luckily: for the Captaine who commanded in chiefe in the Fort, and who never before had been conversant in warre, was so surprized with feare, as not making any part of that defence hee might, he cowardly surrendred the place. Princes who either flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by their affection to their servants, or too much given to thrift, conferre places of command upon such as are unexperienc'd in War: if they desire to be serv'd after this manner, let them admire this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The Romanists having wonne this place, they diligently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted <hi>Prester,</hi> a Sconce defended by good Foot; but the City fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lest the Imperialist, should likewise Plant themselves between this and the Walls of the City, the like might befall them, as had done by the former, resolved to forsake it, and to withdraw the men therein into the Sconce of <hi>Zoll,</hi> which was nearer their Walls, and which they had fortified to their best advantage.</p>
            <p>Whilst some Regiments of the Romanists Army laboured hard with great Forces on this side, under the Command of <hi>Merodes Fuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>Baldirow,</hi> Colonells of the League; Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> on the other side assaulted the Fort of <hi>Bucaw,</hi> and the Defendants wanting both Victualls and Amunition, hee took it: Whereupon, the City was beset at a nearer distance, and <hi>Tilly</hi> seeing the successe of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, made nearer Approaches with his Trenches, thinking to lodge himselfe between the Sconce <hi>Zoll</hi> and the City. Thus for want of men experienc'd in warre, the <hi>Magdenburgians</hi> doe shamefully lose those outward Forts, which they with so much charge had built, and by which they might for a time have kept the Enemy aloofe from their City.</p>
            <p>The King seeing the Romish Army employed there, not knowing how to bring them usefull succours, if he did not first make himselfe Master of such Passages and Places as were a hindrance to his Army, marcht on the 26. of <hi>March</hi> to the enterprize of <hi>Franckfort</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>March</hi> 26.</note> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten under <hi>Zenedick,</hi> a place wherein the Imperialists held a Garrison, he drew neare to <hi>Franckfort</hi>; where, though he found great great store of Roman Catholique Souldiers, as likewise the Marshall <hi>Tieffenbeck,</hi> who failed not as the King moved, to doe his best in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for defence, he beset it on three sides with five Batteries, which played continually: and the Trenches of Approach were with all diligence brought by the <hi>Swedes</hi> even to the edge of the Ditch of the out-works: whereat the Imperialists were so astonished, as though they wanted neither Men, Munition, nor good Rampires for their Defence; yet for that bold enterprizes are for the most part se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by Fortune, they seemed (as if they had been inchanted) to have lost their senses: for at the very first onset, they (little to their honour) forsook a strong <hi>Tenaglia,</hi> which for the better defence of the Port, <hi>Geben</hi> was guarded by foure hundred Foot, which was the chiefe cause of the losse of the City: for the <hi>Swedes,</hi> as the enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, got upon the Rampire, and advanced even to the Draw-bridge
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55221:18"/>
of the Gate, where making two Petars to play, they at five of the Clocke at night entred; and because the entrance of the second Gate was stifly resisted, which being inclosed with a great Trench, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with many Morter-Peeces, was not to be won. The King, who upon such like occasions was beyond measure diligent and fortunate; casting his eye upon the Wall, which within the Gate was upheld by the ramm'd in earth of the Bulwarks, made it suddenly be dug through: And whilst the Imperialists busied themselves in the defence of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Gate, not foreseeing the Kings designe on the other part, fifty of the boldest of the Kings Foot entred by the hole in the Wall upon the Rampiers, and won two Caveliers which stood over the Wall on the left hand of the said Gate; and turning the Cannon upon the City, did by this surprisall so amaze the besiedged, as not knowing what to do, they began to thinke how to save their lives: therefore making no longer resistance, they ran towards the Gate that leades to the <hi>Oder,</hi> that they might passe over and retire themselves in safety to <hi>Landsperg</hi>: But the <hi>Swedes</hi> roundly charging them, and the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists not finding free passage over the Bridge; for it was incumbred with Carriages, most part of the Souldiers fell into the water, and were at the mercy of their Enemies, who in hot bloud (as in such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters is usually seene) refused to give life to any one that looked like a Souldier, and tooke the City, using such severe cruelty, as in the like case is usually done by Souldiers.</p>
            <p>The losse of <hi>Franckfort,</hi> which was guarded by Sixe Thousand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as it was of great prejudice to the <hi>Austrian</hi> affaires, and a great abatement to the courage and hopes of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> the greater was the advantage the <hi>Swedish</hi> occasions got thereby; and the greater the Kings comfort, who seeing it was now no longer time to pause, but to display the sailes of diligence before the good wind of propitious Fortune; leaving good guard at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and fitting directions for the conservation thereof, he unlooked for, threw himselfe upon <hi>Crossen,</hi> placed in that Angle of the River <hi>Queis,</hi> which gushing out of the <hi>Oder,</hi> gives the name to a good space of ground; and then enlarging it selfe to the Confines of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Sagar,</hi> runs into <hi>Pomerania</hi> and <hi>Sletia. Crossen</hi> was defended by three hundred Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists, and many of the best Inhabitants of the neighbouring Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had withdrawne themselves, and the best things they had thither. From thence he came before <hi>Landsperg,</hi> against which he planted his batteries, and began his Trenches; whilst those of the Garrison did va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly oppose the <hi>Swedes</hi>: The young <hi>Count de Gratz,</hi> who commanded in cheife within the Towne, and who was a gallant Commander, and one on whom the Souldiers did very much relye, was slaine in a brave sally which he made against the <hi>Swedes</hi> first works. The King hereupon threatning a generall assault, the Souldiers being much danted by the death of their Chiefetany, and the harmes which they continually received from the Enemy, resolved to come to an agreement; as they did on the sixteenth of April,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>April</hi> 16.</note> One thousand five hundred Foot, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth with their weapons, bag and baggage, Drums beating, matches lighted, and foure peeces of Cannon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55221:18"/>By this losse of <hi>Landsperg,</hi> the way being opened to the <hi>Swedes</hi> into the Electorate of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the King thought he had fitting occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to perswade the Elector to declare himselfe; since that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try being exposed to the Invasion of the Kings Forces, it was not to be beleeved that that Prince, who was allied unto him by bloud, and of the same Religion, would refuse his friendship for the Emperours, of whose power the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> especially the Protestants, were not a little jealous. Having then made a Bridge upon Boates over the River <hi>Spree,</hi> a River which comes from the furthermost parts of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> towards the upper <hi>Lusatia,</hi> and by her watering those Provinces, is of much advantage to them, he sent a Trumpet into <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and desired he might be received in as a friend; but there being in the Town a Governor with some of the Forces of the League, the King was intreated to tarry till they might advertise <hi>Tilly,</hi> and twelve dayes being granted them to this purpose, the said Souldiers did (those daies being expired) forsake the Towne, and withdrew themselves into the Campe before <hi>Magdeburg</hi>: the King entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into to the great content of the people; where making no stay, he advanced forward towards <hi>Berlin,</hi> the place of the Electors residence, situated upon the side of the said <hi>Spree,</hi> where the Elector then was; thinking it fitting and becomming civility to use faire meanes first, and to captivate the Electors good will rather by agreement, than by force,
<q>He sent the Count <hi>Ortenberg</hi> to <hi>Berlin,</hi> to acquaint him with the reasons of his comming into his Territories, where he intended to demeane himselfe, as a friend and kinsman, and that his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings had only respect to the Common liberty, and the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Religion (for the which all Princes were bound to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheath their Swords) and to moderate the greatnesse of that House, which too greedy of other mens Dominions, aymed at nothing but to command over all; that his intention was to succour <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> which was in amity with him, and in all respects worthy of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; he therefore invited his Highnesse to do the like, and to lend him assistance, the Electors being no lesse obliged to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Common liberty, then were the other Protestants; that therefore he desired <hi>Kusterin</hi> and <hi>Spandaw</hi> for his owne security, and Victualls and Amunition for his Army during the enterprize.</q>
But <hi>Ortenbergs</hi> negotiation doing no good, nor yet the like of <hi>Gusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus Horne,</hi> who was sent after the other by the King to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he resolved to march forward with his Army; for that love joyned with feare, might peradventure make him incline to that which was ballanced with another greater doubt.</p>
            <p>The Elector bearing of the Kings being come, and knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be so inferiour in strength and other succours, as that he could not shun this visit, making use of this just occasion to excuse himselfe unto the Emperour, for that he was necessitated by Armes, and the selfe interest of his owne State, and out of no other reason, to make friendship with the King, he together with the greatest part of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility came forth of <hi>Berlin</hi> to meet the King: with whom after he had discoursed two houres, and was satisfied with his negotiation, hee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55221:19"/>
offered to assist him in all he could, declared himselfe to be one of his confederates; And having sumptuously received him into <hi>Berlin,</hi> he assigned over unto him <hi>Spandaw</hi> and <hi>Kusterin</hi>; but the King thought he should not be able to succour <hi>Brandenburg</hi> with his owne Forces only, which were much lessened by the Garrisons he was forced to leave in such places as he had taken, besides the Troopes of Souldiers which he had sent with <hi>Baudis</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> to waite upon <hi>Shamburg</hi> and <hi>Tieffenbach,</hi> whose numbers every day encreasing in the Dutchy of <hi>Crossen</hi> and <hi>Sletia,</hi> it seemed they aymed at some great businesse. All things fitting therefore agreed upon between him and the Elector, he went from <hi>Berlin,</hi> and comming to <hi>Potstin</hi> a place betweene <hi>Berlin</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> upon the bankes of <hi>Havell,</hi> he invited the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> to joyne with him in the relieving of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> or at least, that he would give passage for his Army to do it. But the Elector who was afraid to offend <hi>Tilly,</hi> and to draw the War into his owne Country, with great complements, but uncorrespondent effects, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
<q>That he had taken an Oath unto the Emperour, that he had not yet had any occasion to violate it; nor to adhere to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, which might prove prejudiciall to <hi>Caesars</hi> Crowne;</q>
all these excuses seemed to little purpose, and invalid to the King: who thought that the <hi>Austrians</hi> bare attempting upon the liberty of a <hi>Hauns</hi> Towne, to the which they had no pretence, had been reason enough to make the Duke resolve to assist him, without scruple of breach of his promise or Oath, since nothing was demanded of the Emperour, but that which he unduly usurped, he signified unto him that he would hereafter repent of this, and that all in good time he would put him in mind of it: yet neither these, nor any other reasons were able to prevaile with the Elector; for he being howsoever sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to eminent danger, the Armies of both Parties lying round about him, he very cunningly held off to see how affaires went, thinking himselfe as a great Prince, to be alwaies in condition to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe time enough for that side, by which his Territories might be the more secured.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tilly</hi> much troubled at the Kings so prosperous successe, especially that he should make himselfe Master of their best strengths in sight (as a man may say) of his Army, revolved many things in his mind, how he might regaine his oppressed reputation, and get some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by this warre; On the one side, the losse of those Cities which were recommended to the care of his Valour did much torment him, and therefore willingly would hee have marched to the regaining of them: on the other side, he solaced himselfe againe in the consequence of the businesse of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> on the perfecting of which Siege his minde was still bent; the which if he should give over, it was most apparent, that he should not onely grow lesse in mens opinion, but the Protestants gathering daily better heart, much trouble would thereby redound unto him; moreover the <hi>Swedes</hi> having this place of refuge, struck awe into all the Provinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had passage to turne themselves whither they list, which would cause a generall feare throughout all the neighbouring parts:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55221:19"/>
But that which was of greatest concernment, was; that if the King might have that City for a shelter to himself and his Army, he would not onely over-run all the parts thereabouts, but might lead his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which was full of Protestants ill-affected to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists, and undoubtedly bring the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Hauns</hi> Townes to declare themselves; on whose friendship the Imperialists did very much build. Setting therefore aside all the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he received by the daily newes of the <hi>Swedes</hi> proceedings, hee applyed himselfe wholly to the winning of <hi>Magdeburg</hi>; the which it is thought he the rather did, for that hee held secret Intelligence within the Towne. The Roman Catholiques were thus quartered at the siege of <hi>Magdeburg; Tilly</hi> kept his Quarters about the Sconce <hi>Zoll</hi>; Count <hi>Popenhaine</hi> environed the wayes that led from <hi>Newstat</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Holestaine</hi> enlarged his Quarters almost to <hi>Croken</hi>; and Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> bound in the Precincts of the Campe with his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the side of <hi>Heckdeck</hi> and the Fort Marsh. They had already made their approaches on these foure sides, even to the edge of the Counterscarfe; but their entrance thereupon was hindred by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall playing of the Cannon and Musquets from the Towne: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Tilly</hi> perceiving it would be a businesse of difficulty, and that all delay redounded much to the prejudice of his intentions, betook himselfe to stratagem; and using the correspondency which hee held within the Towne that were well-affected to the Imperiall party, he withdrew his Artillery from the Batteries against the Bulwarks of <hi>Lauburg,</hi> to the end that by this cessation, the besieged might bee enamoured of the Kings happy proceedings, and might thinke that the Enemies Army being thereby called back, was now providing to dislodge. This their seeming removall was well handled by them, and better confirmed by those they held correspondency withall within the Towne; for they making as if they knew that <hi>Tilly</hi> was providing to be gone, did with extraordinary joy divulge their opinions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, conformable to humane nature, which is well pleased when events prove answerable to their desires, even drunke with this hope, and blinded with this conceipt, they studied more how to expresse their joy with invitations and feastings then with diligence, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient guards to watch over their owne safetie. <hi>Tilly</hi> being punctually advertised of all these things, thought it not good to let slip this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, but to effect what he had determined, with all his art and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; he to this purpose,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>May</hi> 19.</note> on the 19 of <hi>May,</hi> called <hi>Popenhaine,</hi> and all the Generalls and Captaines of the Army to a Councell of Warre, where having discoursed upon this designe, they all joyned in a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to set upon the Walls of the Citie on all sides by a generall and valiant Scalado: For being advertised by their Spies, that Guards were not kept, and that through the confidence the Citizens had in their Workes, they little minded their keeping of Sentinels, they hoped without doubt to reape some good hereby.

For after a long and obstinate resistance they wonne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a street, and followed by the other Souldiers who were the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for that they had been beaten back; they without any mercy slew the Defendants and Citizens, and the Citie was in short time sacked and burnt to ashes: which hapned by the carelesenesse of a Souldier, who throwing aside his Musket with the Match lighted, to get up the stairs in a Drugsters house, the Match set fire on a barrel of Brimstone, and this taking hold of other cumbustable matters, the fire did so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it selfe, as the houses being built of wood all was destroyed. The cruelties used by the Souldiers in the sacking of this Citie, was such as is fearefull to say or write; Let it suffice, that good men were of opinion, that God was then so incensed against the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, as that he permitted that fire, to the end, that they might not enjoy the wealth, which with more sobrietie and humanitie they might have possessed themselves of.</p>

The <hi>Swedes</hi> and their King were in particular very much grieved hereat: the King himselfe was more vext then any other at the losse of this City, that since it did so freely declare it selfe for him, he should suffer it to be

lost in the sight even as it were of his so victorious an Army, he struck his foot against the ground, and vowed to revenge, and to serve them the same sauce, who had used themselves so inhumanly; he more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly resented the behaviour of the Souldiers of the League, who had been more barbarous in their usage then the rest: And least the other Cities which were ready to side with him might by this successe be deluded, &amp; so stagger in their resolutions, as doubting his assistance; he published in Print the reasons &amp; causes of this losse, and why he had not formerly succoured it;
<q>That the fault lay in the Citizens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who not valuing his Counsell, and not seeking to obviate the treachery of their Magistrates, had of themselves pulled this ruine upon them; that he had played the part of a good friend by the taking of many almost impregnable places; that the Electors of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Saxony</hi> had denyed him passage; that he neither could, neither ought he to march foure Leagues in an Enemies Country, with so many Cities at his backe, and on all sides of him, by which his Army might without fighting been utterly lost; that the best he could do, was to take in <hi>Franckfort, Landsperg,</hi> and other places which made for his advancing, and that he had spared no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor pretermitted any diligence to relieve it.</q>

               <hi>Tilly</hi> beleeving by this retreat, that the King was afraid, and that he rather intended to looke homewards then to advance further, brought his Army before <hi>Tangermund,</hi> forced it to surrender, and won diverse other places of no great consideration; and judging it not then fitting time to lye before strong holds, which would require much time, and great expence both of men and money, when the Protestants grew stronger in all parts; He advised with his Commanders, and it was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55221:21"/>
generally agreed upon, that they would wage War with the <hi>Landsgrave</hi>
of <hi>Hessen,</hi> as with one who having declared himselfe for the King, was busie in raising of Forces to the no little pressure of the <hi>Austrians:</hi> for this Gentleman being a young couragious Prince, given to love War, Master of a State in the midst of those Provinces which kept their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance to the Emperour, if his Forces should encrease, they ought the more to have an eye upon him, for that he held good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> which republique was much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in power and reputation of Warre, so as that he would not only prove a great diversion to their proceedings, but would have still kept the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholiques in those parts in worke; for the greatest part of the Townes which confined upon him, appertaining to the Electors of <hi>Cullen, Mentz,</hi> and to the Bishops and Princes of <hi>Munster, Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Landsgrave</hi> being therefore out of his owne Dominions, as gone in person to the Campe before <hi>Gripswould</hi> to conferre and treate with the King.
<q>
                  <hi>Tilly</hi> thought he might do well, by a complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Letter to put the <hi>Landsgraves</hi> Subjects in mind of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters errour, who puft up with too much youthfull hear, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone his alleageance to the Emperour, and joyned himselfe with a stranger Prince, whose only drift was to bring ruine upon those miserable and innocent people; So as they foolishly embracing these unsubsistancies, went astray from the good way, putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon narrow and dangerous paths, and that therefore they ought no more to receive him backe, for that he would send them sufficient ayde to confirme their quiet, and establish their liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q>
But these words working little effect with those people, who very well knew they could not withdraw themselves from the subjection of their lawfull Lord and Master, without submitting themselves to the Government of another, they did but laugh at <hi>Tillyes</hi> promises and threats, and prepared themselves for defence.</p>
            <p>The King this meane while, comming himselfe in Person into the Campe at <hi>Gripswould,</hi> he rejoyced the hearts of all the Army, as doth a timely shower the scorched up ground; and by this time the besieged finding themselves weakened, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> with their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries and Traverses advancing even into the Ditch, and seeing the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55221:22"/>
generall assault, which in the presence of their King they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to give them, they yeilded the Towne upon condition, that the Garrison might march forth with their Armes, Baggage, and two Peeces of Cannon; after which, being advertised how the Dukes of <hi>Mechelburg</hi> (who after the losse of their State, usurped from them by the Emperour, had retired themselves to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> a <hi>Hauns</hi> Towne, and one of the chiefe Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> upon the <hi>Trave</hi>) had (answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the agreement) raised a pretty Force of Horse and Foot, he thought the occasion fitting to re-place those Princes in their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: Whereupon leading his Army on to this purpose, he tooke diverse places and Townes which were yet held by the Imperialists, opening the way for the said Princes to returne into their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and totally driving all the Imperiall Forces out of such Cities and Townes as belonged to them, which it was easie for the King to do, for the greatest part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques having withdrawn themselves from that Province, knowing how hard it would be for them to maintaine those Townes, had betooke themselves to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Rostock</hi> and <hi>Weismar,</hi> which being moreover very well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, their Patrimonies would be by their meanes easily preserved, and be afterwards much helped to drive the <hi>Swedes</hi> away from the places they had taken, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques Army should by them have received any advantage; all the other Townes being then come in unto the King, and he knowing that these two Cities, whilst they kept themselves for the Emperour, did make all undertakings upon that State invalide, for that all the rest of the Provinces being an open champion, and not furnished with places of safe refuge, they should upon any approach of the Imperialists, be enforced to forgoe their Quarters in those weake Townes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Austrians</hi> by means of these two places whereunto they might retreate, might easily keep the Dominion and possession of them, and so not be totally dispossest; He resolved to fortifie <hi>Anclam,</hi> a place strongly seated upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Pene,</hi> in the Navell of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> not far from the Lake of <hi>Grosse Haff,</hi> by the which securing unto himselfe the Neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, this place was of no small moment.</p>
            <p>Having taken such order as he thought convenient for the taking of these, before which he left <hi>Banniere</hi> with about Sixe Thousand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he re-placed the Dukes his Nephewes in their Dominions, and making the Inhabitants sweare fealty to them, he thought it not good to tarry longer in those parts, but to returne to <hi>Pomerania</hi>; and by the advancement of his Forces to get <hi>Saxony</hi> to declare himselfe, and to endeavour new acquisitions, the which he did, not only by reason of <hi>Tillies</hi> absence, promise unto himselfe, but that by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, he should occasion such diversion, as he should force <hi>Tilly</hi> to forsake his designe upon the <hi>Landsgrave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Raising thus his Campe from before <hi>Gustrow,</hi> a Towne seated in the Center of that Province, defended by no very exact ancient Wals, and watered by <hi>Nuball,</hi> upon which great Barkes do sayle even to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock,</hi>
he made hast to <hi>Berlin</hi>; and from thence sending his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Borth,</hi> he planted his Campe before <hi>Brandenburg</hi>: and having
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55221:22"/>
sent Collonell <hi>Ranzaw,</hi> a man of an undaunted courage, and perfect valour, with some of his Forces on the other side of the <hi>Elb</hi>; he with a Petard surprized <hi>Tangermund,</hi> by which his way was open into the lower <hi>Saxony,</hi> and to the Bishopricke of <hi>Magdeburg</hi>: He with great Force set upon <hi>Werben</hi> upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> seated in no contemptible place, fortified after the ancient manner, and defended by about One Thousand Two Hundred men, part Souldiers, part men of the Country; he forced it to yeeld, where leaving some Souldiers for a guard, giving order for necessary Fortifications for the defence of it, and throwing a Bridge of Boates over the River, he Quartered himselfe betweene that and <hi>Havell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he gave in charge to <hi>Bannier</hi> to go before <hi>Havelbergk,</hi> of the said Province, seated upon the River <hi>Havell,</hi> and not far from <hi>Elb</hi>; who presently placing his Batteries against it, and having made his approaches even to the wals, which being weake and unperfectly built, did not long hold out, after nine dayes the Inhabitants, knowing they could no longer withstand the <hi>Swedes</hi> assaults, yeelded themselves, 800 Souldiers marching out of the Towne, part of which tooke enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment from the King.</p>
            <p>By these prosperous successes of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and by the newes that the Queene of <hi>Sweden</hi> was already landed at <hi>Wolgast</hi> with 6000 fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men; and by reason of divers other preparations made by the King in divers places, the minds of the <hi>Romanists</hi> were extremely disquieted, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> encouraged: whereupon, the King very desirous to recover <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> that he might draw nearer to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> whose declaring of himselfe, he knew to be of all things else most necessary for him, as likewise to divert <hi>Tilly</hi> from invading the <hi>Landsgraves</hi> Countrey, who presently wheeled about, and came to <hi>Wolmerstat,</hi> a Towne above <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> where he stayed and quartered his Army, dispersing his Horse about the Neighbouring Villages, that he might observe what course the King would take.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Swedes</hi> advertised of these Designes, and having moreover certaine Intelligence, how that two of the Imperialists Regiments of Horse, (who had quartered themselves in the Village <hi>Kolbits,</hi> foure leagues distant from <hi>Tangermund</hi>) did much neglect their Guards, he thought he might defeat them; rising therefore privately to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose from a Towne upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> between <hi>Werben</hi> and <hi>Tangermund,</hi> on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi>

himselfe to his heeles, with the losse of three Cornets, and about three hundred Horse. In this surprisall the Count <hi>Otto Lodovico Ryngrave,</hi> did together with his souldiers gallantly behave himselfe: this Gentleman was of much esteeme amongst the Dutch, and of the best bloud of <hi>Germany,</hi> and in former times his Auncestors had great possessions about the River of <hi>Rhyne</hi>; but through the evilnesse of times having lost all, and remembring the former greatnesse of his Family, he (together with his Brother Count <hi>Philip</hi>) put himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kings service, and being under so fortunate a guide, they fed themselves with undoubted hopes of vast designes.</p>
            <p>The King encouraged by these favourable accidents, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them as preludiums to greater glory, marched forward with the remainder of his Army, and with his Cannon, and incamping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe between the Villages of <hi>Belgen</hi> and <hi>Steindall,</hi> between the <hi>Elb,</hi> and the <hi>Bise,</hi> he resolved to stay a while in that advantagious situation, to observe what <hi>Tillies</hi> intentions were; who awakened by such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements, and thinking that he suffered not a little in his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces which he so undervalued, had such happy successe, he rose from <hi>Wolmerstat,</hi> and having regained <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germund,</hi> he was got too before the Trenches of <hi>Werben,</hi> where some of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Regiments were incamped, who by reason of <hi>Tillies</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving were by the King in diligence sent thither; for the maintenance of that place was of great moment, so as, aswell in respect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of those Forces which did defend it, as for that the City being won by the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, the King was to retreat many leagues backward, and his entrance into the Townes upon the <hi>Ohre</hi> would be hereby hindered (<hi>Ohre</hi> is a River which taketh its beginning from the Confines of the State of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> towards the County of <hi>Danneberg</hi>

            <p>The King this meane while well informed from all parts of these proceedings of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> saw he was not in condition to hazard himselfe in further advancements, for that new Forces being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually added to the former, and he finding himselfe sufficiently weakened by the continuall actions of his owne men, it was very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to joyne Battell with that Army, which being led on by an old Commander, knew not what it was to lose: He therefore resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to tarry upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> and <hi>Havell,</hi> and to hinder the Imperialists from advancing upon the parts thereabouts, held by the <hi>Swedish</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He foresaw that <hi>Tilly</hi> not permitting the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> to continue a Neuter, would force him first by his importunities, and then by his Armes to declare himselfe, from which he could not but expect great advantage: For the Elector ill satisfied with the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strians,</hi> and seeing the Kings assistance neare at hand, 'twas likely that upon any slight occasion he would lay hold upon any pretence, and discover which way he was inclined. He then quartered himselfe near <hi>Werben,</hi> which he had againe wonne by surprisall. He left <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> with some Forces of Horse and Foot about <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the custody of <hi>Retinaw</hi> (a place thogh of no great account, yet at this time (upon this occasion) very considerable, as being seated
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55221:24"/>
upon the <hi>Havell,</hi> betweene the Cities of <hi>Havelburg</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi>) to Colonell <hi>Tod,</hi> a Souldier of great experience, a native of <hi>Germany,</hi> and of good bloud; thinking by keeping himselfe in these strong holds, and thereby hindering the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks from dreaming of passing the River, and going to recover such Townes as had beene taken in those parts, and upon the <hi>Oder,</hi> he should keep the Enemy in perpetuall exercise with evident danger, and make him (who was not able to subsist in those parts impoverished by the daily incursions of both parties) rise from thence, and retreat to his great losse of Honour, and to the prejudice of those parts which yet kept their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance to <hi>Caesar</hi>; he was hereunto also perswaded out of another reason, that the Imperialists could not keep themselves any long time in those Quarters, without giving jealousie to <hi>Saxony,</hi> whose estate for any good order that could be taken by the Militia, could not so sufficiently defend it selfe, but that it must receive injuries by the insolencies of the Souldier, and such parties as were wont to scoure the Champion, which if it should so fall out, it would redound much to the Kings advantage; for that this Elector, little apaid with the Actions of the Imperialists, and exceedingly troubled at the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made a little before by the Emperour, That he intended that all such goods should be restored to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicke Churches, which had formerly beene by the Protestants usurped; a businesse wherein this Prince was not a little concerned, whose Incomes were more compounded of Ecclesiasticall Revenues, then other rents; hee would doubtlesse make use of this occasion, which palliated with a strong pretence, might make him declare himselfe partiall for the King, who was able with no lesse an Army then <hi>Count Tilly</hi> to assist and defend him.</p>
            <p>The Roman Catholicke Army being now re-inforced by the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of <hi>Fistenburg,</hi> and by the comming of <hi>Tiffenbacke</hi> Marshall of the field, who was called backe out of <hi>Lusatia,</hi> with such forces as hee could get out of the Garrisons of that Province, and out of <hi>Sletia</hi>; as also by the advertisements that <hi>Count Aldrenger</hi> was come from <hi>Mantua,</hi> and returning into <hi>Germany,</hi> was within forty leagues, with about 8000. Souldiers; <hi>Tilly</hi> thought that he should meet with no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position which could contest with him, nor keep him from those advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings which his men had at other times made against greater Armies. Raising his Campe from about <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> he came to <hi>Hall,</hi> a City upon the River <hi>Sall,</hi> (which comming from forth those Mountaines, which towards the South upon the confines of <hi>Voitland,</hi> run between <hi>Franconia</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and gathering many other Rivers into it, fals into the <hi>Elb,</hi> not farre from <hi>Rosenberg</hi>;) where he haulted, and muste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Army, which he found to be above 34000. fighting men, he thought himselfe fit for any enterprize; He therefore called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of war, wherein it was the generall opinion of all his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that <hi>Saxony</hi> should be demanded openly to declare himselfe; for this term of Newtrality brings alwaies with it jealousies to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and so much the more at this time, for that the Elector for his owne defence had gathered together a body of about 14000. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55221:24"/>
which would be a great addition to that side he should adhere unto; and in respect that <hi>Tilly</hi> had now invironed his whole Country with his forces, he thought the very feare of the Roman Catholicke Army, would make him put on a favourable resolution, whereby he might easily be brought afterwards to imploy his forces in suppressing of the King. He therefore sent the Baron <hi>Shamburg,</hi> (an Almain by birth; one who very well understood Martiall affaires, as also civill Negotiation, and who was of a Noble family,) to the Elector, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of him that he would joyne his forces with theirs to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the <hi>Swedes,</hi> that he would give quarter for his Army upon his Territories, and contribution in money, whereof the Souldiers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a long time kept short, they began to grumble, and to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, against their Commanders: He willed <hi>Shamburg</hi> (since now the sword was in their hand,) that he should speake the more boldly, and with the lesse respect. <hi>Shamburgs</hi> expressions were lofty, and rather imperious then civill:
<q>He told him, that since he the Elector was a Subject to the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he did proclame <hi>Caesars</hi> indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against him, if he did any wayes forgoe the friendship and duty which he owed to Caesar.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Elector was much troubled at this Embassy, and being much amazed, he called together his Councell of State, before he would give his answer; where the <hi>Austrian</hi> proceedings being narrowly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined; and the Elector being found to suffer much in his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by such like pretences, he being a free Prince, and Lord over his owne; and finding that this was a very fit occasion to draw from him a manifestation of those injuries which he pretended to have received, and an opportune time to free himselfe of those jealousies, which the greatnesse of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> had caused in him; he using but few words, told <hi>Shamburg,</hi>
               <q>that he had alwayes been a good Servant to his imperiall Majesty, and had alwayes shewed his affection to his dignity; and that he did not know any occasion he had given <hi>Caesar</hi> to complaine; that he would alwayes continue the same; but that to declare himselfe in this present immergency, now that a puissant and numerous Army was incampt so neere his State, would be a means to draw the warre upon himselfe which he ought not to doe; that therefore he would still keepe himselfe a Newter, and that he would not be faulty to his Caesarian Majesty in any duty which he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to owe him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shamburg</hi> returned to <hi>Tilly,</hi> who exceedingly longed to heare what answer he would bring backe; and when he had heard it, was no wayes pleased with it; but thought he had the meanes in his owne hands, to bring the Elector to doe what he desired by force, if his proffers, words and protestations would not prevaile: He therefore resolved to rise from <hi>Hall,</hi> and to set upon such townes of the Dukes, as were in the circuit of the <hi>Sall</hi>; having to this purpose sent all his Horse into the <hi>Saxon</hi> Territories, He with his foot incamped himself before <hi>Naumberg,</hi> a place watered by the <hi>Sall,</hi> not farre from <hi>Lipsick</hi>; he raised two Batteries against it, and the place being but meanly man'd and fortified, he in two dayes took it; from thence pursuing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55221:25"/>
his victory, he possest himselfe of <hi>Weisnfeld, Neremburg,</hi> and all the neighbouring Castles; and being come neer the gates of <hi>Leypzicke,</hi> he in friendly manner demanded refreshment, and contribution monyes of the Citizens, and that they would suffer his Souldiers to quarter within their wals.</p>
            <p>This news being come to the Elector, did much puzzell him and his Councell; he knew no other remedy, but either to give way to the Imperialists forces, since his owne Army was not sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend so large a Territory, and which wanted necessary strong holds; or else to put himselfe into the <hi>Swedes</hi> protection; much discourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had hereupon, it was thought at last,
<q>that it would be better for the Electour, and more for his reputation, to defend himselfe against his Enemies, then basely, (as if he were overcome) to yield unto their desires: yet some that were present at the Consultation, wisely ballancing the affaires, were of opinion that he should rather yield to <hi>Tillyes</hi> desires, then draw upon him <hi>Caesars</hi> ill will; alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little good the <hi>Palatine, Denmarke,</hi> and others had of late got by doing the contrary: That the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was a stranger Prince, who had but few helpes, lesse a great deale then those who had formerly undertaken the same; that he wanted the Sinnews of money, and that he chiefly relyed upon hopes from others; that one onely blow would make him make hast backe to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and leave those unwary ones to the pleasure of <hi>Caesars</hi> Sword, who had unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily beene by him perswaded, and had followed his fortune: That <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Forces were big with reputation, and by their so many Victories and Conquests, had established unto themselves a large foundation; that the tree could not be pluckt up, which being fast rooted by many adherents, and so great Subsistency, greater forces then its owne, not lesser were requisite to move it: That wise Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought alwaies to reflect upon the events, which were not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any youthfull examination: That warre was alwayes to be shund, when the entertaining of it could not be but prejudiciall; that by the sole forces of the Electorat sufficient resistance could not be made, that therefore they must demand helpe from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to whom they must grant that which they now deny unto the Emperour; that it had been wont to be held dangerous to call in Auxiliary forces, since what is by them defended from the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of others, is by them pretended unto, as if they had wonne it; and therefore 'tis seldome seen, that they forsake such places as are given to them for Caution. Others said, that the Emperour was got to too great a height; that such greatnesse ought not to be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, much lesse fomented by wise Princes: That the Austri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were known to be declared Enemies to their Sect, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to that Dukedome, whereunto under a pious pretence of introducing the Romish faith, they would bring their armies, and therewithall use such Charity as they had done elsewhere: That the greater the Roman Catholicks grew, the Protestants went so much the lesse; that the comming of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be miraculous, and to be a divine punishment to those, who
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55221:25"/>
in their victories abusing fortunes-favour, cloath'd themselves with too much ambition; that nothing else was to be beleived; for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune cannot chuse but smile on the bold adventures of a warlike King; that such Commanders were great helpes to their Armies, that past examples had shewed them, how prejudiciall a thing it is, to let go the occasion of keeping those low whom we feare, as was proved in the insurrection of <hi>Bohemia</hi>: for if the <hi>Palatine</hi> keeping himselfe in his regall throne, had given bounds to the Austrian power, the name of Elector would have been more reverenced; that it hath been held a maxime, that we should not be unmindefull to assist the weaker, to the end that the ballance being kept even, the greater weight may not fall upon ones owne weaknesse; that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the <hi>Austrians</hi> were not now unknowne; that now was the time to moderate their designes, and to shake off that yoake, which if they should resume, they would not so easily finde a hand to ease them of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harnem</hi> the Dukes Generall was therefore dispatch'd away to the King, who keeping fast in his station, did longingly expect what would be the end of <hi>Tillyes</hi> designe upon the State of <hi>Saxony. Harnem</hi> was received by the King with great demonstrations of love, as hee alwayes used to receive those that came unto him; for he much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted to captivate mens good wils, by kindnesse and affability, being wont to say that the love of Souldiers, and other men was thereby more won, then by severe gravity.
<q>
                  <hi>Harnem</hi> having made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him what the <hi>Austrians</hi> proceedings had been against the Duke his Master, and what their vast designes were, intreated him in his Masters name, that his Majesty would send him assistance, and come to the succour of <hi>Leypzik,</hi> the losse whereof would not onely prove prejudiciall to his dominion, but to the whole interest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants:</q>
but the King willing to let the Electour see, how ill he had beene advised, whilst being able to releive <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> by the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation whereof his estate would have likewise been secure; and whilst he was intreated by him the King, to afford him passage, and to joyne with him, he had denyed to do so, and had sent backe the messenger, with resolutions no wayes profitable, did coolly answer <hi>Harnem</hi>:
<q>That his Master had himselfe drawne the warre upon him, by having slighted his Counsell, or rather for having refused, what was by him propounded: That his highnesse had some Counsellors about him that were Spaniolised; that he needed not poynt out unto him, whither the <hi>Austrian</hi> Monarchy tended, for it was apparently seen by former examples, that having supprest the liberty of the Hauns townes, and the Princes of the Empire, he aimed meerly at the Command over all Europe; that he knew not how to helpe him, for that his designe was to lead his forces elsewhere; and that he was very much troubled at this accident which had befallen the Duke. <hi>Harnem</hi> answered with words drawne from the inmost of his heart, and which were accompanied with some teares that fell from his eyes; that his Majesty as a wise and curteous Prince, as a gracious propagator of the faith, and as the defender of <hi>German</hi> liberty, ought
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55221:26"/>
to forget any thing the Elector had done amisse, which had beene occasioned through feare, and bad Counsell; not out of any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had of his Majesties friendship, to the which he should forever acknowledge himselfe oblieged: That Princes are oft times blinded by their interest of state, and oft times so hoodwinckt, as that they could not refuse the counsels of their Ministers; that the wellfare of the publique ought to be preferred before what ever private respect; that a Prince ought to forget such things wherein they have not received satisfaction, when the doing so redounds to their advantage; that reason of state is alwayes furnish't with so choice a disguise, as in an instant it can turne the most threatning browes of an enemy, into the pleasing countenance of a friend, and as soone change the cleer aspect of a favourite into a troubled face.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King who did indeed desire nothing more then this, though he seemed to feigne the contrary, not objecting any thing to these his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, answered, That he would be contented to come aid the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, upon condition, that for his better caution and security, hee might have the Fort of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> delivered up into his hands, which is a very strong hold, seated upon the <hi>Elb</hi> in a most pleasant Country, begirt with Parrapits and bastions of the latest edition, well peopled, and a place of great Importance, standing between <hi>Lusatia</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of <hi>Hall,</hi> as if it were the Center of those two Provinces: the key which opens and shuts the way into <hi>Saxony.</hi> That he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive money for two payments of his Army; and that his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies eldest sonne might be sent to him, and kept by him as an hostage of his fidelity. <hi>Harnem</hi> by speedy post acquainted his Master with these answers, whose state was now in great confusion and feare, and who returned as speedy answer to the King; That not onely <hi>Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> but his whole state was at his Command; that the money for the Army should forthwith be disbursed; and that he himselfe together with his sonne, would hasten to come and serve him. These Articles being signed by the King and by <hi>Harnem,</hi> in behalfe of the Elector; they agreed upon a time of meeting likewise with the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and other confederate Princes. The Duke having brought his men to <hi>Torgaw</hi> between <hi>Wittenberg</hi> and <hi>Dresda</hi> upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> and mustering them there he found them to be 16000. fighting men, (allowing thereunto some of the Country Troops) with 28 peeces of Cannon, and a very well furnished baggadge, hee marched towards <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> where the King appointed to meet him by the first of <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tilly</hi> this meane time had invested the wals of <hi>Leypzik</hi> on divers sides, striking feare into the Citizens thereof, who were men not verst in warre, but for the most part brought up in merchandising; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they saw they could not resist the strong batteries which beat downe their towers on all sides, and did presage unto them the unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky example of <hi>Magdeburg.</hi> They therefore sent forth deputies to speake with <hi>Tilly,</hi> who concluded that the City should be surrendred, on Condition that they might enjoy their liberty of Conscience,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55221:26"/>
that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Garrison should march out with their weapons and baggadge; and that the City should bee burthened with nothing else but the payment of 200000 Dollers, in prosecution whereof on the sixth of <hi>September.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Septemb.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Tilly</hi> made his entrance into the Town, with the great applause of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Army. <hi>Leypzik</hi> is seated in a large Champion between the <hi>Elb</hi> and the <hi>Sall,</hi> watered by the River <hi>Elster,</hi> and the River <hi>Pleis,</hi> which falling into <hi>Elster</hi> under the very walls of the Towne loses its name. This place being seated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the utmost parts of upper <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Misnia,</hi> and almost in the very heart of <hi>Germany</hi> is a place of much Traffique, aswell in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the great concourse of people as of the rich merchandise, by reason of the many Faires that are there kept; but her fortifications are imperfect, and after the ancient manner.</p>
            <p>This meane while the Kings Army and the Electors being joyned, and the King seeing himselfe now growne to sufficient strength to give him battell in the field, upon which the Totall of this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did consist, he raised his Tents from about <hi>Wittenberg</hi> on the fourth of <hi>September,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Septemb.</hi> 4.</note> past over the <hi>Elb,</hi> and with speedy march tooke his way towards <hi>Leypzik,</hi> that he might relieve the City; but hearing by the way, that the Letters written by the Elector to the chiefe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate of the Towne, wherein he acquainted him of his being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the King, and of the speedy reliefe they were bringing, exhorting him in the meane while stoutly to defend the Towne, were intercepted by the Imperialists, and that now the City was in the power of the Romanists, he stayed in the Fields about <hi>Bitterfelt</hi> and <hi>Dieben,</hi> Towns between the <hi>Elb</hi> and the River <hi>Tena</hi>; aswell to expect fresh Troops of Souldiers, as to informe himselfe better of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies condition, that he might betake himselfe to the best resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tilly</hi> on the other side, advertised of the <hi>Swedes</hi> being joyned with <hi>Saxony,</hi> was much incensed against the Elector, and desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himselfe for the injury received, encouraged by the confidence he had in his Souldiers valour, who were acquainted with nothing but victory, though he might better have effected his designes by waiting for <hi>Aldringer,</hi> who was not farre off, yet not able to appease himselfe, he marched out of <hi>Leypzik,</hi> drew his Army into the Fields, put it into Battell-array, placed his Artillery in the most advantagious pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, fortified passages, and made the King see he would nor refuse to fight with him, no nor with <hi>Saxony,</hi> though both joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The King likewise seeing himselfe in the head of an Army ready to fight, and that at last a Battell must be had, he losing no time, least <hi>Tilly</hi> might be by <hi>Aldringer</hi> re-inforced, couragiously advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy; he mustered both his owne men, and those of the Elector,<note place="margin">

fortune, who had stil bin victors in so many Battels: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, making it publickly knowne that he intended nothing to himself of what should be gotten, but to part it all amongst his fellow souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: he heartened his men with sure hope of good successe, and with a grave and slow march, tooke his way towards the <hi>Austrian</hi> Quarters.</p>
            <p>The Vantgard towards the East, between the Villages of <hi>Dieben</hi> and <hi>Lindaw,</hi> consisted of 14000 <hi>Saxon</hi> Souldiers, rancked into eight Squadrons, foure of Foot, and foure of Horse, and was commanded by the Duke himselfe, who in his owne person lead them on, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by above a hundred of the prime Gentlemen of his State, all Volontiers: He had upon him a breastplate lined with gold, a blacke Scarfe all imbroidered with silver, and was upon a Sorrell Horse all dapled. Behind the Elector on the left wing, Lieutenant Generall <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> marched, who leading on 2000 Horse well mounted, their Riders all armed in black burnisht Armes, under the Command of the 2 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, <hi>Brintauff</hi> &amp; <hi>Corville,</hi> &amp; himself mounted on an yron-gray Steed, appeared in a threatning posture to the lookers on; the Foot flankt in the midst between the Elector and <hi>Harnem,</hi> were lead on by the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, <hi>Offchirchem, Damniger, Marshall, Helmendort,</hi> and <hi>Spinghell</hi>; over whom as Generall of the Foot, was the Duke of <hi>Iltemberg,</hi> the Electors Cousin clad in perfumed Turkish leather, with a great black feather in his head; amidst those Foot were 16 peeces of great Cannon drawne by good Horses, and 26 Sachers; and after them followed all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Swedish</hi> Army, which were so disposed of by the Kings directions: On the right side towards the Village <hi>Delicts</hi> did the <hi>Swedish</hi> Squadrons march, on the right hand whereof stood the King in a mingled coloured Cloth suite, with a Jupe of perfumed leather, with a gray Hat on his head, and a little green Feather moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a Dun Horse; behind him followed 2000 Dutch Horse, and 2000 <hi>Finlanders</hi> armed with Curases, Pistols, and broad Swords: Amidst these Squadrons which divided into foure Bodies, left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them a vacuitie of about a hundred Foot broad, were two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred choice Musketeers placed ready to salute the Enemies Horse, before they came to Pistoll-shot, the Battaglions of Foot which were in the Van-guard, were led on by <hi>Banniers</hi> Marshall of the Field, a <hi>Swede</hi> by birth, before the which he marched in a sute of Turkish leather, with arming points of gold, and a skie-coloured Scarfe upon a Flea-bitten pacing Horse, with a Truncheon tipped with yron in his hand. These Regiments were divided into six Battaglions, each of them consisting of 1500 Foot, betwixt each of which in the Front five peeces of Cannon was drawne, very light and of a moderne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, loaded with bags of Musket-bullets: These Companies were under 72 Ensignes of various and lovely Colours, upon the which was set the Kings Armes, and upon that a great Crowne, the Motto was, <hi>Gustavus Adolphus Rex Fidei Evangelica defensor,</hi> the greatest part of the souldiers were clad in blew and yellow Jackets; upon the left wing did Marshall <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> march, who had the Command of foure thousand Horse armed with Curasses, divided into foure Squadrons, under fifty two Standards, part blew, part O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range

               <hi>Tilly</hi> upon the hearing thereof had sent forth certaine Squadrons of Horse to spye out, and informe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Enemies proceedings, between which and the Horse of the other side there happened a very hot skirmish: and had not the Sun which was then upon the setting parted the fray, which was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained valiantly by the one and the other parties, doubtlesse both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would then have joyned battell, as they did the next day. The King who all the night long kept himselfe in the Field, going now hither, now thither, instructing every one what order they ought to keep, encouraging his souldiers with this pleasing speech and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full voice, and calling unto him all the Commanders of the Army, he with a merry looke said unto them;
<q>That now the occasion was presented which he had so long desired, that he might make a triall of his Souldiers valour; he told them that past victories and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne already gotten, did vanish into smoake, when daring was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated with feare; that they ought not to value that Enemy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so oft beaten within his strongest holds, does now appeare in the fields lesse strong, dismaide, and quaking at the rusling of their own Armes; that feare was the Harbinger of death, for which cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise did oft provide Quarter; that courage was the sonne of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the Father of renowne, and the beautifull dispencer of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, honour, and riches; he acquainted every of them how he would be served by them in this action; he shewed the whole Army of what great consequence the winning of this Battell would be, what advantage would thereby accrue to the publique, and to each private man, since great booty was therein to be had, much acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, extraordinary honour, the increase of the common safety; he with words of efficacy moderated the estimation w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> such as were fearfull might have of the valour and renowne of the Enemy, letting them know that <hi>Tillies</hi> Forces were not great, that his souldiers were discontented, and that many things were wanting in his Army, which were requisite to a complete Battell; that they ought not to way the <hi>Austrians</hi> past fortune, for that she changes daily, and when
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55221:28"/>
shee seemest fullest of haire, becomes soone bald; that by how much more eminent the fame and valour of the Enemy was, so much more glory was to be wonne by beating them: that he had forgon the safe and pleasing quiet of a Court, and entred into the troubles of warre to no other end, but to raise againe that liberty, which suppressed by the Imperialists under the specious pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, kept those people under the yoake of Tyranny, who in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects were worthy to be eased thereof: that the valour of that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was now in question, which not imbaced by the harmfull idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of peace, had in her vigor enough to tame the fiercest nations of Europe: that finally he built his safety upon the honourable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of his men, and the experience of his Commanders, from whose swords, honour and reward was to be expected: that hee would lead them the way they were to follow; that no evill was lesse to be born withall, then what was occasioned by ones owne default.</q>

            <p>On the other side <hi>Tilly</hi> wholly composed of confidence and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in respect of his Souldiers, whose valour he had tryed in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Battailes, did infinitely desire to try himselfe with this King; for as his name and fame was great, so greater would be the glory which the victory over him in battaile would bring with it. Having summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his chiefe Commanders together, he acquainted them with his purpose;
<q>That now the time was come to reap the fruite of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy actions, and give a glorious end to their past victories; that they might afterwards in perfect quiet, enjoy the renowne, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and riches which they had wonne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he shewed them that the Kings forces were new men, and much terrified at the fame of that valour which they in so many victories had wonne: that they ought to thank God, and receive these occasions, as gifts from Heaven, that so they might conquer the persecutors of the holy Church, and by worldly conquests gaine Heaven. That the <hi>Swedes</hi> were not strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then those, who being so often made a sacrifice to their swords, had made men know, of what force the justice of the cause, and the valour of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the seconds Souldiers were; that the bodies of base and cowardly men, were followed with fearfull shadowes, not the mindes of such as were couragious: That the apprehension of dangers and feare of shot, was banish'd by experience: That doubt belonged to the unexperienced, assurance to such as were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it: that the <hi>Swedes</hi> happy successes were to be tearmed, the treasons of subjects, the fomentions of Rebels, not the valour of Souldiers, worth of Commanders, and force of armes.</q>
Here some being of opinion that such undertakings as are pursued with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are most praise-worthy: and these knowing that to fight without the addition of <hi>Aldringers</hi> men, would not be so safe, (who were all old Souldiers, and who within six dayes might joyne themselves with their Army; and by which assistance the King might be fought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55221:28"/>
upon better advantage, and with almost assured victory,) they ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vertised <hi>Tilly</hi> thereof. But he growing still more couragious, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by his owne confidence, would not listen to their perswasions, being of opinion it was not glorious to win upon such advantage.
<q>He said that the reputation of their armes, was too farre advanced; that delay was a manifest shew of feare, and an increase of courage in the Enemy: That there was nothing more prejudiciall in the art of warre-fare, then the appearing to feare the Enemy: That great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises became great Commanders, and that the more difficult they were, the more glorious were they: That to expect <hi>Aldrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> comming, would be but losse of time; for that if by such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay their Army should receive any increase, the same would befall the Kings Army, towards whom many Troopes were already on their march from <hi>Brandenburg Saxony, Mechelburg,</hi> and the other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Provinces; in all which places the Drums did continually beat, and Souldiers were taken into pay.</q>
Drawing therefore his Army forth into the fields of <hi>Leypzik</hi> under the village <hi>Tanger</hi>: hee formed his Army which consisted of 34000. Souldiers in this manner.</p>
            <p>On the right flancke, just over against the said village were placed five Regiments of <hi>Crabats,</hi> commanded by Colonell <hi>Isolan,</hi> a brave subject and much experienced in warre; they were all well horst, and armed with Harguhibuses, Pistols and Simiters: after these followed six great squadrons of Horse under 70. Standerds of severall Colours, with severall impresses; amongst the which, one was a great Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Eagle, which held in her right Tallents a Pontificiall Crowne, and in her left, the Imperiall Scepter; the word was, <hi>Pro Ecclesia, et pro Imperio</hi>; these belonged to the Regiments of the Colonels <hi>Schamburg, Cronenburg, Braungarten, Baldiron, Valmirode, Detrusteim, Ghetts, Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Holesteime,</hi> all of them subjects of great bloud, and great experienced Commanders; they were all mounted on state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Horses, armed with strong Curases, and richly adorned in their apparrell: the Vanguard of Foot consisting of 8000. old Souldiers followed next which was divided into foure great bataglions, under 48. Ensignes of diverse Colours, and with severall inscriptions.</p>
            <p>Over these <hi>Shamburg</hi> Commanded in chiefe, who was Serjeant Major Generall of the Army, a gentleman much verst in warre; in their front stood 20. field pieces, and upon the flanckes of those 16. great pieces so ordered as that they might from a farre off flanke upon the <hi>Swedish</hi> squadrons. Upon the left flanke, and upon the backe of the Vanguard of Foot 5000. Horse marched all well mounted and arm'd, which were the Regiments of <hi>Coronino, Rangoni</hi> and <hi>Gonsago,</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Italy</hi>; and of <hi>Spor, Diffart,</hi> and <hi>Arracourt, Germans</hi> of good account; and over these Count <hi>Popenheime</hi> commanded in chief, upon a brown-bay horse, and accompanied with about 20. Voluntiers, all of them gentlemen of stranger nations.</p>
            <p>After these followed the maine battaile, consisting of 10000. foot which were disposed into six battaglions, and were the severall Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadoes of the Duke of <hi>Sas,</hi> of Count <hi>Bortholed, Walestein,</hi> Duke <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Battaile was upheld on the right flanke by 2000 horse belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Regiments of <hi>Tersica, Breda, Prior, Aldobrandim, Rochim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Mancini, Bonbaglion, Fiston</hi> and others: the <hi>Sieur D' Harcourt</hi> commanded the right wing, and the <hi>Sieur de Cornemberg</hi> the left; both of them Serjeant Majors Generall of the Army: behinde these followed the Rear-guard placed upon the rise of a hill, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of 6000.

Tilly</hi> as the soule of the body, kept himselfe in the midst of the Army, accompanied by many Gentlemen of quality, stiled Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; he rod on a chesnut horse, had on him a gray sute, and was armed back and brest.</p>
            <p>The Imperialists Army being thus ordered, and placed in a very advantagious place, upon which all the great pieces of Ordnance were raised, they stood waiting to see what the King would doe; but hee having advanced the <hi>Saxon</hi> horse against the <hi>Crabats</hi> and the Curaseers, which guarded the left flanke of the Emperors Army; and the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats</hi> charging fiercely upon the <hi>Swedes,</hi> being back't by the body of the armed horse, the fight was very hot about three houres after Sunne-rising: where after the discharging of their Pistols, and their incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with their swords, the <hi>Saxon</hi> horse gave backe, being charged in the front, and on the flanke by the Imperialists Vanguard of horse, lead on by <hi>Shamburg</hi> and <hi>Cronemberg,</hi> who with their Swords in hand prest hard upon them; who falling foule upon the Electors squadrons in this confusion and hurley burley, opened the way to the Caesarian horse, to do no small execution on them.</p>
            <p>The King seeing what prejudice the <hi>Saxons</hi> received, commanded <hi>Bannier</hi> to advance with his horse of the right wing, against the left wing of <hi>Tillyes</hi> Army, which being lead on by <hi>Count Fistemberg</hi> did in close order, couragiously set forward to meet the Enemy: Hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise set forwards two great squadrons of Swedish Horse, seconded by a squadron of Foot, and lead on by <hi>Hebron,</hi> against the <hi>Crabats,</hi> who boldly advanced to discharge their Carabines, opening the horse files: and there being faced by Muskettiers, they to their great losse received a sore salute of Musket-shot, and some field pieces charged with bags of Musket-bullets, did so powre downe shot amongst them, as many of them being put out of their rankes, and many unhorst, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed much mischiefe to their squadrons.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding, not abating their courage, they amidst the bloud, which in all places flowed apace; and the smoake and fire which lightned round about them, gave on undauntedly, and with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55221:29"/>
much violence upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> horse, who being drill'd through by the uncessant shot of certaine Culverings, and likewise charged by some squadrons lead on by <hi>Tilly's</hi> selfe; who being followed by some of the bands of the most ancient, stoutest, and best experienced Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; as likewise by many Voluntiers charged through them, they were routed and began to be scattered on all sides, leaving the field to the Conquerour.</p>
            <p>The King seeing this confusion and the eminency of danger, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor not being able to stay his men from running away, neither by threates, nor yet by intreaties, hee advanced some Squadrons of the <hi>Findlanders</hi> Horse, which were kept for a reserve, and he himselfe with his sword in hand hasted to the place where the Imperialists Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery was placed, which he found guarded but by a few men, the greatest part of them being run to the Pillage of the <hi>Saxons</hi> who were run away, and made himselfe master of it: and straightway turning the Cannon upon the Enemy, made them play upon the flanke of the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> who prosecuting their victory, laid load upon the Foot Regiments of Colonell <hi>Steinack, Halli,</hi> and <hi>Hebrun,</hi> who being sent by the King to incourage the <hi>Saxons</hi> did there desperately defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their Pikes and Muskets. Hee then caused some Horse to advance against certaine battaglions of Foot, who came from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists Reare-guard unbackt by Horse, which caused such feare in them, as setting upon them in divers parts with Curasiers mixt with some few Muskets, though the enemy made good their ground for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an houres space, the old Souldiers not ceasing with incredible undauntednesse to fight, though lam'd and wounded, they were at last routed, their Pikes cut in pieces on all sides, their Foot trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfoot, and their Rankes broken; then seeing what impression his men made amongst the enemy, he commanded <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> with part of his Horse and some Foot to make good the Artillery which he had wonne; and that he should withstand <hi>Popenheime,</hi> who with the Imperialists Horse of the Battaile, and foure battaglions of Foot came hastily on to succour his side.</p>
            <p>Then observing how the Imperialists crying, Victory, Victory, were run to the Baggage, and were intent thereupon as if the Battaile had been ended; hee couragiously placed himselfe in the head of 4000. choice Horse, followed by 4000. good Muskettiers and 800. Dragoons; and crying out follow me and feare not, he with his sword in his hand charged the Imperialists, giving in upon them with so much violence, mingling his men amongst theirs, and killing many of them with his owne hand, as (though they indeavoured to rally them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together, and make head against him) yet their Souldiers being scattered, some here, some there, and some of them busie in pillaging the Carriages, they could not resist the <hi>Swedes</hi> invading them; who charging afresh with more fury and force, had in the space of an houre slaine the greatest part of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tilly</hi> was mad to see this unwonted confusion of his men; he soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citously indeavoured to get his men in order againe, and to re-assume the fight; to him <hi>Popenheime</hi> hasted with Squadron of reserve,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55221:30"/>
though sorely wounded in two places, the blood gush't from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace; but being pursued by <hi>Bannier,</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> with whom till then he had been a fighting, and by this time the grosse of both Armies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gotten likewise thither, the scuffle began againe, the Cannon thundred from every side, some loaded with great bullets, some with bags of small ones, there was nothing seen but smoake, fire, and bloud; some of the most couragious without mercy trod under the horses feet, and members (torne from the body by the Cannon) fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the aire. Then was the Battaile renewed on all sides, on Flanke, Front, and Reare; amidst this horror the King with some able and resolute squadrons charged in, and with his sword made way through the thickest of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> squadrons. Here the <hi>Findlanders</hi> Horse shewed such assurednes and resolution, as cheerfully incouraging each other with their voices, they charged <hi>Tillyes</hi> squadrons through and through, so as the Imperialists no longer able to defend themselves against these men, who had banished all feare of death, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened with the opinion of winning the day, and had likewise got the advantage of the winde, which with a briske gale blew the smoak and powder into the enemies eyes, they in disorderly retreat fell foule upon the squadrons of their owne Foot, which being by them opened and broken, began to run.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tilly</hi> observing this confusion and the eminency of danger, got upon a fresh horse, and resolving rather to dye then to be the spectator of so many mens miseries, and of this blemish to all those victories which had immortalized him, used all the means he could to stay his men, and with his owne hand slew many of them that ran away; the like did <hi>Popenheime,</hi> who so couragiously behaved himselfe, as through his heat of bloud not sensible of the weaknesse his wounds had caused in him, he with his sword forced backe the fugitives, and did for some little time keep the remainder of their Troops together: but the feare of the enemy prevailing more with them then the threates and blows of their own Commanders, it was impossible to rally them again. Wherefore <hi>Tilly</hi> being wounded in the arme with a Pistoll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, and having his head cut with a sword of one of the enemies, with whom (aged as he was) he more then once had with his sword in hand incountred; and knowing that there was no more resisting of the <hi>Swedes</hi> fury, who slew all they met with, hee with those few who yet he found about him took his way towards <hi>Fulda,</hi> and recovered the territories of that Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Popenheime</hi> having seven wounds upon him, was stript by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and left for dead in the field amongst the dead bodyes; from whence by the helpe of a country-man, he was the next morning car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to <hi>Hall,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Fulda,</hi> to be cured: In this dayes battaile about 10000. Imperialists were slain, wounded and taken prisoners, many of which were slaine by the country people, who in their flight slew as many of them with their clubs as they met withall: Those of the better sort that perished here of the Emperors side, were the Duke of <hi>Holestanie,</hi> the Colonels, <hi>Bangert</hi> and <hi>Blancart,</hi> the Baron <hi>Schamburg,</hi> with many Captaines and other Officers: The King
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55221:30"/>
found 1000. of his men missing, and the Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> 4000. of his.</p>
            <p>The Battaile being ended, the King commanded a retreat to be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to recall such Troopes as disorderly followed the flying enemy; and all of them being returned to their Colours, he being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Elector and other Princes, and the heads of his Army, did in a stately manner, and mounted on a pasing horse, visit all his squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and thanked them all for their valiant behaviour; they all cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, long live the King, and nothing was heard but vollies of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and the going off of Cannons. Having afterwards taken requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site order for the solemnization of this victory, and giving his Souldiers leave to retire into their quarters and refresh themselves, for what they had that day suffered, hee went to his owne lodging, where after having a good while discoursed with the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> of what advantage would by this victory redound to all the Protestant Princes, he sate downe at Table, where certainly his meat was very pleasing unto him: his discourse, being onely that he thought no greater contentment could be, then for a Generall to see himselfe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious over an enemies army.</p>
            <p>The news of this victory being speedily brought to the Emperors Court did much astonish the <hi>Austrians</hi>; and as great was their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as was the consequence of their losse, especially since it came so unexpectedly upon them, who relying too much upon their former victories and present power, thought they had led fortune in a string; but within a few dayes after they were much more cast downe: and waving upon a sea of thoughts, their hopes were ready to suffer ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; for it was wispered in the Court and other places, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the prejudice received by this dayes losse; 'twas added that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> much considering the <hi>Swedes</hi> victories, and listning to the protestations made unto him by the King, it was not without reason feared that there had beene some overtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This caused much jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie amongst the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> and much suspition and diffidence grew hereupon amongst them; occasioned through the nicety of the interest of Princes, to whom shadows seem substances. <hi>Aldringer</hi> believing (though injuriously) that the Electour (as Princes use to doe) should side with the party, whereby his territories might bee more secured; resolved not to joyne with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> feigning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to winter himselfe, and to place himselfe in the defence of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi>; but before he did this, he with specious words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted his Commanders &amp; Souldiers not to forgoe their loyalty; thus the Army being little lesse then in confusion, the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Souldiers retiring where their Leaders were most concerned, and all things out of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55221:31"/>
order, many consultations were held in the Emperors Court, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in each Counsellor advising, as they were most concerned in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions &amp; self interest, their resolutions grew more and more confused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Where there are many Counsellours, many are the counsels that are given; and the diversitie of nations makes men differ in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.
<q>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> advised that <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> the Emperors sonne should march into the field, whose authority they said would draw many of the Nobility out of their nests of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and make many private men apply themselves to raise new forces, of which there was then great need; besides it would be a meanes to winne the young King to better esteem with his father, and to ingratiate himselfe with him: they further said that the Majesty and presence of a Prince was of much availment in an Army, that Counsels were more readily had, and the results there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were the more opportune, when the authority is supreme in the Commander; and that that was a businesse of great importance in the Military art, that the remainder of those Forces on which the publique hope and safety did depend, ought not to be trusted to the Command of a private man, who either drawne over by the enemy, stir'd up by the unquietnesse of ambition, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his owne particuler interest, or counselled by his passions, might be able to give the Law to his Lord and master.</q>
But the <hi>Dutch</hi> suspected that this might be but cunning carryed by ambition, which covets command:
<q>for they imagined the <hi>Spaniards</hi> named the King to this imployment, not so much for the publique good, as for their owne particular intents: for if the King should have gon into the field, they would have had a stroake in his Counsels, being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy admitted into the Court under pretence of serving the Queene, sister to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and so by little and little, getting sooting in places of command, they might become arbitrators of the Interests, and of the governing the Imperiall Crowne; they therefore dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd from the others in opinion, alleadging that great provisions were to be made for a Kings setting out, aswell for what belonged to the decency of his person, as to the maintenance of a King-like Army: That the treasury was well exhausted by past expences; that the ancient reputation in Armes of an <hi>Austrian</hi> King ought not to be matched with a new, fierce, and fortunate enemy: That the peoples hopes would be much thrown down by any the least preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice that might incurre unto him; and although these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were qualified by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who offered great sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, these notwithstanding with all the Art their owne interests could infuse into them (which was to be commanded by one of their owne nation) propounded <hi>Albertus Walesteine</hi> Duke of <hi>Fridland</hi> in whom there was great reason to hope well; they made it appeare, that to obviate the eminent danger at the present, no man was fitter to take upon him the command of the Army, then he who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to their advantage exercised the same place, and that this their proposition was grounded upon the surer foundation, for that he had heaped up so much riches, by his past victories, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55221:31"/>
no man was fitter then he to assist in the new levyes of men, and in providing all things requisite for the Army.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Necessity, which out-weighs reason, drew the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to yield unto the <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> who overcome by what had been said, and not having yet got good footing in <hi>Germany,</hi> they came over to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the execution whereof was presently resolved upon. But <hi>Walestein</hi> who was then at <hi>Zenam</hi> in <hi>Moravia,</hi> ten leagues from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and was gone thither by reason of the <hi>Saxons</hi> Armies arrivall in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> was not minded to come unto the Court, for that he expected to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and treated as a soveraigne Prince, which he arrogated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by vertue of his title of Duke of <hi>Michelberg,</hi> for which the tearm of highnesse was given him. The Count of <hi>Verdemberg</hi> was first sent to acquaint him with this Election, and afterwards the Baron of <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemberg,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Echenberg</hi> though he were sicke of the gout, three of the Emperours prime Counsellours, and <hi>Walesteines</hi> great friends, who dexterously overcomming an apparence of deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all made by him, in respect of the great griefe of soule he suffered for being formerly turned out of the same charge, they by their flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, (the true sauce to the bitternesse of passion) did so sweeten his distaste, that at last he yielded. He resolved notwithstanding as then, not to receive such imployment for longer then foure moneths, though these his friends used their best eloquence to perswade him to accept of this command absolutely, without any such restriction.</p>
            <p>The opinions of men concerning this, were various; some thought he did it that he might not hazard his honour and reputation, in times of so great calamity, and for that he had to doe with a victorious and fortunate King; others, because he would not oblige himself to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come difficulties, which leaned upon impossibilites; others thought this was but cunning, for that he being exceeding vainglorious desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the rather to accept of this command upon condition, that so he might not onely oblige the Emperour, but also the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>; by both whose Majesties he desired to be intreated, to accept of that which he underhand did mainly indeavour to have conferred upon him, not foreseeing the slipperinesse and danger of the path his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition lead him unto; drunke with an over-weaning estimation of himselfe, neither remembring that Princes will have their servants to be obedient and not masters.</p>
            <p>Having accepted the command of this Army, hee sent for all the Colonels, aswell those who kept their places, as those who had been casheered; and for that affability is a great advantage to reputation, hee received them all with a pleasing countenance, as prouder Princes use to doe, when they have need of Souldiers:
<q>To those that had but onely the title, he gave a sutable command, inviting them with faire and specious words, to lay out what they had gotten in former warres, and promising great things unto them, and helped such as he knew to be needy with monies where-with to raise men: Hee then cheered them up with the undoubted hopes of profit and honour; He with big and grave words canonized their precedent actions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he keep himselfe from using some exaggerations against
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55221:32"/>
them, who had been the originall of the Empires ruine; he more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over informed them, that the present adversity ought not to be of force enough to distemper the valour of those, whose resolution stood in no need of comfort: That this great ship of the Empire had been agitated by tempest, and yet by wise goverment had esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped running upon the Rockes: He remembred them of their past victories, bad them be confident of the like againe, and told them how he would reward those that should be faithfull unto him. Hee afterwards gave in charge to the Colonels and Captaines, who were uncasheered, that they should compleat their Companies, and knowing that those who were verst &amp; known among the people, and in good esteem amongst them have better meanes to raise men, then those who are novices in warre, he underwrit their Patents for more Companies, allowing some fewer, some more, as hee found them capable of imployment; he comforted them all with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous speeches, which gave so much the more contentment, because formerly his words were wont to be composed of pride, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate servitude; he afterwards sealed up all he had to say with civill intreaties, that they would upon this emergency give proofe of that worth and ingenuity which kept in continuall exercise, should not apply it selfe to be carryed to victories by the prosperous windes of fortune, but by cutting through the waves of difficulty, amidst the rocks of adversity, assisted therein by the sounding line of wisedome.</q>
He promised them likewise Imprest monyes, and good winter quarters, from which Commanders reape no little advantage: since that the peoples daily contributions to the Souldier, falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Officers, are not onely alienated from their full number, but in a good part from the remaining Souldiers; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to run over the Countrey, and goe a free-booting, care not much for the Contributions: and hence it is that afterwards the Souldiers growing licentious, treat the good Subjects no otherwise then they would doe the enemy.</p>
            <p>Estimation which is the daughter either of feare or love, imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted these words of <hi>Walesteins</hi> in the hearts of those that heard them; for many of them possessing goods and lands purchased in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and in <hi>Bohemia</hi> during the late Rebellion, forgot not that it concerned them in their owne particuler to doe what they were able, aswell to maintaine what they already had, as to better their estates and conditions; every one betook himselfe therefore to the worke, and much valuing his favour, who where he wanted not in affection, was not sparing in greatnesse and liberality; they forbore not to spend part of what they had gotten, which being ventur'd upon the banke of Plunder, was to bring them in double advantage. Count <hi>Merodes</hi> went into <hi>Flanders</hi> to solicite the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to raise an Army, to oppose <hi>Bawdis</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> Generall, and <hi>William Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hesse. Isolani</hi> went into <hi>Croatia</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> to raise horse, and that he might the better intend the service, he was honoured with the title of Generall of the Nation: all the rest of the Commanders, that had Commissions to raise men, went some into <hi>Moravia,</hi> some into
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55221:32"/>
               <hi>Slecia, Austria, Stiria, Carinthia,</hi> and other Provinces, where they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood men were least imployed, and were given to warres; so as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where the Drums were heard to beat, the Trumpets to sound, and monyes were disburst, whereby according to custome, the Emperors health being cheerfully drunke, and every one providing himselfe, with good armes and other acoutrements, the people seemed by their discourse to presage the ruine of the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatest part of the horse wanted Curasses, by the losse of Armes in the late routes, and particularly in the battaile of <hi>Leypzik,</hi> where they were either left in the field with their dead owners, or els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where thrown away by such as fled there being therefore great want of armes and artificers, some great men of <hi>Italy</hi> were by <hi>Walesteine</hi> sent into <hi>Lombardi</hi> to make a considerable provision of them; and other Colonels sent Officers of their owne, to the like purpose, sparing no money in this behalfe, not caring for expence; for the Generals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to come into the field, not onely rich in fame, but furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with whatsoever was requisite to a glorious Army: continuing therefore his diligence, he treated with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to have men from that nation, and in this he imployed his Cosen-german <hi>Tersica,</hi> for they had each of them married a daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Arrach,</hi> the Emperours chiefe Counsellour. This man being one of the richest Gentlemen in all <hi>Bohemia,</hi> was not much troubled to finde money to raise 3000. Horse, and 4000. Foot of sundry nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walsteine</hi> after this made the Counts <hi>Galasse, Mansfeild, Aldringer,</hi> and <hi>Montecucully,</hi> Generalls of the Artillery, all of them chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Army; to these he recommended the care of recru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their old companies, and the raising of new ones, which he allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them; and they overcome with the Generals gratitude, did their utmost to obey him. He moreover appointed eight Serjeant Majors Generals of the Army, who have the command over the rest of the Colonels, and whose place is to order the Army in the day of Battaile: and to these he gave new Commissions to raise men. They for the honour they had received, and that they might preserve their Generals good will, (which was ambitiously coveted by all) little waying the difficulty of raising men in dispeopled Provinces, and full of troubles, where the poorest companion could be had under 25. Dollers.</p>
            <p>He gave Commissions to any one that desired imployment, and disburst much money by the way of loane, that the whole might be made up; neither did he make any distinction as then of any that proffered their service; for holding it the best counsell that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Prince, who is desirous to inlarge his dominions, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himselfe in the faith of his friends, and from the injuries of his adversaries, to have copious Armies, that so he might do that in some moneths, which otherwise would require some yeares to effect; his intention was to gather together great quantities of armed men, who if they should afterwards want experienced Commanders, he wanted not old Captaines under whose Colours he might put these new men,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55221:33"/>
and casheer those that were uncapable of such imployment, before he was to march against the enemy: and to this purpose he had wont to say, if the Emperour will raise an Army of 30000. Souldiers, the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> or some other Prince by the assistance of friends, will doe the like; that to fight with equall forces, was to have the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to be decided by fortune, and not to secure ones owne selfe by power: that time would be lost, their Territories would be oppressed, the subject would be weakened by keeping forces, in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, businesse would be precipitated, and finally peace would ensue, the end whereof would be misery and ruine to the vassals; that a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army lords it over the fields, goes whither it lists, meets with no obstacle, and being able to scoure the Country at pleasure, loses not Contribution nor the meanes to maintaine it selfe; and though this be contrary to some experience, where a few men have been known to beat a great many, he said that this little number must be pick't out of a gallant and well reputed nation, and that the execution was easie, when the Commander in chiefe had wonne the name of generous and magnanimous towards his Souldiers. He would not forbeare to let fall in his discourses, that the Imperiall Crowne would be but weake, if it were not secured by 100000. Souldiers kept continually in pay; for the Empire being a body of many members, dissonant in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it fals out, that by the liberty which many Cities professe, and by the power of the Electors, and other Princes, the <hi>Caesarian</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity being by them lessened, sickens, and wanting forces, languishes as if Crusht to death by her owne fewdatories; in briefe he so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely chid the errors of late successes, as all such as were dejected by reason of their past terrors, were seene suddainly to be clad with new hopes.</p>
            <p>Hee moreover sent expresses to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> as well to keep him in good correspondency with the Emperour, as to perswade him to raise men in the assistance of the common interest, and that he would permit the <hi>Austrian</hi> officers to raise men in his Country. This Prince being of high thoughts, and inclyning to warre, a lover of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, counselled by that vivacity which sparkles in the hearts of sprightly Princes, and seconded by advice of others, which useth not to differ from the inclination and genious of the Master; did not onely yield to <hi>Walesteines</hi> request, but declared that he would hazard his life and fortune with him, arming and behaving himselfe, as the chiefe of this league; of which 'tis said he aspired to be Generall; this was the first beginning of the jealousies between him and <hi>France</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reason why he drew upon him the enmity of the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These affaires past not without some knowledge of the Queene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France,</hi> mother to the most Christian King, and to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> for at this instant a gentleman of hers came to <hi>Zenam,</hi> who having had some discourse with <hi>Walesteine</hi> was dismist with appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that he was well apaid with his negotiation: And the <hi>Austrians</hi> building much upon the troubles of <hi>France,</hi> whose union did not a little disturbe their designes, they more seriously applyed themselves
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55221:33"/>
to invent meanes and wayes how to hinder the increase of that flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Kingdome, by nourishing the differences between the Princes of the bloud, and thereby to affoord fuell to the flames of Ambition; to kindle a new intestine warre sufficient to disturbe the Forces of that great King; aswell by deviating them from his intentions upon the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> which in this conjuncture was much feared, as to withhold from thence that assistance which the Protestants expected. To this purpose 'tis said they sent some of their trustiest creatures, concealedly to treate with the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and other chiefe men that were discontented with the government of the Ministers of State in <hi>France,</hi> not letting slip any thing that might hurle the French into those straights whereunto they were leaning; for many were afraid that if the French had declared themselves in this so calamitous time, after a hostile manner, all their preparations would doubtlesly have been much perplext if not totally shipwrackt; but for that when God extends his hand of protection over a crowned head, all the plots and hatreds of their envyers are rendred uselesse, many considered, that the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the second had not a little merited from Heaven, whilest Princes and people jealous of the <hi>Austrian</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and conspiring together to suppresse the same, in stead of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing an opportune occasion of laying the Emperour upon his backe, betooke themselves to things of uncertainty, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned their private interests: so those armes which openly joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether would have ruined the Empire, being unresolved and expecting what the event of others would be, stayed from declaring themselves till such time as the prevailing Forces of the <hi>Swedes</hi> growing weaker, and the Imperiall power in time gathering force, they should finde it a hard matter to abate the edge of that strength, which was inheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the experience of Armies, and was made more stable by being shaked. <hi>Rome</hi> increasing under <hi>Romulus</hi> had the good fortune, that whilest she was fought withall by diverse Nations, she was not set upon by all at once: And whereas being all united they had overcome her, they severally were by her overcome, and by their ruine affoorded leisure to lay the foundations of the Roman Monarchy. It is a truth not to be doubted of, that if the <hi>French</hi> not inferiour in strength to the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and who knew the Imperiall greatnesse ought to have been suppressed, had followed the King of <hi>Swedes</hi> fortune, and openly have drawn their swords, as afterwards they were inforced to doe, they would either have brought the Imperiall dignity to make peace upon their owne conditions, or else have led it to some great exigency. That fire that is not quencht by a little water, gathering more strength, and breaking forth in greater flames, will not afterwards give way to greater store of water: Whence it may be gathered, that when a Prince may by his advancing prejudice his Enemy, whilest his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is busied on one side, he ought not to stand idle on the other, for 'tis well knowne that those Forces which have overcome their first withstanders, made wiser by experience, grow keener and better edged against the second.</p>
            <p>Knowing moreover that the only <hi>Austrian</hi> Forces was not sufficient
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55221:34"/>
in such an emergency as this to withstand the evils threatned by the victories and well conducted Armies of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and of so many other enemies, whose numbers by their greatnesse and command was increased, they sent first the Cardinall <hi>d' Arach, Walesteines</hi> kinsman, to the Pope, and after him Duke <hi>Savell</hi> (who being found innocent, was absolved of the faults laid unto his charge by <hi>Tilly</hi> out of some private ill will that he bore him) with pressing and earnest desires of being from his Holinesse assisted with good store of monies; and newes was brought that the Pope had voted a considerable summe of money to be sent the Emperour, though it were demanded with too much pretensions by the <hi>Austrian</hi> Ministers of State, and advised for the interest of their Countrey by some Cardinals of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that they knew his Holinesse to be very carefull of the good of Christendome, whilest by continuall exhortations he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the safety of <hi>Lombardy</hi> against the fury which the Forces bent without regard upon the destruction of <hi>Mantua</hi> threatned; by whose example the Christian Princes very well perceived, that to foment the greatnesse of puissant Princes, was nothing else but to nurse up a Serpent in ones bosome, which at last would poison its benefactor; as it would have proved in past times, if the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> diversions had not recalled those Forces from <hi>Italy,</hi> which neither the prayets, exhortations, nor protestations of the Pope could prevaile withall to make them turne backe; they also sent to other Potentates, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Count <hi>Rabata</hi> then Governour of <hi>Gradisca,</hi> no lesse powerfull with his pen then with his sword, a gentleman of singular understanding in any affaire, who was very much welcomed by them all, with many complements, but their expeditions proved unuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>When the Enemy watches we must not be asleep: therefore if <hi>Walesteine</hi> did by these new inventions recruit his Army that he might in the Spring appeare in the Field; The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> growne hardy by his victory and other happy successes, sent newes of this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous proceedings, to such Princes, States and Cities, as were his friends; and disswading the <hi>Hauns</hi> Townes, and Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from assisting his Enemy, he did not sit still in this his prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but printing a Declaration, wherein was contained that he would take aswell Roman Catholiques, as Protestants into his protection, that he might not lose time, but make use of his fortune, he resolved forthwith to march with his Army into <hi>Franconia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Province extends it selfe on the West and South side to the Confines of the upper and lower Palatinate, on the East to <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Misnia,</hi> and on the North side to <hi>Thuringia,</hi> so as it may be called the Center of <hi>Germany,</hi> it is partly plaine and partly adorned with pleasant hills, of a fruitfull soile, though in some parts sandy. 'Tis watered by the Rivers <hi>Mayne, Aisah, Ridnits, Bints, Stray, Tawber,</hi> and others, to the no little advantage of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The King agreed with the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> how he should behave himselfe in the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; he left <hi>Bannier</hi> and <hi>Tod</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals of the Field, with other great Officers behinde, aswell that they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55221:34"/>
might drive from the Confines of <hi>Pomerania</hi> such of the Emperours Garrisons as yet remained there, as likewise that they might endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to win <hi>Magdeburg</hi> and other Townes held by the <hi>Caesarians</hi> in the lower <hi>Saxony,</hi> and he himselfe parted from <hi>Hall</hi> upon the River of <hi>Sall,</hi> towards <hi>Erfurt</hi> the chiefe City of <hi>Thuringia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Province is seated between the Rivers <hi>Sall</hi> and <hi>Wesser,</hi> by which it is much enriched; 'tis well peopled, abounding in Corne, Hay, and many sorts of Beasts; it bounds on the South side upon <hi>Franconia,</hi> on the West upon the <hi>Landsgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen</hi> his Country; on the North it is covered with the <hi>Herecinian</hi> Wood, and on the East it bounds upon <hi>Misnia</hi>; the Inhabitants thereof beleeving themselves not able to contend with a victorious Army, at first newes of the Kings being marched that wayes sent Deputies unto him, to see whether by their intreaties they could make him turne another way, since they were not able to doe it by their Armes; they therefore presented themselves before him, they made knowne unto him the Oath they had taken to the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> what troubles they had undergone for doing so, and promised that they would keep Neutrals; but this medecine not being adequate to their malady, wrought no effect. The King would enter their City, make them know his Lawes, and owne him for their Patron;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Septem.</hi> 26.</note> the which he did on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> to lesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Citizens then they imagined, who much affrighted at the report of what cruelties the <hi>Swedes</hi> used against the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, could not free themselves from feare, yet lost they nothing but their Patron, being treated by the King with all demonstrations of sweetnesse.</p>
            <p>A man ought not to be so overjoyed with a good victory, as that his heart be distempered by the delights thereof: the King being therefore entred, <hi>Erfurt</hi> on horsebacke, before he lighted off his Horse, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Colonell <hi>Riven</hi> to take with him twenty Companies of Horse, and three Regiments of Foot, and therewithall to march pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to <hi>Ghota</hi> in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> seated upon the River <hi>Nesa,</hi> which having neither walls nor garrison fitting to resist the <hi>Swedes</hi> assault, the setting upon it and taking of it was one and the same action. The King the next morning went to <hi>Ilminan</hi> seated upon the <hi>Ilm,</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Franconia</hi> neare to the Woods which divide those Provinces. This Towne at his first approach fell to Capitulation, as did <hi>Ghota,</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two dayes through that great Wood, he came before the walls of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> which lyes between the Rivers of <hi>Stray</hi> and <hi>Verts,</hi> which gives the name to a circuit of Land lying betwixt the Bishopricke of <hi>Halberstat</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> and takes unto it selfe the name of a County. He saluted it with many Cannon shot, and made two assaults upon the defendants who stoutly resisted him: but the Governour knowing it would be a hard matter to maintaine the Towne, succour being farre off and inexcessible, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> violences growing greater and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excessible, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> violences growing greater, he thought it was best to give that which he could neither sell nor keep, and upon hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conditions to march forth with Collours flying, Drums bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Bagge and Baggadge; the which the King courteously gave

way unto, and he marched out much satisfied at the so great Civility of an enemy; who observing it as an approved peece of Policy, that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill usage and faire demeaner is a meanes to make men rather turne Subjects then continue enemies, did punctually observe that course.</p>
            <p>Mens wisedome is improved by nothing more then by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others, as appeared by all the County of <hi>Hammelburg,</hi> a rich County, full of Townes, and well peopled, Castles seated betweene <hi>Franconia</hi> and <hi>Thuringia,</hi> which following the example of the Towne of <hi>Mansfeild,</hi> yielded themselves to the Kings obedience; this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise caused the losse of <hi>Koningshoven,</hi> which lyes upon the banke of <hi>Sala,</hi> and which is gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The gaining of this Towne spread no little amazement through all <hi>Franconia,</hi> and the adjoyning territories, insomuch as all those which had yet any thing left whereby to subsist, removed themselves, and the best of their movables to places of better security.</p>

The <hi>Swedes</hi> having wonne the City, presently beset the Castle, which was seated upon a hill, and built upon a rocke, so as favoured not onely by nature but by art also, it seemed to be almost impregnable; yet though the Situation thereof made the businesse appeare difficult, the <hi>Swedes</hi> were incouraged by the speeches and presence of their King, who infused a dauntlesse courage into them, whilst he promised them booty, and honour; words able to inhearten the basest mindes, and which are the true spurres that thrust Souldiers upon all worthie actions: so as after some dayes defence it was taken by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who fought with much cunning and without feare of death; for dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nauciates not him that is accustomed to daring.

               <hi>Auxillius Oxesterne</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who had raised men in that Kingdome and in <hi>Prusia,</hi> to re-inforce the Kings Army, came much about this time to the Camp with 6000 Foot and 800 Horse; so as the King not onely inriched by so many Victories, but his Army being increased by the addition of these men, had his thoughts hightened, and aymed at greater enterprises. Wherefore being informed that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> made extraordinary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for warre, and that he had not onely made the greatest part of the country-people guirt swords about them, but also sent for <hi>Tilly</hi> with the Army of the League, to protect the upper <hi>Palatinat,</hi> which were manifest tokens of feare, whereby the Enemy is oft times invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to further undertakings, hee resolved to hinder those preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not to afford him time to salve the wound he had received. But thinking it first requisite to know the resolution of the <hi>Hauns</hi> Townes, who intended to be but lookers on at this sport, not siding with either party, he resolved to found their intentions; wherefore he acquainted them of <hi>Noremberg</hi> with his meanings; he made knowne unto them the foundation and drift of his Forces, and desired they would openly declare themselves, either as friends or enemyes, and that they would not take any long time to doe it; for if they should demurre upon their answer, or colour it with any appearing excuses, he would take it as an expresse denyall; for he liked not neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trallity, nor would he take notice of any more then two parties, friends or enemies. These resolute words of a victorious King, were

of great efficacy, especially amongst the Protestants, who coveted much to see their Religion propagated, and were ambitious of no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velty.

This Towne is pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly situated upon the River <hi>Mayne</hi> in <hi>Franconia,</hi> which River after a course of some thirty miles fals into the <hi>Rhene</hi> just over against <hi>Mentz,</hi> and by the commodiousnesse of Navigation doth more encrease Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique: It is begirt with Walls and Ditches, after the ancient way in no very exact manner; the King exhorted the Citizens thereof not to refuse the Propositions of agreement which were offered; for as the present conjuncture of time was, he could do no lesse then promise safety to the City, and secure unto them their Religion: but they loath to forgoe their Neutrality, speedily dispatched two Deputies to the King to obtaine leave to continue Neuters, putting him in mind of the Oath they had taken to the Emperour, and of the losse they were to undergo by reason of their Marts and Merchandizing, and other good reasons which at another time had not deserved punishment: For though this was not numbred amongst the <hi>Hauns</hi> Townes of <hi>Germany,</hi> yet the greatest part of the Inhabitants were <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and consequently did adhere to the Imperialists; so as though they pretend Neutrality, they would not have let slip any occasion wherby they might have prejudiced the <hi>Swedes,</hi> as they are used to doe who seem to be what indeed they are not: nothing therfore came of this Treaty, which whilst they were in discourse of, the King made his army advance, and before they had ended all they had to say, the City might see the <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse close by their Gates, and their Foot in readinesse to set upon it by force, if they would not condescend to what was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them; they were therefore enforced least they might meet with the reward of obstinacy, courteously to quit that which they could not without harme to themselves gain-say; they therefore submitted themselves unto the King,<note place="margin">

He also sent part of his Forces before <hi>Kockein</hi> and <hi>Vlersheime</hi> upon the <hi>Maine,</hi> that they might throw over a Bridge to facilitate more Conquests: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given these orders, and seene the Batteries levelled against the Walls of <hi>Vlersheime,</hi> with the taking whereof he was very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; for this being neare the <hi>Rhene</hi> upon the <hi>Maine,</hi> on the side of <hi>Mentz,</hi> freed him from the troubles which the Garrison thereof might occasion him; and freeing the Countrey on this side <hi>Rhene,</hi> and thereby securing himselfe behinde, he might without any manner of feare, goe to new undertakings; he built a Bridge of Boates that he might passe his Army, and provisions to and again at his pleasure, he returned to <hi>Franckfort</hi> to give audience to certaine Ambassadours, and to treat with some great men, about the ordering of affaires for the better facilitating the next yeares undertakings; but he could not stay there above sixe daies, for having received advertisement how that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Troopes of Spaniards and Flemings raised in <hi>Lusemberg,</hi> were marching apace towards the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> to recruite the Garrisons of <hi>Mentz, Wormes, Franchendall, Heidelberg,</hi> and other Townes in those parts, as yet held by the Imperialists, he broake off his Treaties of Negotiation, and returning speedily to his Army, he marched along the <hi>Rheine,</hi> and by the meanes of a Guide who led him a way not much frequented, he with the greatest part of his Army, which had now done with <hi>Vlersheim,</hi> having at the end of eight daies taken it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on composition, went to <hi>Ringaw,</hi> the Country where the best Renish Wines are made, he surprized a great Body of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who were quartered in <hi>Walfe,</hi> putting most of them to the Sword, which infused such feare into the Garrisons of <hi>Rodesheim,</hi> and <hi>Ernsfeilt,</hi> Walled Townes neare <hi>Mentz,</hi> but of no great moment, as that overcome with the apprehension of the Swedish Forces, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their gates unto him; parting afterwards from <hi>Ringaw,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced so farre and so fast, as that he faced <hi>Mentz</hi> upon the <hi>Rhene,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the which he made some Cannon play, rather by way of salute, then with an intention of harme. The channell of the River growing here very broad, he resolved to repasse over the <hi>Mayne</hi> to tarry in <hi>Berghestrate,</hi> and seeke out how he might passe over the <hi>Rhene</hi> there, those parts being but slenderly guarded. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> foreseeing this, had burnt and sunke all the Boates on that shoare which were fit to passe over the <hi>Swedes,</hi> insomuch as the King found his labour was here little better then lost: When a Dutch Souldier having (as it oft fals out) won into the friendship of a Fisherman of <hi>Gernsheime,</hi> named <hi>Iohn Varter,</hi> prevailed so farre with him by promise and profers of advantage, as that by the helpe of another mariner of the same place, they recovered some of the Boates that had been sunke, and emptying the water out of them, made them so fit, as that at sundry times they passed 2000 of the Foot over the River: and the King by these secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the landing on that side, (for by the meanes of great trees, linckt and fastened together, (a moderne invention) they made Trenches and Palisadoes) past over a good part of his Army: hee unexpectedly came before <hi>Oppenheime,</hi> not farre from the <hi>Rhene,</hi> fortified with wals

and Towers after the ancient manner, seated upon the backe of a little hill; the Garrison whereof having the <hi>Rhene</hi> for their Trenches, which they thought he could not so easily passe over, feared no harme; the Towne was hotly set upon; for the Souldiers invited by the hopes of booty, whereof great store was said to be there, thronged in crouds into the Ditch, and the Breaches which were there made, defying death, and not regarding the dead bodyes, which in no small numbers lay in their way. The Defendants making no shew of feare, plaid the parts of valiant Souldiers, hoping for reliefe from <hi>Mentz</hi>; but much more incouraged by the promises of the Governour, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was a well advised man, and much experienced in warre, and who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believed that the King was so strong in men, nor that hee should faile of being relieved: But the assailants, which in two dayes storm'd the Towne, and entring it by force, kill'd all that they met withall at the first in a defensive posture, and sack't the City which was well-nigh halfe burnt to the ground, by a fire which therein happened ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually, that very day, by the meanes of a drunken Dutch-woman. There being in <hi>Oppenhaime</hi> but few Barkes and Materials sufficient to build a stately Bridge, the King hasted to build the Bridge over, which having passed the rest of his Foot, his Horse and his Cannon, hee marched with his Army too before <hi>Mentz,</hi> where the Defendants being provided of all things requisite for their preservation and defence, and having done what they could to defend themselves within bare old Wals and weake Trenches, being out of hope to make good the Towne against the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who with Military discipline drew neerer and neerer thereunto, desired a cessation of Armes; which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the courteous King; and they knowing that the enemies Army consisted of about 26000 Souldiers, and above 20 piece of Cannon, they thought themselves not sufficient without a greater addition of Forces to defend it, they therefore treated, and had such conditions granted them as became a gracious Conquerour.

               </note> This man in the beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi> did by way of stratagem send 500 Horse, by night too, before the gates of <hi>Wahnheime,</hi> a Fort standing upon the Angle which is made by <hi>Necker,</hi> where it fals into the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> to the end that seeming to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists, who had been defeated by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they might endeavour the being received into the Towne. These men behaving themselves wisely, and by the assistance of some fugitives fled from the Garrison, who were acquainted with the customes of the Towne and of the Guard, deceiving the Centinell, the Officers, and even the Governor himselfe, with suppositions, names, likelyhoods, and appearing conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, were admitted into the Towne; where scouring the streets, opening the gates, seising upon the Port, and cutting in pieces all they met, they let in their Companions who were not farre off, and made themselves masters of the Town. Thus it befals Governours, who believing in others, have not as yet known that often times hard and incredible things have unexpected events, they not having learnt to sleep with their eyes open.</p>
            <p>In the inundation of victories, and the mannaging of Military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, Politicke considerations and negotiations ought not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: therefore the King staying some dayes at <hi>Mentz</hi> to discusse divers businesses of waight, thought it not fitting to passe by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act consideration of the present affaires; so as calling together his chiefe Councellours, and the Prime Commanders of his Army, and joyntly weighing the interests of their Forces, there were some secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their opinion by <hi>Benard Waymar,</hi> who persisted in their advise, that they should turne their Forces to the utter subversion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholique Army, they made good their opinions with these reasons;
<q>That the field Forces being scattered, <hi>Germany</hi> being a large and open Country, the winning of Townes would be no hard matter, which being weake in defence, and abandoned by their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, would strive rather to captivate the Kings good will by ready obedience, than draw his anger upon them by their unwise perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; that they should not do well to lose so much time in the taking in of places of small moment, whilest the Enemy recruited and re-inforced his Army; that the <hi>Austrians</hi> had no better friend then time; that they had alwayes repaired their losses, when either by cunning or otherwise they could fence themselves from the first violence; that though the Emperours owne men and monies were well exhausted, yet by the assistance of Spanish Gold, and by recruites from <hi>Italy</hi> (a Nation by experience knowne to be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55221:40"/>
to Germany) he might remit himselfe into his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> who was much concerned in the <hi>Austrians</hi> welfare, wanted not a stocke of money, and territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries sufficient from whence to draw out Souldiers, and regaine what he had lost: And (which was of greatest importance) that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals place was conferred upon <hi>Walesteine,</hi> who having gathered a mass of riches in the past warres, being excessively ambitious of glory and great actions, would not be failing in any thing that he knew might make him remarkable upon this occasion; that they had the <hi>French</hi> on that side for friends, who bringing their Forces upon their frontiers, would hinder the <hi>Romanists</hi> from doing any thing prejudiciall to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> that therefore they should leave off those machinations and rub the soare againe, before it be healed.</q>
But these reasons, though they had much of influence upon all the Commanders, and drew many of them to be of this opinion, yet the King weighing them in the ballance of his wisedome, was for his own interest sake inforced to oppose them; saying,
<q>That the Empire hung upon two strings; the one composed of the selfe-<hi>Austrian</hi> Forces, the other of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique, and Ecclesiasticall powers; that they were to consider which of these two were to be tane away, to overthrow this <hi>Chaos</hi>; that he granted the reasons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gold: <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and <hi>Walesteine</hi> were very valid, but that they were not to throw behinde their backes, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively to looke upon the aid from <hi>Flanders,</hi> the assistance of the Electors and Ecclesiastickes, and of the Duke of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous of warre, could not hereafter expect a better occasion then this, to put himselfe in Armes; that these men though they were new, and not accustomed to warre, yet were they so inhearte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their Princes courage and hope of good successe, as seeing us retire, they would resume the more courage, and cause unto us such prejudice, as usually is received from Enemies, strengthened by strong impressions; that it was requisite to extinguish the fire, which increasing would not be so easily supprest, before they should carry the Cumbustion elsewhere, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> succours from <hi>Flanders</hi> was more considerable then from <hi>Italy,</hi> for that compleat Arming would be found hard in <hi>Italy</hi>: A Kingdome impoverished in people, and the numbers whereof would be much lessened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they should passe over the Mountaines, for that the rigid Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> severe manner of lying in the field did not well agree with that Nation, nurc'd up in the delights of Peace; that for their money they might have men enow in the Low-Countryes; that he knew the Treasury and Forces of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was very considerable, but that on the other side he knew he was not so lavish in laying out his monies, nor his men so ready to take up Armes; that <hi>Walesteine</hi> was a humerous Foole, a fantasticall braine, fit for Comedies, reverenced for his wealth and fortune, not for his wisedome and proper valour; that he was envied by many, a corrivall with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and not well thought of by the discreet <hi>Don</hi>; for what concerned their hopes upon the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55221:41"/>
                  <hi>French,</hi> it was to be granted it would be advantagious to them, if Princes were not ambitious of inlarging their dominions: But since <hi>France</hi> was knowne to be no lesse intent to this then whatsoever other Kingdome, he could not promise himselfe that the <hi>French</hi> would invert the proceedings of the Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and of the <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> against the <hi>Swedes</hi>; but rather that leading their Forces upon their Frontiers, and entring either as protectors of the one, or arbitrators of the other, he foresaw they would rather put in for themselves through the disagreement of the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Imperialists</hi> then assist the Protestants in their proceedings: moreover, that they ought to feare, least if they once should get footing here, they should (following the policy of Princes, who are friends as long as it makes for their owne good) moderate the greatnesse of others, and dissolve the League at any time when they should see the <hi>Swedes</hi> power grow to an excessive greatnesse. <hi>Tod</hi> and <hi>Tuball</hi> would be sufficient to hold <hi>Tiffenbech</hi> and <hi>Ghetz</hi> play in <hi>Slesia</hi>; that the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> it would be no hard matter to disturbe <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesteines</hi> designes, and that <hi>Bannier</hi> was sufficient to watch over <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varias</hi> wayes; that therefore they ought to secure themselves on this side for what was on their backs, which being done, the victory on the other side would easily be affected.</q>
These reasons alleadged by the King, made the Commanders aware, that Councels then suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed best when they proceed from the hidden reasons of interests; and that no resolution ought to be built upon the faire shewes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ground-worke of their demonstrations not being composed of any sound materials, but coloured over as best seemes pleasing to the eye of the present conjuncture.</p>
            <p>All of them therefore forgoing their first opinions, they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously condescended to the King; who seeing what need they had of a good Sanctuary, whereunto upon any ill successe they might safely retreate, as likewise how necessary it was to fence <hi>Franconia,</hi> after he had diligently suryeyed all the nighbouring situations, could find none more commodious then that Angle which is placed betwixt the <hi>Rhene,</hi> and that part of the <hi>Mayne,</hi> which is over against <hi>Mentz,</hi> on the side of the Palatinate, he therefore made a designe be there drawne in his owne presence, of a Fort consisting of seven Royall Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, a Seat so availeable, as lying in the midst between the State of <hi>Mentz</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> upon the sides of two Navigable Rivers, it might be said to be the Key which opens and shuts the entrance and outgoing on both sides of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> whereby he might continually bridle the Inhabitants aswell of the one as of the other circle: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, besides the securing of what he had already wonne, there was hereby a way opened to ends not yet knowne. He gave it the name of <hi>Gustavemborg,</hi> though through the Souldiers playing upon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholiques, it came to be called the Priests scourge; alleadging thereby, that being seated in the sight of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and in the very midst of the Electorate, it was fit to keep the neighbouring Prelates in obedience and under the yoake of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces. Having left or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the perfecting of this Fabricke, and for the preservation of

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55221:43"/>
for the defence of <hi>Danube</hi>: hee therefore marched forward in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and with his Army drew nigh to <hi>Dunawert,</hi> where the <hi>Imperialists</hi> had built a Fort upon the hill, which hee set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and finding nothing to withstand him in those yet imperfect workes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>March.</hi>
               </note> hee forced the defendants to retire into the Towne, which being played upon by the Kings Cannon, which thundred on all sides, and assaulted round about, the Wals not being sufficient to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Cannon-shot, which drilled their Trenches through, and overthrew their Towers, the Inhabitants dispairing of succour from <hi>Tilly,</hi> thought they had done the duties of good Souldiers, and being so perswaded, forsooke the City which might very well have yet held out for some time. They broke the Bridge and withdrew themselves into <hi>Ingolstat,</hi> to the great resentment of <hi>Tilly,</hi> who (as they are wont to doe, that are abandoned by fortune) found opposition to all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, even in those things wherein hee thought himselfe most secure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> having entred the City, and repaired the Bridge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all speed, they passed their horse over the <hi>Danube,</hi> and over-running all the neighbouring Townes without any resistance, the damage was not little which the people received by the insolencies of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to whom the Souldiers licentiousnesse seemed the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, in that they had not formerly been acquainted with the evils of warre, which is used in all Nations against enemies, especially against such as are of another Religion. The King being afterwards infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Condition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Army, hee lodged his Army neer <hi>Druisse,</hi> and extended his Quarters along the litle Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Schmutter,</hi> watching over <hi>Tillyes</hi> wayes, who having inlarged his Forces by the accesse of multitudes of <hi>Bavarians,</hi> kept himselfe along the Bankes of <hi>Lech,</hi> a chiefe River, which taking its head from the Mountaines of <hi>Tirolo,</hi> divides <hi>Bavaria</hi> from <hi>Swabenland,</hi> and fals into the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Dunewert.</hi> The King knowing that Princes resolutions are then best, when they proceed from the advises of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, thought it not fitting to advance further before he knew the mindes of the heads of his Army;
<q>he therefore did send for them to him, and acquainted them with what his designes were; what advantage the winning of <hi>Bavaria</hi> might be to them; that if they could bereave the <hi>Austrians</hi> of that leaning stocke, either by draw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the Electour to some faire agreement, or by utterly ruinating his Country, they might easily afterwards lead their Forces into <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> and into <hi>Caesars</hi> very patrimoniall territories: mature conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being had hereupon, 'twas found it would be a hard businesse to effect, since the <hi>Lech</hi> was guarded all along by great numbers of the enemies Souldiers. The King notwithstanding with his wonted courage was for the undertaking, alleadging for his reason, that to an enemy already terrified and beaten, the more difficult the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking were, the greater confusion it would cause in them; to the which, reply was made by <hi>Horne</hi> and other Captaines, that they should not doe well to fight with the enemy upon such disadvantage of the River; that the enterprise would be difficult, and that to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55221:44"/>
boot with the difficulty thereof it was to be considered of what consequence (if they should be worsted here) the great inheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby of the enemy would be, who were not yet so weakned, but that they were able to encounter with the greatest Forces that the Protestant Colleagues could make; that the Country was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely their enemy; that they wanted a place of refuge, whereinto in case of a storme to retreate; that no little heed was to be had to <hi>Walesteines</hi> preparations, who growne strong in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and in the upper <hi>Palatinat,</hi> would bring the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army in that nooke or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, either to a dangerous Battaile, or to unevitable destruction; that his opinion was, they should put off this resolution to a more oportune time, and that they should go against <hi>Moravia,</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the Emperors Army; the which being the head, if it should be overthrown, the other members would be weakned.</q>
The King having given diligent eare to these alleadged reasons, did with his wonted dexterity rise up, and reply;
<q>that the Passage of the River ought not to be feared, though it were guarded by the enemy, for the <hi>Imperialists</hi> were already at their wits ends, by reason of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Victories; that their recruites consisted of people more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to the plow and to the mannuring of ground, then to the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of weapons; that fortune favoured the forward, and frowned upon the fearfull; that she had turned her backe upon <hi>Tilly,</hi> who after the first was to expect a second discomfiture; that <hi>Dunawert</hi> being well guarded would serve them for a place of safety, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they might retreat in case of any misfortune; that they were to pursue that Army, which being led by an old experienced Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, not unlike a Snow-ball, which by rouling up and downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a great heap, might gather strength againe, and recruite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into his former Condition; that <hi>Walesteine</hi> was farre off, and had but few men, and those but fresh-water Souldiers, and therefore no feare was to be had of him; and concluding with the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what profit and riches they should get in <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benland,</hi> he drew the greatest part to side with him, and knowing how advantagious it would be to possesse himselfe of those Townes which lye between <hi>Lech</hi> and <hi>Iber,</hi> hee commanded <hi>Horne</hi> with some choice Regiments of Horse to make excursions even to the wals of <hi>Vlm,</hi> which is a <hi>Hauns</hi> Towne well munitioned, and one of the richest in all Germany, seated upon the bankes of <hi>Danube</hi> in the midst of <hi>Swabenland,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof being most of them Protestants, if they should see the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces greater then the <hi>Imperialists</hi> in those parts, would without delay cast themselves into his protection;</q>
hee gave him further in charge, that he should invite the Magistracy thereof to good correspondency, and that he should endeavour to bring all the places thereabouts to his devotion; all which <hi>Horne</hi> did, not meeting with much difficulty therein, for many of those Townes seeing the Conquerour in the midst of their territories, and wanting of defence, onely walled about with old Wals without Garrisons, and frighted, as those use to be who see their enemy before their gates, strove who first should bring in their Keyes and Contribution money
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55221:44"/>
to the <hi>Swedish</hi> Officers, who by the Kings directions did treate those people so civilly, and had so particular a care to be lesse grievous to them then were the <hi>Austrians,</hi> as they moderated the report, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholiques had given out of them, insomuch that (as those which apprehend most are usually best contented) those people overcome with the <hi>Swedish</hi> courtesie, could not but confesse that they were better treated by their enemies then by their friends.</p>
            <p>These speedy acquisitions caused much suspition in the Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Auspurg,</hi> where though there were Citizens enow, and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison which were paid by the Senate thereof, strangers, sufficient to defend the same; yet the Electour of <hi>Bavaria</hi> fearing left (the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part thereof being Protestants) it should rather have inclined to the prevailing <hi>Swedish</hi> party, then to that of <hi>Austria,</hi> indeavoured to bring in a Garrison of Papists; and wrought so secretly under-hand with some of the Officers, as that he brought into the City two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Horse and 2000 Foot, who speedily disarming the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Inhabitants, possest themselves of the Gates and of the Arce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and the Souldiers being changed, the Guards were doubled. But the King who upon all occasions did ever desire to advance, was minded to passe over the <hi>Lech,</hi> and remove <hi>Tilly</hi> from thence, who kept the maine body of his Army along that River; and although the enterprise was some-what hard, yet observing the course of the River and the Bankes thereof, he suddainly raised thereupon a good Trench, and planting his Artillery, began to play upon the enemy, who keeping themselves close within their Trenches, did valiantly reply upon him and withstood his Passage: the bickering began to grow very hot, where whil'st both sides were busied and plyed the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile a pace; the King being advertised by Duke <hi>Bernard Waymar</hi> how that he had discovered a Foord, a little lower, by a little Island, by the one side whereof he might easily wade; hee presently sent back the said Duke thither, with certaine Boates carried to such like purpose upon Carts. Whil'st the King-indeavoured by all meanes he could to passe over, <hi>Waymar</hi> past over some select Souldiers by the benefit of those Boates into the said Island, to the end that if need should be they might make good the Passage, till such time as a Bridge might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: and he so well placed his Cannon and Muskets upon the Flankes of the enemy, that <hi>Tilly</hi> who marched thitherward in Person to hinder the Passage, had not the fortune, either to beat the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of the Island, or to hinder them for making their Bridge; for his shot did little availe him, the <hi>Swedes</hi> being fenced by the point of the Island. Whereupon <hi>Tilly</hi> knowing the importance of the affaire, and the great difficulty, made a fierce and bloudy skirmish amidst the waters, which on the other side of the River might easily be waded over, for it came not to above a mans middle; but at last the <hi>Swedes</hi> prevailing, who incouraged by the comming of their King, strove who should first throw themselves upon the Bridge, they got unto the other Banke notwithstanding all the enemy could doe; there were slaine of the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholiques side about 2000, and <hi>Tilly</hi> himselfe being hurt with a shot from a Sachar, dyed within three dayes.

All the workes of this Generall were commended by the Souldier, and admired by the people; his very enemies not undervalluing him. The only thing that might fully his pious fame, was the cruelty and barbarousnesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his Souldiers at the taking of <hi>Newbrandeburg,</hi> and <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> which was such, as the <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves were scandalised at the report thereof; many were of opinion, that this his want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion cryed for vengeance from God Almighty, who is not pleased with cruelty though exercised against Infidels and Barbarians; and that the chastisement which useth to fall upon wise men, to wit, the infatuation of their wisedome, happened unto him, for that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for which in all his other actions he was admired, being suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by his too great daring, he came presumptuously to the Battaile of <hi>Leipsick,</hi> which was the break neck of all his glories; for had he therein carryed himselfe according to his wonted warinesse, many are of opinion he could not have missed the glory of happy successe; and for that one misfortune treads in the heels of an other, as though he had beene unwilling to out live this losse, he ended his life in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55221:45"/>
of glory, writing in Characters of his owne bloud to posterity, his eternity of merits from the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and pointing out unto them the way which leades generous mindes to immortallity. In <hi>Walesteines</hi> Court his death seemed rather to cause joy then sorrow, and this, for that all Courtiers, fawning or frowning as do their Lords, their Masters, knew that <hi>Walestein</hi> envying this warriers good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the renowne which by the Victories in so many Battailes he had wonne, loved not to see this great tree over-shadow the branches of his ambition; and the occasion hereof was, for that 'tis impossible for him to love the Servant that hates the Master; so <hi>Walesteine</hi> not caring for the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as suspecting that it was he who had perswaded the Emperour to take from him his former place and make use of <hi>Tilly,</hi> who was thought to be fitter then he for so great an employment, did no lesse despise and emulate the actions of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, then those of the Master.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> not thinking himselfe safe now in <hi>Monaco,</hi> the place of his residence, which was only walled about with old wals, conveyed speedily all his most pretious movables to <hi>Saltsborg,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Archbishop thereof, an Ecclesiasticall Prince, and one of the most potent and richest of all <hi>Germany</hi>; this City is seated in a pleasant Country upon the River <hi>Zalza,</hi> a Towne lately fortifyed with two Castles upon two hils which command the River on both sides: hee with the remainder of his Army did wisely retire himselfe to <hi>Ratisbone</hi> or <hi>Regenspurg,</hi> intending to secure that place, and to keep himselfe there; for the losse thereof would not be a little prejudiciall to him, it standing in the heart of his territories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this being a free City, and no lesse priviledged then the other <hi>Hauns</hi> Townes, and a good part of the Garrison thereof being Protestants, was by reason of the <hi>Swedes</hi> so many victories very unwilling to declare it selfe; it did not therefore condiscend to the entertaining of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> who had declared themselves enemies to the King, lest thereby they might pull the warre upon them, and by declaring themselves friends to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> publish themselves enemies to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were not farre off with their conquering Army; they therefore in a faire manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be excused by the Duke if they did not what he required of them; and that he might not be jealous of their loyalty, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to stand newters, and not to furnish the King with any thing, save what they could not chuse but grant him. But the Duke knew, that if the <hi>Swedes</hi> should possesse themselves of that City (which they might easily doe) they would not onely hinder the joyning of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Palatinate</hi> with <hi>Walesteine,</hi> but would againe open the passage for their inrodes into the rest of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to the no little prejudice of <hi>Ingolstat,</hi> the which being in the midst of the enemies Forts, ran danger of either being surprised by treachery, or enforced by some on-set to leane towards the <hi>Swedes,</hi> which would be the totall ruine of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> since it was the strongest key which shuts and opens the way to all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne invasions: so as since neither by his perswasions, nor by his promises, he could get them to open their gates, he resolved to try his wit; to which purpose holding intelligence by the meanes of a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55221:46"/>
Lieutenant of <hi>Lorreyne</hi> called <hi>Monseiur D'Erbois,</hi> with some Citizens and other Chiefes of the Country people of those parts, who had withdrawne themselves thither for feare of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> he agreed with them that the Court de Guard of the Gates being often-times by these men doubled, they should upon a night concluded on betweene them, and at which time they should have the custody of the Gate that opens towards <hi>Monaco,</hi> open the Gate and let him in. The bargaine was made and the desired end had: for the Count <hi>de Gratz</hi> who then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Chiefe all the Dukes Forces, sent 500 Horse and 2000 Foot thither in <hi>May,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>May.</hi>
               </note> who being let in, forced the Magistrates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though much against their will, to receive the Dukes Lawes.</p>
            <p>This was the condition of the warre, and these were the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the one and the other party; the King not failing to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his good fortune, nor the <hi>Austrians</hi> to fence those blowes which thundred upon them. When the foure moneths time being expired, wherein <hi>Walesteine</hi> had in some good sort re-inforced the Army, and put all things in order for his going into the field, the Court at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> seemed to be much appaid with the proceedings of so gallant a Commander, who had given so good a beginning to the resolutions which was conceived and hoped for, from his being Generall; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving some whimsie, were it either that he desired to be intreated, and to sell his service at a deere rate, or the more to advantage his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or out of some other extravagant and Capricious opinion, whereof he wanted not good store, hee was heard to say, that not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the Generals place, he was content to enjoy the repute of being a good Servant to his <hi>Caesarian</hi> Majesty, and that he had made himselfe knowne to be so. 'Twas therefore resolved that Prince <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenberg,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Cremismister</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienna</hi> should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be sent unto him, to worke him to accept of the absolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Emperours Forces: together with these, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> sent likewise Father <hi>Chiroga a Capuchen,</hi> a great wit, and who in his time was a wise Commander, to offer him 50000 Dollars a moneth in the name of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for maintenance of the Army, instead of the men that were promised and raised in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, which they now stood in need of in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to oppose the great Army of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which were upon their march to take <hi>Maestricht.</hi> This mans proffers and the others prayers, made him give way to their alleadged reasons, which were used more to flatter him, and to satisfy him, then that the businesse required it: for he much more desired the place, then the Emperour did to conferre it upon him; nay indeed, he feared to be excluded from it, by the well grounded reasons, which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State offered, which were alwayes averse to such a resolution as to conferre that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon him, the halfe whereof might have contented him: but necessity which is the glasse that dasels the eyes of the interest of States, shewed not the blurre that was in the forehead of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
            <p>And for that <hi>Walesteine</hi> knew, that in former times the greatest part of what had beene wonne in warre, and by the sweat of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55221:46"/>
had been conferred to the great dislike of the Souldier upon such as had never been of that profession; pretending hereby to be favourable to the Souldier, whose good liking he ambitiously cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he stood not onely to be declared Generall Independent, of all the Emperours and King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Forces in <hi>Germany,</hi> but to have a great stroake in the disposing of such goods as should be gotten; and therewithall at his pleasure to remunerate such as by their valour should have best deserved: a thought which rather arose from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of obliging the Souldier unto him, then out of any worthy cause which might incline him to it. He likewise desired, that no peace might be at any time treated of without his privity; hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to have these and some other articles subscribed, which though by reason of the urgent necessity were granted unto him, as likewise by the Counsels of some Lords who gloried much in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselves to be partiall on his side, upon whose greatnesse they grounded high hopes; yet could not the faithfull <hi>Austrians,</hi> and in particular the sincere <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are true lovers of their Masters greatnesse, forbear to murmure at the conferring of so great a power; and though they seemed outwardly to be pleased, yet were they much troubled, that they must confide in one whom formerly they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themselves to be diffident of, and of whom they ceased not yet to be jealous; as likewise that the Servant should be possest of the Masters authority. They said, that certainly <hi>Germany</hi> was very poor, if it had none other fit for the managing of such an Army; and what would become of them if he were not there? many such things as these they muttered; above all it was very hard to tollerate him, who growing every houre more ambitious, seemed to be offended with that imployment, which of right he should have petitioned for; and treated arrogantly with those, to whom in all respects he ought to have humbled himselfe; which shewed that by degrees he would pretend to give Lawes to <hi>Caesars</hi> selfe, and all his Councell. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> not well disgesting these things, and much offended with this Generall, could not free themselves of the distaste wherewith they were totally possest.</p>
            <p>The news of this mans being made Generall did much rejoyce the common-people, who incapable of the high mysteries of policy, feed themselves with such hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as sute best with their desires, seeming now almost to have lost all fear of sinister events. Thus every one out of their opinion of the witty extravagancies of this Commander, built Castles in the aire, and prognosticated such events as did better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a better genius: in particular many Counsellours and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of state look cheerfully hereupon, who had received much Gold from <hi>Walesteine,</hi> thinking that he continuing in his Command, they should be advanced to greater honours, credit, and authority. And to say truth, <hi>Walesteine</hi> brought businesses to a good passe, in that so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and threatening a time, wherein fortune would peradventure have beene more sparing to others; and if as he was wonderfull inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and in all his actions exceeding acute, and diligent, he had been endued with the vertue wherewith now adayes few men are, of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55221:47"/>
knowing himselfe, and resisting his owne affections by moderating his extravagancies, and suppressing his pride, he would not onely have wonne the love of his Lord and Master, (one of the most magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, religious, and mercifull Princes, that ever governed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) but would have brought even his competitors and enemies to have partaken of his service.</p>
            <p>Where Force availes not, 'tis good to have recourse to policy; an many times those things are brought to passe by wit, which were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired of by power; Therefore <hi>Walesteine</hi> being a great Polititian, and a wise negotiator, knowing that he wanted such Forces as hee could have desired, to encounter with an Army already inheartened by so many victories, and inrich't with Souldiers, whilest all men flocke to those Colours which are favoured by good successe, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his wit, how he might withdraw the Kings confederates from si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with him: good correspondency was held betweene him and the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> whil'st he waged warre against the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi>; and the Elector did in effect shew himselfe mindfull of many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which he had received from him then, when he Commanded in Chiefe the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Forces; for at the taking of <hi>Prage,</hi> he kept <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesteines</hi> well furnisht Palace, and all things belonging unto him, from being injured by the Souldiers; yet it was rumor'd that he did not this by the way of friendship, but out of Policy; to the end that by this way of partiall proceeding, the Emperour and his Court might have some jealousie of <hi>Walesteine</hi>; as likewise for that <hi>Harnem,</hi> who was trayned up in warre by <hi>Walesteine,</hi> commanded in Chiefe the Dukes Forces, keeping in memory the good discourses that had past between them; he was hereunto likewise perswaded by the means of a certain letter, written by the King somewhat too sharply to the Elector, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he blamed him of negligence in not advancing (whil'st he was victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in <hi>Bohemia</hi>) into <hi>Moravia,</hi> yea, even to the <hi>Danube,</hi> were it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hinder the new levies of men, which were made by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Officers in those parts. <hi>Walesteine</hi> laid this for his ground rule, that if he could remove this one Prince from his union with the King, not onely the <hi>Hauns</hi> Townes, but the greatest part of the chiefe men of the Empire would follow his example; a businesse of such importance, as it would not onely have made plaine the way to his designes, of beating backe the King, of establishing his owne great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in <hi>Germany,</hi> and of punishing his competitors: but finally he would have reduced the Army to his owne secret intent; which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my he wisely indeavoured to make depend on him, by conferring pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and imployments onely upon such as were affectionate to him. He bent his whole indeavours to effect this; and though he might first have regained <hi>Prage,</hi> yet went he not about it; but persevering in the satisfaction he had received from the Elector, he by the meanes of Count <hi>Adam Tersica,</hi> propounded a treaty of peace with <hi>Harnem,</hi> whereunto he by many promises invited him. But were it either to winne time, and afford the King scope enough to effect his desires in <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Swabenland,</hi> or that the Duke was not yet in condition to purchase his peace with the Emperour, upon so good tearms as hee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55221:47"/>
desired, or else for feare of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> he prolonged the negotiation, asking such things as were not to be granted him. <hi>Walesteine</hi> thought himselfe now in the Haven, and believed the more therein, for that he was more and more aware how the <hi>Saxons</hi> apprehending the <hi>Swedes</hi> growing to excessive greatnesse, did delay the taking of those places, which had they been solicitous they might have gotten, which shew'd they might easily be brought to disagreement; since Princes are not pleased with their neighbours too much greatnesse, as likewise that by judiciall Astrology, (which he studied very much, spending every day some time in it, and keeping alwayes some famous Astrologers about him) he found out some Starre which shewed to be propitious unto him; he therefore bent himselfe wholly hereupon, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to bribe <hi>Harnem</hi> and other of the Dukes Ministers of state and Officers by rich gifts.</p>
            <p>The Treaty was by all meanes indeavoured to be brought to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, and <hi>Walesteine</hi> this meane while kept himselfe in <hi>Moravia,</hi> that he might not by the moving of his Forces give jealousie to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who having (as it may be said) forgotten warre, enjoyed the delights of peace, where they were quartered in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Many were of opinion, that the Electour did this to afford <hi>Walesteine</hi> time to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Emperours patrimoniall estate, against the <hi>Swedes,</hi> whose proceedings were by this time growne to an high eminency, as the Princes of the Empire ought rather to have desired them moderated, then foment them yet to a greater height; as also not to disturbe the businesse which was fairly proceeded in with <hi>Harnem</hi>: when at the same time the League was openly ratified in Court, between the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> the Duke having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been some-what doubtfull therein. This was attributed to the distaste the Duke tooke, to see <hi>Walesteine</hi> re-assumed to the Generalls place, contrary to the good rule of government, which teacheth no more to trust in him, by whom we have once thought our selves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; fearing perhaps lest he likewise might receive some prejudice by the ambition of <hi>Walesteine,</hi> who did not much affect the Dukes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: others would mutter, that this was occasioned by the promises of the <hi>French,</hi> who would have brought him to conformity with <hi>Swethland</hi>; and at the same time his highnesse's demand of succour was propounded to <hi>Walesteine,</hi> who after having first suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be much intreated thereunto, (so very vain-glorious was hee) to boot with sending <hi>Aldringer</hi> to joyne with the said Duke, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sent him for his re-inforcement, the Horse of the Grand <hi>Prior Aldobrandini,</hi> of the young <hi>Colloredo,</hi> of <hi>Maracini,</hi> and one Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Isolini</hi> his Crabats; commanding them notwithstanding not to make too much haste, either for that he desired <hi>Bavaria</hi> should be totally ruinated, or for that if the <hi>Bavarians</hi> should have the better, the glory might not be attributed to them, (which he alone coveted) or for that he liked not his men should be consumed so farre from where he commanded; for being onely intent how to effect his own designes with ease, he cared not upon what disadvantage he put others, the workes of a proud and cruell man.</p>

<q>That a King who puts himselfe in Armes must not dreame of Court-delights and safety; that death ought alwayes then to be esteemed deare, and cherished, when it gives life to honour, and is advantagious to the publicke; that Masters commands are never better obeyed then in their owne presence.</q>
Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after this stayed some dayes about the City, he resolved to leave certaine Regiments there to hinder the Garrison from making such sallies as they might doe upon his neighbouring Quarters: and that he might linger no longer before a Fort, the situation wherof gave him no hopes of effecting his desire, he marched with his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Landshut,</hi> a place of some moment in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> seated upon the River <hi>Iser</hi> in the bosome of the two Rivers, <hi>Danube</hi> and <hi>Inn,</hi> which not being prepared for defence, and having in it a timorous people, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it selfe at the first Cannot shot. And after this, having taken <hi>Morsperg</hi> not farre from the mouth of <hi>Iser</hi> and <hi>Amber,</hi> he came before <hi>Monaco,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Dukes Seat; a faire and great City but weakly fenced; the Magistrate whereof finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe not in a condition to contest, sent twelve of the chiefe of the City to throw themselves before the Kings feet, and to desire a treaty for suspension of Armes; but this being by the King denied, who would not receive it upon any other tearmes then upon discretion, it behoved him at last to doe as was desired: And the King not having forgot the bloud that was shed by <hi>Tillies</hi> men at <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> where the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were almost all put to the sword, and their houses burnt; And this being attributed to the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> though (as it hath been said) it fell out by reason of the fire which tooke in a Drugsters house; the King I say taking occasion under this pretence to make the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of warre seeme lesse terrible to those people,<note place="margin">

               </note> who not having till now made any tryall thereof, could not well disgest them; and that he might have an occasion to make himselfe be esteemed mercifull, and consequently their evils appeare lesse to these Citizens (for a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe though great, becomes a consolation, when thereby a greater, which is near at hand, is prevented) he commanded, that in revenge of the aforesaid slaughter at <hi>Magdeburg, Monaco</hi> should be set on fire; the which the Citizens having notice of, and all of them striving who should first throw themselves before the Kings feet, they begg'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of him, alleadging they were not in any blame of what the Souldiers had mischievously done, for that their whole life was spent in traffique and civill affaires: at these lamentations and teares the King suffered himselfe soone to be entreated, his intentions being not to ruinate and destroy, but to preserve and restore; he recalled his direction, nor was there any fire seene but in Kitchens, to make good cheer for the Souldiers; and in the Minthouse where 12000 <hi>l.</hi> in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

was coyned to bestow as a donative or contribution upon the Souldier. Many religious people came likewise before the King to entreat safety of him; for being more than others enemies to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, they feared to be more injured then others by them; yet were they better received then they imagined; and in particular the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins</hi> were better satisfied then the rest: for the King caused some Almes to be given them, and commended their Religion and life, as honest and good; and though one of them had the boldnesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him of the errour wherein he lived, and to exhort him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as other his forefathers had done, hee seemed not to be offended at him, but to make good esteem of him.</p>

               <hi>Walesteines</hi> arrivall at <hi>Pilsen</hi> with so great an Army, govern'd by so brave Commanders, and so well provided with all things necessary, did not onely amuse the King but all the Protestants, who thought the <hi>Austrians</hi> would never have been able to have assembled so many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in so short a time; but above all it troubled the State of <hi>Nuren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> who by its declaring it selfe in the behalfe of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the <hi>Imperialists</hi>; and the riches thereof provoked the Souldier to thinke upon revenge: they therefore hoping in some sort to allay the ill will the <hi>Austrians</hi> might beare them, by sending to collogue with <hi>Walesteine,</hi> acknowledging him to be the Emperours Generall, and acquainting him with the reasons which moved them to declare themselves friends to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> those foure Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who came to <hi>Pilsen</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi>

               </note> to congratulate the said Generall; but they met with so strange an entertainment, as well shewed how capricious the giver thereof was; for at their arivall <hi>Walesteine</hi> gave order that they should be met in great Pompe, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours of the greatest Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>; that they should be discharged at the publique cost, and received with such honour as is wont to be used at publique magnificencies: he afterwards put off their audience for six dayes, and at last when they came before him with their letters of credence which they presented him withall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expounding their Embassy, he welcomming them in all honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner, and receiving them with much appearing courtesie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the letter from their hands, which before he had read through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, he answered; hee was very well informed of their Embassy, that he would come himselfe in person to give them his Answer, and that he should then know, whither the effects were answerable to the handsome expressions of their letter; and so without more Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dismist them. Whereat the Commissioners being much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext, much made on by all, and better attended then before, returned home. The Novelty hereof being knowne in the Camp, and in the Court, past not without some curious discussions; some thought that <hi>Walesteine</hi> had done a memorable act, and that he could not doe better; they said such were not to be pardoned who driven thereunto by feare, beg it, but that they deserved punishment, who had forsaken their formerly sworne allegeance; and that chastisement was the true looking-glasse for wicked men: from thence he dispatched away Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell

               <hi>Spor</hi> a confident friend of <hi>Harnems,</hi> and made 50000 Dollers be delivered out unto him, and other Regalities, thereby to dazle the eyes of such difficulties as he should meet withall, and to re-assume the new Treaty of this accommodation, wherewithall he was much troubled by breaking off the diversion of this peace, his ends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remaine himselfe alone the sole Commander of all the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Forces in <hi>Germany</hi> against the <hi>Swedes</hi>; but the Treaty being prolonged and nothing therein concluded hee determined to march forward; hee therefore mustered his Army at <hi>Raconick,</hi> a place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pilsen</hi> and <hi>Prage,</hi> wherein he found 214 Cornets of Horse, all well in order, 120 Companies of Foot, 44 pieces of Cannon, and two thousand Carriages well furnished; and having his head full of whimsies, and being a great observer of punctuality, he would here make knowne his Commands how he intended to be served: hee ordained that every one should weare a red Scarfe, forbidding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colours upon paine of life, (for hee could not punish any the smalest fault, but either by the Gallowes or by the Pillory.) I cannot herein passe by an accident, which befell a Captaine of the Artillery, who having upon him a rich Scarfe embroydered with Gold, when he first heard this order, tore it from about his necke, and treading it under his feet, shewed his ready inclination to obey his Commands; wherewithall the Generall being well pleased, he received such reward as is used to proceed from satisfaction; for hee was soon after made a Colonell, taken into his good opinion, and made his Copartner. By this example he made the rest readier to serve him, as having means to oblige them unto him: and the more to secure his own Command, and holding it a good rule in policy, to keep his Souldiers and Officers in obedience, he gave Command under paine of his displeasure, that no Souldier, Captaine, Officer, or Colonell whatsoever of Foot, should weare any bootes or spurres; as on the contrary he forbad the Horse Souldiers and Officers to go at any time without them: he imposed such punctuall silence in his Court, and more particularly about his owne lodgings, as he would not have one thereabouts raise their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces higher then he would doe if he were in a Church, which was du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed by all, yea of the chiefest Commanders; and this respect given unto him was grown unto that hight, that lest they should make a noise with the rowels of their spurres, they fastened them with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle buckles. 'Tis said he did this that he might be the more dreaded, for he was so over-Mastered with ambition, as that no Prince in our age was ever knowne to covet so much respect, or to have it observed towards him, as this man did and had. Hee having given these and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directions to his Army, boldly came before <hi>Prage,</hi> and the very first night surrounded it with his Horse, commanding <hi>Gallasse</hi> to set upon it on the side of Mount <hi>St. Laurence,</hi> and the Marquesse of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> on the <hi>Capuchins</hi> side. <hi>Gallasse</hi> upon the breake of day played upon the Wals with eight piece of Cannon, whereby in a short time a breach being made (the Wals being but old and weak) a certain hour was appointed to give the assault, but the Souldiers of Count <hi>Bartal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe Wallesteines</hi> Regiment at the first making of the breach, before the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55221:50"/>
houre appointed for entrance was come, without any directions from the Generall, being desirous to shew their courage, (and thereby to purchase such reward from <hi>Walesteine,</hi> as he used to bestow upon the valliant,) fell with such violence upon the breach, as they by maine force wonne it, and without any withstanding entred the City; for the <hi>Saxons</hi> knowing it impossible to defend so weake wals, had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne themselves into the Palace Royall, which commands the little City; the Marquesse of <hi>Grana</hi> did the like on the other side, so as the <hi>Saxons</hi> dispairing of defence resolved to parle, the which <hi>Wale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine</hi> being acquainted withall, he gave the charge of the Treaty to the said Marquesse, as being very fit for that imployment, who did mannage it with great advantage, and concluded it with honour; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging the besieged to come forth of the Towne, barely with the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their lives: but <hi>Walesteine</hi> were it either that he would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Elector of Saxony with courtesie, and so sweeten any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that might hinder the accommodation, or else to requite the honour he received, in having his Pallace kept in that City untou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, gave the Souldiers their Armes, and moreover their Baggage; (which being the most part booty, they had formerly got, was worth about 100000 Dollers) and made them all, (who were about 4000) be safely conducted to <hi>Letomeritz,</hi> where the <hi>Saxon</hi> Army was quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The <hi>Imperialists</hi> Souldiers at their entry sack't that part which is called <hi>Ofeinstat,</hi> or the little City, at which the Popish Inhabitants murmured; since that the new and old City, inhabited for the most part by Protestants, and Jewes, by the Contribution of certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies kept themselves from the insolency of the Souldiers, the like would notwithstanding have befallen them, if the Towne had beene set upon on their side; and if the Souldiers could have entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by force, but their wals and the River saved them, and afforded them time to make agreement. <hi>Prage</hi> is in the Kingdome of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> whereof it is the Metropolis, it is a large and lovely City, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three parts, two of them on this side <hi>Molda</hi> called the new and old City, and the other on the backe of the Mount <hi>St. Laurence,</hi> called the little City; this City formerly in peacefull times was full of people, and had in it store of strangers, for that many Emperours had kept their Court there: the Wals are of bricke after the ancient manner; it is not defenceable against an enemies Army, unlesse it be defended by another Army without. Here <hi>Walesteine</hi> resolved to stay some time, as well to agree what he should next go about, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume the Treaty of peace.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Prage</hi> and other Townes in <hi>Bohemia</hi> did not more rejoyce the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> then it did <hi>Walesteine's</hi> selfe; who thinking it would be a sufficient argument to perswade the Elector to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace, upon which his minde was wholly bent; hee resolved to send againe to <hi>Harnem,</hi> who was in <hi>Letomeritz,</hi> a City lying upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Bohemia</hi> towards <hi>Saxony,</hi> and where the Electors Forces then were, observing the <hi>Imperialists</hi> proceedings, and to desire him to put a good end to the peace that was propounded; he accompanied this message with new offers &amp; promises, which though
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55221:51"/>
they were very efficacious, yet were they not sufficient to draw the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector into his trap; but the Treaty did every day seeme farther off then other: <hi>Walesteine</hi> therefore marched againe with his Army, resolving upon the Electors utter ruine: and <hi>Egra</hi> remaining on the part towards the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> neere the River <hi>Ros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> with certaine Forces to take them in, the which he easily did; for they wanted Munition and other things, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to defend themselves against so great an Army. <hi>Walesteines</hi> selfe marched towards <hi>Letomerits,</hi> and finding the <hi>Saxons</hi> removed from thence, he passed over the <hi>Elb,</hi> and made a hault about <hi>Melnick,</hi> a wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Towne upon the same River; where after many skirmishes had past between his Crabats and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Horse, (wherein the <hi>Saxons</hi> came off alwayes with the worst,) hee againe propounded the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of agreement with the Duke, and seemed much grieved at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, for that the totall ruine of the <hi>Swedes</hi> depended upon this peace. For the Frontiers of <hi>Bohemia</hi> being secured on this side, and the Souldiers who did defend those Frontiers being joyned to his men, and his Army doubled by the Electours Forces, he would not onely have exceeded the <hi>Swedes</hi> in numbers, sufficient to drive him out of the field, but consequently the greatest part of the Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, who were in League with the King, following such an example, might take such courses as they should thinke fittest for them.</p>
            <p>Hee againe sent Colonell <hi>Spor</hi> with new donatives, and larger of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, who though he used his best discretion in mannaging the affaire, yet was he as formerly entertained, onely with words and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so as he dispaired of effects: for the King being advertised of <hi>Walesteines</hi> proceedings, and how he intended to invade <hi>Saxony,</hi> which he had promised as a reward unto his Souldiers; and fearing lest the Elector being pursued by the <hi>Austrians,</hi> might finde some pretence to breake his word, and comply with the Emperour, (which would have beene much to his prejudice) was already parted from <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and was come with all his Army neere <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> resolving to set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Imperialists</hi> both Flanke and Back, when they should be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in <hi>Misna</hi> or <hi>Saxony.</hi>

            <p>Whilest these things went thus on, <hi>Aldringer</hi> was informed of the Kings being marched towards the upper Palatinat, and of his going towards <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> wherefore in obedience to <hi>Walesteines</hi> orders he rose with his Army from before <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> that he might joyne with him, since any longer abode there might have made much to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice: for the <hi>Swedes</hi> getting further footing in the Palatinate, and thereby hindring his joyning with <hi>Walesteine,</hi> and consequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the benefit of the Field, the Roman Catholiques would be removed from their attempt upon <hi>Nurenberg:</hi> moreover, since it behoved the <hi>Bavarians</hi> to tarry in their owne Territories beyond the <hi>Danube,</hi> for that the other part wanted Forradge, the <hi>Swedes</hi> might the easier prejudice the Imperiall Army; so as fearing lost he might be hindred in his march by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> he hastened his pace, coasting along <hi>Newcost, Amburg,</hi> and <hi>Weiden,</hi> places walled about after the ancient manner, yet chiefe Townes in the upper Palatinat.</p>

The <hi>Swedes</hi> could not march so fast, as to come up to the <hi>Romanists,</hi> for it behoved them to march circumspectly, lest they might fall into the <hi>Imperialists</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes, who were already increased by some Regiments of Horse: and lest all these retiring themselves towards the grosse of <hi>Walesteines</hi> Army, should have leasure to joyne together, and force the King to retreat, all that succeeded herein, was some incounters between the Crabats, and some Troopes of the Swedish Horse, wherein the <hi>Swedes</hi> had the worst.</p>

               <hi>Walesteine</hi> being now come to <hi>Egra,</hi> and certified of the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, whereby he foresaw his designes, seeing withall the <hi>Bavari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Army neer at hand: and <hi>Elnbogen</hi> having surrendred it selfe for want of Munition, to <hi>Holca,</hi> sent that very night his Horse to backe the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and was himselfe by the breake of day on the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> at <hi>Lutitz,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iune.</hi> 18.</note> a Towne upon the Confines of the upper <hi>Palatinat,</hi> not farre from <hi>Egra</hi>; where meeting with his Highnesse of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complements past between them, (though <hi>Walesteines</hi> countenance agreed not with his heart, which agitated with intestive passion, with the ashes of simulation, hid that fire which hatched in his minde an unextinguishable combustion to the interest of that Prince.)</p>
            <p>The King not being able to hinder the joyning of the <hi>Romanists</hi> Armies, nor yet to relieve <hi>Elnbogen,</hi> withdrew himselfe under <hi>Nuren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> (one of the chiefe and richest Cities of the Empire,) which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were in the bosome of <hi>Germany,</hi> between <hi>Franconia,</hi> the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinat,</hi> and <hi>Swabenland,</hi> having the River <hi>Pegnits</hi> running through it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which there are many Bridges built, joyning the two sides of the City in an opulent Country, invironed every where about with fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full territories, abounds very much with all things requisite for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane sustenance; and is so populous by reason of the multiplicity of handycrafts, which are in better perfection there, then elsewhere, as it is not out-done by any other City in <hi>Germany. Nurenberg</hi> is eight miles in compasse, and is doubly walled and ditched, according to the ancient mode; the government thereof is Aristocraticall, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat thereof being composed of 24 ancient Families, out of which 26 are chosen who governe. This Towne made much for the Kings advantage, for he received from thence continuall refreshments, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55221:53"/>
Ammunition for his Army, and berest the <hi>Imperialists</hi> of their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, as likewise he thereby kept himselfe from the hazard of a Battaile, with fresh and numerous men, and did also preserve that communalty from the <hi>Austrians</hi> resolution, of giving it in prey unto the Souldier, and serving it with the same sawce as they had done <hi>Magdeburg</hi>; and if this prime Towne, and divers of the rest, had seen themselves abandoned, they would soone have indeavoured a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement with the Emperour, changing their love of the <hi>Swedes</hi> into hatred; since the friendship and correspondency of Princes, and more particularly of Republiques indure no longer, then their owne requisite interest indures, and their hopes that by the friendship of others they may advantage themselves, and fence themselves from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injured by the more potent. There were some notwithstanding who were capable of reason, that thought the King did this to detaine the <hi>Romanists</hi> Army, and make them perish for hunger, in a Country unpeopled, and rendred waste; and the rather for that a contagious disease broke forth amongst them, called the <hi>Hungarian</hi> disease, which being begot in the Emperours Army, was no small dammage unto them, which would not onely have been very advantagious to the King, he having already had sufficient Provisions from the City: But that which was thought to be the basis of this affaire was, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating the Duke of <hi>Weymars</hi> affaires at this time in <hi>Swabenland</hi> and <hi>Tiroll,</hi> and the like of <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and of other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders elsewere; to hinder whose proceedings <hi>Walesteine</hi> must have much dismembred his Army, or else quitting his resolution of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Nurenburg,</hi> turne himselfe thither where he thought his Masters dominions stood in most need of defence, or else leave those Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to their fortune, and to the Swedish Armies. The King began then to fortifie his Camp in so advantagious a place, as that nothing could be thereby judged, but that he meant to keep within those rampiers some time; there were some others, notwithstanding who thinking they knew the Kings minde, were of opinion, that he did this to the end he might play a safe game, and not hazard all that he had wonne with so much labour and expence of so much time upon one daies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and that his ends were to keep <hi>Walesteine</hi> all the summer about that Towne, and his new men in continuall sufferings, they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accustomed to hunger, against which they could not be provided so easily as they desired, being so farre from those opulent Countries; and then in the midst of winter to endammage them more by the hardnesse of the season, (which the <hi>Swedes</hi> could better indure being bred up in the most frozen Northerne parts) and the incommodity of their incamping, then by his sword. But the truth was, that the King not believing a beaten Army could like <hi>Antaus</hi> grow the stronger, thought that being herein deceaved, he might meet with the like difficulties in the sequell; and finding himselfe amisse in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which he maintained against those who had told him, that <hi>Walesteine</hi> had given order for an appearance in the field with 40000 Souldiers; after this experiment he was heard to say, that the house of <hi>Austria</hi> was so mighty a monarchy, as that he himselfe had seen that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55221:53"/>
effected by it, which he thought had been impossible</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walesteine</hi> having spoken with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and their Forces being united, (after many consultations held how they were to behave themselves in the future Battaile) being informed of the Kings approach neer <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> and of the deep Trench wherewith he had fortifyed his Army, they thought that to be true which they had been told by many, to wit, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> being very weak, durst no more scoure the Country over as they had wont; and thinking that by their numerous Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might be able on all sides to invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and to hinder their succours from <hi>Franconia, Swaben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> (bringing them consequently to the point of not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ishing their men, but of destroying their horses (wherein their greatest strength consisted) by hindering them of forrage they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to march towards them. They therefore raised their Tents from the quarters they had taken up, and in good order marched towards <hi>Neuburg,</hi> a walled Towne seated upon the bankes of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Schwartza,</hi> belonging to the jurisdiction of the upper <hi>Palatinat,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Neumarck,</hi> a Towne of the said Province seated upon the <hi>Sultz,</hi> and lastly too within sight of <hi>Nurenberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Imperialists</hi> Army being come to <hi>Freistat, Walesteine</hi> made there a generall Muster, where were found 314 Cornets of Horse, 210 Ensignes of Foot, 70 piece of Cannon, and 4000 well furnisht Wagons. His Highnesse of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and <hi>Aldringer</hi> marched in the Van; the Battaile fell to <hi>Gallusse</hi> his share, and <hi>Walesteine</hi> brought up the Rear; in which order they marched too within sight of the City, scouring the Country with their Crabats and Dragoons; the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists</hi> were saluted with above 600 Cannon-shot from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who made divers sallies out upon them, but came alwayes off with losse; for the <hi>Austrians</hi> Horse behaved themselves so gallantly, as that the <hi>Swedes</hi> durst not almost stirre out any more from their Trenches, so as it was impossible to hinder the <hi>Romanists</hi> from making their Trenches, which were in short time perfected, and wherein were lodged their Horse and Foot.</p>
            <p>But it must not be omitted, that as the <hi>Imperialists</hi> marched from <hi>Neumar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k</hi> to <hi>Freistat, Walesteine</hi> being in the Reare, as hee marched through a wood, between these two Townes in his Coach, 'twas said a Harquebusse was discharged at him, which hit behinde the Coach, but did not hurt him: this accident though very considerable, was busht up, and no inquiry made into it; but the little that was known thereof, fell from the mouth of <hi>Tersica,</hi> who shared in the danger, and from those that followed the Coach, who said that this was a plot of some of his enemies, so to kill him, whose life was a dangerous rocke to their designes; but those that understood more were of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering opinions, some said it was a chance-shot, made by some of his owne Souldiers, who discharging their Muskets for pleasure, doe many times without thinking of it, shoot one another, and this was the likelyest to be true; others conceived this to be a piece of <hi>Walesteines</hi> cunning, to make the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> believe, he ran great danger for serving the Emperour faithfully, and thereby to inhance
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55221:54"/>
his merit with his Master, and to exalt his owne fame, which might appeare to be so much the greater in being attempted against; others (and with more appearance of reason) thought this report to be false, and spread abroad onely to know what men thought of him; for <hi>Walesteine</hi> was therein very inquisitive, and would often afford discourse thereof to others.</p>
            <p>Whil'st the <hi>Imperialists</hi> labour to strengthen their Camp, the King kept within his Trenches; making notwithstanding continuall excursions with his Horse, and skirmishes, to know the <hi>Caesarians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; who haulting here, pitched their Camp in sight of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, with whom they had divers actions, wherein sometimes the one, sometimes the other had the better. The <hi>Imperialists</hi> took divers Villages wherein they quartered part of their Horse, sacking many Townes formerly forsaken by the Inhabitants; for upon the newes of the <hi>Caesarians</hi> march, every country-fellow provided for his safety; amongst the rest <hi>Allerspurg,</hi> a Towne neere <hi>Freistat,</hi> was insolently visited by some Troopes of <hi>Hungarian</hi> Horse, a Nation more severe and lesse compassionate then many others; yet were they requited for their extortions; for being closely pursued by 2000 Swedish Horse, about 200 of them were slaine, and some of them who were taken prisoners for the reward of their barbarousnesse were paid with the Gallowes.</p>
            <p>Plundering, Ambushes, and beating up of Quarters, was dayly used by both these Armies; when the King seeing how much he was molested by the frequent incursions of the Crabats, (whom <hi>Walesteine</hi> had commanded to disturbe the Swedish Camp, by giving them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall alarums, that so they might weary out the Swedish Horse,) which being armed and kept in continuall motion, did with little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage consume away of themselves: for when the <hi>Swedes</hi> came forth to Charge them, they having their Horses ready saved themselves by flight; the King, I say, much incensed at these people, by whom his Camp was more incommodated then by all the rest, resolved to use what possible diligence he could to rid himselfe of this trouble. Hee commanded therefore that the out-guards should be re-inforced with fresh Horse, and that amongst these many Dragoons and Musketiers should be mingled, who lying in fit ambushes should waite the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Crabats; and when they were within Musket-shot, give fire upon them, and that then the Horse-Squadrons opening should inviron them, this was more then once done to good purpose, so as the Kings quarters were not so much troubled, for the Crabats being thus aware of their too much forwardnesse, were not so apt to let loose their horse reynes.</p>
            <p>These Dragoones are Musketiers on horse-back, who are pick't out men, strong, and couragious; for the continuall duties which they are put unto, requires they should be such; their office is to backe the grosse body of the Horse, and upon occasion to light from horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, possesse themselves of the most advantagious places, and play upon the enemy with their Muskets, which if they shall not be able to doe, they getting on horseback may easily retire themselves to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55221:54"/>
grosse of their Army; these are sent upon convoyes, are imployed in making of ambushes speedily, in surprising fitting passes, in cleering waies, assailing Forts, and in doing all things which are requisite in the mannaging of Armes; they for the most part serve with Foot Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; they carry their match lighted tyed to a cloven sticke, which is fastened to the headstall of their horse; they have short swords, and a little Axe hanging at their girdles to cut wood, break downe Pallisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and to do other occurrences: this is a new sort of Militia, and of late usage in the last warres of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hath shewed it to be of great use: some will have <hi>Ernestus</hi> Count <hi>Mansfeild</hi> to be the first inventer thereof, who fighting against the Emperour, (being an exile) and having no permanent place of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, horst his Foot, that he might the more readily march whither hee would.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walesteine</hi> being advertised that some Carriages of Ammunition were comming from <hi>Herbipoli</hi> to the Kings Camp, not thinking it fit to let them passe, resolved to bereave the enemy of this supply, and to relieve his owne men therewithall; hee gave the charge hereof to Colonell <hi>Spor,</hi> one much verst in warre, to whom he to that purpose allotted some Regiments of Curassiers, Dragoones, and Crabats. This, <hi>Spor</hi> put readily in execution, chasing some scouts backe to the King, taking some prisoners, and others saved themselves from the <hi>Imperialists</hi> in the woods. <hi>Spor</hi> not knowing that any of them were fled away, for the wary prisoners affirmed unanimously that there was no more in their company, pursued the enterprise, and ordered his ambush, weighting for the comming of the <hi>Swedes</hi>; but the King having advertisement hereof, presently doubled his ambush, which <hi>Spor</hi> was not aware of, so as he was retiring to his quarters (for seeing no more <hi>Swedes</hi> appeare, he feared they had had information) he sell upon the Kings ambush, which handled him very sorely, few of his men escaping away by flight, he himselfe being taken Prisoner, and the Marquesse of <hi>Gonsagas</hi> Regiment (who valiantly maintained the brunt) had much adoe to retreat. <hi>Issolani</hi> (he who by continuall and briske skirmishes afflicted the <hi>Swedes,</hi> (whereby he had not onely wonne credit to that Nation, which was therefore tearmed the <hi>Swedes</hi> scourge, but advantaged himselfe thereby, (for <hi>Walesteine</hi> (who was a bountifull Prince, and prodigall to brave and couragious Souldiers) had presented him with 4000 Dollers, and a gallant horse) knowing that the Kings new way of waging warre had prejudiced their fencing, and being much incensed at the routing of his <hi>Hungarians</hi> at <hi>Aller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spurg,</hi> at the late businesse of <hi>Spor,</hi> and in other incounters.) went with 1000 Horse into the fields, and resolutely fell upon some of the Kings Squadrons, broke them, kill'd about 300 of them, and much to his content, brought <hi>Walesteine</hi> two of the enenies Horse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derds; and (for that reward given by the Prince unto the Souldier is a great provocation to good service, and the true bond whereby to keep fast the obsequious affection of Commanders) he was brought to the quarters of Gount <hi>Michenea,</hi> Commissary-generall of the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sarian</hi> Army, to be congratulated (according to the <hi>German</hi> fashion)
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55221:55"/>
by viands and wine for this his service: where passing from healths to play, he lost well nigh all the reward given him by <hi>Walesteine,</hi> when during his play he was againe presented by <hi>Walesteine</hi> with 2000 whereupon being restored to what he had lost, and leaving play, hee immediatly went to Court, where being told by the Generall, that a Convoy of the enemies were upon their march from <hi>Erbipoli,</hi> hee without replying (for <hi>Walesteine</hi> loved to be so dealt withall) lept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his saddle, went towards them, and meeting with the enemies Horse, after a fight stoutly made good by both sides, the Crabats at last prevailed, &amp; having slaine about 200 <hi>Swedes,</hi> hurt many others, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many prisoners, they came backe to their quarters, with three Cornets, where meat was provided for those Souldiers, whereby they were well refreshed, who were before well-nigh famished.</p>
            <p>I thought good to commemorate this act of <hi>Walesteines</hi> liberallity, to the end that by his example, it may be knowne of what force a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals generosity is with his Souldiers, and that though <hi>Walesteine</hi> was held for strangely extravagant, insomuch as many thought all his actions had a tang of madnesse, yet for what belonged to a Worthy, he was a man of most eminent vertue: all his actions leaned upon the deepest mysteries of experimentall policy, upon which occasions me-thinkes I should not omit any thing, though if I should relate all, my story would be nothing but the recounting of his magnanimous acts. He was prodigall in his rewards, and severe in his punishments; and as his gifts did alwayes exceed thousands of Crownes, so were his punishments seldome or never lesse then death: He who thought himselfe to be no ordinary Prince, and to have a more then generous heart, neither knew how, neither would reward vertue and fidelity with small recompence, and therefore he had wont to say,
<q>that the worth and service of a Souldier was to be esteemed so great and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, by how great the price was wherewith it was recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and by how great estimation was put thereon; and that he that thought to be served good cheap, had but cheap service done him; for the reward of a thing ought to be answerable to the worth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</q>
Vertue was therefore cherished and much made of in his Court, insomuch as every one indeavoured to go thither fraughted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, as much as he could; just as Merchants doe, who carry their merchandise thither where they have the best vent; and therefore he never rewarded any man poorly; and herein I must not forget an act of magnificence used by him to an Astrologer. <hi>Walesteine</hi> was so gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to affect judiciall Astrology, as that he governed all his actions, as if it were by the influence thereof; undertaking businesse then, when he seemed to be seconded by propitious Starres, and forbearing any action when he discovered an averse constellation; and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely such in the charge of his Army, at whose nativity the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets seemed to be well inclined, and to whom they promised good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in warre. He being informed that there was a <hi>Genovesse</hi> in <hi>Vienna,</hi> named <hi>Iohn Baptista Seni,</hi> a professor in that learning, who had foretold many things that had accordingly succeeded, sent <hi>Iohn Peroni</hi> (a Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine, who was very inward with him) to bring him to his service,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55221:55"/>
which hee did agreeing with him for a pension of 25 Duckets a Month, at which <hi>Walestein</hi> being offended, he sharply reprehended the said <hi>Peroni,</hi> for having brought a vertuous or man of worth, to serve him for so small wages,
<q>saying, you <hi>Florentines</hi> had best exercise those your good husbandries with <hi>Italians,</hi> and not with me; who abhor to have the learned at so cheap a rate.</q>
So great a friend was hee to unaccustomed greatnesse; hee gave order hee should have forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with paid unto him for his journy, (which was but ten Dutch Leagues) 400 Dollers, and that he should be furnished with a Coach and six Horses, and gave unto him a stipend of 2000 Crownes a year to be paid him before hand, his Coach and all other requisites being maintained to his hand. He so inamored all men with these his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous actions, as it was noted he had got unto him the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous men in all sciences that our age produced: and many a privat Souldier for doing some one remarkable act, hath been by him in one day preferred to a Captaines place, and they have had monies assigned unto them sufficient to maintaine them in that dignity; wherby hee did not onely make those observant of him, who were so raised by him, but did by their examples attract others out of hopes of faring alike; so as all his Souldiers strove who should most please him, by their worthes and valours, not by flatteries, and other indirect meanes, whereby the good will of many in these corrupt times are wonne. By equall rewarding valour he allayd the pretensions of such as were of great birth, wonne the good will of the people, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king those his favourites who had particular dependency upon him, he made himselfe be the more reverenced, and bridled the ambition of great personages; for to conferre favours onely upon such as are nobly discended, makes the meaner sort dispaire.
<q>To this purpose he had wont to say, that worth and vallour did not consist in a spruce-beard, in a well-ordered head of haire, nor yet in titles of birth and greatnesse, but in a dauntlesse spirit and ready hand.</q>
Hee perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly detested Ceremonies and feigned Complements, too much used now adayes in Courts: and therefore he had wont to laugh at those who would bow too low and cringe unto him, and mocking them would say,
<q>this would do well at <hi>Rome,</hi> where a man may catch a cold with standing an houre bareheaded with his hat in his hand, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Indeed Sir it shall be yours.</q>
Hee also liked not many words u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Lords or other novices in warre, in the proffering of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, insomuch as at last he denyed to give audience to any such; let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them know that valiant and faithfull actions, were the meanes whereby to please a Prince, and that thererefore in their service they shoud testifie their valour, which would be the most pleasing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit they could make to him: yet failed he not to make his Officers welcome all forreigne Cavaliers with much civillity, and to reward their good service. Neither did he this so much for the aforesaid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as for that he very well knew how great an enemy familiarity is to respect, and particularly in his case, who having formerly had much acquaintance and many comerades, who thought themselves therein now to be happy, he could not but say,
<q>that domesticke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55221:56"/>
cancelling respect, did detract from the splendor of his place, and from such observance as his eminency required: and that he had rather his commands should be observed by his Officers, as Counsels, then as orders of his power.</q>
He severely punished e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very least default, which though it got him the name of cruell, yet he valued it not,
<q>saying, this was the true way not to mischiefe his men; for he who saw a small fault punisht, would the more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the punishment of a greater; and this feare becomming the rudder whereby the ship of their actions was steered, kept the course therof streight upon the Haven of obedience and of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters favour:</q>
he caused one that waited on him in his Chamber to be hang'd for waking him contrary to his order; he banished a Souldier out of his Army for having no bootes on: this his severity seemed to many to be tyrannicall, and barbarous cruelty, but in the hidden se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his maximes 'twas found to be a discreet piece of wisedome: for such events were the Trumpets which banish't Cowards from his Camp, and was so wholsome an electuary to the fearefull, as many lest they should meet with death through their owne negligence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hardy, and one feare drove out another: yet did he moderate this bitternesse of his government by the sweet of his rewards, of the which he was as liberall, as he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall of punishment.</p>

            <p>Whil'st <hi>Weymar</hi> was intent upon this affair he received a redoubled Command from the King, that all other businesse whatsoever set aside he should come with all his Forces to <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> so as he was by obedience bound to forgo the occasion, which had unlooked for presented it selfe unto him, of entering into <hi>Tiroll,</hi> and being returned to <hi>Kempten</hi> he had already begun his march towards <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> when <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> being on all sides incompassed by the <hi>French</hi> Forces, that they might keep him from taking up Armes, though he publiquely appeared to be onely for the Emperour, yet having some little dependency upon the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> he resolved, though his warlike and couragious spirit could not well admit of thoughts of peace, to call his most intimate friends into his privat Cabinet, and consult with them upon the present emergency, being forced thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by necessity, which maketh men oftentimes incline to that which they have formerly much abhorred. Hereupon there wanted not some, who foreseeing how he was running into imminent danger told him;
<q>that nothing ought to be so deerly esteemed of by a Prince, or be so pretious in his eyes, as peace; that no more profitable or usefull Counsell could be given him, then to shun warre; that the relying upon the power of great and potent men was little advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, or rather oft-times prejudiciall, for that these, (either that they may work themselves into their friends territories, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of assisting them, and so appropriate it unto themselves; or else that they may keep warre aloofe from themselves, and bring it into their friends home) doe never contract friendship but upon particular ends, and such as being foreseen by wisemen, ought to be shunn'd, as we would doe usurers, who taking double use for what they lend, ruine them that adheare unto them: that his Highnesse Forces were but small in comparison of so great a King; that he had no strong hold to withstand or stop a Kings Army save <hi>Nancy</hi> and <hi>Motha</hi>; that in <hi>Lorayne</hi> there could not be raised above 20000 Souldiers, the Inhabitants being more vers'd in ploughing and cookery then in mannaging of weapons; that he could not defend himselfe without the <hi>Austrian</hi> succours, and that these were onely to be expected from <hi>Flanders, Burgundie,</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi>; that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were imployed in the defence of their owne Country; that the <hi>Flemmish</hi> Army was imployed against the <hi>Hollanders</hi> who were very strong and were upon the Guard of the Frontiers of <hi>France</hi>: that <hi>Burgundie</hi> was a little State, and unable to give fitting helpe unlesse strengthened by <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> or the <hi>Switsers:</hi> that to bring in forreigne Forces was to bring the warre home to ones owne house,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55221:58"/>
and to deprive ones selfe, of the free and absolute authority injoyed in peace; and to receive more harme oft-times by friends then we doe by enemies; that Princes ought never to indeavour a breach with such Potentats, against whom all contending being vaine, men onely play that they may lose; that faith ought not to be given to the promises or profers of the mighty, for that they use to indure no longer then serves for their owne occasion; that he is an enemy who onely aspires to get the Command of another mans authority, and that such as these ought alwayes to be suspected; that occasions are oft-times invented by the great and powerfull, whereby they doe hoodwinke their inferiours, that they may pick a cause to take from them what they possesse, and that they aime no lesse at the oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their friends, then of their enemies; that they did advise his Highnesse to abandon the suggestions of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State; to keepe quiet within his owne dominions; and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to injoy that which hee could not so easily preserve in warre.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These reasons though very strong, and such as the Duke (had hee been wise) should have followed, were neither embraced nor rejected; but the greater part of his Councell who were wisely by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> kept partiall on their side, either by pensions, hopes, or promises, thinking it not fit to forgo the friendship and protection of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian</hi> party, for any pretence or threats of the King of <hi>France,</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hopes upon the event of the secret practice held by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and other Princes of <hi>France,</hi> which was to raise new troubles in <hi>France,</hi> whereby they might inlarge their owne limits, said
<q>Peace was alwayes good, where Warre was harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; as it was likewise alwayes prejudiciall when by the idlenesse thereof ruine was well-nigh caused: that wise men ought to observe the meanes how to secure their dominions, which was not to be done by suffering their neighbours to increase in power; that Princes were alwayes in suspition, either to be treated as vassalls, or to lose their estate, when they suffered themselves to be brought into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of one greater then themselves. That <hi>France</hi> was no more powerfull then it was daily indeavouring to increase its power; that the memory of their pretensions upon <hi>Lorayne,</hi> (a faire Jewell for the Crowne) was of great efficacy; that fit occasions to weaken such Forces as we stand in feare of, ought not to be let slip, when the permitting of them may cause jealousie; that it was better to hazard ones selfe in warre, then to be sure to lose all in peace; that inferiour Princes thought it a great advantage to have a sanctuary whereunto to fly, when they are injured by their superiours; that nothing could preserve <hi>Lorayne</hi> from the ambition of the <hi>French,</hi> but protection from <hi>Spaine</hi>; that it might be said to be lost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Swedish</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Forces: that reason of State would have <hi>Alsatia</hi> preserved, <hi>Burgundie</hi> kept flourishing, <hi>Flanders</hi> strengthened, and <hi>France</hi> troubled: that the King wanting issue was lesse observed by his subjects; that such successours as were most adhered unto by the unstable and wavering multitude had reason
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55221:58"/>
to hope well; that therefore <hi>Orleans</hi> ought to be fomented, and that it was safer to follow the <hi>Austrian</hi> party, then by fearing the <hi>French</hi> Forces, to grant them that which would be more profitable to deny them</q>
            </p>
            <p>Although these reasons prevailed much with the Duke, who was sufficiently thereunto inclined, and did lively worke upon the affection which he bore the <hi>Imperiallists,</hi> occasioned by the good entertainment he had received from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilest he was a Voluntier in their Armies against the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> during the life of his Unckle Duke <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>; yet for that the fiercest spirits are sometimes kept under by the scourge or rod of the more powerfull, fearing the inundation of the <hi>French</hi> upon his State, (who were already in readinesse, and had a good will thereunto) he by the advise of his Councell resolved upon a peece of cunning; which was to satisfie the King with complements and faire words, and with all outward appearance which might make him forbeare his threats, and to conceale the ill will he bare him, to a fitter occasion.</p>
            <p>And for that the <hi>French</hi> (a Nation of all others, of a more nimble spirit, boldnesse of minde, and unquiet disposition,) are hardly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or contented with the idlenesse of peace, but still desiring novelty, is oft times prodigall of its wisedome, and runs without foundation to graspe at shadowes, which to their passion seeme bodies; those that had seduced the Queene Mother to absent her selfe from the Court, and to put her selfe into the hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> being still distasted with the present condition of affaires, and thinking they should be more esteemed of when they were forth of the Kingdome, then when in it, having likewise wrought upon the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> (the Kings only brother) to incense him against the Cardinall <hi>Richelieu</hi> (an officer of State, to whom the whole government of the Kingdome being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, did faithfully governe it, and with so much advantage as <hi>France</hi> had never before knowne) upon pretence that the authority where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this man was intrusted, belonged better to a Brother then any other subject, feeding him with vast hopes, kept him still in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by whose knowledge all this businesse was set on worke, considered how much the troubles of <hi>France</hi> would make for their greatnesse, and the profit they might receive by the Civill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that Kingdome, whose union was their jealousie, and was only able to counter-ballance their desired ends: and this so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that by reason of the <hi>French</hi> Forces falling downe upon the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> they rationally enough suspected they might have called the <hi>Swedes</hi> into those parts to frighten the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and consequently invite them to flye for protection to them, whereby fencing themselves from being injured by the Protestants, and without unsheathing their sword, yea under a religious pretence, this was a fitting meanes to possesse themselves of many Forts of great importance: But it being foreseene by the wisedome of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Councell, that this was the Center wherein the lines of many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of reflection was to fall; for that the getting of the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55221:59"/>
are such as are much facillitated by the peoples necessity, who had no other meanes (<hi>Spaine</hi> being growne too weake) to defend themselves against the warre, but by their protection; and that as this would be a considerable addition to the greatnesse of <hi>France,</hi> so would it be no small trouble to the <hi>Austrian</hi> power, since it was not in good policy of State to be permitted. Hence it is that many thinke they upheld the fearefull with hopes, fomented the male-contents with Counsell, and endeavoured to stirre such as were constant by feigned appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; so as these practises passing from one to another already infected with treachery (as the Duke of <hi>Momerancy,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>Delbeaf,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Vsiers, Nismes,</hi> and <hi>Besiers,</hi> and many other principall subjects) the businesse seemed already to have had a good beginning.</p>
            <p>But on the one side they found the <hi>Swedes</hi> proceedings to be such, as neither the <hi>German</hi> Forces, nor yet the Forces of <hi>Flanders</hi> (which were much weakened) seemed to be any wayes able openly to second the commotions in <hi>France</hi>; and that the straights whereinto they were by the <hi>Swedes</hi> reduced, did not well comport with the irritating of <hi>France,</hi> and thereby drawing upon them a dangerous warre: and on the other side they considered, that to passe by such an occasion as this, whereby to moderate the greatnesse of <hi>France,</hi> was to lose that wisedome, which, as the Pilot of the Spanish Counsels, brought their resolutions often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a happy shore; since wise Polititians ought never to abandon those undertakings out of feare, which may suffocate feare, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base themselves in those difficulties which valiantly withstood, are usually by time and fortune dissolved. Wherefore finding no lesse danger in bearing with those jealousies threatened by the Frontier Army, the gray-headed Spanish wisedome, refined by the Italian subtilty, and made perfect by the continuall mannaging of so many and various examples, measuring their height of profit, with their depth of danger, unanimously agreed to endeavour intestine trouble in <hi>France,</hi> to shelter themselves from the cloud which threatened them, and to win time, which being of great help to those who study witty projects, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ey hoped to reape thereby good advantage: and though the small Forces which <hi>Orleans</hi> had with him, promised no great effect, yet the hopes they had, that many others, who had not yet discovered themselves, and who bore ill will to the Cardinall, would joyne with him, as being the Kings onely Brother, and Heire apparent to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> made them hope for some good event; And for as much as past examples doe much authorize the Counsells of Princes, whereupon building their Maximes, they thinke that what hath once happened, may be an unvariable Law to future times; the Duke growing somewhat coole in the enterprise, having no other hopes then those already layd, and his Councellours rather blinded by desire, then guided by vertue, egging him on by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind past examples, whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was therefore two dayes after brought by the Guard to the <hi>Piazza</hi> or market place, where his sentence of death, together with the confiscation of his goods, and his title of Rebell, was read unto him: and the same afternoon, being first disroabed of his orders of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55221:60"/>
Knighthood, his head was strucke off in a privat house, whereby he paid for his infidelity; not knowing that the governments of Princes are not alwayes the same, but that they alter as doth the understanding and experience of their assisting Officers.</p>
            <p>The death of this so conspicuous prince, in whose linage greatnesse flourished, in whose name Nobility shone, whose valour was famous, and in whose person much vertue appeared, in his strength of years, of a healthfull body, begirt with honours, and abounding in riches, manifested the inconstancy of fortune, the uncertainty of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, the slippery footing of greatnesse, the fall of glory, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ambition. At the newes hereof those unquiet spirits who only sought means how to produce Novelties, (not unlike to travellers who seeke to shelter themselves from the aire when great with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest it threatens stormes) so these men with-drawing their bold fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies under the security of feare, knew what was the insatiatnesse of desire, the deceitfulnesse of passion, the feignednesse of presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the harme of infidelity. <hi>France</hi> being by this blow terrified, the common-people by this example undeceived, the Nobility re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, every mans minde was more bent upon their obedience to their Prince, then upon their owne particular greatnesse.</p>
            <p>This mean while <hi>Montecuculi</hi> who then was Generall of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Artillery, and was in <hi>Swabenland,</hi> was commanded to march with the Forces that were about <hi>Lindaw</hi> and <hi>Constantz,</hi> to guard <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and particularly <hi>Brisach,</hi> a Fort whose situation was of very great consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, upon the ascent of a hill, which having no other hill neer for the space of two Leagues, is an Island upon the <hi>Rhyn</hi> in the midst of a large Champion, having a Bridge over the River fortified on the one part and the other with moderne fortifications, which make it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most impregnable by Force, and renders it aswell beneficiall to all the Townes thereabouts, as likewise fitting to assemble together the levies of men, which by <hi>Walesteines</hi> order were made in <hi>Burgundie</hi> and in <hi>Lorayne,</hi> by the Colonels <hi>Cornelius Bentivoglio, Marcus Fiston, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, Bambaglioni,</hi> and others. And because the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopald</hi> was much concerned in the preservation of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> (and chiefely in that of <hi>Brisach,</hi> the key of that Province) the care of seeing this place well Fortified was recommended to Colonell <hi>Ascanio Albertini,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thereof: and moreover many other Commanders were sent thither to survey those Bulworks, and to be assistant to <hi>Montecuculi</hi>; amongst the which I my selfe being one, I forthwith went from the Camp before <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> and came with what speed I could to the said Count of <hi>Colmar.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Montecuculi</hi> and <hi>Ossa</hi> (the Emperours Commissary who watched over the safety of <hi>Alsatia</hi>) being advertised that (besides the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>French</hi> from those parts) there were not many <hi>Swedes</hi> left there, the greatest part of them being joyned with the King before <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> so as there remained not there above 500 Horse, and 800 Foot, thought therefore to make some further advancement whereby (if they should get no other benefit) it would be some advantage to them to get Contribution from the Townes formerly taken in, and satisfy in part their Souldiers, who grew impatient of living without pay: and it was yet more considerable, that the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> who seemed to leane more towards the <hi>Swedes</hi> then towards the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (although he durst not yet make publique shew thereof) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining two Regiments of Foot in his state, (as it was thought) to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the <hi>Swedes,</hi> when he should finde the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Forces neer upon his Confines, would be carefull not to doe any thing contrary to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he ought to the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Crowne. To this purpose, (as likewise for other reasons,) they went from <hi>Colmar</hi> and <hi>Brisack,</hi> and resolved to enter the territories of <hi>Turlach</hi> to make the Marquesse thereof (who being a Protestant, followed the Swedish party) aware of the Errors of such Princes, who forsaking the faith and loyalty which they owe unto their superiours, throw all the goods they doe possesse upon the hopes of getting more and greater by the helpe of others. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore mustered 1500 commanded Muskettiers, and 1300 Horse, with two Companies of Dragoones, and two pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, under the Command of the Colonells, <hi>Aracourt, Montrec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whilest things went thus, <hi>Montecuculi</hi> was advertised that the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg</hi> was marching towards him with 6000 Foot, and 800 Horse, so as commanding me to make the discovery, and I find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were but Country-people, come out of hot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55221:61"/>
by their former warres. A businesse of so great importance, as is the advantage that old Souldiers have over new ones, and in particular Country people; for these men taking up Armes against their will, not to serve their Prince, but to obey him; and being bread up in the idlenesse of Peace, are not able to indure the hardnesse of warre; so as their mindes being alwayes upon their owne families, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to divert them from the thought thereof, and their intensivenesse to peace and quiet imbaseth their courage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montecuculi</hi> (desirous to adde to these his proceedings, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by information and scouts, which assured him that there were no other Forces then what hath been said in those parts) came the next morning with his Horse and Dragoones to <hi>Knitling,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> weakly walled and situated; the Inhabitants whereof prepared for defence, refusing to surrender the Towne. I know not whither they did this as knowing succour was at hand, or for that the <hi>Imperialists</hi> wanted Foot and Cannon, or for that it is naturall to cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly people, to seem valiant, when they feare nothing. But not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to withstand a fierce assault made by the Dragoones, and Light-horse, (who upon this occasion were lighted from horseback,) they fled in such confusion from their stations, and foure of the <hi>Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Souldiers advanced so couragiously forward, as possessing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the wicket of the great gate, (which was left open and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned) they let downe the draw-bridge and let in their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; who being followed by the Horse, put as many to the sword, as at the first they met withall, and angry that they found therein no booty (for the Townsmen had conveyed away all the best things they had to <hi>Heylburne</hi>) they revenged themselves by setting the Towne on fire in foure places; which being (as is usually in <hi>Germany</hi>) for the most part built of wood, it was in six houres burnt to the ground. Which may serve for an example to such Citizens as never having seen the sword drawne at their gates, and thinking to affright and oppugne the enemy with lovely plumes in their Helmets, and rich Scarfes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks, doe not afterwards make good their bravery of speech with gallantry of heart, and so lose their Country, Honour, Substance, and lastly their Lives.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Commanders were not delighted with this fiery spectacle, occasioned by wicked and distrustfull Souldiers; they themselves being Gentlemen full of honour and humanity: but soon after some Scouts being returned, who were sent abroad to learne the Condition of the enemy, brought word backe that the Governour of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> beeng issued out of the Towne with 800 Foot to surprise <hi>Wiseloch</hi> a walled Town of those parts, was incompassed in a wood by 500 Horse of the <hi>Rheingraves,</hi> for the which he desired assistance; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing that if they would speedily free him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that danger (the <hi>Swedes</hi> being easily put to flight,) the Town would remaine at the good will of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholicks, wherein the best things of the Country-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that lived thereabouts was brought. <hi>Montecuculi</hi> though hee list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unwillingly to these hopes, yet <hi>Ossa,</hi> (who was an old man, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in these parts) insisting that they should go on (the desire

            </p>
            <p>This indeavour of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> wakened those that slept; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> (who durst not formerly declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an Enemy) finding himselfe injured by the surprisall of <hi>Knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> and other Townes, assembled all the men of his state together, and marcht into the Field, intending to doe by the <hi>Austrians,</hi> as they had done by him.</p>
            <p>But because nothing rayses a Princes mind more to consideration then doth the importance of Warre, though the Duke of immature age, well inclined to Warre, full of vast designes, (which were fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the troubles begun in <hi>France,</hi> and confirmed in him by his Councellours, out of the hatred they bore to the Roman Catholiques, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> suggestions, and the hopes they had in them) minded not what the event might be, which a wise man ought alwayes to have like a looking-Glasse before his eyes, and though he infinitely desired to enter friendship with the King of <hi>Swedes</hi>; yet not forgetting the Maxime, That it is good to have the opinion of others, (as well that he might have wherewithall to cloake the defects of wisedome, as likewise that he might lay to their charge any thing of evill that might befall,) resolved to send for his Chiefe Councellours, and to advise with them upon the injuries he had received from the <hi>Caesari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and what revenge he ought to take.
<q>He with great resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment urged, that the Imperiall Officers were insufferable in their demeanour; that they thirsted after other mens estates, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to their friends, intending onely their owne interest; that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55221:62"/>
they thought they should merit at Gods hands, by being cruell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and by ruinating the Protestants; that the pretence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was so esteemed of by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> as they thought their faith was not broken, when the occasion being palliated by some inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they know they may usurpe that from their friends, which they desire; that there was no safe living amongst them, who coveting to rule over all men, keepe their ambition onely so long hidden as they thinke it not fit to discover it; That the reverence pretended to by the Church-men, was knowne to be too pleasing, and that they could not chuse but thinke them their Enemies that did not reverence them; that their avarice was tinder so ready to take fire at their owne interest, that any least sparke of profit was able to make them spread abroad a combustion of all manner of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and vexations; that the Declaration made some yeares before by the Emperour, at the instigation of the Ecclesiastiques, was not to be indured; (to wit, that he would have restitution made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Princes (even in their weaknesses) have a certaine kind of preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive above the wisedome of private men; so as though the Duke was for these reasons confirmed in his desired resolutions; yet since in consultations, all men ought to be heard what they can say, he earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desired the rest to speake freely their opinions. Some who were made wary by experience, did not in silence passe by the example of those unadvised Princes, who siding with the Emperours Enemies, became food to the ravenous fury of the Militia, and had inriched those who would have alwayes lived miserable in peace:
<q>They said, The disorder of the Souldier was to be borne withall, particularly when covering their Licencionesse by the credit of their advancing they are freed from their deserved punishment; that such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to be taken away as doe cause pretences, by him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res not to be by them convinc'd; that covetousnesse is not by any meanes more allayd, then by the easie comming thereby; that the designes of great men are not to be loosened by the hands of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: That it is alwayes good not to take notice of offences, when by taking notice of them we againe pull them upon us; that patience in peace was more profitable then the inquietudes of Warre; that the Dukedome of <hi>Wirtenberg</hi> stood betweene <hi>Alsatia</hi> and <hi>Swaben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (Provinces full of the <hi>Austrians</hi> Forces:) That it could not rayse above 12000. Souldiers, and those unexperienced in Warre,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55221:63"/>
accustomed to rest and quiet, and free from noyse; that in all the Dukedome there were onely <hi>Sordendorfe, Heybrun,</hi> and <hi>Onviell</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, which were able for any time to withstand a Field Army: That it would be found better counsell to keepe in good correspondency with the Emperour (as the Dukes his Predecessors had done, leaving behind them the fame of having beene loyall to the Empire) then by leaning to a Forraine and dangerous friendship, to purchase the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Rebell.</q>
Yet were not these reasons of force enough to allay the heat of his spirit, and quench that fire which (the Dukes inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on considered) was kindled in the greatest part of his Counsellours; so as conveying what he had most precious into <hi>Onviell</hi> Castle, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the side of an unaccessible Rock in the midst of an open Countrey betweene <hi>Constance</hi> on the East-side, the <hi>Rhyne</hi> and <hi>Zwitsers</hi> on the South, and <hi>Wirtenberg</hi> on the North, he took up Armes in the <hi>Swedes</hi> behalf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Which being done, <hi>Horne</hi> assembled the Body of an Army together, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 10000. fighting men, and ten pieces of Cannon.</p>
            <p>This preparation of the <hi>Swedes</hi> made <hi>Strasburg</hi> bethink themselves, which till then had kept Neutralls, as not knowing who should have the better; the which Town, wishing well to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> either for their Conformitie in Religion, or for the apprehended greatnesse of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> added to these their desires by the rationall pretence of seeing themselves on all sides surrounded by them;
<q>And affirmed, it was rashnesse to deny that which could not be made good; that the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> Forces were farre off; that opiniatricy could not be maintained without neere and opportune succours; that the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Cities consisted in keeping friendship with those who they stood in feare of, in taking away the occasion of threats;</q>
and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing, They would doe the like to the <hi>Austrians</hi> whensoever they should be encamped neer them; they declared themselves to side with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and assisted <hi>Horne</hi> with what they were able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

his departing, renewed his friendship with them, and taking a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly farewell of all the people, (who filled the aire with their wishing God to blesse him, and good fortune to follow him) leaving with them 2000 Foot for their better strength, he marched with his whole Army which consisted of 26000 fighting men towards <hi>Bamberg,</hi> to refresh his men wearied with continuall duties. <hi>Walesteine</hi> who knew like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he could tarry no longer there, his Victuals and Forrage being well-nigh exhausted, and fearing lest whilest he should finde it a hard businesse to take <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> the King might easily advance to some new designe, and that his Forces being weakened by lying before that Town, he should be the worse able to keep afterwards in the field, He likewise raised his Camp and marched towards <hi>Sindetspacke</hi> not farre from <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> where he haulted and mustered his men, who appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be 36000 Souldiers; he left <hi>Gallasse</hi> in the Reare with directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to fire all the Villages of those parts, (which he did) and that then he should go towards <hi>Misuia,</hi> to drive the <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces thence, whil'st he himselfe went to <hi>Bamberg,</hi> (a City in <hi>Franconia</hi> upon the <hi>Mayne,</hi> belonging to the Bishop thereof, who hath there the power of Civill Juridiction) and stayed with his whole Army in some neer neighbouring Villages: for his end was onely to entertaine the King, and not to put himselfe upon the danger and uncertainty of a Battaile, whil'st <hi>Gallasse</hi> and <hi>Holke</hi> going into <hi>Saxony</hi> with 10000 Souldiers, might ruinate the Country, and force the Elector thereof to come to an accommodation, when he should see himselfe not succoured by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who would have worke enough found them by <hi>Walesteines</hi> Forces He afterwards sent the Marquesse <hi>Grana,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> with 4000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, (all Commanded men) to invade the Marquessat of <hi>Brait</hi> a jurisdiction of the same Province, not farre from the Diocesse of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> which the Marquesse <hi>Grana</hi> did with good successe, and little trouble; <hi>Brait</hi> not being in condition to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a good Body of choice men, wanting Rampiers, Men and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, for their defence.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hornes</hi> proceedings in <hi>Bavaria</hi> (whereinto he was entred with eight thousand Foot and foure thousand Horse) occasioned fearfull confusion in those who were accustomed to the security of peace; and therefore the assistance of their Princes Forces being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be necessary, it behoved the Elector to part from <hi>Walesteine,</hi> and with his men and those of <hi>Aldringers,</hi> amounting to the number of 14000 Souldiers, to returne into <hi>Bavaria</hi> towards <hi>Raim,</hi> (a place invironed with strong wals after the ancient mode, in a considerable situation upon the <hi>Leech,</hi> lying between <hi>Dunawert</hi> and <hi>Augspurg,</hi> which was the passage from <hi>Swabenland</hi> into <hi>Bavaria</hi>) aswell to guard those places which were threatened by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> as to stop the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Country people about <hi>Lintz</hi>; who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> taking up Armes against the King of <hi>Swede,</hi> and of their Princes troubles, tooke the liberty to take up Armes, and by way of insurrection, to hinder the navigation upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> by rifling the Barkes: yet this their insurrection lasted but for a while; for they no sooner knew that <hi>Iohn Went,</hi> Colonell of the Catholique

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55221:68"/>
conceive amisse of the <hi>Swedes</hi> proceedings, that Citie being little lesse then destroyed for their sakes,) he led on his Army to <hi>Erfurt,</hi> the Metropolitan of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> divided by the River <hi>Iera,</hi> which takes head in that Province, and falls into <hi>Vnstrutz</hi> there to prevent <hi>Pappen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</hi> before he should execute his designe of taking it in; who having left Count <hi>Gronsfield</hi> in the Bishoprick of <hi>Hidelsheim</hi> (a Country w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> extends it selfe from the River <hi>Glien,</hi> to the <hi>Fuse</hi> in the Province of <hi>Braunswyck</hi>) with 7000 Souldiers to besiege <hi>Newburg,</hi> a strong place seated upon the side of <hi>Abre,</hi> used much diligence in his marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the remainder of his men, finding how irreparable an other Battell would be by reason of the being at hand of so great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and for the scarcitie of Victualls in those parts unmanured for want of Inhabitants, and abandoned by the Enemy, who could not any longer suffer the incommodities thereof. Great was the diligence that this Count used to prevent the Kings arrivall at <hi>Erfurt,</hi> yet not such as could out-doe the King in speedy march; for fearing the prejudice he might receive if he should therein be prevented by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> he made his Vanguard march by day, and his Rereguard by night, loosing no more time then what was requisite in some sort to refresh the Souldier.</p>
            <p>The King stayd two dayes in <hi>Erfurt</hi> to comfort his Army, and more particularly his Foot who were very weary with so long marches, in which time he understood how that <hi>Walesteine</hi> had wonne <hi>Coleburg,</hi> how his Cannon playd upon the Castle to render his Forces the more secure by the taking thereof; as likewise those of <hi>Pappenheim,</hi> who was marching to joyne with him, and what progresse <hi>Holke</hi> and <hi>Gallasse</hi> made to the prejudice of <hi>Saxony.</hi> The Kings Forces and <hi>Waymars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned, he call'd a Councell of Warre, where he, with his Chiefe Commanders, consulted upon what course was best to be taken;
<q>Wherein some wisely weighing the present condition of affaires, were of opinion, It was not fitting for them to bring themselves to such a passe, as that they could not shunne a Battell upon disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious termes; that the <hi>Imperialists</hi> had a considerable greater number of Souldiers then they, who were ambitious to win by their Swords <hi>Walesteines</hi> good opinion, who was a large rewarder of gallant acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (a thing worthy of consideration:) that the Enemy was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by favourable situations, &amp; fit places to retreat unto; that the <hi>Swedes</hi> on the contrary were an Enemies Country, and that devasted, there being no appearance of Provisions sufficient for them to keep the Field against the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> who were furnished with all things necessary from <hi>Bohemia</hi>; that there was not any more commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble resolutions to be had in warfairing then such as did secure the keeping of what was already got, and did maintaine the Souldier in strength and vigour; that to doe so, was more praise, worthy in a Commander in Chiefe, then the gaining of Townes; that such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions were alwayes blamed and prejudiciall, as were undertaken without having an eye to the event; that the whole ought never to be endangered for a part; that in the losse of one Battell, the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of all their already wonne renowne, their ruine, their being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55221:69"/>
by their Enemies, the amazement of the Subject and Souldier, and the fame and reputation of their Armes did consist: That Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is thought best when wonne by Wit, not by the Sword; that wise men ought not onely to consider what advantage may accrue, but provide for what of damage may happen: That their opinion was to temporise upon the Confines, to incommodate the Enemy now upon the Flanks, now upon the Front, now upon the Reare; to take from them their Provisions, and to prejudice them more by the hardnesse of the season, and scarcitie of Victualls, then by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all to the hazard of a Battell; that it was very advantagious to make good what they had alleady wonne; the which the <hi>Austri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> having lost, they would be constrained to keepe their Campe in their owne Hereditary Territories, and so warring against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and thereby weakned, they would the easilier be overcome.</q>
These Reasons were attentively listned unto, and well liked of, almost by every one, and by the King himselfe; but it was considered on the contrary side;
<q>That to seeme fearfull of the Enemy, is the first step to losse; that Armies were not said to be advantaged by the number of men, but by the Souldiers courage, and Commanders worth; that barren places were to be forgone, and the getting of more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent Cities indeavoured, against the which the Souldier goes the more boldly on incited by the hopes of gaine; that what was won by Armes, was not to be maintained without Armes; the bold under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings whereof is usually favoured by Fortune, who when she finds her favourer abused, doth oftimes turne her backe. Thus did the King speake and resolve; adding, That in Warre men ought not by speculary shadowes and imaginations of feare, to deterre that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which far from any thought of danger ought only to be confident of, and in it selfe: That he confessed, reflection ought to be had of past successes, but that it behoved not the Conquerour to shun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring the conquered, that it was no reason to hazard all for a part, amongst those Enemies, in whom even that Army with so much difficultie recruited, being comprehended, the utter ruine of their Dominion did consist: That they were to fight boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those, who once beaten, were not likely to make head again; that it behoved them to fight who had nothing to lose, and those to shun fighting, who by losing might be undone; that it was never good to abandon those Confederates, who building upon their friendly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, have without respect drawne the Warre upon themselves; that it was dangerous for them to faile in the promises they had made, and hopes they had occasioned: That the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was worthy to be assisted, and to have good correspondency kept with him; that all delay was harmefull, neither could the Prince be blamed of error, who being deceived by his friend, for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne Estate falls to treat with the Enemy; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to thinke of advancing, and having an eye to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists</hi> proceedings, not to shunne an occasion of Battle; that they should succour <hi>Saxony</hi> where it had need of them; or by Invading <hi>Bohemia,</hi> recall <hi>Walesteine</hi> from his designes upon <hi>Misnia.</hi>
               </q>
These
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55221:69"/>
conceptions carrying more of weight and substance with them in the present conjuncture of time, then did the other, wonne the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of all: so as the King (leaving fitting orders for the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of those Townes) went from <hi>Erfurt,</hi> the Inhabitants where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of running a vye to see the Kings preparations, and upon their knees doing reverence to him, they powred their prayers to Heaven out for him, and with much acclamation and confidence wisht him good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. 'Twas observed that the King being troubled at this their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, broke forth into these words;
<q>What do these people fancy unto themselves; doe they believe me to be a god? O how they are deceived; we are all mortall; our soules may well be of steel, but our bodies are of glasse; I presage mischiefe to my selfe from hence, and apprehend Divine punishment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These speeches though proceeding from a King that profest enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholique Religion, made many know he had a well composed minde: Having mustered his men (which he found to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 16000 Foot and 11000 Horse of divers Nations) hee gave the Van-guard to the Command of Duke <hi>Bernard Waymar,</hi> consisting of 4000 Horse, <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Finlanders,</hi> 1000 Dragoones, and 6000 Foot divided into six Squadrons; hee recommended the maine Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile to the Marshall <hi>Kneiphausen,</hi> with 6000 Foot divided into three Bodies, and 4000 Horse parted into eight Squadrons, and he himselfe kept in the Rear with 1000 choice Horse, 1000 Dragoones and 4000 Foot, every Battaglion of the Van-guard, as likewise of the Battaile, and other Squadrons of the Reserve having 5 field-Pieces in their Front. In this order he began his march towards <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice by the way that <hi>Walesteine</hi> had raised his Forces from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Castle of <hi>Coburg,</hi> that he had taken <hi>Leypzig,</hi> and that the quartering of his Army extended to <hi>Newburg</hi> and <hi>weisnfeld,</hi> (walled Townes upon the <hi>Sala,</hi> and upon the Confines of <hi>Saxony</hi>) possessing all advantagious places, he lead his Army to <hi>Newburg,</hi> a Towne sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a little lower upon the said River, towards <hi>Erfurt,</hi> that hee might make use of that station to joyne with the <hi>Saxon</hi> Army, (which was now about <hi>Torgaw,</hi> a place belonging to the said Elector, upon the bankes of <hi>Elb</hi>) consisting of about 12000 Foot and 4000 Horse, to oppose the designes of <hi>Holke</hi> and <hi>Walesteine,</hi> to whom <hi>Pappenheim</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now joyned with 9000 Souldiers, hee notwithstanding kept still in his former quarters, to hinder the <hi>Saxons</hi> from joyning with the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whil'st these went cautiously preparing how they might upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage fight with the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> the King was by his Scouts adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, that <hi>Walesteine</hi> was gone from <hi>Weisnfeld,</hi> and had retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in close quarter towards <hi>Lutzen,</hi> a Village two Leagues off from <hi>Leypzig,</hi> and that <hi>Pappenheim</hi> was marched with part of his Army, towards <hi>Hall,</hi> to hinder the advancing of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Lunenburg</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who being sent for by the King, for the better strengthning of his Camp, made long marches to joyne with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> that afterwards they might meet all in one Body with the <hi>Swedes.</hi> The King resolved not to lose time, but to make use of that conjuncture which hee found
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55221:70"/>
fitting for him, to set upon <hi>Walesteine,</hi> who being severed from <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim,</hi> had weakened himselfe of the best bands of his Souldiers, upon whom he might have relyed for Victory; so as the King thought he might easily bring his designes to their wished for end. Hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore arose from the quarters he had taken, and with flying Colours marched thither-wards, sending the <hi>Finlanders</hi> Horse who were then in the Van to discover the Country, who failed not in their duty; for the Kings commands were readily obeyed by all his Souldiers, the which they went the more cheerfully and willingly about, for that they were thereby invited to the hopes of a glorious Victory, big with booty and reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walesteine</hi> (being a wise Commander) having found the Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and foreseen that making use of <hi>Pappenheime's</hi> absence, hee would force him to a Battaile, upon the successe wherof, the <hi>Sum. Total.</hi> lay; and having many and various thoughts hereupon, weighing duly all that made against him, that he might go upon secure grounds, he resolved to advise with his Astrologer (whom he used to trust with his greatest secrets) who found that the Constellations of that Month were not answerable to the Kings former fortune, or rather that the Planets seemed to have an ill aspect towards him. Grounding much hereupon, (for imitating the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> he had an opinion of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>guries,</hi> and was wont to governe his actions by Astrologicall sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he had studied very diligently) he resolved to see whither the Starres (which had befriended him at other times) would now tell truth or no: he then secretly agreed with <hi>Pappenheim,</hi> that hee should temporise, and that each of them should advise the other when the King should advance, by the shot of Cannon set purposely in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting places, and should by speedy messengers acquaint one another with the Kings proceedings, and that in this case he should speedily returne to his men towards <hi>Lutzen</hi>; for hee would entertaine the <hi>Swedes</hi> with skirmishes, and so afford him opportunity to come time enough. The King having made haste with his marches towards <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, Walesteine</hi> gave quickly the signe agreed upon by a three-fold Cannon-shot to <hi>Pappenheimes</hi> Centinels, who were placed at fitting distances to that purpose, and by speedy messengers gave him notice thereof; and this meane while fearing lest the King might advance further then he desired he should, he wrought all night in the digging of a Ditch, whereby he advantaged his station, and filling it with Muskettiers, which were flanked by Cannon, he stood expecting the comming of the <hi>Swedes</hi>; who arguing by this their paines, that the <hi>Imperialists</hi> were afraid, became the bolder. This meane while divers skirmishes were made between the <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse, and <hi>Isolani</hi> his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, with equall losse, and herein was passed all the night; the King being by the breake of day, as it were Master of the field; for <hi>Wale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine</hi> keeping himselfe close within his Ditch, would not quit his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage till <hi>Pappenheime</hi> should be come to him.</p>
            <p>The King stay'd all night armed in the field, not minding what his body suffered; and being desired by his Captaine to repose himselfe and take some rest, he answered,
<q>That the example of the Generall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55221:70"/>
sweetens the suffering of the Souldier; that to forgoe his vigilancy would shew his care over his men to be but small, and make it seeme he did it that he might not feele the incommodities of his owne life; which they who doe respect, ought not to be in the Saddle with foot in stirrope, but at their owne homes, upon their downe-beds; that the troubles of many suited not with the peace and rest of one alone; that the world appertained to the industrious, not to the sloathfull; that rest was the daughter of idlenesse, and peace, labour the mother of glory and achievements.</q>
Thus calling his chiefe Commanders about a little sire, (which he had caused be made to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the ridgednesse of the night) he in a sprightly and couragious manner, acquainted them with his intentions of joyning Battaile with <hi>Walesteine.</hi>
               <q>Some there were that advised him hee might doe well to stay for the Forces of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and others, who were upon their march not farre from him, with the which hee might the more boldly assault the Enemy; that the <hi>Swedes</hi> being as well in numbers as in situation short of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> they ought not to hazard the Victories of so many Moneths, upon the event of one day; that <hi>Walesteine</hi> commanded an Army who coveted Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile incited thereunto by necessity, and out of a desire that they might injoy the fruits of so many Victories, which they had not yet forgotten, and driven thereunto by despaire, seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves onely subject to sufferings: that fortune was unconstant, and oft-times a friend to the desperate; that <hi>Walesteine</hi> had Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders under him desirous of revenge, obedient Souldiers, and who more apprehended their Generalls frowne then the <hi>Swedes</hi> Swords; that <hi>Pappenheim</hi> was not so farre off, but that if he came not time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the Battaile, he might come soon enough at least to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wearied, and so totally oppresse them; that hee had people with him ancient in experience, and advise, but young in respect of their daring and ambition; and that fortune was obliged to pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his valour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that respect ought to be had to the comming up of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces, without which they should fight upon unequall tearmes.</q>
These reasons though strongly maintained, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing confuted by the King, with lively Arguments made good by the heat of his desire, and by his will. Too much presuming upon a mans selfe-darkens the wisedome of the wisest.

            <p>These speeches comming feelingly from a King, kept all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders from opposing them; and for that it was a nationall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome for Subjects to suit with the inclination of their Princes, they durst say no more in opposition, either not to seem cowards by disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from a businesse that bore danger with it, or lest the King should take the more notice of such as did oppose his reasons. Therefore, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryone applauding what he had said, they speedily withdrew themselves to their Colours, to order their Battaglions, and to incourage their people. Wherefore the King hasting upon the first entrance of <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> fields, did thus order his Army.</p>
            <p>The plaine of <hi>Lutzen,</hi> extends it selfe for the space of one League from the North to the South, and is girt about from the West to the North by certaine Woods, which divide it from another plaine: towards the North-side thereof is the Village <hi>Cursits,</hi> which amidst the descent of a pleasant Strond that runnes in Crookes, sometimes more, sometimes lesse, is rather an Ornament, then hinderance unto it: Amidst certain Hills there lyes another space of ground towards the South-East, which parteth <hi>Cursits</hi> and <hi>Lutzen</hi>; on the East-side stands <hi>Lutzen,</hi> from whence a plaine arising, the space between the East and South is back't by a delightfull ascent of Hills: The broadest part of the plaine falling downe betweene the West and the South, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a Prospect not bounded by the eye: About a League from <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> lyeth a ridge of Hills environed by a little Rivolet; thence from West to East there runs a Trench almost demolish't; at the end whereof, not farre from the Village stands a little house, which serves for a shelter to the Inhabitants of four Wind-mils seated on the ridge of those Hills.</p>
            <p>Upon the left wing of the Vanguard led on by his Majestie, who kept before it with some of his Domestick Servants, not attired like a Prince, but clad in plaine Spanish Leather, upon a dapple gray Horse, were 3000 Horse, all <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Findlanders</hi> (old Souldiers) divided into six Squadrons, under the Colonells, <hi>Vansleben, Ruthen,</hi> and <hi>Wistumb,</hi> Gentlemen of tryed experience; amongst which were ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led five Rankes of Musquetiers, betweene the one and the other Flank to play upon the Enemies Horse, before they should come within Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol-shot: All these were well mounted, armed with Curasses, Pistols and broad Swords like Faulchions, which being drawn, and held up by them in their bridle-hand, did by the reflection of the Sunne, adde to

spotted blacke and white, and twice rode about and surveyed all his Squadrons, enlivening them all with his affable behaviour, sweetnesse of speech, and cheerfull countenance, telling them how confidently he relyed upon their knowne valour, how weake the Enemy was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them through the hope of bootie, this being the end of all their labours, the perfection of their glory, and the accomplishment of their greatnesse, which when they should obteine, nothing could stand betweene them and the Crowne of Victory; whereunto, being by all of them answered with joyfull acclamations, it was observed that some, as if they had presaged what was to insue, said unto him;
<q>Oh Sir, have a care of your Person, and feare not us; to which he answering, "My Valiant and beloved Compagnions, wee have hitherto had but our first course, courage, now we are to expect the banquet; and making the Baggage women and boyes, who were mingled amongst the Troopes to be set a farre off, he himselfe being got upon a dun Horse, the Army moved (enheartned by the sound of warlike instruments, and with cheerfull martiall-like phrases, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every one was incouraged) and thus he advanced towards the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarians.</hi>

            <p>The Horse by this time began to exchange Pistoll-shot on both sides, and the <hi>Imperialists</hi> Artillery began to play a pace upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Squadrons in the Flanke, and the Kings saluted the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> who upon the rise of the hill lay open to the annoyance of the hale of bullets which flew from their Cannon, so as the Fray began to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot; for the Foot being come to the brinke of the Ditch, and in their advancing, orderly discharging their Muskets, the King Commanded the Regiments of his Guard to passe over it, and he himselfe was in readinesse to second them with 4 Squadrons of Horse of the right Wing.

Here the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Horse hasting in, in close rankes, and giving upon the <hi>Swedes</hi> Foot, with their Swords in hand, who were not seconded by their Horse, by reason of the difficultie they found in descending the ditch, yet with their Musket-shot and Pikes withstanding the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Enemy, and charging upon the <hi>Imperialists</hi> Horse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on all sides close up unto them and breaking their first Rankes, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> broke in upon them with such violence, as that the wounded and halfe dead being by the Horse trod underfoot, and the strong and able cut in pieces by the Sword, both these Battaglions were little lesse then consumed, with so much honour though, as that witnessing their loyalty, and writing it in Characters of bloud, it is worthy observation, that many Souldiers as they lay gasping and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up the ghost did notwithstanding with their Swords pricke the horses in the bellyes that trampled upon them, making it thereby be seen that the apprehension of death accompanies not valiant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to their grave.

the businesse; by suffering his body to lye in the Field, and giving it out that he was not dead, but that he was taken Prisoner, and that it became his Souldiers to fight manfully that they might rescue him, the <hi>Swedes</hi> were so exasperated thereby, and the Commanders so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed, as not thinking any death more glorious, then that wherein they should accompany their Lord &amp; Master, They placed themselves in the heads of their Regiments, &amp; Duke <hi>Waymer</hi> in particular placed himself in the head of the Blew Regiment, &amp; reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending the fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Wind-mils, to <hi>Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Waisemberg,</hi> advanced towards <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheim.</hi> So likewise did all the other Commanders against <hi>Walesteines</hi> Squadrons, who though they were with equall valour withstood by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> yet were the <hi>Imperialists</hi> thereby much indammaged. <hi>Pappenheim,</hi> who in the head of his Vangard flew upon the <hi>Swedes</hi> that were led on by <hi>Kniphausen,</hi> in the beginning of the conflict was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Cannon-shot, whereof he shortly after dy'd, as he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in a Coach towards <hi>Stalla</hi> to be cured.</p>
            <p>The losse of this Commander was no lesse direfull to the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Campe, then was the losse of the King to the <hi>Swedes</hi>; wherefore <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesteine</hi> dispatched suddenly a <hi>Piemontesse</hi> Captaine to Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Rinoch,</hi> with order, that he should charge with the Horse that was kept for reserve suddenly upon the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were in some confusion by reason of their Kings death, which <hi>Waymer</hi> could not keep concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

by their owne Commanders, shewed himselfe miraculously worthy, and made it appeare that in times of greatest danger generous minded men ought to give testimony of their valour. This did abate the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies eagernesse, and afforded <hi>Walesteine</hi> and <hi>Gallasse</hi> opportunity to re-order some confused Squadrons, and to withstand the <hi>Swedes</hi> Charge; who being acertained of their Kings death, and the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists</hi> being again reunited, there falling at that very instant likewise (which was about an houre before Sun-set) a very thicke fog or mist, which played the part of a charitable mediatresse, they fearing lest by further ingaging themselves they might run upon some disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, resolved to make a stand, and to make good their ground, and presse no further forward. <hi>Walesteine</hi> likewise finding himselfe aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by many of his Captaines, some of which were fled, some dead, and some wounded, and all his Camp full of confusion for <hi>Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penheimes</hi> death, (who was generally beloved) and that neither he nor his Commands were obeyed, resolved to keep in his station without any further attempt; so as the one and the other of them contenting themselves with the advantage of their situations, they afterwards with-drew into their owne quarters. Thus ended the Battaile of <hi>Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> fought on the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> which was not partiall either to the one or to the other side,<note place="margin">

Yet was the Kings death prised by the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> at as high a rate as whatsoever victory, and so indeed it proved, for with him perished the <hi>Swedes</hi> good fortune, the Souldiers obedience ceased, disorders sprung up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dissentions were bred amongst Commanders, and ambition of precedency, diversity of opinions, difference of Counsels, envy of actions, and dissonancy of confederacyes were stirred up.</p>
            <p>There perished in this dayes fight of both sides about 10000 Soul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diers, it is not known of which side most, and many Colonels and Commanders of esteem, of which there were wounded of the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists</hi> side (who afterwards dyed) <hi>Bartaldo Walesteine,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Chiese</hi>; and of the <hi>Swedes, Brundesteim, Winckell,</hi> and divers others: the action lasted from Sun rising to an houre before Sun set; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test slaughter and execution was about noone; the <hi>Imperialists</hi> left some pieces of great Cannon upon the field, for want of horses to draw them off; the Baggage was not touched either by the one, or the other side; yet 'tis true the <hi>Imperialists</hi> baggage was much damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fire, which lightning in the Ammunition blew up many, and slew many that were the Guard thereof.</p>

important an accident, nor having the clearenesse of their wisedome darkened by the gastlinesse of death and feare, but rather (which was worthy of remarke) comforting each other, and moderating each others griefe, it was at last propounded by Duke <hi>Waymer,</hi> whether they should hault in expectance of <hi>Saxony, Laneberg,</hi> and other Forces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready on their march towards them, or else before their heat were coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or their Swords sheathed, they should pursue the Enemy, astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed through the deaths &amp; flight of their men; the importancy of this businesse being very well weighed, there were some that advised,
<q>That without further consideration they ought to pursue <hi>Walesteine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by new recruits he might take to the Field againe; that these were of the number of such advantagious occasions as were not to be let slip; that the <hi>Swedes</hi> were inraged at their Kings death; that revenge by pursuing of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> was that which by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall applause of the Souldiers was desired and thirsted after; that this the Souldiers daring was wonderfull advantagious; that if their Prince were lost, they ought not at least to abandon the Victory up on which the common good depended, that it behoved them who loved the Kings life not to forget his death.</q>
Whilst the greatest part of the Commanders were pondring such conceptions as these, the out-cry of the Souldiers, who like so many inraged men broke in, asking where the King was, thundring in the eares of the Generalls, and every one agreeing in opinion of prosecuting the Enemy (and this the rather, for that the newes just then came of the Duke of <hi>Lunebergs</hi> arivall at <hi>Affendorfe,</hi> a Village within foure houres march of them) after they had cryed up (and by the joynt applause of all the Militia) chosen Duke <hi>Waymer</hi> for their Generall, who was deservedly beloved by them all, and a Prince both for birth and courage deserving such a charge, it was resolved, that that very night, <hi>Offchirch</hi> should goe with some of the Horse into the Field to recover the Body; and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being refresh't with Victualls and Wine (of which there was great store found in <hi>Wisenfells</hi>) the <hi>Swedes</hi> appeared againe the next morning in Battell Array upon the same plaine. The Sunne was two houres high before they could find the Kings Body; which when they found, was stript, and so dis-figured and mangled with blood, and the being trampled on by Horses, as hardly could they know it; it was with dolefull lamentations of the whole Army put into a Coach, and sent with a good guard to <hi>Neuburg,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> having heer got some Cannon, which for want of Horses were left behind by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> &amp; some Crabats which were come to fetch them off, being put to flight, <hi>Offchirch</hi> pursued them, but <hi>Walesteine,</hi> who was then at <hi>Leypzyg,</hi> expecting the arrivall of some Regiments who were not in the Battell, and the recruiting of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded Forces, with those of <hi>Holke,</hi> to whom he had sent to come to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being hereof informed by his Scouts, he called a Councell of Warre, wherein he demanded the opinion of all his Commanders, whether they should make good the station where they were, or else retreat. Somewere of opinion,
<q>That to retreat, was rather a signe of losse then Victory; that they pretended to be Victors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <hi>Walesteine</hi> was well enough inclined hereunto, but it being knowne that there was not in <hi>Leypzig</hi> two dayes Victuals for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; that the people therein adhered unto the <hi>Swedes</hi>; that the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> being not farre off upon his march, might s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut up the passage into <hi>Bohemia</hi>; that the <hi>Swedes</hi> being grieved would in a desperate manner flye upon them; and that it was much better for them to expect what effect the Kings death would worke, then to fall to blowes with them, who thought they could not lose their lives better then in accompanying their King; seeing moreover how the <hi>Swedes</hi> had received new Forces from <hi>Saxony</hi>; not finding any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in staying any longer in that Citie with their men who were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, and somewhat affrighted by the cowardice of some Officers who some few dayes after payd for their Treachery in <hi>Prage,</hi> he resolved to be gone; and therefore having reviewed his Forces, and given them new orders, he sent them towards <hi>Borne</hi> neere <hi>Pleise,</hi> and he himselfe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them that very day in the Reare with Troopes conducted by some Colonells, who were not so much wounded as were the rest. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Companies of Horse came up afterwards unto him, who being abroad to informe themselves of the Enemies condition, were not at the Battell: And having exhorted the Citizens to be mindfull of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, promising, that if they would so doe, he would keepe good correspondency with them, (as should appeare upon any future occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) he marched towards <hi>Bohemia,</hi> intending to Winter in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and in the meane time to expect what effects the Kings death would produce</p>
            <p>The newes of the Kings death was suddenly spread every where, and the successe thereof was confusedly discoursed of in divers parts; those who never heard that a King ranne any hazard in a Battell, were strangely and unusually astonished; to many the newes seemed an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion or Chimera, a very dreame; neither could it fall into their im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nation, that that King could be slaine, who not long before was surrounded with Victories and Triumphs, and who seemed not onely to have perswaded Fortune to partialitie, but to have subdued her. Others would have it, that this was but newes given abroad, to know what men would thinke thereof, and that the King was privately gone into <hi>Swethland</hi>; which secret departure of his was given out for his death. All the Protestant Princes were much cast downe, at this so important advertisement; words are not able to expresse the griefe which this losse caused in the <hi>Hauns</hi> Townes. There were many who wept for eight dayes together, and would take no sustenance; the Country people and Garrison-Souldiers moved pittie, whilst flocking together, and full of feare, scratching their heads, and looking like so many Lambes that had lost their flocke, they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55221:76"/>
ranne like mad men up and downe calling upon their King.</p>
            <p>The resentments of all other Princes were but shadowes in respect of the Elector of <hi>Saxonies</hi> sorrow, being strucke almost dead at the newes thereof; he spared not for teares or sighs, but broke forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such like speeches as this; The King of all valiant hearts is dead, the <hi>German</hi> liberty hath lost its onely prop. There was not any one in <hi>France, England</hi> nor <hi>Holland,</hi> who was not grieved at this misfortune. Those Kings and Princes confest a gallant King was dead, and that they had not words sufficient to expresse the griefe they thereat conceived: there was not any Nobleman, or Common Subject in those Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces who did not commisserate his losse: the Papists and those that were his Enemies, durst not hold up their heads as seeming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; the fame of his valour and of his civill comportments had not onely captivated the good will of his Souldiers, and his owne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but even the like of strangers and his very Enemies; never was Prince so beloved as hee, those who had never seen his Majesticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son coveted to injoy the sight thereof in effigies. Painters were never so much set on worke, as in drawing this Prince his picture, every one desired to have it; when it was brought downe into any Country where it had not formerly beene seen, the bringer of it was sure to want no visiters. There was not any one in <hi>Germany</hi> (Noble or not Noble) who did not make more esteem of it, then of any other pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in his house; the <hi>French, English</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> never stucke for price so they might have a Coppy. Hee was tall of stature, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what corpulent, of a Majesticall aspect, which wrought in men reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, admiration, love, and feare; his countenance was faire, mixt with red, his haire and beard flaxen, insomuch as he was called by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Yellow King: hee was not full out eight and thirty yeares old; from his Infancy he was addicted to warre, desirous of renowne, and ambitious of good repute; in all his actions he exprest wisedome, in all his speeches gracefull eloquence, in all his treaties affability; in his enterprises boldnesse, in businesse constancy, in difficult affaires dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, in battailes courage, in dangers undauntednesse, upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons watchfulnesse. In fine he was a Prince who knew all, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood all. Never was Commander served with greater applause and affection: he gave satisfaction to every one, either with praise, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, or affability: praise-worthy actions were by him written in Characters not to he razed out; he forgot not services received; he was pleasant in his discourse, not costly in his entertainments. He did not disdaine to speake with all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and many times as he walked before his people, and his Souldiers, he would aske them how they did, what they did, and what they would have? every private Cavalier or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was admitted to his Table, and to his Chamber; he had wont to say that the Table was the racke to wrest out secrets, the net where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to take affection and friendship: hee no wayes coveted cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies nor complements, and if any one not knowing his humour should use any such with him, he would in a jesting manner bid them keep their Courtship for the Queens Ladyes; for that he was in the field to teach to fight, not to learne to dance: he was very severe in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55221:77"/>
the Souldiers insolency, very dilligent in providing for the safety of his owne men: when he tooke any City belonging to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholique, hee would answer such Commanders as would advise him to lay heavie taxes upon the Citizens, and impose new lawes upon them;
<q>This is now my City, it belongs no more unto the Enemy; I am come to unfetter every mans liberty, not to imprison them; let them live as best pleaseth them, and as they have formerly done: I change no lawes to such as know how to live in those lawes that Religion hath ingrafted in them; new shooes doe often times pinch the foot too much.</q>
He made no difference in his treatings between Protestants and <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholiques; hee shewed himselfe equally affectionat to the one and to the orher, affirming,
<q>That they were all the workmanship of God: that hee thought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one believed well that observed the Kings lawes; that it was not the worke of a Prince to instruct his people how to keep out of hell, but that it belonged to Ecclesiasticall persons and Ministers of Gods word to doe that:</q>
whence it ensued that the <hi>Romanists</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing nothing but their native Prince, and that Protestants regaining their liberty of Conscience, his Empire and dominion was desired by the one and by the other:
<q>like a Philosophying Souldier, to witnesse the greatnesse of his minde, he never indeavoured the perfecting of any enterprise wherein his Souldiers might not run some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; hee was angry with those who would advise him to be carefull of his life and person; he thought the thought of death misbecame a Prince professing Armes; that the fancies of saving ones selfe were Counsels proffered by feare; he called them happy who dyed in their vocations; said death was a Voluntier who tooke pay of those that feared him most.</q>
Great were the designes of his taking up Armes; but after the victory of <hi>Leypzig</hi> they grew very vast, for he aspired at the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> which when hee should have gotten he thought it too narrow a bounds to his Commands, unlesse he should inlarge them over <hi>Italy,</hi> and other regions of Europe, yea, peradventure over the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. The Lord <hi>Paule Tresborg</hi> (who was his Leger Embassadour at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and in his returne homeward lay at my house) told me the very <hi>Turkes</hi> began to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the fortune and valour of this King; he had wont oft times to say, that our predecessors having had so valiant Commanders, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting so great enterprises, he wondered how now the world was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished of such men, and that this was the reason why many under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings failed of performance: to which being answered that this was occasioned through the divers use of Armes, and manner of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging warre, and the goodnesse of strong holds; hee replyed, that the diversity of Armes was nothing to be esteemed, but the diversity of hearts; that all <hi>Alexanders</hi> enterprises might be effected, <hi>Hanibals</hi> victories obteyned, and <hi>Caesars</hi> progresses be made, if the heart of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the minde of <hi>Haniball</hi> and <hi>Caesars</hi> daring were to be found. In two yeares space this valiant King drew over to side with him or else won two hundred ninty six Cities, Fortresses and walled Townes, which formerly obsequiously reverenced the Scepter of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55221:77"/>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the second. Hee won many victories in the field, but that of <hi>Leypzig</hi> crowned and immortalized his glory, since therein he overcame the worthiest and most victorious Commander of this our age, and an Army which growne gray-headed in Armes, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, knew not what it was to be worsted.</p>
            <p>By how much the Protestant party was afflicted at this great losse, and the rest who envyed the <hi>Austrian</hi> greatnesse, so much were the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists,</hi> and Church-men consolated thereby; for though many more curious then others listened with delight to the actions of the King, applauding them rather as things unusuall, the present times not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowne a King who would himselfe in person fight in the first Files against his Enemy; yet the feare of his proceedings, the doubt of having their rest and riches turned into labour and misery, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of having great taxations and contributions laid upon them to sustaine the <hi>Caesarian</hi> unsinew'd authority were very fitting occasions to cancell the affection they bore to the worth of this King, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle their hatred and envy of him; as was seen by the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they made in bonefires, musicke and all other outward shewes of joy, which gave the Protestants occasion of much murmurre, who said thus to rejoyce for the death of a man was barbarous, execrable, and inhumane; yet many there were that slighted these Jubilies, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his glory was the greater, by how much more estimation they put upon his losse.</p>
            <p>Yet amongst these mirths and jollities the <hi>Imperialists</hi> were not free from paying tribute of some teares, for they were very sensible of the death of <hi>Godfrey</hi> Count <hi>Pappenheime,</hi> and more particularly the Ecclesiasticall Princes about <hi>Westfalia,</hi> who had been by him and his worth defended against the imminent &amp; inevitable dangers that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, bewailing (as it became them) the losse of a benefactor, more then rejoycing at the like of an Enemy, were much afflicted thereat. Their lamentation could not be held backe, by their rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for the Kings death; which not being thereby allayd, shewes the force of their affection to this Commander.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godfrey</hi> Count <hi>Pappenheime</hi> was by birth an <hi>Alman,</hi> of noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, and excellent education: he applyed himselfe from his first yeares to the warres, and passing though all degrees of preferment, he at last arrived to the Command of being one of <hi>Caesars</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, a place of great esteem and no small consequence; the first proofes he gave of his worth and valour was in the defence of <hi>Riva di Chianena,</hi> in the <hi>Valtaline,</hi> which was playd upon by the <hi>French,</hi> where he raised his renowne, and made men curious to inquire after his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture actions; behaving himselfe afterwards no lesse couragiously in <hi>Germany,</hi> he appeared more worthy to command then to serve; and therefore being advanced to the place of Lieutenant-generall of the Catholique League he did more then satisfie the expectation that was had of him.</p>
            <p>In the most difficult actions he was couragious, in advers fortune not moved, in making of matches politique, in deliberation bold, in Counsell well advised, modest in victory, severe in execution, in his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55221:78"/>
dealings affable; in fine he was in all things vigilant, expert, valiant, mercifull, and magnanimous; the many scarres wherewith his face was adorned, were the Characters wherin his good service was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; the love and reverence the Souldiers bore him testified his civill and noble carriage; the good repute his very Enemies had of him published his ineffable worth to be without spot; his estimation and renowne were the Trumpets of his valour and experience. <hi>Germany</hi> hath not produced a privat Gentleman of so mature an understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of so diligent a mind, of so sprightly a wit, nor one so generous: he never undertooke any enterprise, before he had well weighed what the event and consequence thereof might be; he met with no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he found not some meanes to overcome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee prised not any preferment, profit, or interest, wherein his particular person was concerned; he was held to be in all things zealous to his masters ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, desirous of reputation, and ambitious of glory;
<q>he had wont to say to some of his friends, who would perswade him to be more sparing of the monyes that were paid him; that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve well of a Prince did not consist in having ones chests full of Gold; that Souldiers loved not there, where their Captaines were too mindefull of themselves; that a faithfull Servant could have no more glorious title then that of <hi>Banckrout</hi>;</q>

            <p>The <hi>Imperialists</hi> being gone from <hi>Leypzig, Offchirch</hi> hasted with three Regiments of Horse, and presented himselfe before the gates thereof: the Inhabitants received him quickly within their wals, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well out of the duty they ought to the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> their naturall Prince, as out of the love they bore to those of the Protestant party.

            <p>This Towne being taken, <hi>Kniphausen,</hi> the <hi>Swedish</hi> Marshall of the Field went with six Regiments of Foot and Horse to joyne with <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi> who stayd with 3000 Souldiers before the Castle of <hi>Leypzig,</hi> and he quartered the rest of his Forces about <hi>Aldenburg,</hi> a walled Towne with weake and ancient Fortifications, neere <hi>Pleis,</hi> betweene <hi>Borne</hi> and <hi>Zwika.</hi> The <hi>Imperialists</hi> stoutly answered the enemies out-rage from the Castle; when the Wind mills, which were for the service of the Garrison, being be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> this meane while made divers progresses in <hi>Alsatia</hi>; in particular, he took <hi>Benfield,</hi> one of the most important places of that Province, guirt about with five Royal Bulworks, though not very great ones, with Ditches and halfe Moones, in a spacious open Country, not farre from the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> upon the side of <hi>Ill</hi> (a River which comming

            <p>The <hi>Imperialists</hi> on the other part had thought to have surprized 500 <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse within their quarters, and had therefore dispatched away Forces to effect that designe; but Colonell <hi>Comoschi</hi> knowing of it got on horse-back, and nimbly pursuing them with his Regiment, and some other Troopes belonging to Colonell <hi>Schavalischi,</hi> set upon them at unawares, whilst they thought to have entred <hi>Edengham,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of let; and though at the beginning of the skirmish neither side seemed to have the best, he inforced the <hi>Caesarians</hi> to return to their quarters with the losse of their Colonell <hi>Cronech,</hi> being rather beaten back and overcome by the advantage of the seat, and unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted chance, which is usuall in such cases to cause great confusion and hinder businesses otherwise projected, then by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces.</p>

            <p>Amongst these particulars, <hi>Oxesterne</hi> the Lord Chancellour knew, that to wage Warre with many Forces under severall Commanders of equall power, must occasion discord, division, and disobedience; and therefore knowing very well, that it was necessary to ordaine a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique order concerning the present affaires, to bridle the Military li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse, whereby mens meanes were wasted without discretion, though friends and confederates, and to agree upon Contributions to maintaine the Warre; hee required a Dyet to be held by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues in <hi>Neilbrun,</hi> a Towne in <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> wherein he desired the necessity of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon interest might be weighed, &amp; that order might be taken for the preservation of their State.

They therefore forthwith sent for the Prince of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> (who was then in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Army)
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55221:85"/>
for <hi>Harnem,</hi> and all the wisest men of their side, to come to <hi>Dresden,</hi> that they might advise upon this particular, and to argue what resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they should give to <hi>Walesteines</hi> Propositions: It was therefore propounded, whether they ought to accept of Peace, or prosecute the Warre; those that were for Peace, wrought thereunto by huge Gifts, and mightie promises made them by <hi>Walesteine,</hi> said:
<q>That his Highnesse had hitherto managed the Warre with little profit, and great expences, since he hath got nothing thereby but the being num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongst the confederates of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ethland,</hi> and one of those that had maintained Warre against the Emperour; wherein if he had as yet profited but little, he was likely to profit lesse; since that if the <hi>Austrians</hi> had preserved themselves against the first brunts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set upon in so many parts, what would the event of these affaires be if every day strengthened by <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, by <hi>Indian</hi> Gold, and by the worth of their Commanders, who affectionately applyed themselves to the service of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Walesteine,</hi> they should acrew to that power as in appearance they were likely to doe? That those Princes are said to be very wise, who fore-seeing future ruine, can apply remedies whereby to prevent it before it come; That Peace was never to be refused when the accepting of it may make for profit and reputation; that times were not alwayes the same, but changeable, and that men did ost times repent the not having entertained such occasion as time hath offered; that the occasions, wherefore the Warre was undertaken, ought to be considered, and the ends thereof, which if they were obtained, men ought to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, since the fortune of Warre doth oft-times favour, when kept within bounds, and doth forsake those who transcend them; that the <hi>Imperiall</hi> greatnesse was already sufficiently lessened, and consequently the vapours thereof extinguished, which the ambition of her Officers had raysed up; that the <hi>Swedes</hi> were borne forward by advantage; that it was not good to cherish them any longer in their bosomes; that the pleasures of <hi>Germany</hi> were too much thirsted after by the Ministers of that Crown; that they Treated with the Princes of the Empire with restlesse pretensions; that one of the chiefest Electors of <hi>Germany</hi> ought not to comply with the will of men come from forth Woods and Mountaines; that he ought to indeavour not to dis-member himselfe from the Empire, to preserve himselfe with those that were strangers thereunto, who already give proofes of their immense designes: and what would they be if they should obtaine their vast ends upon the Empier? That an union of many was of no long lasting, that every one had his particular Maximes, so as it would be hard to find an agreement amongst so many differing opinions, geniouses, and interests; that it was better to accept of an offer made, then to pursue it when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</q>
These Reasons strongly urged by some <hi>Spanioliz'd</hi>-Officers, wrought very much upon the Elector, who was exceedingly inclined to Peace, and did not a little prevaile with <hi>Oxesterne,</hi> and other <hi>Swedish</hi> Ministers of State, whose intentions were not good, yet were they not able to get a resolution, so as what had beene formerly alledged,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55221:86"/>
was discreetly opposed by others,
<q>who urged the tye of Religion, crying downe the ends of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> and their by-gon behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards that Elector, shewing how hee was rewarded for his friendship, by the Invasion made into his State by <hi>Tilly</hi>: declaring the hatred borne by Ecclesiasticks to Protestants, and (which was of greater moment) wounding him with the calling to mind the Emperours late published Edict touching the restitution of the goods taken from the Church; and remembring him of the means whereby hee might so conveniently acquit himselfe thereof, and free himselfe from those jealousies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though hee was on the one side Counselled by his desire of Peace, and his emulation of the Chancellour <hi>Oxesterne,</hi> and affrighted on the other side by suspition of the <hi>Austrians</hi> behaviour, hee resolved not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, by not refusing to treat of an accommodation, to keep <hi>Walesteine</hi> in hopes, and by not giving way to the Propositions, to put diffidence in the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and to conclude a suspension of Armes, as did insue, for two moneths, all of them retiring themselves to their quarters, and re-assuming their former negotiations.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Berchenfelt</hi> who was till now left with his men in the parts of <hi>Vetterania,</hi> incouraged by <hi>Baudis,</hi> who still desirous to invade the State of <hi>Coln,</hi> grew impatient of effecting his desires, and who had invited him to joyne with him, so to re-inforce his Forces, as that enterprise was propounded, invited by the likelyhood of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, he patted from those parts with his men which were about 5000 Souldiers, and joyning with some other Troopes marched thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> was during this in <hi>Swabenland,</hi> (no whit at all fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> who were now farre from that Country,) plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Country, and bringing what he got into <hi>Vlm</hi> and <hi>Biberack</hi>: when <hi>Aldringer</hi> went unexpectedly with some Regiments towards <hi>Rain,</hi> making the Governour of that place believe, by counterfeit signes and false names, that his men were some of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Troops, sent upon some enterprise against the <hi>Imperialists</hi>; and being favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a thicke mist, which that morning darkened the sky, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Swedes</hi> from discovering the Country, he without bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed entered the City; wherein leaving a good Garrison, he with the rest of his Army went towards <hi>Auspurg,</hi> imagining to meet with as good fortune in the surprisall of it: but <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> hearing hereof, made all the haste he could thitherward to hinder him.</p>
            <p>Much about this time the arrivall of the most illustrious <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Infant of <hi>Spayne,</hi> Brother to the most Catholique King, was expected in <hi>Milan</hi>; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> purposing to send this Prince into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to take upon him the government of those Provinces whereof there was very great need, for that the illustrious <hi>Infanta Clara Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> was now growne very old, and those people not being willing to be commanded by any, but by some Prince of the Blood-Royall of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and it behoving him to have considerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to get into those Provinces, not onely to open the way unto him, but likewise to re-inforce their Armies, and for his greater credit, the

be to the <hi>Swededs</hi> to take <hi>Villinghen</hi> which was besieged by the <hi>Wirten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berghers</hi> (since besides the incumbrance it was to the parts therabouts, it hindrered the <hi>Wirtenbergers</hi> joyning with the Townes that were towards the <hi>Rhyn</hi>) he marched thitherwards, thinking to effect his designe, and then to make use of the men that were imployed in that service elsewhere; but whil'st hee was upon his march, hee was by fresh advertisement called backe into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> for feare of the Duke of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> so as he speedily went with all his men to re-inforce the Marshall <hi>Turlach.</hi> The like did his Brother Count <hi>Phillipe,</hi> with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he had drawne out of the neighbouring quarters and Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. The <hi>Wirtenberghers</hi> this meane while hasted to accomplish the taking of <hi>Vilinghon,</hi> who they said had cunningly prolonged the taking thereof, for that if they had ended that siege (there remaining no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else wherein to imploy themselves in those parts) they should have been necessitated to have gone to re inforce the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army, and not onely submit themselves to be commanded by the Generall thereof, but (as it is usuall to put men of least respect upon the most toylsome actions) they would have been subjected to heavy dutyes to the dishonour of their Prince.</p>
            <p>The Forces which were raised in <hi>Milan</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being in a readinesse to passe into <hi>Germany,</hi> to the succour of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>-men fearing lest if they should not passe through the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> they might indeavour to possesse themselves of the passages of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> through intelligence had with some that were well wishers to the <hi>Austrian</hi> party, and minded their owne profit, 32 Companies of <hi>French</hi> Foot, and two of Horse, were with diligence sent to those parts, which the <hi>Switzers</hi> permitted to passe, to the end that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of those passes or passages might be minded by such re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements; for the <hi>French</hi> who were no wayes pleased with such Leagues, did much apprehend lest, either surprised by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or drawne by friendship, they might be drawne to side with them; the free accesse of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> to fall upon any occasion into the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> and to shut out from the State of <hi>Milan</hi> that Connexion which it here makes with <hi>Germany</hi> being of great importance. After these was moreover sent <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> a well experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and of an acute wit, with absolute Command, who though it were commonly bruted amongst Souldiers, and other people desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of novelty, that he would fall into the <hi>Valteline</hi> to disturbe the passage of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet had he not order so to doe, nor men suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for that purpose; for these Companyes were so defective, as they did not in all conteine 800 Foot though the King paid for above 2000. as likewise the <hi>French</hi> had not then any such resolution; for that they would not be the first that should seem to breake the peace with the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> being in their power (a weighty impediment) as also not to hinder the severall Provinces of <hi>Italy</hi> from weakning themselves, by sending out their Souldiers, and to weaken the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> of their Forces; for afterwards upon the first occasion of breaking with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they might have the better advantage by setting upon them at unawares, and in a time when
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55221:92"/>
they should have sent out all their necessary defence, barring up the Passages of the <hi>Valteline</hi> then; for so it would be easier for them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, then whilst those of <hi>Milan</hi> were full of people, at every least noyse of the stirring of the <hi>French,</hi> they as being neerer might have first prevented them before they should have been entred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and would have made themselves masters therof, which was indeed their desire; and which would have been very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious aswell to the <hi>French,</hi> as to other Princes. These were the reasons likewise why they deferred the performance of their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Grisons,</hi> and made it be so noysed about to cloake their desire of not pulling upon them so heavy a warre; though some who subscribed to the flattery of their owne desires, spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad opinions, that they would not shut up the <hi>Spaniards</hi> passage, for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> going to molest <hi>Germany,</hi> not well tollerated by that Nation, which not accustomed to the usuall hardnesse of lying in the field, by falling short in their numbers, and miscarrying, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Spaniards</hi> power, or by preserving themselves, to cause more feare in the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and make them when they should be in great need of their assistance, fly unto them for protection, and make offer of those places unto them, which could not (but by necessity) be taken, that thus whether the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should be victorious or losers, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Forces out of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> was very advantagious for the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this uncertainty of times, and present revolutions, <hi>Heydelberg</hi> the Metropolis of the lower <hi>Palatinat</hi> (which some moneths before was besieged by the <hi>Swedes</hi>) was constantly kept by the <hi>Imperialists</hi>; whereupon the old <hi>Ringrave</hi> who commanded the Forces that were before it finding that every longer delay withdrew much from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and knowing how behovefull it was, that that Towne should be taken, before the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces should have past the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, or that the levies in <hi>Lorayne</hi> were in a readinesse; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary how advantagious it would be for the <hi>Austrians</hi> to have that place, as a safe retreat for their Forces, very fitting to lye before <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> so as where he perceived force would not availe he applied cunning, and resolved to make use of a stratagem; he therefore held intelligence with some Inhabitants of the City, who were no wayes inclined to the <hi>Caesarian</hi> party; the businesse was luckily carryed by meanes of a Drummer who imployed about the ransome of prisoners past frequently between the Camp and the Towne; he therefore made some of his Souldiers by night swim the River, who being let in by the aforesaid intelligence, possest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of that side of the Towne or Suburbs which was next the Champion, or open Country, and let in the <hi>Swedes</hi>: whereupon the Castle wanting Victuall and supply ere long yeelded, and 300 <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> who had the Guard thereof, marched out of it on the first of <hi>Iune,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <p>But if the <hi>Swedes</hi> advanced in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> the <hi>Imperialists</hi> were not idle in <hi>Slesia,</hi> for falling upon one of the <hi>Saxons</hi> quarters they cut many in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55221:92"/>
pieces, tooke many prisoners, and brought away good bootie. At this time likewise, fortie Carriages of Marchandize which went from <hi>Auspurg</hi> to <hi>Vim,</hi> were taken in <hi>Swabenland</hi> by 400 Crabats.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> seeing <hi>Waymer</hi> and <hi>Horne</hi> departed from his Territories, bethought himselfe to drive the Enemy from <hi>Neuburg,</hi> (which lying upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> betweene <hi>Dunawart</hi> and <hi>Ingolstat,</hi> much affrighted the neighbouring parts;) by the taking whereof, he should not onely bring his Forces to flank upon <hi>Dunawert,</hi> but by his re-inforced Garrison therein, would have kept the <hi>Swedes</hi> in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all suspition, and have made them forbeare their inrodes. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore raysed his Army from before <hi>Monaco,</hi> and together with <hi>Aldrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> presented themselves before the Walls thereof, from whence they were saluted with divers Cannon-shot; for the Garrison being incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by <hi>Horne</hi> (who at the newes hereof, having quitted his quarters and passed over the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Dunawert,</hi> hasted for their succour) they vigorously persisted to defend their imperfect Walls, yet all this would not doe, for the Towne being streightly beset by <hi>Aldringer,</hi> (who began to be ashamed that he had spent so much time in taking a Towne which was by every one given for lost) it was forced to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before <hi>Horne</hi> could bring succour.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was not this meane while lesse diligent before <hi>Rimberg,</hi> for streightning it continually more and more, and not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to be succoured by 7000 choice <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who used their best skill to get into it, the Towne not able longer to resist the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> yeelded, and tooke Lawes from the Enemy; the taking hereof was a great detriment to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in those Provinces, and very available to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> since thereby they inlarged their bounds towards the Electorate of <hi>Coln,</hi> and opened the way on that side along the <hi>Rhyn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperors Army, and the like of the Duke of <hi>Saxons</hi> were yet in <hi>Slesia,</hi> facing each other, so as <hi>Walestein,</hi> perceiving there was no way to drive Forreiners out of the Empire, but by being reconciled to <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (for he very well understood the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Forces could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd to their former splendor, nor yet <hi>Germany</hi> freed from the incursio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of strangers, without good correspondency had with that Prince, who with a flourishing state and considerable Army flanked upon <hi>Bohemia,</hi> a Kingdome that lay open on that side, so as it behoved <hi>Imperialists</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to guard it by a great power of men, or leave it to the discretion of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces, and that the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Forces being either the one or the other way divided, could neither advance further in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, nor yet could perfectly defend themselves on all sides;) hee re-assumed with forged designes the Treatie of Peace by him so much desired, and propounded a new suspension of Armes, which was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Elector, as making much for his advantage; for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Forces were very much greater then were his; and <hi>Walestein,</hi> feigning to expect an answer from <hi>Vienna,</hi> he held the Elector and his Counsellours in hand, (which by his mony he made his friends) seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be very ambitious of their friendship. <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by some Fugitives, how that a Convoy of <hi>Bavarians</hi> were going
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55221:93"/>
into <hi>Newmarch,</hi> with many Waine-loades of Victualls to replenish that Citie, he straight put foot in stirrop, galloped after them, and being come up unto them, broke some Companies of Crabats that were their guides, and tooke the Provisions from them; he then came before the Citie, and raysed his batteries in fitting places against it; the defendants did for some dayes make good their Partie against him; but at the last, seeing the <hi>Swedes</hi> ready to make a faire assault, and fearing, lest with the Citie they might lose their lives, they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Towne, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> were let in.</p>
            <p>The 15 dayes of Truce, concluded betweene <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Walesteine,</hi> were already past. The Elector, who saw himselfe so much intreated, hoysted his pretensions much higher; <hi>Walesteine,</hi> who though he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much desired Peace, could not in reason yeeld unto the Elector, for he stirred not a whit from his resolution of having the <hi>Swedes</hi> likewise included, whose vast pretensions the Emperour could not otherwise satisfie then with the Sword; the Treatie broke off, for the Elector would make no resolution without the consent of all his Colleagues, nor would <hi>Walesteine</hi> doe any thing which might withdraw from the value and estimation which he coveted to preserve himselfe in. Inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therefore at these unfortunate lets, and the impediments he met withall in all these Treaties, be suddenly set upon <hi>Sweinitz,</hi> but he lost many men in sundry assaults which he made, being moved rather there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto out of anger then for any hopes he had of good successe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that by this hostilitie might the sooner bring the Elector to conclude a Peace. The Citie being succoured by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke the enterprise to keepe himselfe from losing more men, which by reason of their scarcitie were much prized by him.</p>
            <p>At this time Count <hi>Crats</hi> commanded the Duke of <hi>Bavarias</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he was a well verst Souldier, and one who had given good proofe of his experience in Warre.

               </gap>nted with the actions of such as bore him ill will, <hi>Crats</hi> resolved to be reveng'd of them. He therefore, by meanes of a Trumpeter, who upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of ransome of prisoners, past and re-past betweene the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, gave <hi>Horne</hi> to understand, that he desired to speake with some one that might be confided in concerning a businesse of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Horne</hi> (who had already found <hi>Crats</hi> his discontentment) liste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hereunto, and applyed himselfe unto the businesse; so as some few dayes after, at which time he sent his Trumpeter touching the ransome of some prisoners, <hi>Crats</hi> discovered, how that being unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy used by <hi>Walesteine,</hi> and but coldly looked upon by the Duke his Master, he was resolved to quit the service, and make it appeare what prejudice they did unto themselves who evilly intreat their servants, or suffer them to be misprised by their Officers; that therefore he would deliver up <hi>Ingolstat</hi> into the hand of the <hi>Swedes</hi>; the Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (ambitious to appeare a good negotiator in a businesse of such weight) incouraged <hi>Crats</hi> with hopes of great preferment: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some Companies being about this time expected in exchange of some of the Garrison, he agreed with the Trumpeter, that he should acquaint <hi>Horne,</hi> how that he would have him advance towards the Towne, the night before the comming of the others, for that he would make the other Officers believe that they were the expected recruits, and so let them into the Citie. The Trumpeter, who very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood <hi>Crats</hi> his meaning, informed <hi>Gustavus Horne</hi> punctually there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of who was well pleased with this Plot; and beleeving it to be a thing very feacible, he re-advertised <hi>Crats,</hi> that he would not faile to send fitting Forces at the appoynted time; he therefore communicated this designe to <hi>Schavalichi</hi> a valiant Colonell, who was to take the charge of this enterprise, and who made choice of 1000 Horse and 2000 Foot, and did with those secretly and opportunely present him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before the gates of <hi>Ingolstat</hi> on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May.</hi>

Princes receive much advantage by the comming over of such Commanders who have served the Enemy, since thereby they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Enemies proceedings, and intentions, and for that by the good usage of such, others may be invited to doe the same, <hi>Crats</hi> who was a man of eminent place and much verst in the affaires of warre, was in a small time preferred to be Marshall of that Army.</p>
            <p>This new resolution of <hi>Crats,</hi> (who had alwayes been held to be of an uncorrupted faith) seemed strange, and afforded diversity of thoughts to many who deemed he might easily have delivered up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Swedes</hi> that City wherein he commanded in Chiefe; and it did open the eyes of such, and make them better advised, who indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to injure a man doe notwithstanding leave him meanes to revenge himselfe.</p>
            <p>This plot not succeeding, <hi>Holke</hi> marched towards <hi>Vilsbourg,</hi> and <hi>Waymer</hi> (that he might hinder him from taking of <hi>Neumarch</hi>) sent Colonell <hi>Plat</hi> with 4000 Souldiers towards <hi>Wolfesteim,</hi> some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of met with the Crabats, skirmisht with them, and after a long fight with equall fortune there perished on both sides about 100 men.

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorayne</hi> having got together a Body of 8000 fighting men, was ill advised by his Officers, who had drawne him on with flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing but fruitlesse hopes, and was perswaded by that confidence which makes the greatest designes answerable to desire, though hee was advertised by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (who were preparing in <hi>Lombardy</hi> to passe over into <hi>Alsatia</hi>) not to take in hand any new designe, till such time as they were come with their Forces to the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> which being joyned with the <hi>Lorayners,</hi> they did not onely thinke to drive the <hi>Swedes</hi> from thence, but entering into <hi>Lorayne,</hi> to defend that Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the Invasion of the <hi>French</hi>; a businesse which tended much to their ends; for by bringing their Forces into that state, they did not onely thinke to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from breaking in thereinto, which they should alwayes afterwards have feared in <hi>Alsatia</hi> and <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emberg,</hi> but putting Garrisons into <hi>Nancy, Mota,</hi> and other the best Townes of that State, they should make themselves absolute arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that Princes will, they should open the way to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thorow this Country into <hi>France</hi> upon any occasion of breach, they should make their journy more safe and short from <hi>Germany, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and assuring themselves that the <hi>French</hi> would not so easily bring their Forces upon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> nor set footing in <hi>Germany,</hi> whilst <hi>Lorayne</hi> stood in defence of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> who hardly quit those places they are once possest of, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> being far from receiving assistance from that Crowne, and invironed by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> they would make but small aboad in those Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were slenderly inhabited, uncultivated, and already consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the misfortune of warre.</p>
            <p>The Duke disquieted by the Counsell of those who were ambitious to shew their valour before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should partake of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

was perswaded to make his men advance into <hi>Alsatia</hi>; and raise the Siege of <hi>Haghenaw.</hi> Some are of opinion, that the Duke was hereunto perswaded by some who depended upon <hi>France,</hi> to the end that he breaking his promise made unto the King, such an occasion might put the <hi>French</hi> upon the possessing themselves of that State, before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should come thither; at which the <hi>French</hi> were not a litle troubled: for that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should (as they easily might) nestle themselves here together with the re-inforcements which by the addition from <hi>Flanders, Germany, Burgunies,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> they might receive, and peradventure of some turbulent <hi>French,</hi> these last (the nature of whose nation it is to shew their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hands before the Marriage should be consummated, he would break the Match, he resolved to send her disguised in Pages apparell, attended upon by three of his most intimate Friends to her Husband into <hi>Flanders,</hi> which insued without any interruption.

The King gave gracious eare to what the Cardinall said, and replyd; How that the Duke without any occasion had given himselfe over to very evill Councell, that he had so oft broke promise with him, as he could not now any longer trust him, that therefore his firme intention was to secure himselfe of all the Dukes Forts and strong holds, during the present Commotions in <hi>Germany</hi>; and that he would have the Princesse <hi>Marguerit</hi> in his custody; and that when these things should be willingly yeelded unto by the Duke, he should then taste the effects of his Clemency.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall having by these mannerly excuses moderated the Kings anger, and saved himselfe from apparent danger, was not not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding herewithall satisfied, as indeed it made but little for him; for the King saw well enough that all this was but cunning to deferre the time till the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces should be arrived; wherefore the Cardinall, seeing himselfe invironed on all sides by the <hi>French,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no succour nigh, and finding the <hi>Spanish</hi> promises not likely to take effect, agreed to surrender up unto his Majestie the New Citie of <hi>Nancy,</hi> to discard forthwith such people as were there in pay, to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that the Princesse <hi>Marguerit</hi> should be put into his Majesties hands, and totally to relinquish the <hi>Austrian</hi> union.

The Cardinall, after having reproached the Duke for his sinister comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55221:96"/>
totally averse to the Rules of good State-government, he in the Kings name demanded of him the Old Citie, expressing an intention, that when the Duke should make good his promises, the King would courteously restore all unto him, whose aimes were not to take what belonged to another, but only to secure himselfe of such a ones loyaltie, who by failing therein might prejudice the Crowne of <hi>France.</hi> The Duke, who very well knew how hard a matter it was to get strong holds out of the hands of powerfull men when they were once possest of them, was not well pleased with this proposition, but being much vext and troubled thereat, indeavoured by reasons pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with promises, and other proffers to be therein excused; but the Cardinall replying, that his instructions were to secure himselfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of the Old Towne, which by all meanes he must have, and threat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> likewise apprehending danger of his own life, signed the agreement, &amp; caused the Town to be delivered up into the hands of the Kings Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; but upon these conditions, that neither should the Citizens be disarm'd, nor the Duke deprived of his Revenue.

            <p>Whilst these businesses were in hand, the Duke of <hi>Fearia</hi> made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day more haste then other, whereby he made the <hi>French</hi>-men fear that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> designe was to passe into <hi>Loreyne</hi> when they should have freed <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and to make Saint <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Ringrave</hi> hearing of the <hi>Loreyners</hi> motion towards <hi>Hagenaw</hi> rose from before the Siege of <hi>Brisach</hi> with his Regiment of Horse, and with 1500 Foot of the neighbouring parts, and marched speedily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Pfalsberg</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Alsatia</hi>; but as soone as he had set footing on those Frontiers, 'twas said the <hi>French</hi> wished him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare any hostility against those Townes that belonged to the Duke, for that they neither required nor stood in need of his Forces to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him.

undertaking, leaving about 30 of their men behinde them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many wounded in that action. Yet must we not forget the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a <hi>Scotch</hi> Souldier who was of Major Generall <hi>Ruthens</hi> Troope, and offered himselfe to bring some Prisoner to <hi>Horne,</hi> who much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it, that hee might learne the Condition of the City; this man being one of the formost, ventered so forward in the breach, as that laying hands on one of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> who stood in the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he dragg'd him through the Ditch, and presented him to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>About 10000 Foot and 2000 Horse of <hi>Neopolitans, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Lumbards,</hi> were at this time gathered together in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and yet great preparations were made by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> who though they made the occasion of this their Arming to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of succouring <hi>Germany,</hi> and (as it had been generally noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) to conduct therewithall the Cardinall <hi>Infante</hi> (who had been at <hi>Milan</hi> ever since the midst of the preceding <hi>May</hi>) to the government of <hi>Flanders</hi>; yet wanted there not many jealousies, that this was only a piece of craft or cunning of that Nation, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leavy men in <hi>Italy</hi>; not so much to succour <hi>Flanders,</hi> as out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that if in this interim things should go well in <hi>Germany,</hi> they might make use thereof in some important new affaire in that Province: for many were of opinion that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not suffer the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and their Forces there so apt to disturbe their designs in <hi>Italy,</hi> since thereby their pretensions of being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Arbitrators of all the affaires between the Princes of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> was much lessened, whilst by this neighbourhood of the <hi>French,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> who formerly did depend upon them, was discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be totally falne off from them, and to declare himselfe openly for the <hi>French.</hi> The Common-wealth of <hi>Genua</hi> was not so obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them, as of late it had been: the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> (who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deserved well of the Crowne of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and shewed himselfe partiall in that behalf) had declared himselfe a free Prince, and to have no dependency on them: and for that the suffering of the <hi>French</hi> to get head in <hi>Italy,</hi> was a diminishing of the power possessed by them, so as they tooke into consideration how they might keep the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in their former obsequency, and keep under the greatnesse of <hi>France.</hi> Thus men found in their grave wisedomes, that it was not yet fitting time for the <hi>Infante</hi> to part from <hi>Milan,</hi> and that his going from thence was for two reasons to be deferred; the one for that the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces, unlesse seconded by those of the Emperour, being of themselves weake and not able to overcome the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by so many Victories, if they should passe over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and not be faithfully seconded by <hi>Walesteine</hi> (who was not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well satisfied with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whereby he might not be suffered to passe further) much dishonour might redound to their Army; the other for that if he should goe from <hi>Milan,</hi> they should not so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde meanes, without his assistance how to order their affaires in securing themselves of the jealousies they had of <hi>France,</hi> and keep the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces, who formerly depended on them, in their fealty. It
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55221:100"/>
was resolved therefore, that the Infant should stay at <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> should with the Army passe over the Mountaines to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Brisach</hi>; since that, if <hi>Brisach</hi> were lost in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> all their hopes were lost of ever recovering such another Province, or of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Lorayne,</hi> as it was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intentions to doe; and this being their way to passe from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Flanders,</hi> they were by all meanes to endeavour the preservation thereof; but for that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the authoritie granted by the Emperour to <hi>Walesteine,</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Generalissimo</hi> over all the Forces in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> could not come thither with <hi>Walesteines</hi> satisfaction, without having a dependency on him; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thinking it tended to their dishonour, that a Generall of theirs, a Subject of so great birth, should be subordinate to one, (who before by favour and fortune, he was arrived at this height) would have thought it a great honour to be Colonell under a <hi>Spanish</hi> Generall; it therefore not being yeelded unto, that he should depend upon any one but the Emperour, though it was forseene that <hi>Walesteine</hi> would be much scandalized thereat, and that some mischance might thereupon ensue, yet by meanes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> had his Pattent signed to be Captaine independant upon any one, save upon the Princes of <hi>Austria.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> this meane while not failing to arme afresh in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> applyed themselves to raise jealousies of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> They were beyond measure troubled, that <hi>Edward Farnesh</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> varying from the Maximes of his Predecessours (who alwayes shewed themselves to be well affected unto, and to depend upon <hi>Spain</hi>) should as well in his apparell as in his Treaties follow the genius of <hi>France,</hi> and that he did not adheare as his Ancestors had done to their Councells; and they were much more injealousied by reason of the alliance concluded by the great Duke of <hi>Tuskany</hi> without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; for the Duke his Father, having alwayes borne respect to the Crowne of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and by the advice of that King married <hi>Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandina,</hi> they by the reverence of the Father challenged the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the Sonne: Wherefore, that they might the better discover his intention, they dispatcht away the Regent-<hi>Villani</hi> to <hi>Parma,</hi> with instructions to invite him to take upon the government of the Forces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as formerly his Uncle Duke <hi>Alexander</hi> had done; (a meanes whereby they thought more clearely to discover his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards them:) who when he was come unto the Duke; though he managed his negotiation with much dexteritie, he at last discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Highnesse genius to be adverse unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and by his refusall to goe into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to admit of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrison in the Citadell of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> he openly made it knowne, that he would live like a free Prince, and no wayes depending upon the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; so as <hi>Villani,</hi> bringing but a bad report of him to <hi>Milan</hi>; and from thence, sending the like information to <hi>Spaine,</hi> his Resident received but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome usage; some Towns of the <hi>Piacentian</hi> Territories being pincht by <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrisons, and an Agent of his being dispatcht away to the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that many of the Emperours Forces had been quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55221:101"/>
in his Towns; he was but hardly handled by the Kings Officers, not having so much as Audience allowed him, which was the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the breach betweene the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and this Prince, as shall in his proper place be said.</p>
            <p>They could not moreover endure, that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> should live under the protection of, and be dependent upon the Crowne of <hi>France</hi>; and it was reported, That they held negotiation under hand with the Infanta <hi>Marguerita,</hi> that she should marry the Princesse <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to the Infant, and at the same time by forcing away that Princesse, surprize <hi>Mantua,</hi> and in her right to have just cause to invade <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> which they easily might have done, if Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> who was watchfull over his owne affaires, and was faithfully advertised of all their proceedings, had not applyed speedy and fitting remedies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; for knowing the importancy of the affaire, he instantly sent the Infanta <hi>Marguerita</hi> out of the Citie, and taking good order for the safeguard of his businesses, he made the <hi>Spanish</hi> machinations vanish into smoake; and the Infanta being brought to <hi>Pavia,</hi> after she had beene a while in that Citie (where she was alwayes nobly treated by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) she was afterwards sent for into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and declared to be the Vice-Queene of <hi>Portugall.</hi>

work it so that the <hi>Swedes</hi> should give over that enterprise: But this pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>position carrying but little soliditie with it, was quickly poised by the answer of Count <hi>Volfegg,</hi> who replyed, he did not thinke the <hi>Switzers</hi> were able to undertake such a worke; for if they were not able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Swedes</hi> from passing over the <hi>Rhyn</hi> at <hi>Steine,</hi> nor to make them quit their Territories, they were lesse able to keep that which belonged not to them; that the Emperour was his Master; that he received Laws from noman else; and that with the loyaltie that became a Gentleman of honour, he would keepe the Town against whosoever as long as he had breath.</p>

            <p>The comming of foure piece of great Cannon was expected, for those they had did little good by reason of the smalnesse of their Boat, and the Duke of <hi>Berchenfield</hi> was arrived with 4000 Foot and 3000 Horse: When newes came, that <hi>Aldringer</hi> being already parted out of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> was upon his march with 20 Regiments of Horse, and 4000 Foot, and that he had already taken <hi>Biberach,</hi> being notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding followed by D. <hi>Weymar,</hi> who was not far from the <hi>Swedish</hi> Camp. The generall assault which was intended to be made, were it either that they stayd for the comming of these men, or that they would not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard themselves in vaine, there being a great new succour entred the Towne (which added to those that were already there, and made about 8000 Foot) or for some other reason, or for their good successe, for which the <hi>Swedes</hi> had already used all the devotions which in like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they are used to doe, was deferr'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Weymar</hi> being this meane while come to <hi>Gutleiben,</hi> (which was <hi>Hornes</hi> quarter) with the Colonells, <hi>Rotutchin, Vistem, Ransaw, Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> (prime Commanders of that Army) and having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him, after about an houres secret discourse concerning the present emergencies, he immediately returned to <hi>Cheli,</hi> where about his men lay. The next day, when the great Cannon appeared, those who were desirous of it, were confirmed in their opinion that the Siege should be longer continued, and the generall assault should be indeavoured. But they soone found the error of their conceit; for <hi>Weymar</hi> being in hast, returned, and having wisely weighed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with <hi>Horne,</hi> that every the least delay they should make there, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced much to the prejudice of their designes and interests; for the <hi>Austrians,</hi> who marched apace towards their Campe, might easily have stopped their passage, invironed them with their Forces, get
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55221:102"/>
luckily into <hi>Wirtenberg</hi> and make use of the commodiousnesse and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of that State, totally to destroy the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army; they therefore thought it fit suddainly to raise the siege, and necessary and fitting directions being given to this purpose, their Cannon being withdrawne from the Batteries, the Foot in handsome order backt by the Horse past over the Bridge, defending themselves with as much gallantry as might be, against a briske Sally which the besieged made; insomuch as they burnt the barkes, and shewed themselves in the Field on the other side the River in perfect Battaile-array.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> being risen from before <hi>Constantz,</hi> the <hi>Imperialists</hi> who were come to the defence thereof, came out with great force and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and being mightily incensed rather against the Protestant <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> then against the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they over-ranne many of the Protestant Townes in <hi>Turgovia,</hi> dealing hardly with many Protestants, where Allarms being given by their Bels, and <hi>Kesserling</hi> the Serjeant-Major of the Country, he who being one of <hi>Zurich,</hi> moved not at <hi>Hornes</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall, made what haste he could thither; but not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the injuries done by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> he was sent as a man of quality by those of his owne side to acquaint the Colonels of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists <hi>Switzers,</hi> who were yet at <hi>Vill,</hi> with this the <hi>Austrians</hi> incursion, and to present unto them the injuries and violences done by those of <hi>Constantz,</hi> and to be counselled and assisted by them; but as soone as he was lighted off horse-backe he was made prisoner by the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholiques, who gave no reason for it, but that he had not intirely done his duty, at the comming of the <hi>Swedes</hi>; at which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Cantons being mightily incensed, and more particularly those of <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> they betooke themselves to Armes, and were upon resolving to breake with them, had not the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Violar</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour, by their interposition and wise dexterity, moderated that heat with threatning revenge in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones breast was likely to have extinguished friendship and to have kindled civill turmoyles, which would not so suddainly afterwards have been extinguished.</p>

and spoke with him at <hi>Ravenspurga</hi> a Towne in <hi>Swabenland,</hi> betweene the Lake of <hi>Constantz</hi> and <hi>Danube,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> seemed not to be a little comforted, that <hi>Walesteine</hi> had commanded his men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their assistance, or rather (it may be) desiring their ruine; so as they having got together an Army of about 26000 fighting men, who were fit for any enterprise, the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> calling his chiefe friends together, discust the businesse with them, what course they were to take to effect their Designes; the question propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was, whether they were to advance boldly, and not refuse the giving Battell, or else more considerately, not to ingage themselves in a businesse of such importance, but to endeavour to get into <hi>Alsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and succour <hi>Brisach?</hi> Some were for fighting, maintaining their opinions, by alledging;
<q>That they were come into <hi>Germany</hi> with their Armes to make use thereof, not to let slip the opportunitie of winning renowne; that there was a necessitie of fighting, when not to doe so was prejudiciall, and did imbasse the Souldiers; that all delay was then harmefull, when diligence was advantagious; that the Souldiers were already sensible of the inconveniencies they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-went by the Countries being destroyed; that they wisht ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye fighting with hope of Victory, then dispairing of their enterprise to live in feare; that the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Horse began to be destroyed, the <hi>Italian</hi> Companies to lessen, and the Enemy to grow stronger; that it was better to encounter the <hi>Swedes</hi> whilst the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier was strong and willing to fight, then not to be able to shun figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting when the Souldier should be discontented and brought low; that the honour of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Armes consisted in this Victory, as likewise the suppressing of the Enemy, and so did the <hi>Austrian</hi> greatnesse; that it was true, the Enemy was strong in Horse, but weaker in Foot, and differing in opinions; that all the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of such as were well affected were lost, and the reports of their rivalls augmented, when effects did not correspond with hopes, and with what hath publiquely beene divulged; that the magnificency of <hi>Spaine</hi> was envied, every going lesse whereof would be a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to those that fear'd them.</q>
On the other side, those who incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more to worke their ends with wisedome and circumspection, said;
<q>That they ought to consider what was the chiefe end of all their endeavours aimed at, and that if their principall drift were to succour <hi>Brisach,</hi> they should chearfully intend that; that the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is said to be had, when the thing indeavoured is accomplisht; if the getting into <hi>Alsatia</hi> were the thing they desired, they must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke themselves by what way, and with what greatest securitie they mought get thither; that the losse was greater which they should receive by fighting with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were experienced Souldiers, and greedy of Victory, if they should be by them beaten then any advantage they should get if they should beat the <hi>Swedes</hi>; that they very well knew the difficultie of re-assembling an Army, the teares shed by the <hi>Neopolitans,</hi> the hardnesse they had suffered in <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> and how prejudiciall the sending out of men was to <hi>Spaine,</hi> which was too much uninhabitated and uncultivated; that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55221:103"/>
they were to make much of those men, which being once lost, could not be so easily renewed; that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had the Forces of the <hi>Ringrave,</hi> of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> others at the Siege of <hi>Filisburg,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Garrisons, from whence they might draw out Souldiers, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto the rest who were scattered abroad in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> they might though beaten recruit themselves, and oppose the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army which though Victorious, would be by that Victory weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that it behoved them not to hazard those Forces wherein the honour and reputation of <hi>Spaine</hi> consisted, and to the maintaining, and good condition whereof all their endeavours tended; that it was better for them to compasse their ends by wiles and stratagems, then by relying only upon their strength hazard the not being of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> who was a Gentleman of quicke foresight, and very wise in his resolutions, examining precisely the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctures, and reflecting likewise upon the publique good, as also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reputation of himselfe and his Commanders, that he might not seeme fearefull in refusing to fight, resolved hee would not be thereunto averse: on such tearmes notwithstanding as he might make use of the advantage he had over the Enemy in Foot; nor yet that he would be lesse diligent in venting and practising Military stratagems. Hee shewed great courage and much desire to fight, he came to <hi>Vber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linghem,</hi> appeared in Battaile array, made his Horse advance even to before the <hi>Swedish</hi> quarters, made divers skirmishes with his Horse, and shewed that he was come into <hi>Germany</hi> to deale blowes.</p>
            <p>This resolution being perceived by <hi>Waymer,</hi> and the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders, who were still desirous to end the Quarrell in the Field, they called a Councell, to resolve whither they were to fight, or contenting themselves with their advantagious station, to indeavour the Enemyes prejudice, rather by streightning them in their Provisions then by joyning Battaile with them, in the event whereof the whole affaire consisted;
<q>There wanted not some who were of opinion that it was wisely, and maturely to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether they ought to fight or no, or to hazard the danger of a Battaile; that resolutions which were onely Counselled by hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the extraordinary ardour of too forward spirits, ranne often hazard of danger; that it was to be considered upon what dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage they play, who hazard the whole against a part; that the Crowne of <hi>Swethland</hi> could not receive a greater blow, then by the losse of those Forces which were knowne to be her vitall pulse, the maintainer of her greatnesse and assistance: that on the contrary side, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army was an addition to <hi>Caesars</hi> strength rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against the jealousies of <hi>France,</hi> then to suppresse the <hi>Swedes</hi>; and peradventure the maintaining of them would be lesse prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to them, then their overthow; that the <hi>Dutch</hi> lost little by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them, nay, their losse might be argued to be an addition to the others strength; that <hi>Walesteine</hi> was not ignorant of the injury he suffered by their arivall, whereby his authority was lessened; that it was well knowne he was over-ruled by ambition, and netled by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretension, wherewithall he being more vexed then by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55221:104"/>
the <hi>Swedes</hi> Sword, they might hope well in the feigned correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of those two Chiefetaines, and in their intestine hatred, which would prove as pernicious to them as advantagious to the <hi>Swedes</hi> their Enemies; that it was to be believed by how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Spaniards</hi> successe should be, by so much lesse would <hi>Wale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein</hi> their rivall oppose himselfe to the <hi>Saxons</hi>; that it had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been knowne, what mischiefe had been occasioned by not giving satisfaction to Officers, and their dissonancy in affection; that <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was not onely well armed, but swolne with ambition to aprove himselfe a worthy Commander; that his Souldiers were either fresh <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> a Nation which unacquainted with that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, not knowing how else to save themselves otherwise then by Victory, would be resolute in their fighting, and the maintaining of their Rankes, since they knew not where to escape, for that the Woods were full of barbarous Country-people, who slew as many as flew from their Colours; that it was to be believed they would onely prove constant in resolution of Victory: that the <hi>Germans</hi> who were in the Enemies Army were old Souldiers, and lead by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Commanders; that they knew how short they were of the Enemy in Foot, by which it is that enterprises are effected, and Victories got: that therefore their opinion was that they should deferre giving Battaile, and rather endeavour to destroy the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by their selfe sufferings, who being entered into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted Country which wanted necessaries for the maintenance of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and being moreover on all sides invironed by <hi>Swedes,</hi> it was easily to be foreseen, that they must either thinke upon returning, or else destroy their men, which were not accustomed to labour, and hunger, nor to the climate of <hi>Germany,</hi> which in Winter was excessive cold, so as their vigorous Foot being extenuated, they might the more easily be overcome.</q>
These efficatious Arguments and Considerations were much listned unto by <hi>Horne,</hi> and the Major part of the other Commanders; but <hi>Waymer, Offchirchin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who above measure coveted to give them Battaile, not able to see that Army which not long before boasted it selfe to be invincible, and able to make its way through the strongest oppositions which the <hi>Austrians</hi> could make, give backe for the onely neighbourhood of a Nation which they held in no esteem, answered,
<q>that it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne how available the reputation of Armes was to a Prince, by which greater Victories are oft-times achieved then by Force alone; that this was of very great consideration, to whosoever hath the Command and Government of an Army; that hereby Enemies were possest with feare, ones owne men heartned, and dominion was preserved; that on the contrary side, scorne, and undervaluation, was the beginning and product of ruine; that reason granted, <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesteine</hi> who envied <hi>Feria's</hi> greatnesse, might for this forfeit his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, but that it could not be denyed, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> praise, whereby their Souldiers were incouraged, was likely much to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the opinion of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> not onely amongst their owne men but over all the world; that it was evidently known, if <hi>Feria</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:55221:104"/>
prospered in his endeavours, <hi>Walesteine</hi> could not so justly blame the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Councells, but rather by commending them, be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as his rivall to out-doe him by some new enterprise; that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Authority in <hi>Germany</hi> grew greater; that subjects did more patiently endure <hi>Imperiall</hi> impositions, that the preservation of these guests would not so openly be refused; and every one being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned with hopes, and having their hearts raised, the people of <hi>Germany</hi> would thereby be occasioned to contemne the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and to set a greater estimation upon the <hi>Austrians</hi>; that the businesse of <hi>Brisach</hi> was curiously looked upon by all the world, it being of so apparant importance, that they were now at their last gaspe, and ready to yeeld; that they should not abandon that fortune, which hitherto had been favourable, and propitious unto them, till they should see themselves by her abandoned; that the Victory of this Battaile brought with it the winning of all <hi>Alsatia,</hi> the securing of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> the preservation of the Townes in <hi>Swabenland</hi>; that it was the ruine of the <hi>Spanish</hi> honour, and (which yet imported more) it was the eternizing the good opinion of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Armies, and the evident suppression of <hi>Bavaria</hi>: For <hi>Walesteine</hi> who would be glad to see the bad successe of the <hi>Emperours</hi> Councels, which were resolved on without his advice, and were set on Foot by <hi>Bavaria,</hi> blaming the unadvisednesse of the Officers, and rejoycing at the ill event thereof, would by drawing them upon his backe, be rather like to foment their ruine, then to repaire it; so as <hi>Alsatia</hi> would be secured, and the <hi>French-mens</hi> threats, when they should see the <hi>Swedes</hi> power grow over-great, would hereby be provided for, for they would find hard passing the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> when it should be secured on these parts; that they might safely hope to march with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into <hi>Austria,</hi> and compasse their ambition aspired unto of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Emperour whom they pleased; that therefore they ought to fight, and rather hazard themselves upon so great an enterprise, then with losse to shun a danger, and thereby pull upon them another more irrepairable; that if their Army were weak in Foot, it was the stronger in Horse; that indeed <hi>Alsatia</hi> was much impoverished of all such necessaries as were requisite for the aboad of an Army; but that it was neer <hi>Helvetia,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof would make use of this advantagious occasion, and willingly to vent their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, supply the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their pay.</q>
These conceipts of <hi>Waymer</hi> though they were acknowledged by all to be too adventurous, yet were they taken into consideration, and the emergent occasion being maturely weighed, the result of the Councell was, that they would imbrace both propositions; that is, to incommodate <hi>Feria</hi> by cutting off his Victuals, and temporising, and yet to fight couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously, when they would doe it in such a position of place as might be advantagious for their Horse. They therefore ordered their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taglions and planted their Cannon in most convenient places, and with part of their Horse made towards the <hi>Austrians,</hi> believing firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come to a Battaile with them; but they being favoured in their situation by a little Hill which they lay under, and by a contiguous
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55221:105"/>
Wood, would not be drawne from thence though provoked thereunto by divers skirmishes, but sent secretly their Vanguard towards <hi>Mulen,</hi> with intention to winne the passage at <hi>Dutling,</hi> and to enter on that side into the Dukedome of <hi>Wirtenberg</hi>; wherein if they had prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as they wisely endeavoured it, it was that which would have fully satisfied them. <hi>Horne</hi> fore-seeing the disorders that might hereupon ensue, faced presently about that way, and went streight towards <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> where he stayd that night; and hearing the next day, which was on the sixth of <hi>October,</hi>

The <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing here, that the <hi>Austrians</hi> were advanced to the top of the Hill, they had put themselves in Battell-Array in a plaine betweene two neighbouring Woods: <hi>Horne</hi> thinking now for certaine that <hi>Feria</hi> was resolved to fight, he hasted with his Horse to the top of the Hill which is above <hi>Dutling</hi> on <hi>Engens</hi> side; and whilst he gave orders to the Foot, he sent Monsieur <hi>Ville-Franch's</hi> Regiment of Horse to fall upon the Enemy, and by skirmishing with them, to towle them out into the plaine; but this tooke not effect, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves in their advantagious position, entrench't there; and being short of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in Horse, they would not draw out into the Field, but make use of such places as were convenient for their Foot. But the <hi>Swedes</hi> were told by their informers, that the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists</hi> had refused to give them Battell the day before, onely by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Aldringer,</hi> who had received order from <hi>Walesteine</hi> not to fight, nor to hazard his men; which in case he should loose, he should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise lose his imployment; and for that, <hi>Walesteine</hi> not well pleased with <hi>Ferias</hi> comming, desired his reputation might be blur'd by some unluckie encounter; believing notwithstanding that <hi>Feria</hi> would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in opinion with <hi>Aldringer,</hi> as well grounded upon reason, that he should fight before his Freshmen should be wearied with their duties in the Field, where hunger was their greatest Enemy: The <hi>Swedes</hi> kept their men all that night long in Battell-Array; and the Generalls, though they had conveniency to rest themselves in their Coaches, did notwithstanding dismisse them, saying; It was not fitting they alone should enjoy their ease, where so many friends and fellow Souldiers suffered hardnesse; they therefore were content to lye that night, (which was very cold and snowy) upon the naked earth, neere the rest of the Souldiers: An example which ought to be followed by such Commanders as desire to winne the Souldiers love; for there is no greater cause of murmuring then inequalitie, and to enjoy a mans owne ease, whilst his Companions are in misery. If King <hi>Gustavus</hi> did Acts of wonder with a few men, this was one of the chiefest causes thereof, for he thereby gave others reason to imitate and follow his example.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> the next morning perceiving the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance (as they expected they should doe) and that they could not draw them into the open Field; and <hi>Horne</hi> being moreover advertised that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55221:105"/>
they began to march towards <hi>Sigmering,</hi> a place which though it were upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> lyes yet more lower towards <hi>Bavaria</hi>: And fearing least <hi>Feria</hi> and <hi>Aldringer,</hi> who were wise Commanders, and of a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned understanding, should winne the hand of them, and get into <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg</hi> by <hi>Balings</hi> side, which was but two Leagues off, where the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists</hi> yet kept the strong Castle of <hi>Solerme,</hi> situated upon a craggy Mountaine, and which was then besieged by the <hi>Wirtenbergers</hi>; and that they might passe from thence to <hi>Filisberg</hi> to relieve that Fort, and so getting over the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> recruit <hi>Haghenaw,</hi> runne over the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> joyne themselves with the remainder of the <hi>Lorayne</hi> Forces, and with those that were rays'd in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and advance prosperously on the other side the River to <hi>Brisach</hi>; they went from <hi>Dutling,</hi> and tooke the same way, and lodged that very night in <hi>Drussing</hi>; where the newes being, that <hi>Feria</hi> was upon his march; and it was moreover confirmed, that he had throwne a Bridge over the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Horne</hi> sent 500 Horse under the Conduct of the Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell of the <hi>Finlanders,</hi> who was well practised in such like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, to discover the Enemies Designe, and to take some prisoners, by whom he might learne what condition their Army was in. This man went boldly on; and as he thought to surprise a quarter, wherein were 1000 of the Enemies Horse, he found them ready to entertaine him, as having had notice of his intention; he was unexpectedly set upon by them, and himselfe, with many of his men, taken prisoners. The newes still continuing, that the <hi>Caesarians</hi> were upon their march, the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders advanced to <hi>Baling,</hi> to hinder their entrance on that side into the aforesaid Dukedome, and there they stayd: But being againe informed that the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> was parted from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringer,</hi> and that he marched with onely 12000 towards <hi>Brisach,</hi> and that <hi>Aldringer</hi> being sent for backe by <hi>Walesteine,</hi> returned with the rest into <hi>Bavaria; Horne</hi> gave order to follow them, and therefore <hi>Weymar</hi> marched with his Forces towards <hi>Ebing; Horne</hi> and <hi>Berchenfield</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Newstat,</hi> that they might meet together before <hi>Brisach</hi> to re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force that Campe, and preventing the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> force them to depart from thence; but as soone as they had begun this their march, there came certaine newes, that the speech of their parting was not true, but that it was a stratagem of theirs, by leaving their Baggage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench't in <hi>Miskerck,</hi> and that they were in hast gone towards the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> and were already at <hi>Egen.</hi> The <hi>Swedish</hi> Generalls advising what was hereupon to be done, they resolved to follow them, and to leave their Baggage at <hi>Rutuile,</hi> (a priviledged Citie upon the Frontiers of <hi>Wirten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and which was with good correspondency with the <hi>Switzers</hi>) that they might make the more speedy march, and overtake them. <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> therefore returned back, and together with <hi>Horne,</hi> and <hi>Berchenfield</hi> returned to <hi>Shemburg,</hi> and marching all that night they were the next morning at <hi>Drussing.</hi> Whilst the Souldiers very weary with their long marches rested themselves in this Village, <hi>Horne</hi> was advertised by Letters from <hi>Scafhause,</hi> that the <hi>Imperialists</hi> were past by the Townes of that Canton, of which they had burnt two; whereat the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Switzers</hi> being much inraged, had taken up Armes; that many
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55221:106"/>
thousands of them were gathered together, intending to proceed in hostile manner with those they should find had provoked them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; that therefore wanting Horses to backe them in the Field, while they should revenge this Out-rage done unto them, they desired his assistance therein. This advice did much amuse <hi>Weymar</hi> and <hi>Horn,</hi> though they gave not much credit to the Letters, knowing that the <hi>Switzers</hi> (who were divided in their opinions) doe not so easily put on such resolutions of declaring themselves Enemies to a great Prince. They resolved notwithstanding (that they might let their friends know they never abandoned good neighbours) to send <hi>Berchenfield</hi> with part of the Army to <hi>Newstat</hi>; that <hi>Horne</hi> should keepe about <hi>Rotevile,</hi> and that <hi>Weymar</hi> with 40 Companies of Horse should goe to know what those of <hi>Scafhause</hi> wanted.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Horn</hi> was come to <hi>Rotevile, Weymar</hi> came hastily to him from his quarters, and brought with him certaine Letters from <hi>Oxesterne,</hi> which were directed to <hi>Horne</hi>; which when they were opened, and a secret Commission found therein, they soone changed their former orders; for <hi>Weymar</hi> leaving his intention of going to <hi>Scafhause,</hi> tooke the way of <hi>Franconia,</hi> that he might againe come into <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to the enterprise of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> to the which he was invited by secret adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements given him by the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and other Protestant friends; that it was now time to thinke upon some action that was unexpected by the <hi>Caesarians</hi>; for <hi>Walesteine,</hi> who was distasted, seemed very desirous that somewhat of mis-fortune might befall the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>; as he, who had beene the cause that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had passed over the Mountaines with a power indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and that <hi>Aldringer</hi> too joyned with them; and that it was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceived, that if the <hi>Swedes</hi> would endeavour the ruine of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> he would not budge one foot to succour them: and just so it proved, as shall be said hereafter. <hi>Berchenfield</hi> was left with the residue of the Army to goe to <hi>Offemberg,</hi> to watch the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proceedings beyond <hi>Brisack</hi>; and Marshall <hi>Horne</hi> tooke his way with 2000 Horse towards <hi>Eneding,</hi> from whence he sent away a Trumpet to acquaint the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of <hi>Scafhause</hi> with his comming, and so went himselfe to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher,</hi> a little Village belonging to that Canton, where he found the Deputies of the said Citie, fuller of Wine then resolution; for the preparations which were said to be made by the Protestant <hi>Switzers,</hi> were found not be such as was given out, there being onely 1000 Foot sent by the Canton of <hi>Zurich,</hi> under the command of Colonell <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drich,</hi> for the defence of that Citie, and to no other purpose; neither did they conclude any thing, but stood with their Glasses in their hands till two houres within night; at which time, <hi>Horne</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Lieutenant of Crabats (who was taken prisoner as he ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the <hi>Swedish</hi> Centinells, which he tooke to be <hi>Caesarians</hi>) that there was not farre from thence 500 Carriages of Ammunition for the <hi>Austrian</hi> Army, with some Crabats for their Convoy, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got on horse-back, and pursued them though in vain; for they being advertised by some of the Lieutenants Companions, got (by the favour of the night, which was very dark) to <hi>Mulen.</hi> This happened after he
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55221:106"/>
had tane his leave of the said Deputies, having been very instant with them to use their authority with the Canton of <hi>Basel,</hi> that they should not assist the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> neither with Victuals, nor Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he feared they would.</p>
            <p>At the same time that <hi>Oxensternes</hi> Commissions came to <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Waymer,</hi> there were other Commissions sent to those who were before <hi>Brisach,</hi> which commanded the <hi>Ringrave</hi> to raise his Forces from the Siege of <hi>Colmar,</hi> and to joyne with Colonell <hi>Ransaw,</hi> and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were quartered in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> to the end all of them together making up the Body of an Army, and strengthned by the Garrisons of that Province, they might have an eye to the Duke of <hi>Feria's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes. <hi>Berchenfeilt</hi> for the better strengthning of the <hi>Ringrave,</hi> and to secure the Towns in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> went over the Bridge at <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> &amp; marcht likewise toward <hi>Colmar.</hi> But for that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should come to <hi>Brisach,</hi> they might easily by the advantage of the River passe and repasse over the Bridge, and <hi>Horne</hi> fearing lest they might by that way indeavour to enter into <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> (a Country wherein they might that yeare have easily wintered) he incamped himselfe about <hi>Horneberg</hi> upon the Frontiers of that State, a place not onely able to receive him, but very fitting to molest the <hi>Romanists</hi> Army whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they should passe backe againe into <hi>Bavaria,</hi> (as 'twas thought they would suddainly doe, aswell to hinder <hi>Waymers</hi> proceedings, as also that so many people could not subsist in those parts, which were totally consumed, and for that the most part garrisonized by the <hi>Swedes</hi>)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> this meane while advanc'd to <hi>Waldshut,</hi> not meeting with any obstacle; and making themselves masters thereof, as also of <hi>Sichemghem,</hi> and <hi>Leuffemburg,</hi> (all which yielded upon Articles) they at last set upon <hi>Rinfelden,</hi> the Garrison whereof defending themselves with constancy, and obstinacy, hoping to be quickly succord, and not able to resist a gallant Assault which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made, they were all put to the Sword. From hence they passe to <hi>Basel,</hi> the Citizens where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (were it either out of feare, or for their owne interests) received <hi>Feria</hi> curteously, who notwithstanding would not enter into the City, but they made much of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missary <hi>Ossa,</hi> of Count <hi>Iohn Serbolone,</hi> and Col. <hi>Ieri,</hi> who entring thereinto had what they could desire for their mony. The Siege was likewise raised from before <hi>Veling,</hi> by the <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenbergers,</hi> and the Militia in <hi>Roteville</hi> was committed to the charge of Colonell <hi>Agafield,</hi> to prevent the insurrection of the <hi>Romanists</hi> thereabouts, which they might indeavour being imboldned by the comming of that Army.</p>
            <p>All the thoughts and designes of the other <hi>Imperialists</hi> aymed at the <hi>Saxon</hi> Army, they bent all their wits how to weaken it, of which they were so jealous. The greatest preparations for warre which in so short a time and in the present conjuncture could be, was made in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> to save themselves from their Enemies threatning Forces, which lay towards <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and in <hi>Alsatia</hi>; the Councels of the one side, and of the other were imploy'd in measuring their owne strength, and the like of their companions, and in plotting how they might get
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55221:107"/>
the Victory; upon the which by reason of the consequencies which depended thereupon, all the Eyes of Christendome were fixt. When <hi>Walesteine</hi> still more and more desirous to conclude a peace with the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the which he would have been the gladder of, for that without it he could not easily compasse that which he desired to doe, to the new <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, made new proffers, and conditions, drawne out of the necessity whereinto he was brought, and whereby he went lesse in honour, for they were so large as that his reputation was thereby prejudiced; but not being such as gave satisfaction, to the pretences of that Prince, (neer whom were some Counsellors that were partiall to the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and very ill affected to the <hi>Romanists,</hi>) nor the <hi>Swedish</hi> Armes being as yet so great as that they needed a moderator, nor yet so much declined as that they ought to shelter themselves from the Emperours indignation; nor yet the Emperour being willing to grant him what he then demanded in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of those Forces which were by him fomented; he went so wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to worke, as neither to incense the <hi>Swedes,</hi> nor yet exasperate the Emperour: but proceeding with each of them so as he conceived made most for his owne advantage, and the suspension of Armes for other three weeks being now out, he tooke in divers places in <hi>Misnia,</hi> and set downe before <hi>Leypzig.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walesteine</hi> perceiving that the <hi>Saxons</hi> removed their Forces from <hi>Slesia,</hi> a noble Province, he followed them and cut many of them in pieces; and seeing it was not now time to set in order other mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, whilst his owne were in hazard, he withdrew himselfe along the <hi>Elb</hi> to <hi>Laitmeritz</hi>; from whence <hi>Gallasse</hi> being gone with 10000 Souldiers towards <hi>Dresden,</hi> hee advanced once more to <hi>Braig,</hi> the which he tooke, as likewise many other places formerly held by the <hi>Saxons</hi>; not for that his minde was bent upon such acchivements, for they were of no great importance, but that he might appeare to be imploy'd in these parts, and to shun occasion of going to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of <hi>Bavaria</hi>; as likewise by feare of Armes to invite the Elector to sence himselfe by Peace against the molestations of Warre. From thence being gotten neerer <hi>Glogaw,</hi> and understanding that <hi>Harnem</hi> was marching thitherward to succour it, and disturbe his designe; and that the Count <hi>De Towrs,</hi> was then in the <hi>Swedish</hi> Camp in Armes with the title of Commissary generall, and that he and Colonell <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> were with 5000 men about <hi>Victenaw,</hi> (where he was informed that the said Count was a man rather fit for politicke imployments then mannaging of Armes, for though he understood Military affairs, yet was he of so easie a disposition, as wanting vivacity of spirit and ready resolution (parts requisite in a perfect Commander) his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries might easily by their cunning worke upon the sweetnesse of his minde) He applyed himselfe to this enterprise, thinking to set upon them unexpectedly, and to work some impression in them: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore through his wonted cunning (whereby he miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governed all his actions, when fortune favoured him) given secret order to his Commanders that they should make as if they went towards <hi>Harnem,</hi> altering his course on the suddaine, he on the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55221:107"/>
11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> fell so unexpectedly upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> quarters, that he was upon their backes before they could retreat in safety, either to <hi>Vra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tislavia, Krossen,</hi> or <hi>Glogaw,</hi> (all of them neighbouring places) or yet receive succour from <hi>Harnem,</hi> for not thinking that <hi>Walesteins</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe had so long a reach, he was at this time so farre from them, as that he could not come unto them time enough; so as these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders finding that they could not put themselves upon the fortune of Armes, but upon great disadvantage, being farre short in number to the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> who were 20 Regiments of Foot and 13 of Horse, and being out of all hopes of Victuals or succour, which being farre off could not come time enough to serve their stead; that they might not perish miserably through hunger, nor runne headlong upon the desperatenesse of Battaile, and so remaine victimes to the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Sword, knowing that voluntary Surrenders were alwaies borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, when safety is by no other meanes to be had, the Count and <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi> together with the rest of the chiefest Captaines, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves aside, and being comforted by proffers which <hi>Tersica</hi> made unto them from <hi>Walesteine,</hi> who promised that if they would yeeld up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him those places which they had in their possession, he would not onely spare their lives, but treat them as friends and companions; necessity being that which prevailes with the most obstinate, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to accept his offer, not seeing how otherwise they could possibly escape; they therefore resolved to submit themselves to <hi>Walesteines</hi> clemency, who soone after set the Count <hi>De Towre</hi> at liberty, and suffered <hi>Tuball</hi> likewise to make an escape; wherewithall the Court at <hi>Vienna</hi> was not well pleased, which would faine have had the Count in their owne custody, that as head of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Commotions he might have received just punishment for his defaults; as likewise they would gladly have had the contrary party been deprived of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi> who was so gallant a Commander, as that his worth could not but be prejudiciall to them. But <hi>Walesteine</hi> who was alwayes of an uncorrupted faith, and who desired to witnesse to the Elector of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi> that his invitations to peace were indissolvable tyes of Loyalty; and who desired by his curtesie and civill usage to oblige even his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, regulating his government by dealing gently with his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to the end and that thereby working upon their affections hee might rather appease their anger, then provoke them to an obstinate defence; found rather that by his thus doing to purchase the ill will of the Emperours Court, then falsify his word, of which he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithfull: and he was so generous in his demonstrations, as if hee thought to purchase the good will of the Electors Counsellours and Officers; it being naturall to all men who are not ingratefull, and therein worse then Beasts, to be well inclined to their Benefactors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walestein</hi> being imboldned by this so happy Victory, advanced to <hi>Frankfort</hi> upon the <hi>Oder,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Landsperg,</hi> both which yeelded suddainly unto him; for the Governours of them having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Elector to abandon them, if the <hi>Imperialists</hi> should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before their Gates, they obeyed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands withdrew themselves to <hi>Kostrin. Walesteine</hi> being perswaded
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55221:108"/>
by these prosperous successes, and thinking that these his proceedings were the true meanes to moderate the Duke of <hi>Saxonies</hi> pretensions, resolved to try him once more, and to that end sent unto him Prince <hi>Albertus Frauciscus</hi> of <hi>Sassen-Lavemberg</hi>; but his demands meeting with like successe as before, he marched with his whole Army to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> invironed with strong Rampiers, and very opportunely seated on the West upon the bankes of <hi>Neisse,</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Lusatia</hi>; the Governour whereof not sayling in his duty, though for the defence thereof he had but 800 Foot and 150 Horse, with some few of the Inhabitants (a small number to maintaine a place of so great circuit) prepared gallantly for defence, little valuing <hi>Wale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steines</hi> threats; yet not being able to resist a strong Assault made by the <hi>Austrians,</hi> he and all his men were put to the Sword, as often times befals those, who warm'd in the opinion of themselves by a more then usuall presumption, waste that wisedome which tempered with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity would make a happy mixture.</p>
            <p>The escape of these Commanders being divulged to have hapned by <hi>Walesteines</hi> knowledge, (who desirous to captivate the Enemies good will so ordered it, that thereby he might manifest how hee was offended with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Austrian</hi> Officers) made <hi>Oxesterne</hi> perceive that <hi>Walesteine</hi> being daily more incenst against the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> would criple those actions which might keep up the <hi>Imperiall</hi> greatnesse. For being above measure ambitious, and not able to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the so large Authority granted him, should now be limited, 'twas likely he would re-assume that intestine hatred, which by reason of the new acknowledgements made unto him by <hi>Caesar,</hi> and by the simulation of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Ministers of State seemed to be almost quite laid aside; and that some ill vapour distilling from thence, he might give way unto the <hi>Swede</hi> to make advantage of these their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, by some considerable acquisition: and chiefly he believed that some good might be done upon <hi>Bavaria,</hi> being it was he who (more watchfull then the rest, and wisely knowing what prejudice Princes receive, who raise their subjects to too high a pitch) had ordered the meanes how <hi>Walesteines</hi> vast ambition might be moderated, and who being likewise thought to be the chiefe promoter of <hi>Feria's</hi> comming, it was not to be doubted but that well contented with any mischiefe that might befall that Duke, <hi>Walesteine</hi> would make but slow hast to succour him: making use therfore of this occasion, the taking of <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> was thought would prove the easiest to be effected.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Waymer</hi> having crost over <hi>Swabenland,</hi> came to <hi>Newburg,</hi> before his departure was taken notice of; and unexpectedly setting upon it, some Countrey-people (who having recourse thither had taken upon them to defend it) affrighted at the first news of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Cannon, (as people not accustomed to Armes) they Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Towne on the 29<hi rend="sup">•h</hi> of <hi>November</hi>; the <hi>Bavararian</hi> Garrison marching forth,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:55221:108"/>He then came to <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> planted his Cannon against it, and the Garrison, after 18 dayes resistance made, dispairing of succour, and being unprovided of necessaries, (for they at this time dreaded not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such accident, which was thought to be unpossible, unlesse by meanes of some correspondency) the Towne was yeelded up on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> and thus the <hi>Swedes</hi> got a great Citie upon the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi> which runs through the Town,<note place="margin">

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> being advanced to <hi>Brisach,</hi> and thinking the most difficult things now feacible by reason of his late good successe, thought he mought easily take <hi>Colmar,</hi> a chiefe Citie in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> two Leagues distant from <hi>Brisach,</hi> on the other side the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> in that Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion which extends it selfe betweene that and the Mountaines towards <hi>Lorayne,</hi> which had formerly beene a free Towne, but by the vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Occurences fallen into the <hi>Austrian</hi> subjection, begirt with good Ditches, Walls, and Rampiers, though imperfect; in the which, the <hi>Swedes</hi> having placed a rich Magazin of Victualls and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, for the supply of their Armies which lay in those parts, he hoped, by the taking thereof, not onely to Victuall <hi>Brisach,</hi> but to refresh his owne Army, wherewithall he determined to keep in those parts for some time, to maintain those Towns which yet kept free to the Emperour, as likewise to endeavour the taking of many others which were under the <hi>Swedes</hi> power, and to get into with <hi>Loraine,</hi> the losse

He therefore resolved to send <hi>Aldringer</hi> into <hi>Bavaria,</hi> being desired so to doe by the Emperour and the Duke thereof, who much feared <hi>Waymers</hi> advancement, for he was drawing up into the heart of the State. <hi>Aldringer</hi> did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; he re-passed over the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> and set upon <hi>Freiburg,</hi> which was held by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and which soone yeelded unto him, and the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof tooke pay of him; which Towne, though it were of small moment, being onely invironed with bare Walls without Rampiers, yet being that he and his men were to passe by it, it behoved him to secure it.</p>

He therefore spoke thereof to the Duke, who though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired not more Forreiners in his Country by whom subjects usually receive nothing but losse, yet he being a very religious Prince, and who kept still loyall to the Emperour, setting aside all particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, where the common cause came in question, would make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how firme his heart stood to the service of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the house of <hi>Austria</hi>; he was moreover the sooner drawne to yield to this request, by reason of the need he stood of helpe against the <hi>Swedes</hi>; and for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> assistance was requisite to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <hi>Walesteine,</hi> whose indeavours tending onely to his ruine, had brought him to a hard condition.

and Souldiers of that Nation, which is the sinewes and strength of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Armies; a daring Prince, and beloved by the Souldier and common people, and one who would hardly submit to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a stranger. Though the Deputies, the Souldiers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes of the Union were pleased with this Election, yet was not the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> therewithall satisfied; as well for that the King being dead, he pretended to be chosen Generall, and to have the whole weight of the Warre intrusted in him, since there was no Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the Confederates of greater strength then he, nor who had more favoured the <hi>Swedes</hi>; as also, for that <hi>Waymers</hi> greatnesse, who was a Prince full of spirit, and descended from the right line of the first borne of <hi>Saxony,</hi> which were expelled their state by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, made him not a little feare, that if the <hi>Swedish</hi> affaires should prosper, and he should winne upon the Souldiers affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he mought aspire to recover that which he knew had formerly belonged to his Ancestors. These jealousies having gathered together a great masse of grosse humours in the Electors breast, whom the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarian</hi> Ministers of state, failed not to put in mind of what accidents might easily fall out, inviting him to an accomodation by large prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and efficatious perswasions, he was seene to be much changed, and beganne to nauseate <hi>Oxesternes</hi> and <hi>Waymers</hi> actions, and to be more cautious in his confiding in them then he was wont; and this was afterwards knowne to be the rise of <hi>Saxonies</hi> falling from the <hi>Swedes. Horne,</hi> who wisely fore-saw this storme, rid post to <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> treated and consulted with <hi>Oxesterne</hi> how to find a remedy for so important a businesse; but he was not much listened unto by those who governed by passion, gave no eare to the reasons he alledged; nor was there any one who thought how to appease the Electors displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; for the <hi>Swedes</hi> were now growne to that hight of pride, as that they cared not for any one, thinking that every one should take it for a favour to be numbred among their friends; (the effects of prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wherewithall men are blinded, and as with Wine, made drunke with confidence and presumption; as likewise of the prosperitie of Northerne people, who thinking abundantly well of themselves, shew pride in their actions, affording thereby occasions to us <hi>Italians</hi> to call them barbarous.) They pretended, that the Elector was bound to second their resolves, which made them afterwards very wel know, that the government of States ought not be exercised with ambition, nor passion, but with wisedome, free from any particular interest, and from any affection which thwarts the publique good.</p>

<q>For to retreat without doing any good, from an enterprise once undertaken, embases the Souldier, redounds to the discredit of the Officers, addes to the vigour and reputation of the Enemy, and makes the Leaders on be accounted ill-advised, a word very hurtfull to the Conductors of Souldiers.</q>

               <hi>Hornes</hi> returne into <hi>Swabenland,</hi> gave Allarme to all the <hi>Imperialists</hi> thereabouts, and awakened the Commanders: and this his comming causing many men to wonder, who thought it was incredible that he should forsake <hi>Bavaria</hi>; some began to thinke there was some-what more in't, and in particular <hi>Ossa,</hi> who commanded in those precincts was more suspitious then the rest, as was soone after seen in Colonell <hi>Peter Chinich</hi> of <hi>Salutorne,</hi> Governour of <hi>Lindaw,</hi> who was arrested, and sent prisoner with a good guard into <hi>Tiroll</hi>: but his reputation suffred in no one particular, but only by the false suspition of the said <hi>Ossa,</hi> who bore him little good will, occasioned by the great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and correspondency which <hi>Chinich</hi> held with the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and in particular, with those of <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> two Cantons which confided but indifferently in the <hi>Austrians</hi>; and this much the more, because some <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were of <hi>Ossa's</hi> party, and held, not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one could be faithfull to them who was not a <hi>Romanist,</hi> fearing much lest <hi>Chinich</hi> might be a Protestant, and by reason of the good opinion the Protestants had of him, they agreed to ruine him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to free themselves of this suspition, then for that he deserved it; which was sufficient to nourish a conceipt, that he had held Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was then in <hi>Rhetia.</hi> And matters of State being like wax, which takes heat, and is distemperd upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the least occasion, he was imprisoned before he was accused, though his innocency appearing afterwards; by his absolution, his loyalty shone forth the brighter.</p>

               <q>The losse of this place though it were not of so great consideration in respect of the situation, yet it being a principall place, it was in the present conjuncture thought to import much, by reason of the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which depended on it, &amp; for that it was likely it might fall into the <hi>Frenchmens</hi> hands, who when they should have gotten thither they might easily advance further and maintaine themselves in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satia,</hi>

and in the lower <hi>Palatinat.</hi> Yet they who seemed to be greater Politicians, discoursed alternately hereupon; those who opposed the reasons alleaged by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> answered, that it was better to leave it in the hands of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> then to win it; for the <hi>French,</hi> to whom when they should not surrender it, they should shew little desire of continuing longer friendship with them, by which their Interests was to receive no small detriment; and by granting it, the gaine would appeare to be prejudiciall; for besides the depriving of themselves of such a place to retreat unto, they would draw a power upon their shoulders, which assuming unto it selfe the title of being arbitratour of their affaires, the <hi>Swedes</hi> who should continue in those parts, would consequently be brought to reverence the Lawes of <hi>France</hi>; from whence it would insue, that their authority being limited and made dependant on the <hi>French,</hi> their atchievements would be unperfect, and their greatnesse would not be suffered to exceed the limits which they should allow them. And though others said that it was not to be imagined that the <hi>French</hi> would betake themselves to a businesse of small satisfaction, suppose the negative thereunto were granted, for that their Interests required good intelligence, with friends of so great power, who might otherwise wax jealous: yet wise men foresaw that no good effect could ensue hereupon; since that the desire of rule is blinde, and the reasons of preserving it, prevaile over whatsoever other respect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the considerations which the Protestants had hereupon were farre short of those held by the <hi>Austrians</hi>; for they thought this to be a greater losse then any they yet had suffered; not for that the <hi>Swedes</hi> or Protestants got much thereby, whose power consisting in the Union of many, they hoped that in time, and by such meanes as they might use, they should recover from them what they had lost; but for feare lest it should fall into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> whose greatnesse being upheld by the Crown of their onely Monarch, and those Provinces neighbouring upon their Kingdome, they well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The mindes therefore of the Councellours were confused, their judgements uncertaine, their resolutions timorous, their remedies doubtfull, and their hopes inconstant. Yet all this notwithstanding, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who are alwayes undaunted in adversity, carefull of their affaires, and most faithfull in all their doings, failed not with their refined judgements to calme the perplexity of their mindes, to secure their feares, to advise what was expedient, to proportion agreements, and to confirme faith in the certainty of hope.</p>

In <hi>Lombardy</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> was diligent in taking men into pay, and in indeavouring Monies, and Foot from <hi>Spaine,</hi> whereby to re-inforce the Army, and thereby to maintaine the power of <hi>Spaine</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>; assistance for the present occasions was indeavoured at <hi>Naples,</hi> (the Magazine whereby the <hi>Spanish</hi> greatnesse is re-inforced, by imposing new grievances upon the Subject, new impositions upon Salt, and upon the incomes of Fines, or Amerciaments, Customes, and the Kingdomes Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues) and to boot with the continuall issues of Souldiers which went from that Kingdom, 6000 Foot were entertained by Prince <hi>San Severo,</hi> and other Brigadoes under <hi>Don Carlo de Gatta, Lucius Boccapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vola, Iohn Baptista Orsino, Caesar Caracciolo,</hi> and divers others; and the Drums beat through all the other Dominions of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and assessements were made for the supply of Men and Monies, for the <hi>German</hi> warre; upon the which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were as intent as if it had been their own businesse. At <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadours prest much upon the Pope to assist the <hi>Romanists</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and did much exasperate the sinister behaviour of the <hi>French. Creqiri</hi> aboad in the Court to moderate the <hi>Spanish</hi> conceptions, and to interest the Pope in behalfe of his King; the Pope by some supply of Monies did wisely satisfie the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> entertained the <hi>French</hi> in civill manner, and consolated Christendome with plenary indulgencies; and in fine the eyes of all Europe were fixt upon what would be the event of the <hi>Spanish</hi> preparations; when <hi>Feria</hi> after having been some few dayes sicke of a <hi>Feaver,</hi> died; and for that after he had been in a faire way of recovery, he fell into a relapse, some suspected his death might be occasioned by poyson, and that it was done by <hi>Walesteines</hi> privacy: for he greatly hated and envied the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who being faithfull to their Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not permit that people should live in feare of him, who ought to dread his Master; nor that the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of state should be so foolish, as to admit of defence, or listen to the justification of one guilty of high Treason. Yet was there no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ground for this conceipt.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Feria's</hi> death as it was gladsome to <hi>Walesteine</hi> and some other <hi>Dutch</hi> Ministers of state, who were not pleased that the <hi>Spanish</hi> authority should get further possession in <hi>Germany</hi>; so was it very much lamented by the Emperour, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> all the <hi>Austrians, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> the Crowne of <hi>Spaine</hi> having lost in him, one of the worthiest servants it for the present had, or had had in many yeares before. He was none of the famous cryed-up Commanders, for being alwayes imployed in state affaires, hee was
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55221:116"/>
not accustomed to Armes; and he was arrived at the hight of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in state government, as that <hi>Spaine</hi> did bost it selfe, and <hi>Italy</hi>
glorified, never to have been in a more flourishing condition, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fortunate guidance of this Prince. He was excellent in all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall knowledge, and upon all occasions shewed himselfe worthy of the place he bore; his opinions free from flattery, and now acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be void of weaknesse, proved that true borne <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not such as through envy they are divulged to be. By the preferring the good of his King, before his owne good, he taught us, that how much the richer a servant is in deserts, the nakeder hee is in his owne privat designes; his diligence in resolutions, his sincerity in opinion, his order and judgement in treating, made it appeare, that though <hi>Spaine</hi> be not barren in producing men of this science, yet had shee few that did surpasse him, in having served his King with a more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous spirit, with more ready parts, or with a better appointed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he governed <hi>Milan</hi> many yeares, was beloved by the people, well esteemed by the Souldiers, admired, and feared by Forrayners; he (though streightned in time) did dexterously raise an Army, did wisely guide it, did with much successe, succour <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and did with so miraculous constancy indure the injuries of the weather, and the sterillity the Countries, as his good government, and the good orders he took, were acceptable to the Souldiers, supportable to the Subject, and commended by the <hi>Enemy.</hi> Those who possest with an evill opinion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were afraid at his first comming, and who more offended by words then deeds eschewed him, did by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience prove, that his picture was not drawne according to the life, that the civillity of <hi>Spaniards</hi> was tolerable, and the behaviour of their Commanders worthy to be reverenced; the very <hi>Swedes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves commending his actions, said they admired the <hi>Spaniards</hi> good demeanour, the affability of that Nation, the modesty of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; and by seeing that these men though so powerfull dealt not like others, who as soone as they have got footing in another mans possession, make it lawfull to satisfie their desires, they knew that the detractions which they suffered under, were onely the effects of feare, and weapons used by the weakest, not merited by their actions; and they did further adde, that if all <hi>Spaniards</hi> were so beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they should rather conforme and joyne themselves with them then with any other Nation.</p>
            <p>To say truth, he was a Gentleman of great dexterity, full of affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, over-flowing in curtesie, and most universall in all those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments which are required in a generous, prudent, gentile, and most-esteemed-of great state Officer to a great King; hee left his Wife much afflicted, having two Sonnes and one daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walesteines</hi> actions were now the generall discourse throughout all <hi>Vienna,</hi> yet did the Court for many dayes wisely dissemble their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him, dexterously concealing the plot laid against him, that they might goe upon sure grounds: for such Officers as are grown to too great an authority, and have the meanes to be dangerously harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their Masters, ought to be seized on with dexterity, and to have
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55221:116"/>
their wings clipt before they can bethinke themselves, or let loose the reines to their infidelitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walesteine,</hi> being by his Friends advertised of all that past, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lest his designes might perish amidst these stormes, he sent for the Colonells, <hi>Tersica</hi> his Cousin, and <hi>Chinschi</hi> his Kinsman, and <hi>Illo</hi>
his favourite, into his private Closet, where he was much agitated with intestine passion, which on the one side layd before him his reputation, and the infamous title of disloyall and ungratefull; on the other side it presented unto his eyes his own fear, the danger of calumny, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> hatred, his enemies emulation, and the desire of revenge; so as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in these considerations, sorrowing that the greatnesse of his eminent fortune should make his downefall the greater, he narrowly weighed with these men the present emergency, and having wisely ponderated the imminent danger, he chose a meanes very proper to plead in his behalfe, and which in some sort might make him seeme excusable, were not the prerogative which Soveraignes hold over their vassalls too Supreme:
<q>he then discoursing upon the instabilitie of fortune, which oft-times abandons those who thought they had had her surest by the fortop; and upon the incertaintie of the Planets, which rarely effect those things to which they seeme to encline; complained of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State, laying ingratitude and ambition to their charge; affirming, that when ever they prefer a servant of theirs they prepare his precipice, so much the deeper by how much higher he is exalted; that their reasons, though in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance leaning upon the Policy of State, are produced by their owne proper interests, whose maxime hath in it such ambition, as that they declare all that live independent thereupon guiltie of high Treason. He moreover taxed the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ministers of State that were neere the Emperour, of dulnesse and unadvisednesse, in having suffered that Nation to get footing in the Court; saying, they were not well verst in the negotiation of those places they were possessed of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that, let the necessitie be what it please, it is never good to admit the Officers of one Prince into another Princes Government, and especially those, that to boot with their owne pretensions, that they may the better maintaine their owne conceptions, and for the respect they desire should be borne unto them, adde the upbraiding of the assistance they have given, and good turnes they have done. He spared not in his discourse some Monasticks, who being displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with him, as he said, for his rewarding the Souldiers with what the Souldiers got, and not suffering them to partake thereof as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had beene used, nay more, for his totally discarding them from having any thing to doe in his affaires, imposing upon them their attendance upon Gods Service, and the doing their owne du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, declared him to be an Heretick; as for these, he said, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served correction, and not to be fomented, since their pretensions were now growne to that height, that nothing was to be done where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were not to have a finger. He murmured against the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and breaking forth into bitter speeches, he declared how the Politicall part of that Prince was so interessed, as that from thence
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55221:117"/>
proceeded all the past and present miseries; and for that his hatred was more bent against him then any other, he charged him with many things, to make his Commanders know his accusations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from malice, but out of intire loyaltie; and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he accused him of little good will to the Emperour, by being the meanes of withdrawing from <hi>Caesar</hi> the strength of those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which whilst governed by him <hi>Walesteine</hi> awed <hi>Germany,</hi> and kept all the Princes and States of the Empire within the bounds of dutie; wherein if they had still continued, those miseries had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beene which had of late beene tasted; he affirmed, that this Duke had conspired against his person, not so much for that he saw him a so much dreaded Generall, as for that he had never given his consent that the title of Elector <hi>Palatinate</hi> should be conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, nor yet that his Dominion should be so much inlarged, for that he well fore-saw the Emperour would never enjoy peace thereby, since the Protestant power suffering thereby violence, which was fomented by two great Crownes, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> he would not quietly enjoy the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; according to <hi>Hidra's</hi> heads, one head being struck off another would rise up in its place: for it was certainly knowne, the Protestants would never suffer that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to depart from one of their profession, nor yet would forreigne Potentates suffer that Prince to be driven out, who being upheld by many props, as well within as out of <hi>Germany,</hi> was almost able to counterpoise the <hi>Imperiall</hi> greatnesse, which being now annext unto the power of <hi>Spaine,</hi> makes all <hi>Europe</hi> not a little jealous: he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to have assisted and consented unto the comming of <hi>Feria,</hi> as independent on him, not for the publique good, but for his extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, plainly discovering, that the restraining an authoritie gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is a signe of suspition, from whence many evills take their rise, since thereby the good will of well-doers suffers an allay.</q>
In briefe, as it is usuall with emulation to make appearances seeme substances, <hi>Walesteine</hi> rather envying this Princes greatnesse and his solid wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then invited by any just occasion of blame in him, who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knowne to be a wise Prince, full of goodnesse and loyaltie towards <hi>Caesar,</hi> spoke thus of him:
<q>But afterwards comming to resolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what was to be done, he agreed with them that they should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge it throughout the Army, how that he, finding how his actions were falsly interpreted at the Court in <hi>Vienna,</hi> was resolved to quit his charge, and to betake himselfe to a private life, wherein wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men rest secure from passions of the mind, and from such down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls as envy layes traps for in other mens actions; that they should shew unto the other heads of the Army, and to the whole Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, how much they should be indammaged if this should happen; that they should murmure against the injurious Officers and evill Counsellours which had possest themselves of <hi>Caesars</hi> eare, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous to enjoy the reward which belongs to the labour of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and well-deserving Subjects, indeavoured to loosen their hands of gratitude which were bound up by his authoritie, in disposing of what was gotten to deserving Souldiers, and not to Jesters or Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatterers;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55221:117"/>
that they should likewise give out, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
Plotted his ruine, for no other end, but that as they had obtained their share in Counsells, they might likewise get the charge and command over the Souldiers to make them slaves to their ambition; that whilst they had need of his wealth to be imployed in the raysing of an Army, and of his credit in perswading the people to serve the Empire faithfully, his actions were commended and so received, as that infinite promises were made and obligations acknowledged, but these ceasing, the memory of al past-benefits vanisht to ayre; that these new Counsellors envied their companions greatnes, and did no sooner find out any good place, but they streightway sought how to possesse themselves of it; he said, it was an experimented case that some make use of their servants no otherwise then husbandmen doe of their Cattell, which after long and laborious service are brought to the Shambles; that his affection towards the Souldier was not unknowne to them, how liberally he used to make them partake of the fruits of his Victories and Authority.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They were further to adde that by the deposing of this General, his promises would faile of being effected, and they were to faile in their pretended satisfactions; for whosoever else should Command, would indeavour to reward those, whom he already found inroled in his owne affection, not those whom he should know depended upon his rivall; and that it being usuall in these times to hate such as are friends to our Enemies, (preferring privat passion before pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good) they should be necessitated to much obsequious suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to preserve themselves in his favour: that therefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved them all to intercede, by their humble supplications to <hi>Walestein</hi>
his Highnesse, that he would not forgoe this Army, which so much needed his assistance, and wherein his owne interest so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted; and that they should doe well to informe the Emperour how prejudiciall the losse of this Commander would be.</q>
By this <hi>Tiberian</hi> cunning of <hi>Walesteine</hi> the chiefest of the Army were much moved; for it is naturall to humane affection, greedily to solicit such things as they desire, when those things seem to shun them.</p>
            <p>The other Colonels perswaded by these leading men, whose spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches seemed as so many oracles, (such reverence did they beare unto them by reason of their intimacy with the Generall) agreed all in a resolution joyntly to present themselves before <hi>Walesteine,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him not to hurle that Army into a precipice of miseries, which he had raised above the mountaines of Victory and Glory; that they would not yeeld to obey any other Generall; that great was the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, the tempest violent, the <hi>Imperiall</hi> dignity likely to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, should it be deprived of his Worth; that therefore they were resolved to follow him, and never forgoe his Command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Wale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine</hi> seeing the hearts of his Commanders so well disposed to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wrought it so, as that <hi>Illo,</hi> should secretly and as it were of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe propound unto the rest of the Colonels, that if they desired his Highnesse should continue his charge, they were to secure him of their faith, (let whatsoever mischiefe happen through the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55221:118"/>
of the times, and of his enviers) with giving him somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hands to this purpose. The Colonels, who as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly said were very well affected to him, for his liberality used towards them, aswell in honours as in favours (the greatest tye wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Souldiers love can be bound) and who therefore reverenced him, he having particularly obliged many of them by conferring places upon them, which he would not perhaps have given to others, following herein the <hi>Ottoman</hi> policy, who value none, nor take any into their Musters, save such as are valiant and couragious, resolved to underwrite and subscribe unto a writing drawne up to this purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Wee Colonels and Chieftaines of the Warre, whose names are under written, understanding that the Duke of <hi>Mechelberg</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to quit his Command of <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> to his <hi>Caesarian</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, since that he is falsly calumniated in the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> though we have ever knowne his actions to be most loyall; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into mature consideration, that if this should happen, much mischief would insue hereupon; wee therefore moved out of the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie wee owe to his <hi>Caesarian</hi> Majestie, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and to the whole Empire, having willingly and out of our owne accord humbly besought our said Generall, not to abandon us in this so important conjuncture and great emergency, wherein his assistance is so requisite, doe all of us promise and oblige our selves, upon the faith of Gentlemen of honour, to stick still close unto him, (nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to part from him, or relinquish him, for any cause or accident whatsoever) after the best manner, and with the greatest faithfulnesse we are able.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This writing subscribed by 42 Colonells, did much inhearten <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesteine,</hi> and afflict the <hi>Austrian</hi> Ministers of State, who no wayes affrighted with the eminency of this danger, but rather assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by these proceedings of what before they did suspect, betooke themselves to their deepest wisedome and acutest wit. Whereupon it was given out, that the wisest of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Officers meeting on the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in <hi>Count d'Ognates</hi> house,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ianu.</hi> 12.</note> (the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour) the fittest meanes were considered of, how to save the <hi>Imperiall</hi> authoritie from receiving a blow by the treachery of this man. Some were of opinion,
<q>That they ought to temporize and beare with his actions, and afterwards upon fitting occasions withdraw the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from him, under the command of <hi>Italian</hi> Colonels, and not <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> that so being deprived of his so much feared reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, he might be brought to give an account of his actions.</q>
Many knowing that in State-affaires Princes ought not to deferre their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, but rather to consider every shadow of danger as a reall harm, were of opinion (and this was the embraced advice)
<q>That <hi>Picolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi>
and <hi>Gallasse,</hi> men of unsuspected fidelitie, should be suddenly sent unto him to arrest his person: But some difficultie appearing likewise in this resolution, the good successe whereof was not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for that <hi>Walesteine</hi> was begirt with many Troopes of his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and such as sided with him, so as though the rest of his Army
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55221:118"/>
should have obeyed the Emperours letters Parents conferred upon <hi>Gallasse,</hi> (which notwithstanding would be hardly effected) the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian</hi> Captains, and the greater part of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commanders, whose affections were great unto their Generall, would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themselves from his obedience; whereby hee might betake himselfe with his most intimate friends to some strong holds, from whence hee could not be gotten out without surprizall, or siege, (things of time, and full of lets, the Enemy being neer at hand, by whom he might be succourd) and so the undertaking prove rather prejudiciall, then profitable;</q>
therefore craft, and deceipt, was thought to be the best resolution; and that to compasse their ends, they were to corrupt some of his Commanders, the true way to work mischiefe to ones Enemy; for there is no so secure Treason, as that which is wrought by ones deerest friends or most esteemed Servants; nor was there any better meanes found to secure themselves from this flame, then to take away the fuell that fed it. They therefore secretly wrought an understanding with some <hi>Irish</hi> Officers of <hi>Tersica's</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with whom certaine <hi>Spaniards</hi> were very inward, that by all meanes, they might be sure to secure <hi>Walesteines</hi> person, by which action, to boot with the purchase of immortall glory, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised large recompence, and extraordinary honour: nor should they by such an act any whit staine their reputation or their bounden duty, since that fighting under the Empire of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the second, they were first bound to him, before unto their Generall; nay, it would bee a great evidence of their loyalty to fence their Prince from Felony.</p>
            <p>These words prevailed much with <hi>Lesley</hi> Captaine of <hi>Tersica's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, who betaking himselfe unto the businesse, communicated the whole affaire to Captaine <hi>Butler,</hi> and then to <hi>Cordon,</hi> Lieutenant-Colonell, and Governour of <hi>Egra,</hi> all three of them very much confiding one in another. These being desirous to be knowne the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of so great safety, and the Preservers of the Emperors Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, went consideratly seeking out how they might compasse their ends: but it being an uncertaine, and dangerous thing to make him prisoner; for though the chiefe Commanders faithfully serving <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> should obey his supremest Commands; yet the Captaines Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority availing but a little, when not seconded by obedience of the Souldiers, they plainly saw that these being well affected to their Generall, would rather be ready to free him, then to obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Officers. To prevent this therefore, they resolved to kill him; for since a dead man wages War no more, and that there are but few that prove themselves lovers of Carkasses, this was the true meanes to bring so wisht for an indeavour to good end. <hi>Caesar</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding (as it is said) was not pleased with this way of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; for being a Religious Prince, and one that feared God, hee thought that before the cause were knowne, it became not the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of his justice to give way to homicide: as also his Majesty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving borne particular affection to <hi>Walesteine,</hi> knowing him to be a very usefull Servant, he could not, (no not for such a suspition) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally blot him out of his good opinion. But for that Princes affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55221:119"/>
though never so great, are overborn by reason of State, and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines telling him, that God was not offended at the actions of great men, when they are done for the publick safety; that many things were permitted to Princes, for the preservation of their dominions, which were prohibited to privat men; and that of two evils the least was to be chosen; he suffered himselfe to be perswaded to underwrite the Order, but yet with limitation; though his Ministers of state, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the necessity of the resolution, 'twas said, that they made the heads of the conspiracy understand <hi>ex parte,</hi> that they should use the best meanes they could to effect what was agreed upon for the publique good.</p>
            <p>Whilst the <hi>Austrians</hi> at <hi>Vienna</hi> spread their nets, and did all that lay in them, to effect their mentioned deliberations, and whilst <hi>Wale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine</hi> on the other side endeavoured by the hooke of promises to win upon the affections of the heads of his Army, <hi>Horne</hi> having taken <hi>Biberack,</hi> and being advertised, that some <hi>Imperialists</hi> were quarterd at <hi>Mitelbiberack,</hi> (a Town not far from thence) he secretly came before it, surprised it, put most of them to the Sword, and the next morning with Petards and scaling-Ladders entred <hi>Valsdee,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Swaben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> seated in a Champion between certaine Woods almost in the center of that Province, invironed with Wals and Towers, and some Palisadoes and Rampiers about the Gate, after the ancient manner, the which he sackt and evilly entreated; from thence advancing forward, hee tooke <hi>Ravenspurg,</hi> and some other Townes weakely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
            <p>The Country-people of upper <hi>Austria,</hi> at this time tooke up Armes, and some Townes rose, and did much disturbe the Passage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Danube</hi>; for over-running the Country from <hi>Lintz</hi> to <hi>Passaw,</hi> they robb'd the Barkes that past thereupon, and did other mischiefe to those Frontiers; whereupon some Regiments being sent towards them, many of them were taken and cut in pieces, and divers of the chiefe of the sedition were hanged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walesteine</hi> was full of sad thoughts, which suggested his fall unto him, and the danger of his actions: whereupon not finding any better meanes to escape so important an emergency, then a bold and daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse resolution, he resolved (since that the justifications made in his behalfe at the Court by his Cosen <hi>Maximilian Walesteine</hi> were ill interpreted) to doe that very thing which was most feared: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after his retreat from <hi>Saxony</hi> into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> 'twas noised that hee sent Baron <hi>Schaffemburg</hi> Lieutenant-Generall of the Horse under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of quartering some Regiments in <hi>Austria,</hi> but that afterwards being suffered to come into <hi>Vienna,</hi> hee should indeavour some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe against the Emperour and his Counsellours. But (it being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall with those that distrust, not to suffer any thing to passe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed in the ballance of feare and suspition) as he desired to lodge some of his Troopes about <hi>Vienna,</hi> some of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Ministers of state, objecting that he was one of <hi>Walesteines</hi> confederates, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be one that sided with him, he was arrested in his own house and a good guard put upon him: and the Emperours Councell sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55221:119"/>
that in jealousie of State-affaires all delayes are harmefull, that they might not let the malady grow worse, and having already agreed upon the businesse with the afore-named Officers of the Garrison of <hi>Egra</hi> (whether they fore-saw <hi>Walesteine</hi> was to come as the fittest place for succour of the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi>) they resolved to write to <hi>Gallasse,</hi> that he should take upon him the government of the Army, prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>Walesteine,</hi> and proclame him, and all that adhered unto him, Rebells; and that he should promise and ascertaine pardon unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, who though formerly copartner in his Felony, should abandon his obedience to him. And thus Letters Patents, and Orders, were sent abroad into all quarters signifying this mans Rebellion, and inhibiting every one to follow or obey him.</p>
            <p>Yet did this resolution meet with a thousand doubts; 'twas feared lest mischief might ensue hereupon; for if <hi>Walestein</hi> should joyn with the <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces, he should have little lesse then totally have dis-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the Emperours Army, the greatest part whereof consisted of <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Bohemian</hi> Commanders, and all the Souldiery depending upon him, as one who largely rewarded them, and conferred places upon them, whereby he might believe to rely upon their obedience. The newes which he had caused to be spred abroad, that he would make himselfe be crowned King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> would be acceptable to all the Princes and free Cities of the Empire: for since it is no good policy to love to confine upon a great and powerfull Prince, whose Forces may continually be feared, 'twas the true way to rest secure from the <hi>Austrian</hi> jealousie, if that Kingdome should fall upon a third person, and the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Crown be thereof deprived, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one dreaded, by reason of its great Potency, and consequently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else could be argued but that he should be assisted and succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not onely by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> but by all the other Princes and Cities who were jealous of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
            <p>In this revolution of affaires, <hi>Walesteine</hi> not thinking himselfe safe in <hi>Pilsen,</hi> for that he was farre from the Protestant Forces, and yet not willing to goe from thence, he sent a messenger of purpose to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Waymer,</hi> who was quartered about <hi>Camb</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> to invite him to come speedily to <hi>Pilsen,</hi> for he would deliver the Citie into his hands, and desire his assistance, till such time as he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a place of safetie to thinke upon his affaires. Duke <hi>Waymer</hi> surprized with this unexpected newes, much marvelled at so sudden a resolution, as is usuall in things thought unpossible, and for that he who knowes and governes all things here below, would not permit that the wickednesse of one should be the ruine of so many, <hi>Waymer</hi> thinking this to be but a piece of imposturisme, which upon other occasions he was accustomed to use, would not give beliefe thereunto: but being more suspitious then formerly (for little faith is given to one that hath once beene faultie) he sent backe the messenger with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable excuses, not believing that <hi>Walesteine</hi> could possibly fall so violently upon such a resolution. Wherefore <hi>Walesteine,</hi> seeing his designe faile, resolved immediately to be gone from <hi>Pilsen,</hi> and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55221:120"/>
himselfe to <hi>Egra</hi> (a Citie of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> upon the borders of <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> watered by the River <hi>Eger,</hi> a place of moment, begirt with Walls and Ditches, though old, yet good and strong) that he might be the neerer to receive necessary succour from Duke <hi>Waymer</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> many of whose Forces were upon those Frontiers. He therefore marched thitherward, with <hi>Tersica, Chinschi,</hi> and <hi>Illo,</hi> and about 1000 Horse; whither being come, he againe advertised <hi>Waymer</hi> as formerly, desiring him that he would lose no time in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing; but neither did this free <hi>Waymer</hi> of suspition, but fearing to be over-reached, he grew more and more diffident; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators, seeing the occasion now proper to give accomplishment to their designe, bethought themselves how to effect it. <hi>Cordone,</hi> who was Governour of the Towne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Febru.</hi> 25.</note> did on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> invite <hi>Tersica, Illo,</hi> and <hi>Chinschi</hi> (who came accompanied with one Captaine <hi>Niman</hi>) to sup with him in the Castle, where he himselfe was lodged: supper being ended, and the servants who waited at table being dismist, that they might likewise sup, a Squadron of Armed men, chosen out to that end, entred the house, and cryed a loud, <hi>Long live</hi> Caesar; <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> and the rest of the Conspirators, who were set at the end of the table towards the doore, flew from their seats, and withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves apart, gave way for eight Souldiers to come in with Halberts and Spits, who presently flew upon the Rebells; and they throwing downe the table drew their Swords, and upbraiding <hi>Cordone</hi> and his companions with treachery, would have defended themselves, had not their courage beene confused, and the strength of their armes abated by this this superchery and unexpected accident. For whilst confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with feare and anger, they knew not on which side to looke, <hi>Tersica</hi> being slaine with the blow of a Halbert, which struck him on his left side, and <hi>Chinschi,</hi> being beaten to the ground with a Hammer, none but <hi>Illo</hi> was permitted to dye like a Souldier, and to prove that coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hearts yeeld not to death, no not when most gastly portraited, or in the most dangerous encounters: for, retiring himselfe unto a window, loudly accusing the Conspirators of infamy and base ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, mis-becomming a Souldier, and calling for helpe unto his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he so defended himselfe, as the Conspirators, partly by the fury of his countenance, partly by his threatning voice, and partly by his Sword, were almost brought to an ill passe, when laying hold upon a Spit, (whose blow he had warded) whilst he laboured to pluck it out of the Souldiers hand, he was therewithall thrust through the neck, so as it behoved him to breath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that soule, which expiring with the sight of his Enemies blood, it may be believed he dyed satisfied with his owne undauntednesse. <hi>Niman</hi> in this hurley burley pleaded innocency, and asked pardon, and going out of the chamber, might perhaps have escaped, had not the guard which waited in the Court as he came downe the staires, runne upon him, and slaine him with their Swords. This execution being done, <hi>Walesteine</hi> onely remained to put an end to this direfull Conspiracy; they therefore consulted how they might make him sure: and considering that to arrest him, would be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, uncertaine, and almost impossible, though he were deprived of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55221:120"/>
these his confidents, by reason of the uproare that would be amongst the Souldiers and other heads of the Army, they resolved, the most expedient meanes would be suddenly to kill him likewise, for this was the onely short way to effect their intents. They went out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle about twelve a clock at night, and went towards the Generalls Lodging which was upon the <hi>Piazza,</hi> who a little before hearing <hi>Tersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Chinschis</hi> wives complaine of their husbands tarrying abroade so late, was got into the window, and asked the Centinells what those complaints meant, for he was one (as hath beene said) that could not indure any noyse; <hi>Cordone</hi> being knowne to the guard, was suffered quietly to passe by them, who thought he went to speak with <hi>Walestein</hi> about some important businesse, as Governours use to doe; and as without asking any question, he was comming from the anti-chamber into the room where the General was, the door-keeper withstood him, telling him he had received directions not to suffer any one whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to come in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon they both drew, and the doore-keeper was presently slaine. <hi>Walesteine</hi> hearing this noyse, ranne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the doore, and met the Conspirators, one of which couching his Halbert, ranne him through both the sides, whereat he presently fell and dyed; hereupon an Allarme being given by the guard of the <hi>Piazza,</hi> the newes was forthwith spread throughout the whole Citie, from every quarter whereof the Souldiers flocking with their Weapons in their hands were ready to revenge their Generalls death, had not <hi>Cordone</hi> appeased them, by declaring unto them in the best manner he could the Emperours directions; wherefore there being no hopes to be had in him that was dead, and feare to be apprehended from them that were alive, they cryed out, <hi>Long live</hi> Caesar. And those that were most affectionate to him, seeming to rejoyce at his downefall, indeavoured rather by such demonstrations to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of being thought his friends, then to call to mind their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him.</p>
            <p>The next morning the Duke of <hi>Saxon Lavemberg,</hi> who had some dayes before sent a Trumpet into <hi>Erga,</hi> to acquaint <hi>Walesteine</hi> how that he was to speake with him touching the Peace, which was yet in Treatie with <hi>Saxony,</hi> had much desired him to send him a safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy; <hi>Cordone</hi> deteining the Dukes Trumpeter, sent one of <hi>Walesteines</hi> Trumpeters to him, to let him know that he expected him; who not fearing such a Stratagem, nor hearing of the late newes (for faith once given, makes the most detested Enemies be believed) came to the Towne, and was presently carryed to see the dead bodies, had a good guard set upon him, and was conveyed to <hi>Vienna.</hi> The <hi>Imperialists</hi> indeavoured likewise to insnare <hi>Waymer,</hi> inviting him againe in <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesteines</hi> behalfe to come to <hi>Egra</hi>; but he (though by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation he had had from other parts, he began to believe what had in <hi>Walesteines</hi> behalfe beene said upon him) did not notwithstanding advance without a good strength with him; so taking 2000 of the best Horse of his whole Army along, he marched thitherward; and being almost come to the Towne, he met with some Companies of Crabats, who by orders from <hi>Gallasse</hi> kept those wayes, and knew not
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55221:121"/>
what had happened in <hi>Egra,</hi> nor of the agreement; they had a great skirmish together, and the Crabats meeting with hard measure were fain to fly fort, whereby <hi>Waymer</hi> being aware of the plot returned backe to his former quarters.</p>
            <p>This newes of <hi>Walesteines</hi> death, and of the other great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, being presently known at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and every where divulged, did much rejoice such whose mindes were troubled in this perplexity;
<q>but if such as were faithfull to the Empire were glad hereof, those who sided with <hi>Walesteine</hi> and were his friends, were not so, for hereby all their designes were cut off: nor yet were the Curious satisfied herewithall, for matter being likely to arise from such novelties as would please an itching eare, they desired not the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion thereof should be taken away. Some that wisht not well to the <hi>Austrian</hi> party would declare him to be innocent, and gave out that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had wrongfully accused him, and to no other end, then to bereave him of that Authority, which being independent on them did not please them: that they had butcher'd him, for that they very well knew hee being full of exalted thoughts, which would not suffer him to comply with their intentions, nor yet to permit that Forrayners should be entertained to doe that which those of the Nation were able to effect, they feared they should not long injoy what they had possest themselves of in <hi>Germany,</hi> where they exceedingly desired to be esteemed of, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thinke no man can governe himselfe wisely, unlesse assisted by their wily craft. Others discoursing upon the grounds of past examples, concluded that if <hi>Walesteine</hi> had been resolved to violate his faith unto his Master, he was of so quick a spirit, and foresight, and was possest of so plenary an Authority, as he might easily have effected any thing he had intended. Others said, that making use of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, he cald to minde the injury that was done him, in having his charge formerly taken from him, without any demerit of his, and that therefore he had not forgot revenge. Some conceived, that he being extraordinarily proud, and excessively ambitious of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, could no longer content himselfe with his present condition, but that he aimed at the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; though this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was moderated by others upon well-grounded reasons: for that he was already well in yeares, and almost impotent; he wanted is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue male, nor was he likely to have any; his honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was already sufficiently well grounded, the Characters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of should be registred in memory, and that therefore he could not thinke to obscure the glory of his past fidelity, with a thought of a short injoying that, the event whereof was uncertaine, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie certaine. Others said, that the desire of growing greater, blindfolds mens understandings, obfuscates their senses, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes the eyes, even of the wisest men, fixing them onely upon the desired Object; that therefore there being few that can resist the force of their affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and see the gulfe, or whirlepoole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which keeps neer unto their transcendent greatnesse, they unexpectedly slip downe thereinto: and that it had thus befalne <hi>Walesteine,</hi> in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55221:121"/>
quiet condition of his present estate, and not contented with the honours and greatnesse which he had acquired.</q>
The truth was, for what may be gathered from considerate men, that <hi>Walesteine</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing satisfied with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> for the reasons aforesaid, and much suspecting their cunning, bethought himselfe how he might best fence himselfe from their blowes, and make <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> see how evilly the Emperour was counselled in bringing in of auxiliary Forces, whilst he with his owne Forces promised to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what was needfull, desiring that the aid from <hi>Spaine</hi> might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Monies, and not in men, since Authority is bounded by independent Forces; and that therefore (as his chiefe end) he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consented to joyne with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> nor openly to rebell against the Emperour: But that pretending as Duke of <hi>Mechelberg</hi> to be a soveraigne Prince, and that the Militia paid by his Monie belonged properly to him, going off from his charge with the Souldiers that depended on him, 'tis conceived that by making a third party, hee would become a looker on and see where the businesse would end; and that which side so ever should seeke for succours from him, should be inforced to give him such Conditions as he would desire. And for that his confidence in the Emperours goodnesse, bereft him of that consideration which ought with well-weighed wisedome to be soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by men powerfull in Authority, he was not aware that the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Princes by how much the higher and more unaccessible they are, so much the easier are they to be overwhelmed into the hatred of State-jealousies, he supposed to reduce <hi>Caesar</hi> to the necessity of giving him satisfaction, by driving out those Forreiners, and preserving the Authority which he had granted him: but neither daring nor willing impetuously to hazard himselfe upon a point, the end whereof was uncertaine, and whereby the name of disloyall would certainly bee purchased, he temporised in an appearing distaste, perswading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of his ambitious confidence and selfe presumption to reap consolation; the which he did firmly beliefe, thinking it was not then time to displease him, nor that any other could undergoe the great weight of that charge; since that his actions appeared alwayes to be very faithfull, till that after <hi>Feria's</hi> comming they began to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what slow in ordinary services: and for that the interest of Princes, are like purest Christall, which is dimm'd and rendred obscure by the least breath, and that verball counsells are of more force then those that are conveyed by the pen, it was the opinion of many, that those who did then possesse <hi>Caesars</hi> eare tooke opportunity by colourable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to make <hi>Walesteines</hi> actions seem suspitious, and to make the Emperours Councell be of the same opinion. Many approve hereof by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if he had totally resolved to forgoe his obedience to the Emperour, and side against him, he (as a wise man and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily followed) would not have given such evidence of his intent, (State-affaires being of so nice a nature, that bare appearances, therein appeare reall substances) but that concealing his desire under feigned dissimulation, he would upon some fitting occasion have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne himselfe from the service together with his chiefe Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55221:122"/>
and Souldiers very well affected to him; and that he would have done this so, as that the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> believing him should have come in unto his aid. And this was approved of by the testimony of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Generals, who being asked concerning this businesse, by men of no common account, could not say otherwise. But be it how it will, the businesse is weighty and worthy of remembrance, so as I thinke it not fitting to leave it here abruptly off, but by making a short digression to acquaint the reader with some of this great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders qualities.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Walesteine</hi> was borne a private Baron of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> a Childe of fortune, not much inricht in Patrimony, nor other indowments; he past his Infancy under the Tutorship of the Jesuits, where his lively spirit, when hee began to be first downe-feathered, broke the reignes of observancy, and feare of those his Elders, and vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the instability of his disposition, he seemed sometimes incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Armes, sometimes to learning, sometimes to other extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies; being afterwards entred into the larger field of Youth, and therein giving himselfe over to what his genius most led him unto, and freedome to his unquiet spirit, letting his desires domineer over him, he spent some time uncurb'd by consideration, whereby he got the respect of unwise and unstable: desirous afterwards to know other Countryes, and the fashions of other Nations (a knowledge which well becomes men of Command) he visited <hi>Flanders,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the sight of <hi>England,</hi> satisfied himselfe in <hi>France,</hi> went into <hi>Italy,</hi> (a Country which refines the Northerne wits) and having admired the magnificency of <hi>Rome,</hi> the delights of <hi>Naples,</hi> the quaintnesse of <hi>Tuscani,</hi> and the fertility of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> his curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fixt it selfe in <hi>Padua,</hi> a City apertaining to the most illustrious state of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Mother of liberall sciences, receptacle of the learned, fountaine of vertue, and there he applyed himselfe to divers studies, whereof he made himselfe at least a partaker, if not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect master; though the vivacity of his spirit, and his unquiet opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, made many esteem him to be foolishly conceited. Leaving <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua</hi> with little of renowne, though he had got the Language, and custome of the Country, he returned to <hi>Bohemia</hi>; where not able to remaine idle, though laught at by many, and contrary to the will of his Comrades, he disposed himselfe to spend part of what his Trustees had gotten in his absence, and, yet being naturally there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto inclined, he applyed himselfe to Armes, the strong keyes of glory and greatnesse. The Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being molested in <hi>Friuli</hi> by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces, desired aid of the Emperour; whereupon <hi>Walesteine</hi> boldly proffered to raise 300 Horse at his owne proper costs and charges; which offer being accepted of, and by him punctually performed, he went with the title of Colonell to the succour of <hi>Gradisca,</hi> where he tarried during that action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting wonder in men, by his generous extravagancies, and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberality; he was sumptuous in his invitations, (the true tyes of affection) reviving the conversation of his friends, rewarding and solacing the Souldiers; nothing being more able to captivate
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55221:122"/>
the good will of the Militia then generositie. Many therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be desirous of his service, which by these actions was pleasing to the Arch-Duke and his Ministers. <hi>Charles</hi> Count of <hi>Arach,</hi> a much favoured Counsellour of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> would joyne alliance with him, gave him his daughter for wife, and consequently made him partaker of his affection and protection. The differences of <hi>Friuli</hi> being composed in peace, troubles arising in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Arch-Duke being made Emperour, he had occasion to exercise his warlike genius; his father in-law had opportunitie to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance him, and fortune to favour him. Being afterwards of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man become a Prince, being from a Colonell preferr'd to be a Generall, and discovering himselfe to be wise, from being thought a foole, he made the world see, that his study was not to change opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but condition; and that there is no better fence against the blowes of envy or malice, then the received opinion of not being greatly wise; and that fortune there showres her favours where are the clouds of extravagancy. The War being afterwards brought to a happy end, as by his meanes the <hi>Imperiall</hi> State was augmented, so did <hi>Caesar,</hi> (who is alwayes wont munificently to reward good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices) by investing him with the Dukedome of <hi>Mechelberg,</hi> make him a Soveraigne Prince, and of a Subject, a Feudatory of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Being arrived at this hight, surrounded with so many applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, secured by so great merit, and glorying in his worthy actions, knowing that a good Militia is the securitie of Principalities, and and that Souldiers flock thither where recompences are frequent, honour invites, estimation inheartens, and gratitude opens the doore to munificence; by cherrishing ambition with titles, puffing up valour with praises, and securing affection by effects, he drew unto his service the best Swords, and best Wits, that of late ages have mannaged Armes.</q>

                  <hi>Walesteine</hi> was ambitious in all his actions, grave and haughtie in all his treaties, wise, and advised in all his resolutions; he was not governed by selfe-interest, not moved by profit, nor plyable by adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; he exceedingly desired to be reverenced, coveted to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and was a great maintainer of punctuallitie; he could not indure any defect in his Army; he liked not confusion; he was offended at the sloath and ignorance of those who were not indued with those parts and conditions which he desired, to wit, greatnesse of spirit, quicknesse of understanding, readinesse in Treaties, fore-sight in their doings, obedience to commands, faithfulnesse in executions. He did so abhorre any base action, as that his favour being once lost by any single fault, it was not to be regained by whatsoever merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious act. He declared, that under his command, Souldiers were to live and behave themselves like Souldiers, and not thinke they had girt their Swords about them (as many doe) to winne fame amongst the weake and vulgar sort, but amongst men of courage; such as were abandoned by fortune, and yet abounded in worth and valour, were by him splendidly entertain'd, assisted with competent helpes, and such as exceeded many of their deservings: his magnanimity
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55221:123"/>
of mind could not tollerate, that a gallant wit should beg that which so many unworthy men possest; and therefore he afforded them meanes to exercise their talents, and to climbe up those steps which Princes ought to leave free to such, as gathering rust in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and kept low by the Antipathy of such as governe, if they had wherein to imploy themselves, would (being esteem'd of by others) prove peradventure the abstract of perfection. No mans authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nor protection was of weight with him, not permitting, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conditions of birth, nor the intercession of such as were powerfull, nor that the riches of a blunted spirit should obscure the qualities of inferiours, and bereave that which worthily becomes a man of merit. Valour and knowledge in Armes, were to him the onely recommendations of a Souldier; Doctrine and exemplary life, the like to him of Church men; Wisedome and capacitie in State-Officers; Diligence and faithfulnesse in servants. Speech, nor writing, nor the request of great ones, were not able to put any one in his favour; whosoever made use of such means, rather impaired his cause then better'd it. In his Souldiers, he especially loved quicknesse of spirit, extravagancy in thoughts, and ambition; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that Valour would not admit of a low mind, a limited o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, nor respectfull humilitie. A ready action, a new thought, an unsuall audacitie, were the true wayes which led to his favour. He valued high spirits above vulgar wits, no lesse then doe good breakers of Colts. He held an opinion, that a Souldier who had too tender a conscience, and was too scrupulous in his resolution, could never be perfect in the Souldiers craft. He was not given to sensuality; for since lust reignes onely in idlenesse, he that had his understanding busied about the speculation of greatnesse and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime affaires, could not bend to a flying shadow of imperfect fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He affirmed, there was no defect more blamable in a great man then sensualitie; that the strength of <hi>Mars</hi> grew weaker in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of <hi>Venus</hi>; that the toughnesse of the mind was distempered by the fire of appetite; that constancy was lost in the laborinth of too much tendernesse, and politick wisedome in the like of specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that the livelinesse of the spirit suffered through the mist of Effeminacy. He much coveted to exceed others in glory; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost drunke with envy, he let himselfe loose to be governed thereby; he termed those poorly-minded, who content with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were in, did only live to eate, and slept to divert the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of time, which they could no otherwise employ then in satisfying their senses; he was immesurably angry; sudden in his hatred; rash in resolutions; obstinate in the execution thereof. Lasinesse was never lodged in his bosome; he spent such houres as he could exempt, from either politick or military affaires, in the study of some Science, and in speculation how he might make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more remarkable. Dissimulation was banisht his Court; nor cared he for any that used it: he said, it was the weapons of feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and basely minded men, who would cover their pusillanimity under a smile, or teare; that base flattery became not freedome and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55221:123"/>
liberty. Hee was well-pleased with pompe, sumptuousnesse, and applause. He affirmed they merited not the honour of Command, whose appetite lead them not to glory; that glory was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne which led the way to worthy actions. Such of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as were most brave and costly in their apparell were best liked by him; he had no harbour for covetousnesse; he abounded in libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; he cald those who were mony-Masters, Servants, and that wise man a foole who did worship his Cofery; he was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he who had not a great heart and much of generosity could never become a great Commander. He would reply to some of his friends, who would put him in minde that Gold is the sinnewes of greatnesse, you say well, but it must be then in the hands of one that is not a slave thereunto: greatnesse followes greatnesse; great Souldiers have great hopes, and these keep the field, where great rewards are to be had: whilst <hi>Caesar</hi> powers on me his great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficencies you see how he is served; I finde no Gold that can weigh in the scales with the merit of a valiant Souldier; read the bed-role of my Commanders, and then argue upon any actions. Hee added that Souldiers were Masters of Gold, not that of them; Kingdomes might be said to be cheaply got, by rewarding the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia; that no better interest or use was made of Monies then from that principall which was invested in the Sword, in a bold courage and resolute headpeece: that Princes were never impoverished by rewarding their servants. He greatly loved his masters gereatnesse; he desired he should be reverenced, and coveted still to make him greater; knowing very well that by how much the greater Princes are, so much more conspicuous is the function of their Officers. He laught at some ignorantly ambitious, who for having mustered their Squadrons, or stood Centinell some one might, in some safe Fort, farre enough from the Enemy, pretended to be equally trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them who had lost their bloud, and by their experience had made themselves worthy of imployment; as his favours shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red plentifully downe upon men of worth, so were the hopes of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and poorly spirited men but small.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To counterpoise his praise-worthy conditions, they were much allaid by his haughtinesse, cruelty, and hasty fiercenesse; his unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse in Religion, the little respect he bore to the Churchmen, and his hereticall maximes, made him be knowne to be wicked, a miscreant, and not deserving a good name. Hee together with the Church-men, exceedingly hated their riches; were it either that he himselfe coveted them, or for the naturall envy he bore to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans goods, or for that he would curry favour with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> the greatest part whereof were no friends to Friers. Hee would abusively say amongst his friends, that the exorbitant great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of some of these Church-men, was, both <hi>ratione divina</hi> and <hi>humana,</hi> to be moderated by wise Princes: exaggerating, that cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing their appetites with these worldly preferments, and giving way to temptation through their having the world at will, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came idle, and ran into many publick scandals; he added that the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55221:124"/>
inriching of these men was the impoverishing of the laity; since that the Monies which were more then superfluous for them, and was lost in their luxuries, might be imployed to the publick service of the Empire; moreover that since by their great revennues the incomes of Princes was lessened, it was a matter of great conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that so many should be suffered to injoy so pleasing a quiet; for that if they were turned loose into the world, neither would ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration so much decline, nor would Christian Princes bee put to such streights for Souldiers, Townes would not be so unpeopled, neither would Principality be so much prejudiced.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Hee had under his service men of all Nations of Europe; and every valiant man found a place in his favour, but of all other <hi>Italians</hi> had the preheminency; hee would call that Nation spritly, wary, full of craft; and to this purpose he was wont to say, the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> were the onely wits, on the other side the Mountaines; to those that would propound <hi>Spaine</hi> unto him for a wise Nation, hee would reply, that the great wisedome wherewith the <hi>Spaniards</hi> maintained their greatnesse, had not its originall in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but was learned in <hi>Italy</hi>; the Councels of that Monarch being best guided by <hi>Spaniards</hi> Itallianated, and <hi>Italians</hi> Spaniolised. He was of opinion that the quickest spirits were bred up in the schooles of Vice, and accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of craft. His thoughts were high, his hopes vast, and his ends strangely profound. He consented not to the warre of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but disswaded from it, and made it appeare that the unconquered Forces of the greatest Emperour that for many ages had reigned, and who was victorious over so many Provinces, ought not to bee imployed against one of his owne innocent Feudatories. He ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med revenge upon inferiours, the advice of weake spirits; high and magnificke resolutions, the effects of a well qualified soule. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was (as his most intimate friends said) to carry his Forces against the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and he vaunted himselfe, that he would give a happy beginning to that war without putting the Emperour to any cost.</q>
A high designe, but who shall consider his fortune, the quality and numbers of his Commanders and Souldiers, will see that no Emperour since <hi>Charles</hi> the firsts time had a more flourishing Army, greater store of Souldiers, more able Commanders, nor more absolute experience: leaving out many who betooke themselves to serve other Princes after his charge was taken from him at the Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> I cannot omit to put you minde of what might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for from the valour of <hi>Godfrey Pappenheim, Iohn Aldringer, Philip Mansfeild,</hi> Baron <hi>Cronemberg, Holch, Offcuts, Schamburg, Tiffembec, Festemberg, Ghets, Merodes, Fuchari, Harnem, D'Harcourt, Asfelt, Benecawsem,</hi> and other <hi>Dutch</hi> Gentlemen, each of which was worthy to lead an Army, and governe a Province; as likewise from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and beyond humane intelligence of a <hi>Mathias Gallasso, Ernestus Montecuculi, Octavius Picolomini, Hanniball Gonsag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55221:125"/>
and the Governour shewed so much resolution, and judgement, as that making use of such defences as would have served others ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a cause of feare then confidence, he made continually new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, digging up new grounds, filling houses up with earth, making Palisadoes, and Wood-workes, where any breach was made in the Wals by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Artillery, as when the Enemy thought to enter the Towne, through any such breach, they then found grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hinderances; for these their inward trenches being furnished with coragious &amp; valiant Muskettiers, with Morter-pieces loaded w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> bags of Bullets, and with Pikemen, whilst the <hi>Swedes</hi> got upon the battered Wals ready to leap into the Towne, they received such salutations of Musket-shot as they were forced to retreat, and thinke of some other meanes how to advance and win ground; in the which they lost so much time &amp; so many men, as that the <hi>Imperialists</hi> did bravely, and as I may say almost beyond example, make their party good from the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi> till the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August.</hi> At last more overcome by Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then by the Enemy, they capitulated, and <hi>Martij</hi> marched forth with 400 Foot and 30 Horse, to his unspeakable glory, in having so long defended so weake a hold.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Swedes</hi> made these proceedings in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was not the meane while idle, who having made all requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Provisions for the recovery of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> by which he was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle incommodated, he marched with an Army of 14000 Souldiers towards <hi>Strawbing,</hi>

            <p>On the other side <hi>Horne</hi> in upper <hi>Swabenland</hi> having well-weighed the <hi>Austrians</hi> proceedings, and knowing that <hi>Miminghen</hi> would bee a place fitting for his purpose, to make there an Arsenall of Armes, and a Magazine of all fitting Provisions, that he and his Forces might keep in those parts, he resolved to try the taking of it; whereupon comming before it, and beginning gallantly to play upon it with 14 piece of Cannon, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> under the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of Count <hi>D'Arcus,</hi> having couragiously maintained the Assault, wanting succour, and not being above 700 Foot to defend so great a circuit of Wall, were at last inforced to yeeld, and upon Articles to open the Gates to the Conquerour.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorayn</hi> who at this time kept in the <hi>Vogesan</hi> Mountains (which border upon the uttermost parts of <hi>Lorayne</hi> towards <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>) perceiving (by the <hi>French</hi>-mens surprisall of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayne,</hi> by their Garrison in <hi>Nancy,</hi> by other places possest by their Forces, and by the King of <hi>France's</hi> anger, occasioned by Duke <hi>Charles</hi> his sinister behaviour; and chiefely by reason of his Brothers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, who married the Princesse <hi>Margueret</hi> at <hi>Brussels</hi>) his great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being totally bereft of his Dukedome, and yet resolving not to forgoe his good Intelligence with the <hi>Austrians</hi>; desirous likewise not to see <hi>Lorayne</hi> fall into the hands of any others then some of his owne family, pitcht upon new resolutions, which were very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55221:125"/>
and thought to be very opportune, had not he through this vizard looked upon another object, and higher designe.</p>
            <p>He therefore resolved to renounce his state to the Cardinall <hi>Francis Nicholas</hi> his Brother; for that he being one that had beene no wayes faultie, might easily find both pardon and favour from the King. The Cardinall desired the Kings consent thereunto, who graciously affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it him: Insomuch, as it was reported this was done, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise he should joyne in alliance with some such Prince as the King should approve of, whereupon it was jestingly said, it was with the Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and that he should really quit all intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and with Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> as those who caused jealousies and suspitions in the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because these pretences were regulated by the Dukes agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the <hi>Austrians</hi> approbation (as it was commonly said) to delay time till fortune might look favourably upon the affaires of the Empire; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not permitting that the Cardinall should marry with a Subject that depended upon <hi>France,</hi> nor yet that submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe to the will of the <hi>French,</hi> he should unherd himselfe from them, and their protection, and the streights wherein they found themselves being of moment herein, they the more willingly set about it; So as, that the marriage which the King approved of might not take effect, and that the new Duke might not forsake the <hi>Austrian</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they betooke themselves to new resolutions.</p>

               </gap> (the true meanes to cover all breach of word) Duke <hi>Charles</hi> wrought the matter so, as that the Dutchesse his Wife should relinquish all her claime she had to that Dukedome, as heire to Duke <hi>Anthony</hi> her Father, and <hi>Charles</hi> his Uncle, to her Sister the Princesse <hi>Claudia</hi>; for that the Cardinall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded afterwards by reason, that he should not be Duke if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Claudia,</hi> as enfeoffed by the Dutchesse, were descended out of the house of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> that I say, palliating by these excuses which were so advantagious to this so well woven peece of Art, he might marry this Princesse, and render the <hi>French</hi> designe vaine. The Cardinall suffering himselfe thus unwisely to be governed by his Brothers inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed counsell, and the like of his friends, unprovidently, and without the Kings knowledge or consent, resolved upon this match; which proving a great concernment to the <hi>French</hi> Commanders and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, who very well knew how ill those Princesse and the people of those parts were inclined to them, they sent speedy newes hereof to the Court, and were advised to increase their guards, and to watch more narrowly over the new Dukes proceedings.</p>
            <p>On the other side, this Duke judging by the new demeanour of the <hi>French,</hi> and call'd on by his owne consideration to examine his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, found that he was to expect some new accident; he judged it was not safe for him to tarry longer at <hi>Nancy,</hi> where he was little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a prisoner amidst so many guards, nor yet to quit the State, which by his assistance he hoped to preserve. He chose a third way
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55221:126"/>
believed by himself, and confident to be the most behovefull for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety of his owne person upon all occasions, and not to give jealousies to the <hi>French</hi>; and this was to retire himselfe to <hi>Luneville,</hi> a place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt onely with bare Walls, seated neare the <hi>Mosell,</hi> ten Leagues from <hi>Nancy,</hi> where the Dukes of <hi>Lorayne</hi> have their places of pleasure, and are wont to recreate themselves with Hunting. Under pretence of such disportment he went thither; and being there, answer came from <hi>France,</hi> to the Letters formerly sent, wherein was contained (as was commonly reported) that the <hi>French</hi> Commanders should have a di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligent eye to secure the forth-comming of both their Highnesses, that upon the occasioned appearances, since the Dukes deeds differed from his words, <hi>La Motta</hi> should be demanded of him, a strong place, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated upon a Rock: that the Princesse <hi>Claudia</hi> should be sent to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>; and that the <hi>French</hi> might be permitted to put a Garrison into <hi>Luneville,</hi> whereby they might keepe those Dukes from parting thence. To performe this, the Marshall <hi>Dela Force</hi> went to <hi>Lune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and in seemly and faire manner delivered his Embassy to the Duke; who surprised with this unexpected accident, granted <hi>Luneville,</hi> but did immediately refuse to deliver up <hi>La Motta,</hi> or to be deprived of his Wife, upon reasons conformable to the agreement a little before made: But the Marshall replying, that this was his Commission, and exhorting his Highnesse to submit unto the Kings will, the Duke growing pale, and complaining of violence, replyed, he had no other place to retire unto but <hi>La Motta</hi>; that his Wife was given unto him for a Companion by God, and that nothing but death should part him and her; that the King might content himselfe with being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of <hi>Nancy,</hi> and of all the remainder of his State. To which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, the Marshall replyed, I ought and will obey my King; your Highnesse may doe well to aske counsell this night of your pillow; I will send one of his Majesties Captaines of the Guard to morrow for your answer.</p>
            <p>The Marshall this meane while taking his leave, gave order that such Foot and Horse as were lodged thereabouts, should draw neerer <hi>Luneville,</hi> to prevent any thing of noveltie that might ensue if the Duke should escape thence. The next morning the Captaine of the Guard came, accompanied with good store of Horse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon the three demands made by the Marshall, but got no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answer from the Duke, save onely, that if he would accept of <hi>Luneville,</hi> he would deliver it over unto him, it being a place of no consideration; but that he would never forgoe <hi>La Motta,</hi> nor his Wife; and with these words, making his owne Wife, and the Wife of Duke <hi>Charles</hi> goe into the Coach, he himselfe got on Horse-backe, and going from <hi>Luneville,</hi> went towards <hi>Marienville.</hi> The Captaine following him, came up unto him, and desired to know whether hee intended to goe; to which the Duke replyed, whether it shall please God; since I can find safetie in no place; the Captaine added, your Highnesse will please to excuse me; I onely askt it that I might wait upon you; 'Tis more then needs said the Duke; I am comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so to do said the Captain, and then poynting out unto him the way
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55221:126"/>
to <hi>Nancy,</hi> he said, your Highnesse must goe this way, not that way. The Duke astonished to see himselfe thus made prisoner, galloped to the Coach where the two Duchesses were, and crying out aloud, that they were betrayed, broke out into such expressions against the <hi>French</hi> Ministers of State, as the Captaine was inforced to reprehend him, and to wish him to be more advised in his speeches. The Duke was hush, and not able to say a word, went to <hi>Nancy:</hi> where new Guards being put into the Castle, and all the Avenues being well lookt unto, though the <hi>French</hi> would not owne this as restraint, the desires concerning his Wife and <hi>Le Motta,</hi> were againe renewed; the which the Duke still denying, the <hi>French</hi> were much perplext what to doe, and the Duke fell upon a thousand severall imaginations; when newes came from all parts, that the King being highly offended with him, for his aforesaid actions, was resolved to have him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming, since his words and actions did not correspond. The Duke fearing to incurre further displeasure, knowing he could not by any other Treatie withdraw himselfe from the imminent danger which hung over him, resolved to save himselfe and his Duchesse; and losing his State, to enjoy at least that libertie which he held dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then Kingdomes. He therefore acquainted Monsieur <hi>Pollion,</hi> an ancient servant of his, and one in whom he much confided, with this his intention; and discoursing how they might make an escape, they at last agreed, that the said <hi>Pollion,</hi> under pretence of Hunting, should send some Horses, Hounds, and Hunts-men, towards those parts which lead into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and that these being left in severall places upon the way should wait for their comming; but all the difficulty lay in their getting out of the Castle, in the which, to boot with the other Guards at the Gates, a hundred <hi>Harguebuziers</hi> waited in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward roomes and lodgings; and especially every night and morning the Serjeant Major of the City, under pretence of visiting their Highnesses, came to see whether they were there or no, so as their getting thence would prove a hard matter; They therefore did herein imploy their wits; and at last they light upon a secret paire of staires, which opening from the Duchesses lodging landed upon the ground, and from thence the way lay through a little gate into the old City, by which they thought to escape: but there was at the foot of this stair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case, a house wherein some of the <hi>French</hi> Guard lay; and the little gate being chained up with great Irons chaines, provided of purpose by the <hi>French,</hi> and no passage being to be had without the breaking thereof, Monsieur <hi>D'Pollion</hi> advised hereupon with a very skilfull Smith, with whom he prevailed so farre as to make him desirous his Master might escape. So as the appoyntment being made betweene them, and the Duke calling for Monsieur <hi>D'Morisse,</hi> a Servant of his, in whom he much trusted, and to whom he imparted the businesse, they consulted together how they might effect their desires.</p>
            <p>They agreed that the Smith being let into the Chamber apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led like a Gentleman, should breake open the Gate before the time of going to bed, that the Duchesse should depart in a Pages habit, and that the Duke comming downe the said staires by night should get to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55221:127"/>
Monsieur <hi>Pollions</hi> house, where course should be taken for their get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Towne. On the last of <hi>March</hi> the Smith came into the Chamber and hid himselfe underneath the Dukes bed, the Serjeant Major had according to his custome given good night unto their Highnesses, when Monsieur <hi>De Pollion</hi> having a Page before him with a Torch lighted in his hand entred the Castle, and came into the Duchesses Chamber who was laid in her bed, and streightway putting on the Pages apparrell, tooke the same Torch in her hand and went before Monsieur <hi>Pollion</hi> out of the Castle, the Guards suspecting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: the Duke after midnight descended the staires with his shooes off, and without any trouble past through the Guards chamber, and got also out of the Castle; for the Souldiers, who suspected nothing, were all asleep; and when he was come to Monsieur <hi>Pollion's</hi> house, that they might with more safety get out of the City, hee and the Duchesse cloathed themselves like two Gardiners, who are wont to carry dung out of the City, to such Gardens as lye about <hi>Nancy</hi>; and having so besmeared their faces, as that they rather looked like Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers then Princes, the next morning at the opening of the Gates, with each of them a basket of dung upon their Shoulders, they passed freely out of the City. Monsieur <hi>Pollion</hi> who under pretence of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (as hath been said) was to go out, got into his Coach with six Horses soone after the Duke and Duches were gone, and without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any the least suspition, went out of the City; for the Guards having lookt into his Coach suffered him to passe as they had used to doe. The Duke and Duchesse this meane while in their counterfeit apparrell walked apace, and were got a good way off the City, but were so weary by reason of their burthens and their walking on foot, which they were not accustomed to doe, as that the afflicted Duchesse was ready to fall upon the ground, and the Duke stood wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to see the poore Lady brought to such a condition; when the Coach comming up to them they began to take comfort, threw away their baskets, and got readily into the Coach, and made what hast they could to the place appointed, where their horses staid for them; where immediately getting upon fresh horses, they arrived happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>French Contée</hi> and came to <hi>Bisanzon,</hi> where they rested them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Monsieur <hi>Morisse</hi> his house, after their wearysome journy.</p>
            <p>The next morning the Serjeant Major came according to his custome to give their Highnesse a good morrow, when the doore-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per stept unto him, and desired him to forbeare a little for that his Highnesse was not well; the other was content, but returned againe some two houres after; the doore-keeper would not yet open the doore unto him, excusing himselfe that he had received such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the Duke his Master: the Serjeant-Major threatened then to beate open the doore; to whom the other answered he had no reason to doe so; and said it was a shame, that a poore Prince should not be suffered to sleep as long as he would, and did thus a while enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him; but not knowing that they were gone out of their beds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their customes at other times, hee resolved to knocke at the doore, and hearing no answer made he forced it open, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55221:127"/>
into the chamber seeing no body there, and finding the staire door broken open, he found what the matter was, and much incensed, sent many Horsemen abroad in pursute of them, who rid many Leagues to little purpose.</p>
            <p>These Princes having staid some dayes at <hi>Bisanzon</hi> where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresht themselves after their sufferings, and laying aside their gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners weeds, they went from thence and tooke their way towards <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> where, by order from that Duke, they were feasted, presented, and entertained like Princes, though the Embassadour of <hi>France</hi> (as it was reported) desired they might be there detained. From thence they went to <hi>Milan,</hi> where they were civilly and honourably entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Infanta</hi>; and being furnisht with Monies and all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, they went to reside at <hi>Florence,</hi> and in this case remain'd the begun misfortunes of that house; which as formerly it had vaunted it selfe to be envied for its happinesse, appeared now to be prosecuted by fortune as much as any other whatsoever. And by this vicissitude it is proved how unstable humane constancy is, how flattering hope is false, and what folly is in the best wits.</p>
            <p>The chiefe <hi>French</hi> Commanders who were quartered every where in that Dukedome, upon the newes hereof flockt to <hi>Nancy</hi>; newes was sent to the King; The Marshall <hi>de la Force</hi> was this meane while drawing neer to <hi>la Motta</hi> to force the Garrison thereof to yeeld, if he should not obtaine it by Commission from the Duke; when hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what had happened, he delayed not to come before it, to raise his batteries,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aprill</hi> 5.</note> and on the fifth of <hi>Aprill</hi> began to play upon the Towne, wherein the Baron <hi>d'Ische</hi> commanded in Chiefe, a valiant Gentleman, and who playing reciprocally upon the <hi>French,</hi> shewed he had no mind to yeeld the Towne.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> was at this time imployed in the government of <hi>Cambray</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> who incited by his sprightly courage, thinking that his Martiall <hi>Genius</hi> would be suffocated by keeping quiet within the precincts of those Mountaines, whilst Warre was waged in all parts else; and remembring that nothing doth more prejudice a lively Prince then idlenesse, resolved to betake himselfe to some imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein he might exercise his valour; whereupon since the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who exceedingly desire to have the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> their sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendaries, aswell to draw them to side with them, as to make their service seem the more honourable, had often times invited him to take upon him the place of his late Brother Prince <hi>Philiberto,</hi> or else the government of the <hi>Flanders</hi> Forces, he resolved at last to accept of their offer. Hee therefore consented to take upon him that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, left <hi>Cambray,</hi> and passing into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> went from thence to <hi>Brussels,</hi> having sent his Wife the Princesse of <hi>Corigniano</hi> together with his Children to <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Princes suddaine departure afforded matter of discourse to the curiosity of our newes-mongers; some would have it that he had thus secretly absented himselfe out of some privat distate hee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the Duke his Brother; others thought hee thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to better his condition, invited thereunto by glory, and desire to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55221:128"/>
change the government of <hi>Savoy,</hi> for that of <hi>Flanders</hi>; others that were more speculative, would not sticke to say that this was done by the privity of the Duke his Brother, who was thought by many, that though he outwardly appeared to be well affected to the <hi>French,</hi> yet that inwardly hee depended upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> party, so as they thought this his departure was not without the consent of his Brother, but covertly cloaked, lest he might cause jealousie in the <hi>French,</hi> who were ready openly to declare themselves against the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Austrians</hi> aswell in <hi>Vienna,</hi> as in all other places, were this mean while diligent in providing for the present emergencies, and more particularly the <hi>Spaniards</hi> used all possible meanes to provide for all necessaries for the Field, and they imployed all their indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that since the place of <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> which was conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> concern'd them in reputation, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme some notable piece of service. To this purpose some Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments commanded by <hi>Colloredo</hi> were made to advance towards <hi>Slesia,</hi> where having possest themselves of a great part of the Country they recovered the Citie and Castle of <hi>Olss,</hi> situated in a large plaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Oder</hi> &amp; the <hi>Bartsch,</hi> begirt about with Ditches &amp; Wals; it made no defence but yeelded upon discretion; and the Garrison being 500 Souldiers, took service under the Emperours Colours. And for that the businesse of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> was that which most troubled the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> they resolved to indeavour the recovery thereof, aswell that they might satisfie the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as likewise to honest their owne Counsels; for they knew the name of this Citie was famous, for the many Dyets had been held therein, and therefore the taking of it would sound wel in the peoples eares, and would win reputation to the forces of a King, who would not be much cried-up, should hee meet with misfortune at the first entrance into his government. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides they thought the enterprise would not bee very difficult, the Towne being unprovided of necessaries, the Country and strong Holds round about it possest by <hi>Romanists,</hi> and it not being in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to resist an Army, since it was not perfectly and according to the rules of Fortification walled about or defended, nor could be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured by the <hi>Swedes</hi> without evident danger, difficulty and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. All requisite preparations were made in <hi>Austria,</hi> as also in all other Provinces belonging to the Emperour and his friends, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect so important a businesse, wherein so much of reputation lay, and so much the rather for that it seemed a shamefull thing to every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that a place not very strong, and in the heart of the <hi>Romanists</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, should have it in a Garrison of such as were of a repugnant beliefe.</p>
            <p>The Landgrave of <hi>Hessen,</hi> who was with his Army as this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Hidelsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ime,</hi> did draw neerer unto it. And the losse of this place being like to prove a great blow to the <hi>Romanists,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Coln</hi> perswaded <hi>Benecawsem,</hi> who was Marshall of the Field, to succour it by all meanes possible; the which (though he knew it would be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter) he indeavoured, but to no purpose, for he was beaten
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55221:128"/>
back by the <hi>Swedes</hi> with some losse in his Reare: so as the besieged, seeing themselves but in a sad condition, failing of their expected succour, and thinking that they had done all that their honour did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them unto, they soone after delivered up that good Citie upon honourable conditions, into the hands of the Landsgraves Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, marching forth with flying Colours, Drums beating, two piece of Cannon, 1700 Foot, and 350 Horse.</p>
            <p>The delay of <hi>Miminghen</hi> had opened the passages of <hi>Swabenland,</hi> and secured the <hi>Swedes</hi> behind on that part. But <hi>Horne,</hi> who knew it would be hard for him to keepe in that Countrey, if he should not first make himselfe Master of some place upon the Lake of <hi>Constantz,</hi> and <hi>Lindaw</hi> being a place not to be then indeavoured by reason of the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation and the strength thereof, it being well guarded and much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by the <hi>Austrians</hi>; and finding <hi>Constantz</hi> impossible to be taken, he thought upon the taking of <hi>Vberlinghen,</hi> which though there were divers circumstances which would render it hard to be taken, notwithstanding, invited by some intelligence hee held with some of the Protestant inhabitants, and comforted by hope, which makes men carefull in what they goe about, he resolved to try his fortune.</p>
            <p>He to this purpose, moved with his Army from their severall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and marched thitherward, came with 8000 fighting men and 12 piece of Cannon before the Towne, and within a few dayes made his approaches to the Ditch and Walls; the Towne, though it were onely surrounded with a single Ditch and Towers, after the ancient manner, and some Trenches made where it was weakest, resolved not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding to defend it selfe. The Inhabitants did therefore make Rampiers of earth against the Walls, the Gates, and such Towers as they thought weakest, made places to retreat unto, cut off their streets, closing them up with strong Trenches and Pallizadoes, and began with their Cannon and Musket-shot to re-salute the <hi>Swedish</hi> Campe. <hi>Horne</hi> having playd incessantly upon the Towne with his Cannon for some dayes space, and a sufficient breach being made, he commanded an assault to be given, as was done with much courage and great force by the <hi>Scots</hi> under <hi>Ruthens</hi> command, but with no lesse valour and boldnesse repulsed by the defendants, and some fresh supplyes that were come in unto their succour: yet for all this <hi>Horne</hi> altred not his mind, but streightened the Towne every houre more and more, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the Walls, and firing the houses with Granadoes, artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fires, and with the Cannon; but the besiegeds diligence increasing as did the <hi>Swedes</hi> offences, <hi>Hornes</hi> confidence began to coole; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (perceiving that the difficultie grew every day greater, that his men grew lesse, and that the Garrison in the Towne was increased by dayly succours which were by the Lake sent in) his wisedome prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over his passion, and that he might not from a Generall of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, become but the Commander of some few Troopes, he raysed his siege and returned to his quarters. But because the difficultie of these proceedings arose from the Lake, which afforded meanes of succour to the Townes built thereupon, and it proving unpossible to take any
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55221:129"/>
one of them without cutting off the passage thereunto by water, he thought the taking of <hi>Bucorne</hi> would be a good meanes to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this, it being a walled Towne, upon the Banks of the Lake, between <hi>Vberlinghen</hi> and <hi>Lindaw</hi>; a fit place to build Boats, and to scoure those Rivers: He therefore rising from before <hi>Vberling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen,</hi> turned thitherwards, and without any obstacle tooke the Towne, and gave present directions for the so fortifying it, as that it might be a safe station; and gave likewise order for the building of two small men of Warre, which might serve to make excursions upon the Lake.</p>
            <p>All things necessary for their going into the Field being prepared in <hi>Austria</hi> and in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the <hi>Imperialists</hi> put themselves in order, and prepared to march: The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> parted from <hi>Vienna,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a considerable number of Nobilitie, and came within a few dayes to <hi>Prage,</hi> where mustering his Army, he found therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30000 fighting men; and having weighed severall expedient meanes how to regaine that place, the losse whereof so much molested all those people, he left <hi>Prage</hi> and marched towards <hi>Pilsen</hi> about the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>May</hi> 20.</note> but the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who had given a Rendezvous to all his Forces about <hi>Turgaw,</hi> had sent 12 Regiments towards the Frontiers of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> so to rayse jealousies in the <hi>Imperialists</hi> who were quartered in that Kingdome and if not to divert the taking of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> at least to dismember the <hi>Austrian</hi> Army, in obliging it to divide it selfe, that so he might afford more way for <hi>Waymer</hi> and <hi>Horne</hi> to incampe against them: and just so it fell out; for that he might not leave that Kingdome unprovided for, the King left <hi>Collorado</hi> there with 10000 Souldiers, and his Majestie, with the rest of the Army, leaving <hi>Pilsen,</hi> went towards the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; having first made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good appoyntment, and taken good order with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Aldringer,</hi> that they likewise should advance against <hi>Ratisbon</hi> on the other side.</p>
            <p>The great preparations which were made in all parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the <hi>Austrian</hi> Dominions, by the wisedome and gold of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and on the contrary side, the dayly declining of the Protestant and <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces after the losse of their King, the chiefe heads and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours whereof, not caring by new Levyes to recruit their shrunk Companies, but onely looking after their owne particular profit and advantage, fill'd <hi>Oxesterne</hi> with many thoughts, who as Director of all their affaires, had the whole weight lying upon his wisedome; and wit availing but little where force is wanting, nor such fruitfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being to be hoped for from Commanders interessed in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular gaine, as are produced by great and magnanimous hearts; nor yet the decaying Contributions being sufficient to satisfie the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pretences, who not having wherewithall to answer their ill-taught wills as formerly, by reason of the Countries being impoverished, demanded pay; <hi>Oxesterne</hi> resolved forthwith to send his Sonne Embassadour to <hi>Holland,</hi> and into <hi>England,</hi> as well to demand assistance in money, men, and advice, as also their interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the King of <hi>France,</hi> for by waging Warre with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:55221:129"/>
in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flaunders,</hi> the succours which were expected from those Provinces in <hi>Germany</hi> being deteined for their owne defence, the Protestant Forces might more boldly proceed in the <hi>Austrian</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
            <p>The Embassadour was curteously received by the States, and sent away, if not fully satisfied in his desires, at least comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with great hopes. From thence he went for <hi>England</hi>; where, by His Majestie of <hi>England,</hi> hee was nobly entertained as the Sonne of <hi>Oxesterne</hi>; but not bringing any Letters with him from the Queene of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> not knowing that <hi>Oxesterne</hi> had any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to Create Embassadours, he was refused audience as an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherewithall his Father, who was then at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> being suddenly acquainted, he being a man greatly esteemed of, and of high pretences, was thereat scandalized, and without more adoe sent for his Sonne backe, and seemed nor to be much satisfied with the <hi>English,</hi> nor with his fruitlesse Embassy. Hereupon the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Confederate Circuits were speedily summoned to <hi>Franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> to consult how they might best mannage the Warre, and to put on such resolutions as might be most adequate to the present im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minencies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hidelsheim</hi> being surrendred (as hath beene said) to the Landgrave of <hi>Hessen,</hi> he, after the taking thereof, joyned with <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Lunenberg,</hi> who was quartered in <hi>Westfalia,</hi> with a strength of men to about 5000 Foot and 2000 Horse; they joyntly went towards <hi>Scheld,</hi> a Towne betweene <hi>Gostar</hi> and <hi>Hidelsheim,</hi> the Garrison whereof being weake, as not amounting to above 600 Foot, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to contest against a great Body of Souldiers provided with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, the Commander fore-seeing the Enemies approach thought best to quit the place, and tooke away with him the ablest Citizens that he might get Contribution from them; then went to <hi>Wolfembuttell</hi> a considerable strength, the preservation whereof as it was greatly indeavoured by the <hi>Austrians,</hi> so did this Governour bend all his thoughts upon the maintaining of it, and therefore this Garrison was no little comfort to him, though his Souldiers got not all safe thither; for being overtaken in this their march by the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> Horse, who pursued them closely, about 40 of them were taken prisoners and cut off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Waymer,</hi> who was at this time quartered with his Forces about <hi>Newmarch</hi> in the upper <hi>Palatinate,</hi> had an eye to the <hi>Imperialists</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and was informed, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Army was drawing up towards him, and that on the other side the <hi>Bavari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were not farre from <hi>Ratisbon</hi>; therefore that he might indeavour as much as in him lay to hinder these advancements, he rose from the place aforesaid, and incamped himselfe betweene <hi>Ratisbon</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> that he might be the neerer to bring succour to that Citie, in the losse whereof he shared deeper then any other, as he had partaken of much glory in the taking of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Forces being come before <hi>La Motta,</hi> the Garrison whereof did gallantly defend themselves, the Marshall <hi>Dela Force</hi>

            <p>By this time the <hi>Bavarians</hi> were on their side come within sight of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> appeared likewise on the other side; <hi>Waymer</hi> who was much troubled that so famous a purchase which he to his great renowne had wonne should be lost, passing over the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Kelchaine</hi> a place above <hi>Ratisbon</hi> neer to the said River entred the City, and marching with wonderfull admiration in the sight of the Enemies whole Army, hee put thereinto a recruit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a thousand Souldiers and some barrels of Powder.

            <p>The Siege of <hi>Ratisbon</hi> continued, against the which the <hi>Imperialists</hi> thundred Cannon-shot, hailed Musket-bullets, and used Granadoes, and other artificiall fires, to effect their desires; wherein though they found much more of difficulty, then they at first imagined, yet did not they quite lay aside their hopes; but this being the first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise undertaken by an Army commanded by a King in person, who was come into the field with so great Forces, wherein if he should not prevaile, all his credit would be lost, and the Enemy inheartned, they imployed all their might to overcome whatsoever difficulties. The <hi>Swedes</hi> and Inhabitants were no lesse vigilant in defending themselves with equall valour, molesting the <hi>Imperialists</hi> with continuall Sallies, and hindering their approaches by great and small shot, wherewithall many were slaine; for the besieged not having their wals rampired whereby to resist the Enemies briske Assaults, it behoved them by their frequent shooting to keep them aloofe off; the which was done with much diligence, as that through the smoake and fire of Cannon shot, the Towne seemed to be all on fire; when <hi>Aldringer</hi> by order from the King went with 15 Regiments to succour <hi>Lanshut,</hi> which was streightly beset by <hi>Horne</hi>; and as he thought to enter in by one Gate, the <hi>Swedes</hi> being let in by the other, (whilst he was upon the Bridge, ready to enter the Towne,) he was slaine with a Musket-bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; not without suspition that this had happened unto him from his owne side, in revenge of some injuries done unto them; for such was his severity, as hee was rather feared then beloved by the Souldier.</p>

He was a native of <hi>Lucemberg,</hi> of meane birth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving past his child-hood, moved thereunto by his naturall genius and sprightly desire, he put himselfe in service with some Noblemen who travelled into <hi>France</hi> to study; whereunto he likewise applyed himselfe, and became the Master of many Languages, and intelligent in many affaires; from thence, passing into <hi>Italy,</hi> he was entertained for Auditor by Count <hi>Madrucci,</hi> from thence he went to <hi>Trent,</hi> and by his Pen wrought himselfe into the Prince his Auditory; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving studied a while, at last, were it either his fortune, or by reason of the malignitie of the times, he was envyed by many, and being much scandalized with the actions of some of his Colleagues, he resolved to be gonne, and not certaine what course to take, he went towards <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spruch,</hi> resolving to follow the occupation that he should first meet withall.</p>
            <p>Before he came to the Bridge of <hi>Lenis,</hi> he met with a Souldier of <hi>Milan,</hi> who comming from <hi>Germany</hi> into his owne Countrey, and speaking with him concerning the Souldiers craft, he resolved to take it upon him; he therefore received pay of the Emperour, and at first trayled a Pike, shortly after he got a Halbert, and won the love of his Captaine and all his fellow Souldiers: for being good at his Pen, the casting up of the accompts of that Company, and the answering of such Letters as were sent to his Captaine were recommended to his charge; and behaving himselfe still worthily in this place, and his Captaine, through the assistance he received from <hi>Aldringers</hi> wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, being made Serjeant Major, and his Lieutenant Captaine in his place, <hi>Aldringer</hi> was made Lieutenant with the applause of all the Officers and Souldiers: in which place he continued to give signes of his more then common understanding. He had the keeping of a place in the upper <hi>Palatinate</hi> not farre from <hi>Egra,</hi> committed to his charge, by which the Protestant Army was to passe, which with bare 50 men, by the meanes of barricadoed Trenches, and Palliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does of great interlaced Trees, he so gallantly maintained against the Enemies whole Army, without any other succour, as that (to the fame of his wisedome) he purchased the addition of being held great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valiant.</p>
            <p>Thus in a short space of time he was much desired by many Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells, and had offers made him of divers Companies. Being (at the instance of his maintainer) perswaded to comply with the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Salsbergs</hi> Nephew (a young man, who needed such an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter) he, by his Souldiery and by his Learning, did so much insinuate himselfe into the good will of that Colonell and his associates, as that <hi>Aldringer,</hi> making him seeme gray-headed for wisedome, who was but greene in yeares, he thought he could recompence him with no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a reward then, in default of his Serjeant Major, to conferre that place upon him. Being raysed to a place of this imployment, and thereby having occasion to be knowne to the Generalls, and to negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55221:133"/>
sometimes with one, sometimes with another of them, he so won upon the good likings of every one, as that he got the repute of being a better Souldier then any one that did officiate that charge: and being favoured by Fortune, and confirmed in every ones good liking, he was raysed to the degree of a Lieutenant Colonell, and from thence to be a Colonel; still refining his judgement by the experience and manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Martiall affaires, till he was found worthy to succeed to the command of the Emperours Forces before <hi>Mantua</hi>; where comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over the body of an Army, he executed the authoritie of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, though not under that Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aldringer</hi> was of a lively spirit, of mature wisedome, of a refined understanding, and of a valour levelled to enterprises. His Councells were accompanied with the freedome of Voyce, with past examples, and fore-sight of the future, in so much as in all Consultations held, they were preferred before the advice of any others. The informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Pen proportionably displayed, opened the gates to capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, inlightned the understanding to make resolves, and were most gratifying to the curiositie of his Master, and Masters Officers; the divers Countries he had beene verst in, the divers maximes he had observed, the inclinations of many people traced out by him, made him so wary in all his actions, as no Italianised <hi>Spaniard</hi> could out doe him.

He was so great a husband, as that he was as much intent to the service of his Prince, as to his owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular interest; uncompassionate towards the Subject, being exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive in laying on Contributions; very straight-handed in letting the Souldier partake thereof, or in bearing with them, so as he was not much beloved by them; his austeritie in this kind, particularly at <hi>Mantua</hi> (where 'tis reported he got such spoyle and bootie, as that none of <hi>Caesars</hi> Commanders ever parted from thence with greater riches) made him hatefull to the people, not beloved by the Souldier, and contumacious towards God Almightie. And this did presage that the promoters of that Warre would make good the proverb, <hi>That riches ill got are not usually long enjoyed.</hi>

But <hi>Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who was very loath to lose this place, it being a seat of great consequence, as well for the interest of the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> as for the reputation of their Forces; for if this place should be lost, whilst they and their Armies stood looking on, to boot with the feare, which would be thereby caused in other Townes recommended to his charge, they should much lessen the valuation which was yet put upon them and their Armes; and it being naturall to all men to love their owne actions best, and which have their originall from them, as fathers doe their children, <hi>Waymer,</hi> who had had the chiefe hand in taking this Towne, and who desired the preservation thereof, as the issue of his valour, not dreaming of any other object but how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, thought all the reasons alledged by <hi>Horne,</hi> and such Captaines as adhered unto him, invallid. And rather blinded by affection of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, then illuminated by military reason, he was resolute in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they were to imploy all their skill and industry to make the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> faile in his first enterprise: for the <hi>Swedes,</hi> together with their friends and confidents, being hereby incouraged, it would be a cooling carde to the <hi>Imperialists</hi> in their subsequent proceedings. And if this place should be by the <hi>Swedes</hi> preserved, to boot with the good successe that they might build hereupon, it might be added that the <hi>Austrians</hi> would grow so to distrust the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being those who perswaded to the taking of a Towne weakely walled, and in the heart of their own dominions, and not succeeding therin, as they would have but small hopes to take places better fortified, by which, all those bad
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55221:134"/>
effects would be produced, as usually are occasioned by a conceit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the common people and Souldiers. He therefore resolved by all meanes to relieve it. <hi>Horne,</hi> who maturely fore-saw the event which might ensue, and who was one that desired rather to governe his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with advisednesse then rash violence, opposed <hi>Waymers</hi> opinion againe, who thought it better to hazard a danger wherein was hope, then to injoy advantage wherein was feare. From hence, not onely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement in Councells began to arise betweene these two Generalls, but particular emulation and distastes; whence proceeded those subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent sinister events, which the <hi>Austrians</hi> patiently and wisely suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to grow ripe, gathered thence such fruits as is the usuall product of such disparitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alcha</hi> being surrendred, <hi>Horne</hi> came to <hi>Dunawert,</hi> and that he might not more exasperate <hi>Waymer</hi> (who being Generall, <hi>Horne</hi> was very much troubled he could not joyne with him in opinion) he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, who was already come thither with his Forces, that he might adhere to <hi>Hornes</hi> counsell, if he could not bring <hi>Horne</hi> to agree with him in the relieving of <hi>Ratisbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They held divers Councells of Warre at <hi>Dunawert,</hi> wherein the present emergencies being wisely weighed, the major part were of opinion, that to undertake the reliefe would be a hazardous and rash action; so much the rather, for that the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army was much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> being in all hardly 16000 fighting men; for <hi>Cratz</hi> (as hath been said) stayd before <hi>Fortheim</hi>; and the <hi>Ringrave,</hi> who had received orders to come from <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and bring his men, which were about 6000 to strengthen the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army, delay'd his going, for he did not greatly desire to joyne with <hi>Waymer,</hi> under whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he pretended not to be. It was notwithstanding resolved, that they should molest the <hi>Imperialists</hi> as much as they were able, by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them in foraging, by cutting off their Victualls, and keeping them from advancing to other enterprises, till such time as being hindred by continuall molestations, they might light upon some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious time to try the fortune of a battell, and likewise expect the <hi>Saxons</hi> fortunate proceedings, who being gotten almost to <hi>Prague,</hi> if they should take that Citie, it would infuse much terrour into the people of that Kingdome, and peradventure would make the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists</hi> remove from before <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and bring them to looke unto the safetie of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the preservation whereof they ought with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to be carefull of, as well for their owne interests as for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Armes.</p>

to be imployed) Count <hi>Tantmiscorfe,</hi> the Emperours chiefe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour, was againe sent to <hi>Luitmeritz,</hi> with new pretences: But the Elector persisting still in his high demands, no good came of it; so as this treatie breaking off, and <hi>Harnem</hi> joyning with some <hi>Swedish</hi> Regiments, they together with <hi>Luitmeritz</hi> tooke <hi>Fridland,</hi> and <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenberg,</hi> places notwithstanding of no great moment, so as Colonell <hi>Pech</hi> had order to depart from the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Camp, that hee might joyne with <hi>Colloredo,</hi> who was encamped about <hi>Colts,</hi> that so they might both of them jointly oppose the Enemies designes against <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Imperialists</hi> this meane while did their utmost to put an end to the taking of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and though the besieged defended themselves with unexpressible valour, and of unheard of opposition, (insomuch as many of the <hi>Romanists</hi> were afraid they should never compasse their desired end) yet glory being that which sweetens all difficulties, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> egg'd on by the presence of the King himselfe, who in his own person, amidst the haile of Musket-shot, incouraged them, did with so much violence, and obstinate valour set upon <hi>Off,</hi> a Borough without the City, on the other side the River, at the head of the Bridge, as that though the walls thereof were with equall emulation defended by Cannon, Musket, Mines, and artificiall fires, at last the <hi>Imperialists</hi> made themselves masters thereof by a generall Assault, wherein such was the slaughter as the very wals in some places gutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe bloud; and readily turning the Cannon upon the Towne, they began to play upon the wals thereof on that side likewise, from whence the besieged being desirous to reply, (as it behoved them to doe) that they might keep them off with their Cannon and frequent Musket-shot, they began to finde that their store of Powder was mightily shrunk, without the which not being able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and finding no hopes of succour, they thought of surrendring, whereby they might receive more advantagious tearmes, then in like cases are usually had from the Victor. Therefore the Governour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acquainted all his Officers, in what condition the Town was, that the want of Ammunition was great, (there not being Powder enough to maintaine three dayes shot) and that without great store thereof that frequent shooting could not be maintained, with which they had hitherto supplyed the imperfection of their Rampiers, and kept the Enemy aloofe off; that they might not through obstinacy, (as it oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times befals those who are too confident and presumptuous) lose toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Towne, their lives and lively-hoods, hee tooke the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in writing of the Captaines, and other Officers, and then gave notice to the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Camp, that hee would parle. Hostages being forthwith given on both sides, 'twas agreed that the Garrison should march out with their Colours flying, Drums beating, Matches ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Armes, and Baggage, and some peeces of Cannon; that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants should live as best liked themselves, and that such as would not stay there might freely remove their goods, or alienate them, and goe whether they pleased; and that the City should enjoy all its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Privileges: and since it seems naturall, that neighbouring Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55221:135"/>
are not acceptable to Towns, and States that love liberty, (whither this proceed for <hi>Antipathy,</hi> or that men are not well pleased with the shadow of what over-hangs their owne gardens, or grounds; or be it from envy which is borne to neighbouring greatnesse) the Citizens desired likewise to have it granted them, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> should have no right, nor rule over them; and that whatsoever Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison should be put there into, they might be of <hi>Caesars</hi> Forces. This was likewise granted them by the King to his great glory, and to the extraordinary comfort of those people, who though they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, boasted they had got such large Conditions, as perhaps they should not have found, had they continued free. And this was done because the <hi>Austrians</hi> were willing to win upon the peoples affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by easie meanes, which is better then severity of certaine Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who know not how to make their Subjects obedient, but by the Sword, and keeping them under: and by this example they would have invited other Towns, which had flowne out by reason of the bad government of former Ministers of State, to submit themselves again to the obedience of their native Prince, the which would have insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would ere this have been seen, had not the Masters eye been too farre distant from the actions of his Commanders, who through their owne authority, grew licentious.</p>
            <p>The losse of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> though it cost the <hi>Austrians</hi> the lives of about 6000 men, (the very flowre of their Army) partly perished by the Sword, partly by sufferings, partly by hunger, and that they spent above two Moneths more before it, then <hi>Waymer</hi> did when hee wonne it with the effusion of more Wine then Bloud, did much inhearten the <hi>Romanists,</hi> neither without reason; for by this successe, they were heightned to greater hopes, and confidence; and the Protestants, that they might stop the currant of such reports as raised and added to the honour of the <hi>Romanists</hi> actions, as those whereby their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates might forsake them; and because generous hearts are very tender of detraction, they resolved to oppose the fury of this torrent with the bankes of some honourable action, though it were very difficult and dangerous to withstand it whilst the tide came in; and therefore if they failed in their designes (as shall be hereafter said,) all their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe proceeded meerly from the slothfulnesse of their Officers; who aiming in all their actions, onely at their owne interests, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon nothing else, but how to get Contributions from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to raise Monies, that they might afterwards quietly retire themselves to their owne homes, rich in Monies, and loaded with spoile, did not care to stirre out of their quarters, unlesse inforc't by necessity. For had their thoughts been onely bent upon the publique good, every one of them would have made that the scope of all their actions, by not suffering the losers to gather Forces together, which were afterwards to be imployed in revenge.</p>
            <p>Nor can they herein any wayes excuse themselves, for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported they never indeavoured to hinder the <hi>Imperialists</hi> from raising of men, by setting upon them before they were got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which they might much more easily have done, then when
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55221:135"/>
they were sufficiently provided, and their Counsels in their dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have for the most part been upon resolves, and their Armes used against the Country-people where they were quartered, rather then in what respected the publique preservation, and in augmenting the common utility: nay every one of their Captaines having his thoughts more bent upon the emulation of his fellow Colleague, then upon the bond of concord, by going cooly to worke, that they might withdraw from the opinion of another mans glory, they through their owne discords gave occasion to their Enemies to reape in due time that advantage which could not from any where else have been expected. And from hence may be gathered of what force su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority is in Military affaires, and what prejudice they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive who depend upon another mans sence; for before they have resolved upon what is to be don, their Enemies have done what they would doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ratisbon</hi> being wone from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the King cast his eye upon the <hi>Saxons</hi> proceedings in <hi>Slesia</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> from which he was to expect no little indammagement in those parts; he therefore resolved to march into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and from thence to lead his Forces into the midst of <hi>Saxony,</hi> hoping not onely to pluck the Electors wings, but by force of Armes to bring him to conclude a Peace; which being obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and so those Forces disingaged from thence, which ought to have been imployed in the preservation of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> high were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, to drive with so great Forces the <hi>Swedes</hi> from out the Empire, and so easily to returne into possession of what had been lost. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could words, nor determinations, nor promises, bring the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Saxony</hi> to thinke of Peace; for were it either for feare of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were yet strong in the field, or out of a desire to draw an advantage out of this necessity from the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> no agreement could be made, neither of the one, nor of the other side. So as the King passing over the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Straubing</hi> with his Army, he marched towards the upper <hi>Palatinat,</hi> leaving the D. of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with some <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall</hi> Regiments joyned to those other of his own, in his own state, to have an eye to the <hi>Swedes</hi> proceedings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Infanta</hi> who (as hath been said) having entertained himselfe for above one whole yeare in the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> in which time through his admirable wisedome, he did much comfort the Subjects with the sincere demonstration of his good intentions, and of the like of the King his Brother, was inclined to Peace, and to hold good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with the Princes and Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> winning upon their affections, and moderating the jealousies which had been till then spread abroad over all that Country, by some men desirous of Noveltie; that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> aspired to bring it to his becke, and to increase his owne greatnesse. By his interposition, the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Genoueses</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> from whence some new commotions might have risen, were composed; hee renewed the League with the Papists-<hi>Switzers,</hi> and in courteous manner received Embassies which were sent to him from all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his arrivall. Amongst which one must not be forgot, which
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55221:136"/>
farre exceeded for pompe and glory, all others in our memories, sent at any time from any King whatsoever, not onely to <hi>Milan,</hi> but to any other part; and this was the Embassy of <hi>Signior Bertucci Valier,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Senator of the most illustrious state of <hi>Venice,</hi> who appeared in such splendor, as he sufficiently proved, that the greatnesse and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficency of that Republique, (most illustriously represented, by those that represented her) hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ninety Companies of Foot, and 25 Troopes of Horse, being brought into the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> under the command of the Marquis of <hi>Liganes,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Nocera,</hi> Prince of <hi>S. Severo,</hi> Marquis <hi>Fio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renza,</hi> Count <hi>de Langia, Matteo Rocales, Gasparo Baraldi, Peter Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> Marquis <hi>Lonaso, Maestro di Campo Guasco,</hi> and <hi>Gambacorto,</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> resolved upon his departure for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and his going was now thought the more opportune, for asmuch as it was not then time to doe any new thing in <hi>Italy</hi> against the <hi>French,</hi> nor yet to hinder the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Forces in <hi>Germany</hi> from such a succour; for the warre being mannaged by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> advice, those Ministers of state were resolved to make it appeare, that as by their meanes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell <hi>Walesteines</hi> treachery was cut off, together with his life, in the very rise thereof, so having unfetterd the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Authority, they were able to maintaine the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Crowne. 'Twas added, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> being at varience between themselves, and thereby their numbers lessened, they would be brought to a bad bargaine, when they should be pursued by a powerfull Army; and though some objected the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the <hi>French</hi> Forces, from whence it was affirmed the <hi>Swedes</hi> would not faile to be re-inforced, yet their owne interest being concerned, 'twas supposed they would never succour the <hi>Swedes</hi> to any purpose, till they had such places as were possessed by the <hi>Swedes</hi> upon the <hi>Rhyn</hi> in their hands: but since as yet the <hi>Swedes</hi> were resolute not to quit them, 'twas likely they would be unwillinger to doe soe, when by the assistance of the <hi>French</hi> they should be remitted into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition of strength; whence it was foreseen that the <hi>French</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of not first breaking with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and by reason of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> absence out of the Kingdome (who was then in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands) would rather chuse to reduce the <hi>Swedes</hi> to such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, as that they must be inforced to assigne over unto them those Townes, so as they might become masters thereof without drawing a Sword, then that they would foment their greatnesse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> then past over the Mountaines in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> being come to <hi>Inspruch</hi> hasted to <hi>Lints,</hi> whither the Queen of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> was come to meet her Brother, whom when he had seen, he toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Brother in Law, and chiefe Heads of the Army, held a Councell to advise what course was best to be taken in the present conjuncture of time. The <hi>Dutch</hi>-men were of opinion,
<q>that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing what they had begun, they should march boldly against the <hi>Saxons</hi>; alledging that the Elector surprised by the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and wanting the <hi>Swedes</hi> succour, would easily be brought to thinke of Peace; without the which since they could not freely keep the field with such advantage as was desired, they were to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55221:136"/>
their Counsels &amp; their Forces to that purpose: they added, that though <hi>Waymer</hi> and <hi>Horne</hi> should come in to their succour (the way into <hi>Bavaria</hi> being open, and all their Forces brought into <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>) the seat of Warre would be in that Electorate, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding, that the <hi>French</hi> should be compel'd to come in to the succour of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> so as they might not come to an open breach with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more opportune advice, to march with their Forces against the grosse body of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> whose weakning would the better fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the accommodation with <hi>Saxony</hi>; and that for the honour of their Armes they were bound to goe into <hi>Flaunders,</hi> where in many respects (as well of the <hi>Infanta</hi> his presence, as of the recruiting those parts) 'twas need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ll the Forces destin'd for their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence should first be imployde before they should be consumed in the service of the Emperour; and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> adhering in opinion to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as that which was best grounded, (for to boot with the feare he had of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who lay upon the Fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his State, it complyde with his interest that those Forces should be disperst which were intertained in many of his Townes) and the one and the other of them being desirous that they should march with their Army thitherward; alledging moreover, that <hi>Saxony</hi> would never make any considerable progresse into <hi>Bohemia</hi> by reason of their Commanders slothfulnesse, who were more given to drinke then to fight; they prevailed so much by their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they brought the King to resolve upon his returne to the <hi>Danube,</hi> and to goe against such Townes as were possest by the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
               </q>
He therefore presently faced about, and came unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly before <hi>Dunawert,</hi> against which he made two gallant assaults, which the defendants not being able to resist, the Towne was storm'd, and the greatest part of the Garrison put to the Sword.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swedish</hi> Generalls, who lay incampt betweene <hi>Dunawert</hi> and <hi>Auspurg,</hi> and hearing the newes of <hi>Dunawert</hi> being taken, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that their longer abode in <hi>Bavaria</hi> would be prejudiciall to them, they resolved that <hi>Waymer</hi> should retreat towards <hi>Lavingen,</hi> a place neere the <hi>Danube,</hi> betweene <hi>Dunawert</hi> and <hi>Vlm,</hi> and should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe himselfe thereabouts; and that <hi>Horne,</hi> that he might have an eye to the proceedings of the <hi>Infanta's</hi> Army which was quartered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Fussen,</hi> should goe to betweene the <hi>Iser</hi> and the <hi>Leech,</hi> with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from joyning with the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> and to advance further when the <hi>Ringrave</hi> should be come up unto him; who being with above 7000 good Souldiers in the Dukedome of <hi>Wirten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> he had timely advertisement to advance into <hi>Swabenland,</hi> so as by his assistance <hi>Horn</hi> might keep the Field with lesse feare of danger. But competition betweene Commanders, being that which of all other things doth most retarde victory, and is the ruine of Armies, (were it either the will of God or the <hi>Swedes</hi> misfortune) the bad effects thereof were sufficiently shewed upon this occasion. For the <hi>Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> seeming (and but seeming) as if he would joyne with him, that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55221:137"/>
he might not be under anothers command) this was one of the chiefe reasons of the ruine of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces</p>
            <p>By reason of the Treatie at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> wherein so large and faire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were granted by the <hi>Austrians,</hi> who made use of this bait to bring such to be in love with their civill demeanure, who formerly exasperated by the severe usage of former Ministers of State, would never be brought to comply with them; divers <hi>Imperiall</hi> Cities, and in particular <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> which was then brought to a bad condition; their Traffique being hindred, wherewithall the greatest part of the Inhabitans did maintaine themselves, and a great scarcity of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls being amongst them, by the devastation of the Countrey and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts made by the Armies, insomuch as that they payd halfe a Florin for a loafe of bread, and a Dollar for a pottle of Wine; the Citizens thereof began to move a Treatie of agreement with <hi>Caesar,</hi> making use of this pretence, to honest and cloake their faultinesse, that they had joyned with the <hi>Swedish</hi> partie to no other end but for the maintenance of their libertie of Conscience, Priviledges, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chises, which they had so many yeares enjoyed; and that when they should be listened unto in these their pretensions by the Emperour, they would balke all other occasions of violating their Oath, and doe homage to him: and that they had had sufficient experience, that to deliver ones selfe up into the protection of another Prince, was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall for-going of their obedience to their chiefe Soveraign, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial subjection of themselves to a worser, as their state had too well made proof of, whilst by having recourse unto the King of <hi>Swethland</hi> (a Prince in appearance very affectionate to his Friends) they had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the destruction of their Territories, the consumption of their Arsenalls, and the ruine of all their affaires, with an undoubted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, that when the King should have brought all <hi>Germany</hi> under him, they should be otherwise treated then by the <hi>Imperialists</hi>; For that Princes, who are ambitious of greatnesse, retaine nothing in memory, save onely what in the present may make for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>By reason of the resolution taken at the Dyet at <hi>Franckfort,</hi> by the Protestant partie, of making Duke <hi>Waymer</hi> Generall of the Forces of the union, 'twas said, that the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> grew likewise jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and that moreover he was not well satisfied with <hi>Oxesternes</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who he thought did not proceed with him in so sincere a manner as he ought; and that the Contributions which were had from the Associate Provinces, were not divided amongst the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as they ought to be, but converted to the private use of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders, who were suspected to send into <hi>Swethland</hi> to their owne homes what they got in <hi>Germany</hi>; whereat the <hi>Dutch</hi> were not a little troubled, whilst they saw another remote Countrey clothed with their spoyles. These allegations were likewise occasioned by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar envy, which usually reigning amongst States-men and Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, (who are ambitious to be thought the only Christalls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the actions of other men ought to be seene) had at this time given some signes of the Dukes no great good affected intelligency with the <hi>Swedes.</hi>

               <hi>Horne</hi> was this meane while come with his Army to <hi>Myndelheim</hi> to watch over the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proceedings; who gave out, that they would goe into the upper <hi>Swabenland</hi> and into <hi>Alsatia:</hi> When <hi>Waymer</hi> being advertised, that the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Dunawert,</hi> marched towards <hi>Norlinghen,</hi> one of the chiefe Cities in <hi>Swabenland,</hi> situated in a large plaine, begirt with Rampired Walls and strong Towers, hastened his march to come and joyne with <hi>Horne,</hi> the which he did at <hi>Gutemsberg,</hi> a place neere the <hi>Danube,</hi> betweene <hi>Lavingen</hi> and <hi>Vlm,</hi> at the same time when the <hi>Caesarians</hi> appeared first before <hi>Norlinghen.</hi> Where the <hi>Swedes</hi> suddenly resolved to passe over the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</hi> (a Towne not farre from <hi>Gutemsberg</hi>) and to incampe themselves in the mouth of the Valley of <hi>Rems</hi> (which is a plaine of about two miles in breadth betweene the Mountaines, beginning at the end of the <hi>Norlinghen</hi> Champian, and extends it selfe into the Dukedome of <hi>Wirtenberg</hi> towards <hi>Baling</hi>) that they might the better secure the Dukedome of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> the maintaining whereof was of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them; for all other adjacent parts being ransacked, they could onely from hence have Victualls and Forrage for their Armies. And because they thought this the most convenient seat, not onely to succour <hi>Norlinghen,</hi> but other places of consideration in <hi>Swabenland</hi> and <hi>Franconia,</hi> they tooke their way through the Territories of <hi>Haidn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haim,</hi> which is a Countrey along the River <hi>Brents,</hi> which is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey upon the Confines of <hi>Swabenland</hi> towards <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> and went to <hi>Aulen</hi> a Towne not farre from thence; where, though they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved advertisement the Count <hi>Strozz</hi> and <hi>Iohn De Wert,</hi> were gone with a good strength of Horse from the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Campe to set upon <hi>Valerspach,</hi> and other places of <hi>Franconia,</hi> they would notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lose no time, but went the next day towards <hi>Bapsinghen,</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Swabenland</hi> towards <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> that they might there take their readiest advantage and bring reliefe into the Citie; in which march they met with some <hi>Imperiall</hi> Troopes, wherewith they skirmished, cut many of them in pieces, and tooke some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.</p>

who notwithstanding persisting in his opinion, and being secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein by <hi>Offcherchin,</hi> Lieutenant Generall of the Horse, 'twas resolved, that the next morning <hi>Waymers</hi> Horse, which made the right wing of the battell, should advance to a straight and incommodious passage in face of the Enemies Campe, (who were already possest of all the most advantagious neighbouring Avenues) to discover whether or no they might passe that way without danger; the which being ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, they presently found the difficultie greater then they had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, by reason of <hi>Iohn De Werts</hi> return, who was sent for back from the enterprize of <hi>Valerspach,</hi> by which meanes the <hi>Imperialists</hi> did much exceed them in numbers; wherfore they agreed not to try a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell at that time, but onely to send some recruits into the Citie, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Governour and Inhabitants thereof, and to exhort them to expect the arrivall of the <hi>Ringrave</hi> and <hi>Cratzs,</hi> upon whose comming they should be sure to be succoured; 200 Musquetiers were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conveyed into the Towne by <hi>Hornes</hi> Horse, who went himselfe to the very Gate, where he spoke with the Governour, and perswaded him to persist in his defending the Towne, promising him sudden and opportune succour, which being done, he returned to his quarters not meeting with any encounter.</p>
            <p>This meane while Colonell <hi>Libesteime</hi> was come unto them with two of the Duke of <hi>Wirtenbergs</hi> Regiments, and one of <hi>Ransawes,</hi> and <hi>Schavalischi,</hi> with three other Regiments, two of Horse, and one of Foot; the <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse, (the <hi>Ringrave,</hi> and <hi>Cratz,</hi> not comming unto them) could not move from the advantage of their seat, without either giving battell, or making a prejudiciall retreat, for if they should once part from thence, it would be very hard for <hi>Cratz</hi> ever to joyne with them, who ran manifest danger of being left to the mercy of the <hi>Imperialists</hi>: much complaint was made for want of Forrage, for it being to be fetcht afarre off, many of their Horse came short home which were cut off by the Crabats; and the Citie, which was continually playd upon by the Cannon from divers of the Enemies batteries, by making of severall great fires, gave notice of what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie it was reduced unto. <hi>Waymer</hi> perswaded by these reasons, and by his owne generous heart, which still excited him to try a battell with the Enemy, and who desired nothing so much as to be in the Front against a contrary Army, so to beare away the Victory, which he affirmed to be a pleasure, which did farre exceed all other earthly contentment,
<q>began againe to perswade <hi>Horne</hi> that they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to succour the Citie since they had given them their word so to doe; that every day they lost in so doing made the Confederate Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties lesse confident, for when they should see <hi>Ratisbon, Dunawert,</hi> and <hi>Norlinghen,</hi> lost in the face of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army, their Colleague, which not long before had boasted not to feare what Fortune could doe, nor any Forces the <hi>Imperialists</hi> could make, they would have but small hopes of being defended; especially when that Army which dauntlessely had in triumph advanced to beyond the <hi>Danube,</hi> should now be seene to give back, and suffer Confederate Cities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the care thereof to be lost, whilst it looked on: He
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55221:138"/>
added, that great undertakings were actions which became great Commanders; that boldnesse made much for victory, that <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caesar</hi> with a few Souldiers beat <hi>Pompeyes</hi> great Army; that the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffers of fortune were not to be refused, which to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants victories more glorious, had given them an occasion to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallise their fame, by bringing them to fight against a King, a Cardinall, and an Elector of the Empire, assisted by <hi>Polaches, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians, Dutch, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the gallantest Nations of Europe; that the taking any one of these Princes prisoners would be a weighty circumstance: that there could not be a fitter time then this desired by Souldiers, for by overcomming fresh men, rich, and well appointed, they were to change their fortune, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their apparrell; that the <hi>Findlanders</hi> Horse long'd to have a bickering with the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> and to change horse with them; that great numbers begat confusion; and that danger ought not to be thought of, where mens mindes are conscious of no such thing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But these reasons prevailed nothing with <hi>Horne,</hi> who governing himselfe with wisedome, and solidity, was not carried away with the vapours of desire; for the businesse in hand being weighty, he would by no meanes consent to what had been moved: but his advice was, to know the opinions of all the chiefest Officers, before they should come to such a resolution; who being called together, and much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation being had hereupon, it was the generall opinion, that the <hi>Infanta's</hi> Army being that day joyned with the Kings, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> succour being yet afarre of, they neither could nor ought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any thing, which would be but to precipitate themselves into ruine. <hi>Horne</hi> said, and was followed in what he said by the greatest part of the Commanders,
<q>that in a businesse of so great weight, men ought to be very advised in their resolutions, and to foresee the event of running greedily upon a businesse, the difficulties whereof were not so slight, as their desires would make them appeare; that the <hi>Austrian</hi> Army was conducted by valiant Captaines, and who were desirous in presence of their Prince to demonstrate such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as might make them seem worthy of the places conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; that the <hi>Dutch</hi> wanted not courage, the greatest part of them being the remainders of those Armies, who had so often looked the Enemie in the face; that the <hi>Italians</hi> though new men, were yet knowne to be agile, and soon made capable of the businesse, desirous of honour, &amp; who not being acquainted in the Country, it was to be believed, that they would joyntly resolve rather to die overco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, then by flying away become a prey to the barbarous Country-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ambitious of glory, &amp; of the fame of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cried-up for the preservours of the <hi>Imperiall</hi> greatnesse, being resolute in fighting, a wise Nation, and very valiant, it was not to be imagined that they would turne their backes; that the Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present ought not to be contemned, though but a young man, for that it was a great furtherance to an Army; and all Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders desirous together with his yeares to increase in his Majesties favour, they were by manifestation of their gallantry to indeavour
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55221:139"/>
a place in his affection: but that which of all things else ought to be duly weighed was, that they were very weake in men, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the Enemy; and that they were not to passe by one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that if they should be worsted at this time, he knew not how they should ever get together againe, since the Crowne of <hi>Swethland</hi> could not disburse monies for new levies, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines not caring whether their Companies were full or empty, that therefore the chiefe thing to be indeavoured was the preservation of those people, without the which the <hi>Swedish</hi> power would be anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated; and that they must rather thinke how to overcome their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies by Wit, then by Weapons; and that if they would needs try a Battaile, they must of necessity attend the comming of one at the least of their two expected re-inforcements.</q>
So as to give <hi>Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> notwithstanding satisfaction, they resolved to lay aside any resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of giving Battaile, till <hi>Cratz</hi> at least were come to them, who was by this time not farre of; they fell notwithstanding to bethinke how they might indeavour to succour the Towne with any appearance of good successe; and divers were the consultations in this behalfe. Some were of opinion, that their best course was to seat themselves at <hi>Vallesteine,</hi> some halfe a League distant from <hi>Nordlinghen,</hi> as the neerest place unto the City, and from whence they might bring such succour as was requisite: but this was not approved of, for that to effect this, a great space of champian Country being to be passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they consequently afforded the Enemy opportunity to give them Battaile, when the <hi>Swedes</hi> should not be able to retreat at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; and the <hi>Caesarians</hi> being at liberty to over-run the state of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg,</hi> and the Territories of <hi>Vlm,</hi> they would not onely have thence all things requisite for their Army, but they would necessitate them to forgoe that place, for feare of being beaten thence; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the City, not receiving necessary succour, would surrender it self in sight of their Army. Others advised that they should withdraw their Army for their better security sake, a little further from the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> till the arrivall of their expected succour; but neither was this thought fitting, for their retreat would have invited the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to follow them, and to plunder the state of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits expected from <hi>Franconia,</hi> could not without great difficulty, and evident danger, come to the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army. So at last their joint opinions was to succour <hi>Nordlinghen</hi>; but in such sort as the Army should not want victuals from the Dukedome of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> nor that that state should be left to the discretion of the <hi>Imperialists</hi>: and though this resolution was likewise upon well-grounded reasons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by <hi>Cratz</hi> (who was then newly come, as one who was better acquainted with the Country and the Enemies Forces, amongst whom he had long commanded) publickly protesting, that so rash an attempt ought not to be made, against a fresh, victorious Army, and so recruited, without a further addition of Forces, which was to be expected by the <hi>Ringraves</hi> arrivall, who was by this time nigh at hand, and by some other Troopes likewise not farre off; and <hi>Horne</hi> was likewise of this opinion, adding, that an Army consisting of great
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55221:139"/>
numbers, and those new Souldiers, ought rather to be fought withall by keeping them busied and molested, then by the Sword; for not being able to keep themselves long in an impoverished Country, they must of necessity either perish or begone, just as befell the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> the yeare before; yet for that both <hi>Cratz</hi> and <hi>Horne</hi> were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to please <hi>Waymer</hi> and <hi>Offcherchen,</hi> (who as none of the wisest, would in jeasting manner say, that these their Counsells and Advises partooke of feare) they were so much incenst at these speeches, which reflected so much upon them, as they concluded to put in execution, and to be themselves the first that should prosecute, this resolution. They therefore raised their Camp the first day of <hi>September,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1.</note> which consisted of 12000 Foot, and 8000 Horse, and 28 piece of Cannon. There was a Hill neer the City called <hi>Arensperg,</hi> upon the which if they should have incamped themselves, the besieged would have thereby beene much comforted, and the <hi>Caesarians</hi> so much incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, as they would for certaine have beene inforced in a short time to raise their Siege. The <hi>Swedes</hi> therefore marched towards that Hill, to effect what they had agreed upon: the <hi>Imperialists</hi> heard of this their motion, but not being able to imagine what their designe might be, not dreaming that ever they would make so hard an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, they moved not from their quarters, till they saw them neer their <hi>Corps de guarde,</hi> which they had re-inforced with some Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horse; finding afterwards some bands of <hi>Swedish</hi> Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettiers belonging to <hi>Waymer,</hi> which were the Vanguard, and drew after them some pieces of Cannon, made towards them, not willing to contest the Field with them, they gave them way, and retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the aforesaid Hill <hi>Arensperg,</hi> the place which the <hi>Swedes</hi> had designed to incamp themselves in. Duke <hi>Waymer</hi> with a great Body of Horse set upon the said <hi>Corps de guarde,</hi> and though they were with equall valour withstood by them, and <hi>Sadlers,</hi> and <hi>Cratz</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments beaten backe, at last being overborne by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse, (which furiously and in a joynt body Charged them) they and such other Troopes as were sent in to their succour, were inforced to give backe, with the losse of many of the <hi>Austrians</hi>; and in particular <hi>Prior Aldobrandini</hi> perish't there, a valiant Gentleman and deservedly beloved of all. The like befell another passage guarded by 400 <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> which was by force of Armes taken by Colonell <hi>Vistem,</hi> after a stout defence made by the Enemy: and for that that station was of so great moment, onely for as long as the wood continued, neer unto which it was, and the end whereof extended to where the <hi>Imperialists</hi> were incamped in Battaile-array, they were so farre advanced, and their Muskettiers so ingaged, as that they were necessitated to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour likewise the gaining of the plaine. But <hi>Waymer</hi> being confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a gallant Body of <hi>Caesarians,</hi> and he not having men enough to set upon them; <hi>Horne,</hi> (who though he still were of the same minde, which was to keep upon <hi>Arensperg,</hi> and make himsele master thereof, on that side which extends it selfe to the left hand, that he might there expect the <hi>Ringrave,</hi> who was within two little dayes march, and had with him about 8000 of the bravest and best experienced Souldiers
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55221:140"/>
of all the Army) since he saw that to proceed like a wiseman, was esteemed a token of Cowardise, by those who by reason of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good successes despised the Enemy, and would come to a Battaile, to shew that he likewise wanted not courage, and that hee knew not what feare meant, hee furiously fell upon those trenches which were made by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and giving upon two Battaglions of Foot, though they had much adoe to get unto a halfe moone which stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very beginning of the height, yet Charging them through, after a bloody fight wherin the Count <hi>de Solmes,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Verms</hi> were slaine, who had the charge to defend it with their Regiments, they entred thereinto; where instead of haulting and making good the station, as <hi>Horne</hi> commanded them, they advanced to set upon the Squadrons of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, which was placed in Battaile-array; where being Charged by the <hi>Austrian</hi> Horse, and the rest of the <hi>Swedes</hi> not being able to succour them, for that the Trenches were not to be pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by horse, and much pester'd with smoake, occasioned through the firing of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> Ammunition, they fled away in great confusion, so as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might easily advance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that important station, which proved afterwards the ruine of the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This rout given to the Protestants would not have proved so preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall, if the Horse, which was appointed to backe them had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in due time, &amp; opened the fences, as <hi>Horne</hi> had commanded them. They say this omission was occasioned by the incumbrance of some Carriages over-turned in the Woods, which contrary to the orders they had received, advancing before the said Horse, was a cause of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them for a while and this was the reason why that advantage was lost, which afterwards 'twas impossible to recover; for whilst the <hi>Swedish</hi> Foot advanced forwards into the Trenches, not being backt by their Horse, the greatest part of them were cut in pieces by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian</hi> Horse. The fight was valiantly performed for some while, not onely here, but likewise on the left wing, with the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Horse, whose Charges the <hi>Swedes</hi> valiantly withstood, and gallantly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and the businesse grew now to be so hot, as that many hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters were made, and many fierce skirmishes; but because the <hi>Swedes</hi> could not Charge so well by reason of the disadvantage of their situation, and not being able to get into their Trenches, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> growing more and more upon them, they were inforced to indeavour a retreat, but being ingaged a little too forward, though <hi>Horne</hi> had here shewed all the worth of wit and industry that ever was shewen by the undaunted discretion of any ancient experienced Commander, the successe was not good; <hi>Horne</hi> made all his Horse advance against the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> and gallantly Charged them, that he might have time, whilst these were at handy blows with the enemy, to draw off his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which was too far advanced; and likewise to recover his Foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a little Towne called <hi>Neresham</hi> which lies in the vallie between the Hill where the action was, and the above named <hi>Arensperg,</hi> and which extends it selfe to a little River: hee likewise hoped that his Van-guard should take their station together with the Cannon, on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55221:140"/>
the other side the said Towne, so as the Reare-ward which was pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Austrians</hi> might retreat under the safe-guard of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and being thus gotten into a place of advantage, his Troopes might face about, and joyntly with Duke <hi>Waymer</hi> make head against the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> till the <hi>Ringrave,</hi> who was not farre off, might bring op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune succour.</p>
            <p>But the Battaglions of the left Wing, tired and worne out with the labour of eight houres continued fight, and being charged by reserves and other fresh Troopes of the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> turned their backs, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hastily to save themselves under the shelter of <hi>Hornes</hi> Vanguard, they broke the files thereof, and totally discomposed it. At the sight hereof <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Cratz</hi> came in, and facing their Regiments, ceased not to exhort them to turne head; but it was in vaine and impossible to bring them againe into order; and the feare of death being more prevalent then the comfort of life, deafened, and blinded through confusion, they ranne with loose reines, some here, some there, as fast as their Horses could carry them. Whereupon <hi>Horne</hi> provoked by honour, and by the words which <hi>Offcherchen</hi> had let fall, resolved not to live to be the spectator of so great a misfortune; but it not stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Gods good will that he should then perish, he was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, as was likewise <hi>Cratz,</hi> who being wounded by a Musquet-shot, could not escape falling into the Enemies hands.</p>
            <p>This battell lasted from the break of day on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Septemb.</hi> 7.</note> till two in the afternoone, in the which the <hi>Swedes</hi> left dead upon the field about 6000 Souldiers, the greatest part whereof were Foot, lost all their Cannon and Baggage; and that which most imported, they likewise lost the reputation of their Armes, and fortune, which favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all their actions till this instant, had made their fame terrible to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and brought them to be so conceited of, as that it was thought by the wisest, nothing but discords and emulation betweene themselves could have rendred them conquerable. Almost all the Horse retreated with <hi>Waymer</hi> into the Dukedome of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and some Foot companies retyred to <hi>Vlm</hi> with <hi>Offcherchen,</hi> who was also wounded. This battell was given by the <hi>Swedes</hi> too unadvisedly, and out of too much courage; for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above 20000 fighting men, they had the boldnesse to provoke an Army composed of three Armies, wherein were above 40000 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and in place of such advantage as did move laughter in the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>; many whereof thought that they did it out of dispaire, or for want of wit in the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders. The Kings Majestie, and the Illustrious <hi>Infanta,</hi> wonne immortall glory in this battell; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who, to the wonder of all men, were alwayes amidst the Musquet-shot, voyd of feare; nor would they be withdrawne from thence, for any Counsell could be given them, but replyed, that such Princes as are afear'd, ought to keepe themselves in their Royall Pallaces, not come into any Army. The greatest actions in this battell were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> in so much as the <hi>Swedes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were astonished to see it, who set upon their quarters, thinking to affright them, as being but new Souldiers, and yet they found by all
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55221:141"/>
they did they had no paragons; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> notwithstanding, of all others fought most miraculously with their foot fixt, &amp; gave testimony of their Valour and Fidelitie; in so much as the <hi>Dutch</hi>-men may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, it was by their meanes that they received any comfort: for doubtlesse without their inforcements and undauntednesse, together with this battell, they would have lost all meanes of ever gathering head againe. Of their Commanders, the Marquis of <hi>Liganes</hi> was by the <hi>Swedes</hi> themselves accounted worthy of all glory, and to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a gallant Commander; yet are not the rest to be forgotten, for every one to whose share it fell to fight, discharged his dutie as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him. Of the <hi>Swedes, Horne</hi> and <hi>Cratz</hi> were immortallized, not so much for the valour shewed by their Swords, as for the solid wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their counsells, wherein if they had beene followed by the rest, they would not doubtlessely have split upon this Rock: yet did <hi>Waymer, Vistum,</hi> and the rest behave themselves valiantly; but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the ground, and the imparitie of Forces, tooke off the edge of their fiercenesse. <hi>Horne</hi> being brought prisoner into the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Tents, the King and <hi>Infanta</hi> were desirous to see that man whose valour had made his fame immortall, and therefore he was brought to their Lodgings; where, as he would have prostrated himselfe before his Majestie and the <hi>Infanta,</hi> they (like worthy Princes, and indued with extraordinary goodnesse) raysed him up, and receiving him in a curteous and friendly manner, told him, they were much satisfied in having so worthy and so valiant a prisoner: to which <hi>Horne</hi> replyed, and I am proud to be in the hands of so great Princes. He was from thence sent backe into the quarters, where he was visited by all the Commanders of the Army; and the King gave order that he should be treated with all respect and civilitie, such as is usually given to men of merit by great and magnanimous Princes.</p>
            <p>Whilst the <hi>Austrians</hi> were busie in bringing their ends about in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> were not idle; for the great Cardinall <hi>Richelieu</hi> (wisely fore-seeing where the blow prepared by the <hi>Spanish</hi> braine was to fall) used his best industry not to suffer his King to stand a fruitlesse spectator in this controversie; and therefore the taking of <hi>Bitsch</hi> and <hi>La Motta</hi> was the more plyed: both which were surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, the one through the weaknesse of its Garrison, the other by the death of the Governour, who as he was comming into the Town from forth a halfe Moone that was without the gates, was slaine by a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet-shot upon the Draw-bridge. The Castle of <hi>Vildesteime,</hi> in the <hi>Voghese</hi> Mountaine, upon the confines of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> towards <hi>Alsatia</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> was also taken; and that whole Province being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that great head-piece began to thinke of new Achievements in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> (when things should succeed more opportunely) and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the fittest meanes to march with their Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> if the peace should at any time be broken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> therefore gathering together all their Forces which were dispersed about <hi>Lorayne,</hi> marched with them towards the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> not without some jealousie in the <hi>Austrians,</hi> who fear'd lest they might joyne with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> of whom likewise there
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:55221:141"/>
wanted not some apprehensions; for the <hi>French</hi> seeing them held in play by the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Forces, thought to get into <hi>Filisburg</hi> by force if they could not prevaile by faire meanes. Their end notwithstanding, (as was conceived by Polititians) was, neither to declare Warre at this time against the <hi>Austrians,</hi> neither yet to distaste the <hi>Swedes</hi>; but as Arbitrators of the businesse in <hi>Germany,</hi> the proceedings both of the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Austrians</hi> depending upon the ballance of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to keepe themselves attentive spectators upon the fall of the one or other of them; carrying the matter so, as whether the <hi>Swedes</hi> should winne or lose, they without entring into Warre might reape advantage thereby. For the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> being then all of a piece, and therefore become the most formidable power of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, if the <hi>Austrians</hi> should prevaile, they would be able to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>Swedish</hi> partie; and such strong holds as by such an accident should be put into their hands by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they might easily keep them; and if the <hi>Swedes</hi> should be victorious, the apprehended <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian</hi> greatnesse growing weaker, they saw they were sufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their owne Empire, and to keepe the <hi>Swedes</hi> within the limited bounds of power; so as <hi>France</hi> being well enough pleased with the falling out of others, that so she might inhaunce, and keepe intire her owne strength through their ruines, it was clearely discerned, that their intentions were neither to denounce Warre against the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> nor yet to foment the <hi>Swedes</hi> but conditionally. For if they should have denounced Warre, to boot with the former alledged rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, concerning the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> absence, it was to be considered, that the breaking of peace without occasion given, would adhibite faith to what was already suspected, that the <hi>French</hi> intended to pluck downe the <hi>Spanish</hi> greatnesse, and by the ruines thereof, the more to aggrandise their own Monarchy; and that which imported more then all the rest, that the <hi>Austrian</hi> Force being counterpoised by the <hi>French</hi>-mens declaring of themselves, 'twas easily discerned, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> having the way opened to proceed on to further greatnesse, they would consequently be more confirmed in their resolution of not parting with the Townes upon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> nor yeeld to give the <hi>French</hi> such content as they desired. Whereupon if the <hi>French</hi> should indeavour by force of Armes to make them forgoe their obstinacy, it would be a meanes to make a pacification betweene the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the Emperour, and to their no little prejudice incite them against themselves, or by holding with them to rest contented with what they could purchase of themselves, at the great expence of money and blood. And because the <hi>French</hi> knew the great ill will that the <hi>Loray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> bare them, to shun all insurrections, they resolved onely to keepe <hi>Nancy, La Motta,</hi> and <hi>Bitsch,</hi> and to throw open the Gates of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities, walled Townes, and Castles of that state, which were 36 in number; and to prevent any mischiefe that might happen at <hi>Nancy</hi> the Inhabitants were disarmed, and at <hi>Nostre-Dame</hi> gate a Citadell of foure Bulworkes was erected.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> where in due time 'twas doubted their Armies might fall on, they gave in Commission to Duke <hi>Crequi,</hi> who was dispatcht
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55221:142"/>
from <hi>Rome,</hi> that he should go to all the Princes and Potentates there, under pretence of Visit, Complements, and ratification of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties good intelligence with them; but indeed secretly to informe himselfe, how they stood affected towards his most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie; and where he should find any appearance of aversenesse, that he should wisely indeavour to worke upon their affections by promises, and by making his Kings good intentions knowne unto them; making his agreement so with them, that upon any occasion they might favour him; and that he should invite them to an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive League against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> as the place which lyes open to the commerce of the Emperours Forces; and the maine Body of their strength being thither reduced, kept the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring states in continuall jealousies. He therefore went to <hi>Florence,</hi> and though he had no hope to obtaine any thing of the great Duke, by reason of his relation to the house of <hi>Austria</hi>; yet to palliate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of his other Visits, 'twas thought fit in all respects, both of decency and faire correspondency, that he should goe to that Court to make all his other Embassyes seeme but Complementall, without futher causing jealousie in the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> From thence he went to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> where having stayd two moneths, he found those wise Senators desirous to preserve the publique peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and constant in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes keeping good intelligence with his Majestie of <hi>France,</hi> rather willing to be mediators for publique tranquilly, then authors of new turmoyles Having tane leave at <hi>Venice,</hi> where he admired the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their regalities, and the splendid manner of their treating, he went to <hi>Mantua,</hi> where being worthily received by Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> and assured of his great good inclination to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> he passed on to <hi>Parma,</hi> to visit the Duke thereof, whom he found full of high and generous thoughts, and one who being a sprightly Prince, was not contented to passe away his time in idlenesse, a thing despised by exalted minds; and having filled his Highnesse with vast hopes, and assured him of his Kings assistance in keeping him independent upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and confirmed him in his good will to <hi>France,</hi> and to that purpose agreed upon what was knowne fitting for the Dukes interest, he followed on his journy to <hi>Pyemont,</hi> and there passing over the Mountaines, returned to <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>This Victory, which much inheartned the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and all that sided with them, was solemnised with a publicke thanks-giving, and by speedy Posts all their friends were advertised thereof; signifying what advantage the <hi>Romanists</hi> might hope from thence, and on the contrary side, what dammage their Enemies were to receive thereby. Whilst thus incouraged, they advanced to reap the fruits of so great good fortune, this newes was much resented in <hi>France,</hi> though some more speculative then others, would say, that this defeat was desired by the <hi>French,</hi> and expected upon designe, that they might see the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces reduced to such Condition, as that standing in need of their protection, they should be necessitated to have recourse thereunto, and consequently willing to put into their hands not onely <hi>Filisburg,</hi> (which the <hi>French</hi> so earnestly desired) but likewise <hi>Mentz., Benfeilt,</hi> and other places upon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> possest by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Souldier, and wherein they had hitherto obstinatly kept themselves, nor would by any meanes be perswaded to forgoe them. The Marshall <hi>de la Force,</hi> who with a compleat Army of about 16000 fighting men kept himselfe in <hi>Montbelgard</hi> (a Country which lyes betweene the Frontiers of <hi>Lorayne, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Helvetia,</hi> not long before purchased for a summe of Mony by the <hi>French,</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg</hi>) and upon the Frontiers of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satia,</hi> did by order from the King draw neerer the <hi>Rhyn</hi>; not out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intention to joyne with the Protestant Forces, (as it was noysed, and feared by the <hi>Romanists</hi>; the more, for that the Marshall being a Protestant, 'twas doubted he might vary from his directions recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Court, and demonstrate his affection towards the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants to their advantage) but to get into the Townes, where the <hi>Swedes</hi> being no longer able to subsist, 'twas knowne they would rather deliver them up unto the <hi>French,</hi> then to the <hi>Imperialists.</hi> And just so it fell out, for the <hi>Swedes</hi> being too weake to keep themselves in that Province without the aide of <hi>France,</hi> resolved to quit <hi>Colmar, Sclestat, Hagenaw, Lindaw, Hermisteime,</hi> and some other Towns barely begirt with ancient Wals, though Populous, and Merchandising, which ly in the heart of that Province, on the other side of the <hi>Rhyn</hi> towards <hi>Lorayne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Fichieres</hi> (who was then assistant for the King of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Franckfort,</hi> with <hi>Oxesterne,</hi> and the reformed Councell,) making use of this occasion, renewed his demand and his pretence to <hi>Filisburg,</hi> and that the <hi>Swedes</hi> might the easilier condiscend to the consignation thereof, he accompanied his demands with vast promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of assistance; which was very willingly listned unto by them who upon this emergency stood in need enough thereof, for necessity is that which makes things either acceptable, or unacceptable. <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esterne</hi> notwithstanding was of another opinion, though he wisely concealed it; for he approved not of receiving so powerfull strangers to be companions in their atchievements, and so to receive Lawes from them, for by ingaging their owne liberty, and subjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55221:143"/>
to <hi>France,</hi> hee would say to those he did confide in, that when they should have this strong hold, they would desire another; &amp; under the specious charitable pretence of receiving the <hi>Romanists</hi> into prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they would without unsheathing their Swords, injoy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the <hi>Swedish</hi> labours. That neighbouring potentates nor their exhibitions ought never to be trusted in, for what is not taken by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with the Sword fals into the power of friends, by the exposition of some writing, made by some Officer of State. The other <hi>Dutch</hi> Counsellours (for of the twelve deputies chosen to consider of the publick government of the Confederates affaires, there were nine of that Nation) allured by hopes of monies from <hi>France,</hi> upon which they much relied, aswell for the publicke as their particular interest, (for they very well knew they could no longer subsist by the <hi>Swedish</hi> party, and that therefore it was behovefull for them to have some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince to rely upon, from whom they might receive such pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as might maintaine them in the decencie of their degree,) sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to this desire of the Embassadour, and perswaded <hi>Oxesterne</hi> to resolve upon sending to Colonell <hi>Smidberg,</hi> who was Governour of the Fort, to deliver it up unto the <hi>French,</hi> the which was done, though with some delay; for <hi>Smidberg,</hi> pretending that the Crowne of <hi>Swethland</hi> owed him certaine Monies, intended not to quit that place till he had received satisfaction. 'Twas said he was hereunto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited secretly by <hi>Oxesterne,</hi> who for divers ends would protract the surrender of that place. Yet did the <hi>French</hi> remove this obstacle by satisfying <hi>Smidberg,</hi> by which meanes they possest themselves of this so considerable strength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Waymer</hi> being gotten with the remainder of his ill-treated Army to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and having re-assembled a new Body of an Army, about 14000 Souldiers by the means of the two Brothers, <hi>Otho Lodovico,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Ringrave,</hi> who joyned their Forces with him, and by the Souldiers drawne out of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Garrisons, eagerly thirsting after revenge, prest the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour that he would send un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him 6000 men which had formerly been promised by vertue of the new capitulation between the <hi>Swedes</hi> &amp; Crown of <hi>France,</hi> in lieu wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Swedes</hi> had till now taken Mony, to shun such confusion as is usually caused by the <hi>French,</hi> when they are mixt with other Nations: By which aid he gave out he would yet be able to oppose and retard the <hi>Imperialists</hi> in their swing of Victory, who were very much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Infanta's</hi> parting from them, who carryed along with him, as he travelled, not onely all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army being about 10000 fighting men, but likewise part of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> assigned to him by the King for his convoy. The Embassadour replied hereunto in an affectionate manner, that his Highnesse was not at all deceived in his relying upon succour from his King, who was a well-wisher to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of the Crowne of <hi>Swede,</hi> to the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to <hi>Waymers</hi> person in particular; that therefore he would suddainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Court therewith, and that he would moreover write to the Marshall <hi>de la Force,</hi> to know from him what orders, he had received from the King concerning this; and thus he held him in suspence till
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55221:143"/>
having received an answer, he gave the Duke to understand that the <hi>French</hi> were ready to assist him; but that 6000 Souldiers appearing to them to be very few in respect of the <hi>Austrians</hi> numerous Forces imboldned by Victory, they intended not to hazard the reputation of their Armes upon a new precipice; that therefore they offered to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him with a compleat Army of 20000 fighting men, which were upon those Frontiers in <hi>Alsatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Embassadour did upon this offer, take cunningly an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune occasion to re-demand <hi>Benfelt, Gustavensburg, Mentz,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neighbouring places, much desired by the <hi>French,</hi> the better to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves of <hi>Lorayne</hi>; and that they might make the Warre in another mans Countrey, if at any time the <hi>Austrians</hi> should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put Duke <hi>Charles</hi> into his Countrey againe. This caused no small muttering in <hi>Oxensternes</hi> Court, where it was publique dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that the <hi>French</hi> did onely desire to reduce the <hi>Swedes</hi> to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of imploring their succour, by which meanes they might ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compleat their ends, which were to possesse themselves of all the Townes of those Provinces without waging Warre, that so they might not onely enlarge the Confines of their great Kingdome, but secure it by the <hi>Rhyn</hi> from being invaded by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Forces at their pleasure against them, inforce the <hi>Germans,</hi> weakned by so many Warres, to submit themselves to their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to depend upon the Lawes of <hi>France,</hi> and so to keepe the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi> Forces in perpetuall motion, fomenting the Protestants, to divert them from such assistance as they might bring to <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> should move with their Forces into those parts. All reasons drawne from sound Consequences, and approved of by reall Arguments; yet did their principall object make against it, which would not permit them without greater occasion to breake with the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and counterveene such Articles as they had sworne and subscribed unto, especially in a time when the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was out of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This comming of the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and the newes of the delivery of <hi>Filisburg</hi> by the <hi>Swedes</hi> into their hands, was so briske a gust of wind, as it quite over-turned many of the <hi>Austrians</hi> designes which they had formerly resolved upon; in so much as though in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they should have pursued their Victory, and not have suffered the <hi>Swedes</hi> to recruit, they did notwithstanding curbe in their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which shewed they had no mind to make the <hi>Swedes</hi> desperate, and so force them to fly for protection to <hi>France,</hi> and joyne their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with those of so puissant a King, delivering up unto him such strong holds as they were possest of upon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> which when they should be in the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> they would meet with more difficulty in recovering them. And moreover, the <hi>Austrians</hi> were very unwilling to breake the peace with so great a King; For these Townes lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Confines of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> were new possest of they should consequently have <hi>Alsatia</hi> annext to their Dominions, from whence they might without any obstacle issue out with such nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Forces as that Crown is famous for, &amp; render vaine the indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55221:144"/>
of whatsoever more then reasonable Army. And so by the ruine of their Enemies, Forreyners should get further footing in their Territories; and whilst they should beat the Tree, others should ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fruit. And the <hi>French</hi> should without losse of blood be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of those Cities which would hardly be regained by puissant Armies. 'Twas observed, that from this time forward the <hi>Austrians</hi> began to proceed more slowly, being contented to undertake such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, from the event whereof they could not expect any absolute benefit.</p>
            <p>The Landgrave of <hi>Hessen</hi> had better successe then his other Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, who was at this time at the siege of <hi>Myndem,</hi> the Garrison whereof by continuall fallying out did much prejudice the besiegers; for in one sally they slighted two of their batteries, and tooke three piece of Cannon which they brought into their Citie, and tooke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prisoners. Yet did this little availe them, for duties and famine daily increasing, and having no hopes of succour, they were forced to yeeld the Towne unto the Landgrave, who freely gave them leave to march out with their Armes, Baggage, and two piece of Cannon, on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November.</hi>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who had absented himselfe from the King his Brothers Court, being wrought upon to that purpose by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of his Counsellours, who through the desire of bettring their conditions, and blinded by lying hopes, believed by this dis-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the Royall Brothers, to make the King withdraw his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from those Ministers of State, whose greatnesse they envyed, and to advance themselves; being incouraged by the Queene his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who was then in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and allured by faire promises which were said to be made unto him by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was at this time in <hi>Brussells</hi>; where at last, better bethinking himselfe of his owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, wisely discovering the cunning of those that were his advisers, and growing very apprehensive; for it was said, by those that were skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in State-affaires, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intended under some specious pretence to secure his person, and dexterously to allure him into <hi>Spain,</hi> where they might afterwards keepe him as an Hostage for the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies they might have of the great powers of the most Christian King, from all which they might rest secure by having this pawne in their hands; for hardly would the <hi>French</hi> have taken up Armes against their Kings Brother, since their King wanting Issue his Scepter was to fall into his Brothers hand; not was it likely they would ingage themselves in a Warre against their Kings onely Brother, and put the Kingdome to so much cost and grievance, since from thence they could expect nothing but the ruines usually occasioned by Warre. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, any advantage the <hi>French</hi> could have made hereby, would have come short of a ransome for their King, in case the Crowne should have fallen to the said Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> These impressions growing strong in <hi>Monsieur,</hi> and he moreover reflecting much upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta's</hi> arrivall, who was to take upon him the command of those Provinces, the which indeed did most of all trouble him. To these considerations was likewise added, secret intelligence held betweene

the Cardinall <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Pilloran,</hi> who (as is usuall with the sprightlinesse of the <hi>French</hi>) annoied with the <hi>Spanish</hi> gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, desirous to alter his purpose, and to injoy those mighty promises which were made unto him by the King; And having moreover for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone his love which he bore to the Princesse of <hi>Phalsberg,</hi> for new af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection taken to Madame <hi>de Chimay,</hi> tooke upon him to be a meanes aswell of the returne of his Master, and of the reconciling him with the King, as hee had beene of withdrawing him out of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other excellent practises of the Cardinall (who as a faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of that Crowne, was much troubled at this disagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his two Masters,) were used to effect this; As likewise the wholsome advice of some others, who were ingaged as good <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to undeceive him, and free him of such suspitions as were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in him, by those that envied the greatnesse of <hi>France.</hi> These conceptions put together were so available, as discovering at last the cinders under which the fire lay hid, which he feared might breake forth into some great flame, he resolved to have speedy recourse to the waters of mercy of his most Christian Majesty, wherewithall to wash away all his faults. He therefore under pretence of hunting (an exercise wherein he usually spent his leasure times) agreed with those he affided in, of what safest &amp; shortest way he was to take; he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ride streight towards the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and took order to prevent any mischiefe which might insue, that upon the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed certaine Troopes of <hi>French</hi> Horse should bee upon those Frontiers.

The <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who if all be true, that was said, were not very well pleased hereat) did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing wisely cover their inward sorrow, giving out how much they were joyed, that their Kings Brethren in law were reconciled, and that his Highnesse needed not have beene so secret in his departure; for as they had courteously received him, so would they as willingly have served him, and attended him with such decency into <hi>France,</hi> as became so great a Prince.</p>

            <p>After this action, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> fearing lest they might necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>Swedes</hi> to implore succour from <hi>France,</hi> and to joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Army commanded by the Marshall <hi>de la Force,</hi> who was fallen downe into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and was then quartered about <hi>Lindaw,</hi> they kept themselves within there quarters for some time in the Dukedome of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> not indeavouring any new businesse, at which the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders did not a little wonder. But this was by politicians interpreted a piece of cunning, thus to afford leasure to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who were totally broken, that gathering a little courage they might not give way to the demands made in <hi>Mentz</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Agents, concerning those Townes which they held upon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> and thereabouts, and which they had yet refused to surrender. But the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> growing jealous at these delayes, by which they seemed rather to seek peace with the Protestant Princes, then pursue the warre, 'twas said, that the <hi>Austrians</hi> foreseeing an almost inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rupture with <hi>France,</hi> would first see the businesse of <hi>Germany</hi> setled, that they might the more freely afterwards oppose themselves to the <hi>French</hi> Forces, the which was to be indeavoured before they should declare open Warre against the <hi>French</hi>; for if they should fall foule with them, before the other affaire were setled, they were likely to meet with greater difficulties then otherwise; for inheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by hopes from <hi>France,</hi> their pretensions would be the loftier. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> doubted lest the Emperour might conclude this Peace, and lest he might remit the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> into his state, so to gaine the friendship of the King of <hi>England,</hi> which it much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to have. Hee indeavoured therefore (by what was gathered from understanding men) to thwart this, and made <hi>Iohn de Wert,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Forces of the Catholicke League, (of which the said Duke, as hath been formerly said, was <hi>Generalissimo</hi>) sit downe before <hi>Heydelberg</hi> the Metropolitan of the lower <hi>Palatinat,</hi> to renew by this hostillity, the jealousies between <hi>Caesar</hi> and the Crowne of <hi>England</hi>; the which <hi>Wert</hi> did, and tooke the Town, and shortly after the Castle, which wanting succour compounded.</p>
            <p>The losse of this Towne, though it opened the way for the <hi>Caesari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to advance, without any difficulty, towards <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and <hi>Mentz,</hi> yet was it not pleasing to the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Councell. For <hi>Manheime</hi> being garrizon'd by the <hi>French,</hi> a strong hold upon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> at the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55221:145"/>
mouth of the <hi>Neccar,</hi> formerly possessed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; afterwards slighted by them, to free themselves of the expence they must be at, in maintaining a strong Garrison there, which now they needed not, and having built a Bridge upon Boates, they would not oblige them to passe over the <hi>Rhyn</hi> and declare Warre. They therefore kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within their quarters at <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> and the Marquisat of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach,</hi> not indeavouring any other enterprise, attending the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Peace with <hi>Saxony,</hi> which at this time, was with much ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and almost an assured successe treated of. For the distastes which that Elector had taken against <hi>Oxesterne,</hi> for the little respect given by him in his discourses to the Electors actions, were growne to a very great height; And though the <hi>French</hi> who were troubled this peace should be concluded, sent Monsieur <hi>de la Grange,</hi> to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector to disturbe it (as it was commonly reported) with promise of Monies, Armes and assistance, yet did they not feare to effect it; for the Elector was not greatly well inclined to the greatnesse of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Protestants in <hi>Germany,</hi> and therefore it was not to be believed, hee would nourish the Warre, at the desire of the <hi>French.</hi>

Who debating hereupon, some were of a contrary opinion; affirming,
<q>That the event of a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse must be maturely fore-seene before the businesse it selfe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; that it was well knowne how that Fort was valued by the <hi>French,</hi> what trouble and paines they had to get it from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and that therefore it was not to be doubted, that as the losse would be more resented, so would the distaste they should take thereat be the greater; that it was not yet time to come to open enmitie with the <hi>French,</hi> who were at peace within themselves, had recovered their Kings Brother, and who united within themselves, were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alone, without any other assistance, formidable to all Europe; a Nation alwayes desirous of Warre, which could not wish for a better occasion then such a conjuncture to breake with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> being as well their greatest Enemies as their chiefest Rivalls, and who by having an Army out of their Kingdome, might thereby evacuate those unquiet humours wherewithall they doe abound, and which uses to occasion home-troubles amongst them, very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to those that feare them, and without which all attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them are vaine; that <hi>Flanders</hi> was not able at one and the same time to maintaine it selfe against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and defend it selfe against the <hi>French</hi> who might easily fall upon <hi>Artois</hi>; that the Forces of <hi>Burgondy</hi> were too small to defend it selfe, from those

much more powerfull of a King of <hi>France</hi>; that <hi>Italy,</hi> which was drained by the continuall evacuation of so many men sent into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> most Princes being at this crisis of time well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined towards the <hi>French,</hi> might run a great hazard if it should at this time be set upon; that it was no doubt that either <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> without succour from <hi>Germany,</hi> could make their partie good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>French</hi>; that it was credible, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were much concerned in the possession of those Provinces, were to expect succour from the Emperour, whereby the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army being weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the <hi>Swedes</hi> joyning consequently with the <hi>French</hi> Forces, the Warre was likely to be kept on Foot in the Empire, to the great prejudice of those people; that it was therefore better for them to temporise, and persisting in the way they were in, before they should breake with <hi>France,</hi> to weaken the <hi>Swedes,</hi> re-assume a good correspondency with the <hi>Hanse</hi>-Townes, and conclude the peace with <hi>Saxony,</hi> without the which it would be dangerous for them to have to doe with the <hi>French.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To these wel-grounded Reasons, reply was made by those who knew how advantagious it was to make Achievements without cost,
<q>That occasions of securing themselves and growing greater were not to be let slip when Fortune proffers the meanes; that the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>French</hi> were no longer concealed; that the harmes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by them were apparently seene; how they indeavoured to oppresse the house of <hi>Austria</hi> and aggrandise themselves; that the blowes of a declared Enemy were lesse to be feared then those of a diffident and feigned friend; that it was to be considered, the <hi>French</hi> would alwayes foment the <hi>Austrians</hi> Enemies, and strongly assist them, out of hopes of getting somewhat thereby; and that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves in peace, whilst others were by the eares, as others grew weaker, they must consequently grow the stronger; that the proceedings of the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> was not much to be feared, for that the impatiency and eagernesse of that Nation, not being long to be tollerated by others of a different genius, 'twas probably to be hoped they might alter the affections and friendship of their Confederates; that it made not for any of the other Protestants that they should get footing out of <hi>France</hi>; that it would be hard for them to make any proceedings in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by reason of the strong holds and situation thereof; that it was held, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would never agree they should grow greater in those parts; That <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> wanted not Forts upon the Frontiers sufficient to consume whatsoever Army; and that the losse of that Countrey would be prejudiciall to <hi>Helvetia,</hi> whereunto it was not expedient to change the Confines of a King whose Territories were dis-joyned, with those of a formidable Monarch whose state was united; that more might be feared in <hi>Italy</hi> then elsewhere; but since it made not for the advantage of the Princes and Potentates thereof, that the state of <hi>Milan</hi> should be taken from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and put into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> it was to be hoped, that they would not draw ruine upon themselves, but that well weighing their owne interest, they
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55221:147"/>
would pitch upon some such expedient meanes as they might know fittest to keep their neighbours lowe. That the Country was narrow, guarded by considerable Forts; and that the <hi>Italians</hi> who shewed themselves to be jealous of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> greatnesse in that Country, 'twas to be believed they would shew no lesse dislike against the <hi>French,</hi> when they should appeare to advance towards them: So as it was better to take <hi>Filisberg,</hi> (since thereby they should drive beyond the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinat</hi> secured,) and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard themselves upon an open Warre, then (by neglecting such an occasion) to preserve a suspicious Peace, which was likely to be broken to their greater prejudice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These reasons weighed together with others, seemed to be more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide, and therefore consent being thereunto given, <hi>Baumberger</hi> made some crafty Souldiers advance towards the Towne in Country-mens apparrell, that at the appointed time, they might surprise the <hi>Corps de Guard</hi> that was at the Gate, in a very darke and cold night, and hee himselfe marched thitherward, and by meanes of the Ice, which was able to beare any whatsoever weight, hee drew neere the Rampiers with his Ladders, and easily breaking downe the weakned Palisadoes, hee put some 300 of his men into the Towne, who joyning with the former, and possessing themselves of the <hi>Corps de Guard</hi> within, and beating downe the Drawbridges with a Petar on the out side, the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarians</hi> luckily entred the Towne the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ian.</hi> 24</note> whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it was thought a presumptuous and vaine attempt to have offered at it. They tooke the Governour, Officers, and most part of the Souldies prisoners, who foolishly believing, that the <hi>Austrians</hi> would never have dared to breake with their so strong and fortunate King, whilest they had other Irons in the fire, and thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be in a sanctuary, neglected their Guards, not dreaming of any such novelty.</p>
            <p>By this surprisall and other fortunate successes of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Franckfort,</hi> were as much moved, as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved what side to betake themselves unto, they saw apparent ruine if they had not speedy recourse to <hi>Caesars</hi> clemency; they were weary of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who began to be troublesome to them: for knowing they were to forgoe that City, they indeavoured by indirect meanes to get what they could from the Citizens, none of the Protestant party caring then for the publicke good which they held as good as lost. The Inhabitants of <hi>Franckfort</hi> therefore seeing themselves reduced to this condition, began to treate of agreement with the <hi>Austrian</hi> Agents. And the Capitulation being ended, they tooke in a Garrison of the Emperours; and though they were not sure this their resolution should prove so successefull as they expected, (for the Towne of <hi>Sas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senhawsen,</hi> which was over against the City, was in the <hi>Swedes</hi> posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by whom they might suffer injuries; and to this consideration was moreover added, the neighbourhood of the <hi>French</hi> Army, and <hi>Waymers,</hi> which might cause to them some considerable prejudice) yet they thought it more advantagious at the present to cloze in with the Emperour, who offered them a gracious pardon, then be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

And though the <hi>Austrians</hi> indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to moderate this opinion in the King, signifying unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, that they were forc't upon that enterprise by the <hi>French,</hi> who had in effect declared themselves Enemies to the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of such places as made for their prejudice; the Emperour by capitulation made with the Elector, having alwayes had a part in the Garrison maintained in the very Towne of <hi>Filisburg</hi>; and though with many like messages from <hi>Rome</hi> they were not wanting in indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to retard and divert the breach betweene those two Crownes, the Pope very well foreseeing, that from thence nothing could be expected but some singular prejudice to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and to <hi>Italy</hi> also, whither certainly Forces would be brought: Yet were they not able to appease the <hi>French,</hi> who in a threatning manner prepared for revenge, making much Warre-like provision, and beginning really to think upon Warre.

This acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on though it were of some consideration to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> (aswell by the addition of the Towne, as for the Electors person, who to purchase his liberty, would at all times give his voice in the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Dyet, for the crowning of the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi>) yet was it thought by some to be no little misfortune; for this being a blow wherewithall <hi>France,</hi> being now great in power and Military preparations, would bee netled, so great ruines were foreseeen, as not onely their owne Subjects, but their Neighbours, yea, all Europe should suffer thereby; and so it fell out: For the King of <hi>France</hi> to boot with these apparent injuries, sufficient to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate an occasion of breaking Peace, was little satisfied with the proceedings of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents, who were publickly peacht by the <hi>French</hi> for having wrought upon the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>France,</hi> by many hopes, and filled them with vast imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thereby to cause civill discords, then which they could finde no better diversion; and for having done other things prejudiciall to that Kingdome: And finding at last the breach might well be retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but not evaded; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would never have suffered the <hi>French</hi> to make such Achievements, without drawing a Sword, and not requite them by Armes, since it so became them to doe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of those who for their sakes were turned out; As likewise for that it did not well agree with their government, that the <hi>French</hi> should grow greater, and should get neerer to their Confines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they should be continually jealous of their neighbourhood, and be sure to have them alwayes a counterpoise to their greatnesse, whilest under the name of good neighbours, they had possest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of such Townes as were held by their Forces, for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such as had flowne unto their King for protection; They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to permit any longer any such hostility without resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Having therefore concluded upon Warre, the King of <hi>France</hi> sent an intimation to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> which implyed an open breach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

hee would presently restore unto him <hi>Triers,</hi> and set the Elector at liberty; the Messenger whereof was not by his Highnesse listned unto. <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> who was with a great body of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Ramberviller</hi> in <hi>Lorayne,</hi> was commanded to fall downe into <hi>Alsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> that he might be ready for the imployment he was put upon. Duke <hi>Crequi</hi> who was returned from his Embassy from <hi>Rome,</hi> and who was made Lieutenant-Generall of all the <hi>French</hi> Forces in <hi>Italy,</hi> had Commission for the raising of 10000 Foot and 2000 Horse in <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheny,</hi> and <hi>Bresse,</hi> and to be ready to fall into <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>emont</hi> upon any such order from the King. 2000 <hi>French</hi> Foot were sent to <hi>Casalle.</hi> Much Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Provision was sent to <hi>Pinerolle.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Pragelle</hi> (which is a Vallie on this side the Mountaine of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and from whence issueth the River <hi>Chison,</hi> which having cut through the Vallie of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosa,</hi> fals into <hi>Poe</hi> neer <hi>Villefranca</hi>) were commanded to make certaine places of those Mountaines more easy to be passed, that such Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as were to goe from <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Grenoble</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> might passe that way. Monsieur <hi>de Bellieure,</hi> a personage of great esteem, was declared Embassadour extraordinary to all the Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Italy.</hi> And because the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who was still more and more distasted with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents, held good corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the <hi>French,</hi> divers Companies of Horse were sent towards <hi>Parma,</hi> and a good summe of Mony was sent by the King to the Duke thereof, to raise new Troopes, and for the payment of an Army in his owne state; of which, together with the assistance of other Princes their friends, the <hi>French</hi> thought to make use, to assist them on that other side, in the assault they intended to give by the way of <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> to the state of <hi>Milan</hi>; And if the effect thereof had been answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the wisedome of the plot, and his Majesties advice had been readily executed, doubtlesse the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might have run the hazard of losing the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> which did then sufficiently want men for its owne defence. Thus the Embassadours being dispatcht away, diligent preparations for Warre were made on both sides.</p>
            <p>The newes hereof comming to the Emperours Court, which was not yet quite free from the former disorders, altered the pulse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on this side, and did not a little obviat those hopes wherewith they were already much comforted by their late good successe against the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Wherefore fearing some new mischiefe, they speedily summoned the wisest of their Councell together, and examined such things as most concerned the preservation of the Empire, and found, that their discords with the Protestant Princes, were the reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which kept it languishing; for that the Warre maintained in their owne Territories, weakned the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> and laid low the <hi>Spaniards</hi> high designes, built upon the power of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. 'Twas therefore agreed upon that all diligence should be used to finde out an adequat remedy for this malady, which they found not to consist in their owne Forces, disperst abroad in other places through the hostility of the Princes of the Empire. The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was then againe invited to a new treaty of Peace, which was propounded unto him, and accompanied with the fairest propositions
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55221:149"/>
that necessitie could find out. Baron <hi>Curts</hi> went to <hi>Prague</hi> to treat with those deputed by the Elector, who though at first they were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded to come thither, they at last agreed upon a meeting, wherein the Electors pretensions and the Emperours proffers were made knowne.</p>
            <p>The Duke was found to be already somewhat diffident of the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> Agents for the Reasons that have beene said; and that he was greatly jealous of the <hi>French-mens</hi> having declared themselves, whose greatnesse was distasted by the <hi>Dutch</hi>; and that he feared, lest by the assistance of that King, Duke <hi>Waymer,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes,</hi> might grow to such an excessive power, as that he himselfe should not dare to answer to <hi>Waymers</hi> pretensions, which might perchance fall upon the Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as being formerly the patrimony of his Progenitors. Hereunto was added, That the Princes of the Empire not being pleased with the depression of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> thereby to exalt Forreiners, it was no good Maxime so farre to agrandise their friends, as to become after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards no lesse jealous of their greatnesse then of the Emperours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive power: So as finding himselfe in a condition to purchase an accommodation with <hi>Caesar,</hi> upon better tearmes then formerly, he shewed himselfe more inclinable to peace then in the preceding Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Agents perceiving, and pressing for a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Heads were signed unto, and the former correspondency with that Prince re-assumed, with the applause, and to the content of all the <hi>Saxonists</hi> who had beene much consumed in that Warre. The Heads of the Agreement were, That the exercise of Religion, being left free, (save in the Emperours Hereditary Territories) the Elector should be permitted peacefully to possesse for 50 yeares yet to come, all such Goods of the Church as he was now possest of, which time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, those differences were to be decided by the Sword of Justice, not of Warre; That three Towns in the Bishoprick of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg</hi> should remaine at his disposall, and that the Prince his Sonne should be Aministrator of the said <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and should enjoy the Principalitie of <hi>Lutzenitz</hi>; That reasonable Levyes of Moneyes should be made throughout the whole Empire, for satisfaction of the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> if they would accept of this peace; And that those should be satisfied who should renounce what was given them; And that such as would not agree unto this peace, should be enforced thereunto onely by the Emperour, without the Electors intermedling therein; And that all the Princes, as well <hi>Romanists</hi> as Protestants, should be put againe into possession of their owne Estates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auspurg</hi> was at this time in great scarcitie of Victualls by reason of the absence of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces, and the passages which were possest by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> in so much, as dayly many perished for hunger; and despairing of succour, for that the Protestant Forces were farre off, and they themselves much weakned by their past-suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, the Senate thereof, induced by necessitie, resolved to flye for clemency to the Emperour. And though they had beene heinously peccant against the Emperour and Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> yet found they such usage from them, as they would hardly have found from other
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55221:150"/>
Princes, for indeed their goodnesse hath ever beene very exemplary towards all such as implored their pardon. Their Commissioners were graciously received in <hi>Stucart</hi> by the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and after some dayes Treatie, their requests were yeelded unto. They were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to exercise their Religion, and were sentenced to pay 50000 Dollars to the the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> by vertue whereof on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi>

                  <hi>March</hi> 28.</note> 20. Companies of <hi>Swedes</hi> marched out of the Towne, who were convoyed to <hi>Erfurt,</hi> and 1500 <hi>Imperiall</hi> Foot were taken in, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Count <hi>Fucari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This meane while the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was falne from <hi>Lorayne</hi> into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> where he tooke <hi>Raffach</hi> by storme; When Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Bullion,</hi> who had private directions to goe along with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>De Lande</hi> Embassadour and Governour of the <hi>French</hi> Forces which were in <hi>Rhetia,</hi> to the enterprise of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of which affaire, not onely secresie was requisite, but such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect proceedings as might not give any occasion of suspition to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who as being neerer at hand might have prevented the blow, and have possessed themselves of the passages of that Valley before the <hi>French</hi>; He appoynted his Muster at S. <hi>Madem,</hi> a little Towne in the <hi>Agnedine</hi> Valley, that he might make use of this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well to invite the <hi>Grisons</hi> by pay to come thither in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as also to cover under this pretence any suspition that the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of so many people might occasion. The Forces therefore being met together at the Rendezous, in all three Regiments of <hi>Grisons,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Colonell <hi>Vlisse,</hi> Colonell <hi>Salice,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Pracher,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Selvesteime</hi>; three <hi>French</hi> Regiments under the Colonells, <hi>Leches, Lande,</hi> and <hi>Chambale,</hi> and two Companies of Horse, commanded by <hi>Messieures de la Villetta,</hi> and <hi>Michy</hi>; the Commissary and Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, unexpectedly opened their Commissions, and read the Kings directions to the said Commanders, which gave great content to all the Souldiers, who were desirous to quit those quarters wherein they were much streightned.</p>
            <p>They then marched towards the Mountaine <hi>Spluga,</hi> and came to <hi>Chiavena,</hi> and making themselves masters thereof, without any gaine-saying, they advanced to <hi>Riva,</hi> and passing over <hi>Sassocorbe</hi> (which is a Rock betweene the Mountaine and the Lake, by which way they are to passe who will goe from thence by land into the Valley, and which is a very streight passage, and hard to be made if there were any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it) they came to <hi>Traon,</hi> not meeting with any hindrance: For the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> wanting necessary Forces for maintaining it selfe, was rather thinking upon defence then how to set upon another. And because the <hi>French-mens</hi> designe was to shut up all the passages into that state, in such sort, as it should be impossible for the Emperour to send them any succour by the way of <hi>Tyroll,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> came thither on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi> with two Regiments of <hi>Switzers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aprill</hi> 24.</note> under the command of the Colonells, <hi>Smid</hi> and <hi>Steynor,</hi> and six <hi>French</hi> Regiments under the Colonells, <hi>Montesin, Frideliere, Cerny, Vande, Canesin,</hi> the Count <hi>Di Serra</hi> and <hi>Colla,</hi> and five Companies of Horse belonging to the Baron of S. <hi>Andrea,</hi> the Baron <hi>De Gin, Cannigliac,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55221:150"/>
Villenueffe</hi> and <hi>Rocherviere,</hi> and made himselfe master of the rest of the Valley. And though the Inhabitants did with wet eyes behold these new guests, and that it had beene better for them to have beene governed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for so they might have had free commerce with <hi>Germany,</hi> and with the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> yet were they enforced to observe such Lawes as were by the Conquerours put upon them. The <hi>Valteline</hi> is situated in the midst betweene high Mountaines, which hem it in on all sides, so as it rests betweene them a Plaine, about a mile in breadth, tis watered by the River <hi>Ada,</hi> which runs through the middle of it, full of Towns and Villages, inhabited by numbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, abounding in all sorts of Fruits the earth affords, so as the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines on each side, being covered with Vines, from whence most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wine is had, it represents a stately Theater. It bounds upon the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territories, the Arch-Dutchy of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll,</hi> and upon <hi>Rhetia</hi>; nor hath <hi>Italy</hi> a more beautifull Valley.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State, in the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> not being sufficiently provided for necessary defence, were not a little confused at the unexpected appearance of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Grisons</hi> in the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi> Cardinall <hi>Albornotz,</hi> the Regent in <hi>Milan,</hi> with courage su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined this so sorrowfull newes, and speedily advertising <hi>Spaine</hi> thereof, diligently applyed himselfe to all such expedient meanes as upon such an emergency could be used; and having weighed the difficulties of withstanding the <hi>French</hi> (who were already masters of <hi>Riva,</hi> and other avenues) from entring the state <hi>Milan,</hi> he thought it best, that being carefull at the present of preserving the Frontiers of that state, succour might be solicited from <hi>Spaine, Naples</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> by which the state being brought into a good posture, they might betake themselves to what should be most expedient. A scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny was therefore made of all such as were able to beare Armes, from 18 yeares of age till 50. that upon any occurrency they might be pickt out, and imployed in the defence of requisite places.</p>
            <p>The Militia of the State, and of the men therein fitting to beare Armes, being calculated, which might amount to neere about 10000 Foot, some thousands thereof were chosen out, and disposed of in places of most importance. <hi>Don Carlo Colombo,</hi> and Serjeant Major <hi>Molina,</hi> were incontinently dispatcht away to the Frontiers of <hi>Comasco</hi> with ten Companies of Foot, &amp; Count <hi>Serbellone,</hi> was declared super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent of those Confines, who together with other eleven Companies of <hi>Guasco's</hi> Brigade, and five Troops of Horse, forthwith tooke up his quarters on the left side of the Lake, over against the Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> and fortified himselfe in the way which the <hi>French</hi> were to passe, to hinder the Enemy from invading the Lands of <hi>Comasco</hi> on that side. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes were delivered out to rayse Souldiers in all parts. Some store of ready Money was sent to the Embassadour <hi>Cassatt,</hi> Lieger for the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> at <hi>Lucerna,</hi> to rayse 4000 <hi>Switzers. Don Antonio de Sermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes Steward,</hi> was sent to <hi>Florence,</hi> to acquaint the Duke thereof with what had hapened, and to demand of him the <hi>Brigado</hi> which he was obliged to maintaine for the defence of the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> by vertue of the agreement made at <hi>Siena.</hi> The Citie of <hi>Milan</hi> disbursed readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55221:151"/>
50000 crownes upon this occasion. And because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wisely fore-saw, that the <hi>French</hi> preparing themselves in <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheny,</hi> would certainly fall into <hi>Piemont,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> to set upon the state of <hi>Milan</hi> on that side also, governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their accustomed undauntednesse, together with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Provisions of Warre, and new Fortifications in <hi>Novara, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara, Alexandria,</hi> and other Forts upon the Frontier, they bethought themselves to try <hi>Victorio Amadeo</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to see whether he, as his Father had done before him, was resolved to follow the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Spaine.</hi> They very well knew, that for reason of State it did not well befit his Highnesse, that the <hi>French</hi> should nestle themselves in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> being very sure, that he should not from them injoy that authoritie and respect, which he, as esteemed doore-keeper of <hi>Italy,</hi> had from the one and the other Crowne; wherefore they were very urgent with him to this purpose, and full of promises and hopes. But the Duke, who after the businesse of <hi>Pinaroll,</hi> knew he suffered much in those Prerogatives, which whilst absolute Master of the <hi>Marquisat</hi> of <hi>Saluzzo</hi> he enjoyed, not having Forces sufficient to withstand the invasion of the <hi>French,</hi> and being in a condition not to be succoured by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose Armies were much diminished and weakned, his answer was ambiguous, and such as is usually given by Princes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such like occasions; yet it was thought, that keeping secret and wary intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he had promised them that he would, yes marry would he, satisfie the King of <hi>France</hi> in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but that temporising, and as occasion should serve, he would put on such resolutions as should most comply with his owne interest, and not be unacceptable to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> His answer was therefore appearingly honested with faire pretences, wherewithall the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were not altogether distasted, nor the <hi>French</hi> throughly satisfied. In fine, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents were not wanting in such wisedome and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy as was requisite upon such an occasion.</p>
            <p>On the other side, <hi>Rohan</hi> began cautiously to Fortifie; he put a Garrison into <hi>Riva,</hi> drew a Trench from <hi>Provegio</hi> to <hi>Coschio,</hi> two little Townes, the one on this side, the other on the other side of <hi>Ada</hi>; wherewithall, barricadoing up the entrance into the Vallie, he thought to secure himselfe on that side from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> attempts. And because the way from <hi>Chiavena</hi> into the <hi>Vateline</hi> by <hi>Sasso-Corbe,</hi> which was in sight, and under the command of the Cannon of Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> did trouble him, he resolved to make a way upon the ridge of the Mountaine S. <hi>Iulian,</hi> to which purpose he set 200 Pioniers on worke, but could not effect his desire. He afterwards going on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously, made himselfe absolute master of the whole Vallie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of gain-saying: where thinking to make some long abode, he tooke order for securing of the Fort <hi>Feria,</hi> and of the Castle of <hi>Codera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this revolution of affaires, Monsieur <hi>De Bellieure</hi> came to <hi>Turin,</hi> who when he had delivered his Embassy to the Duke, his Highnesse and his Ministers of State were not a little staggered, for finding the ruine that was to fall upon the state if they should refuse what was
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55221:151"/>
propounded by the King, they were consequently to be very circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spect in their proceedings with the <hi>French</hi>; &amp; on the other side, if they should yield to their desires, to foment ones owne ruine, and draw subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon ones selfe, was hard of digestion to a good Polititian. For when the <hi>French</hi> should be masters of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> there was no doubt, but that the Duke of <hi>Savoyes</hi> Authority growing lesse, and he being invironed on all sides by the <hi>French</hi> Forces, hee should not keep up that reputation which he held, whilest between them and the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but should be treated as a subject of <hi>France.</hi> The Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore much perplext, and his Councell no lesse confused, hee resolved by no meanes to irritate the Forces which hung over him; but legitimating his reasons by faire excuses, to maintaine friendship with the <hi>French,</hi> and not totally forsake <hi>Spaine</hi>; for time being that which much helpes the weakest in power, he might from thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect some happy occasion of compliance, which now to undertake would be dangerous.</p>
            <p>Those of <hi>Piemonte</hi> did the rather adhere to this Counsell, for that they found the winning of the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> would prove a difficult businesse. For though the Duke should effectually joyne with the <hi>French,</hi> and openly declare himselfe for them, since it did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and lesse with the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Grisons,</hi> that that state should fall into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> they found that when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should be brought to a very low ebbe, they would all joyne, in using what meanes they should thinke fittest, to keep those Forts from being possest by the <hi>French.</hi> The Dukes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Embassadour was therefore in generals, shewing a newtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, though (as shall be said hereafter) hee fared not the better for it. Hee therefore for the more safety of his owne dominions, added eight companies to every of his former Regiments. Hee resolved to levy 2000 <hi>Switzers,</hi> and applied himselfe to such opportune reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as the present emergency required. And that these negotiations might not passe without the Popes knowledge, whom he desired to interest in his protection, knowing that he was likely to stand in need of his Holinesse his intercession to moderate the displeasure which his proceedings might cause in the <hi>French,</hi> Hee sent Count <hi>Francis Cansciani</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to acquaint the Pope with the whole affaire, and to desire him that he would interpose that the Duke might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, according as he desired, to keep newter.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Waymer,</hi> by reason of his late bad successes, was at this time in no good credit with such <hi>German</hi> Princes as were confederate with the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> who did not applaud his too hasty actions. Wherefore hee seeing that the Countries Contributions grew daily lesse and lesse; that the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> had made his Peace with the Emperour, and that many <hi>Hauns</hi> Townes had changed their Copy, so as he knew not how longer to maintain his Army without help and assistance from the great Potentate, the States from whence he raised his Monies and Victuals, for the maintenance of his Souldiers, being the most of them already in the power of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and the Country wherein he was quartered being totally wasted and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55221:152"/>
and that his Souldiers, inforced by their sufferings, fled to the Colours which were set up of all Nations, for the King of <hi>France</hi>; who foreseeing the insubsistency of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies, in the <hi>Swedish</hi> service, aswell for the want of Contribution, as of pay, which the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders converted to their owne use, and fearing lest by the disbanding of these the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Army might bee augmented, which was victorious, and composed of the same Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, resolved to make some levies of Forreyners, aswell for what hath been said, as likewise to winne the affection of the Protestants, who comming into his pay, together with the aggrandizing of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dreaded power, the weakning of other Armies made not a little for the advantage of the <hi>French. Waymer</hi> being therefore moved out of these considerations resolved to fly for protection to the <hi>French,</hi> by whose Agents hee had been sought unto and perswaded to take pay of that Crowne, and to ingage himselfe and his Forces in the service thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> foreseeing that unlesse they could divert the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Forces, which were numerous and well experienced, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke of their designe was grounded but upon an ill foundation, and that this division of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces was the right way to compasse their ends, had procured this Princes dependency upon them, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gallant Gentleman beloved by the Souldiers, a greatly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Commander, and who was at this time in great valew and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; As also the like of the Landgrave of <hi>Hessen,</hi> who was a sprightly Prince, and of no lesse esteem with the Protestant party, and the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and all this was done through great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which being food onely fit for weake stomacks, the using ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was rather prejudiciall then advantagious to the safety of <hi>France</hi>: For this was judged to be one of the chiefe motives which made the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> reconcile himselfe to the Emperour, hee having too well found, that the protection of more puissant Princes, is nothing else but a hook, whereby that liberty is fisht for which hath escaped the nets of other mens rule and govenment, as he had very well found since his joyning in friendship with the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Chancellour <hi>Oxesterne</hi> having likewise wisely weighed, that any longer tarrying about the <hi>Rhyn</hi> would be hurtfull to the need which the Townes upon the <hi>Elb</hi> and <hi>Oder</hi> stood in of his assistance, which might easily be invaded by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces joyned with the Emperours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As likewise for the Dyet which was to be held at <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> for the new Truce, Peace or Warre, with the <hi>Polachs</hi>; leaving <hi>Mentz,</hi> resolved to goe into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> to provide for what was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for those Provinces, which were yet held by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces, and which did more import them then the others; foreseeing very well it was impossible for the <hi>Swedes</hi> to keep any longer upon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> being pursued on one side by the <hi>Imperialists</hi> Sword, and on the other side prest by the desires and perswasions of the <hi>French,</hi> who knowing them to be but weake in Men, Mony, and Meanes to subsist, did much urge them to give themselves up unto their protection, that so they might get into their hands such Townes as they were possest of

in those parts. Hee therefore tooke his was by <hi>France,</hi> where, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the King, he was honourably treated, and received with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary civillity; and afterwards imbarking himselfe in some <hi>Holland</hi> Vessels at <hi>Callis</hi> he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Nurenberg</hi> which yet stucke to the Evangelicall League, (for so did the Protestants tearm theirs) being reduced to that scarcity of Victuals as that a loafe of bread was sold for a Dollar, and decaying much in trade, it being a very populous City, which lived upon han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-Crafts and Merchandizing, seeing their hopes faile them of being succoured by the <hi>Swedes</hi> and Princes of the League, being likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the examples of <hi>Ratisbon, Auspurg</hi> and other Cities, which had found more Clemency from the Conquerour, then from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, (for <hi>Caesar</hi> finding at last that violent meanes did not worke upon a malady cankered through the peoples obstinacy of not forgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liberty of their Conscience, had applied the due remedy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to wit, the permission of their said liberty and privileges; which was the true Antidote wherewith to abolish hatred, and regaine the peoples love) agreed likewise, that 'twas better for them to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile themselves with the Emperour, then to persevere in friendship with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> from whom they had yet received but a ruinous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, which peradventure would not have proved such, if they had kept themselves in their due obedience to the Emperour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> were in these confusions, when the <hi>Imperialists</hi> imbold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their victories, and growing stronger in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> thought it expedient to venter upon somewhat whereby they might satisfie the Duke of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> and advantage themselves in those parts. <hi>Montebelgarde,</hi> which lies upon the Confines of <hi>Alsatia, Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Lorayne,</hi> and <hi>Swizzerland,</hi> and where the <hi>French</hi> had fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, seemed to them a very convenient place to open their way into <hi>Lorayn</hi>: Gathering therefore together all their Forces towards <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sach,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> they advanced to the taking in thereof, against which they planted their Cannon, plaid upon the Towne, and would doubtlesly have taken it, had not the Marshall <hi>de la Force</hi> suddainly come in to the succour thereof, who fortunatly gave the <hi>Austrians</hi> Battaile neer <hi>Luder,</hi> and after a strong bickering had the upperhand, and routed the Regiments of <hi>Wert, Renoch,</hi> and <hi>Merci</hi> the chiefe heads of that Army. Whereupon the <hi>Imperialists</hi> fearing to bee worsted, if they should continue the enterprise they had begun, suddainly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Siege, and retreated, part into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> part (under <hi>Wert</hi>) into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> rather to guard that Province, then to indeavour the winning of any Townes garrisoniz'd by the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As these the <hi>Austrians</hi> proceedings were jointly listned unto in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> and throughout the whole <hi>Caesarian</hi> Territories, so was the news of the <hi>French-mens</hi> falling into the <hi>Valteline</hi> no lesse displeasing unto them, whereby much of their designes was annihilated, and those of the State of <hi>Milan</hi> not a little troubled; for that State wanting men, and Provisions requisite for its defence, might suddainly have beene

set upon by the <hi>French,</hi> who if they had done as they threatned, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely the Dukedome would have beene in some danger of being lost; since it failed of succour from <hi>Germany</hi> which was its principall stay; from <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> from whence, by reason of their farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, aide could not suddenly be had. Signor <hi>Antonio Porres</hi> was therefore dispatcht away from <hi>Milan</hi> into <hi>Inspruch,</hi> to solicite the comming of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the succour of the <hi>Valteline. Tiroll,</hi> though much terrified with this neighbour hood of the <hi>French,</hi> began to beat up her Drummes, her Inhabitants ranne to her Confines, breaking up the high-wayes, and barricadoing them with great Logges of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, covering themselves with Trenches, and betooke themselves to defend their passages, with as much diligence as the shortnesse of time would permit.</p>
            <p>The Arch-Dutchesse of <hi>Inspruch,</hi> commanded <hi>Fornemont,</hi> Serjeant Major Generall, who was then quartered with his men in <hi>Swabenland</hi> neere <hi>Chempton,</hi> to passe over S. <hi>Maryes</hi> Mount, and not onely to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Tiroll,</hi> but to regaine the places that had beene taken by the <hi>French,</hi> and driving them out of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to succour the state of <hi>Milan</hi>; and to him were joyned 1000 Foot, who were payd by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadour. <hi>Fornemont</hi> with 4000 Foot and 400 Horse, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From thence he went to the Bathes of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi> which is another narrow passage, where Colonell <hi>Pracher</hi> was with 1400 Foot, and setting couragiously thereupon, he made such worke, as though he were valiantly withstood by the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and that Monsieur <hi>De Landes</hi> Regiment, and two other Companies of Horse came in to succour; yet <hi>Pracher</hi> knowing the place to be too weake to resist the grosse body of the <hi>Dutch</hi> which advanced, and fearing to be driven out, resolved to quit the place, and to retreat to <hi>Bormio,</hi> and did so, with the losse of about 70 of his men, And from thence, keeping alwayes on the left hand of <hi>Ada,</hi> he past over <hi>Tridolfe</hi> (a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which issueth out of <hi>Valfurba</hi>) and got to <hi>Tirano,</hi> one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Townes of the said Valley, on this side of the <hi>Ada,</hi> over against the Valley <hi>Puschiavo,</hi> and there refreshing his wearied men, <hi>Lande</hi> not thinking himselfe strong enough to make head against the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists,</hi> for that the greatest part of the <hi>French</hi> were in the Countrey of <hi>Chiavena</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> he resolved to get into the Valley of <hi>Puschiavo,</hi> and there to expect succour from <hi>Rohan. Fornemont</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of the occasion the <hi>French-mens</hi> retreat afforded him, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards <hi>Tirano,</hi> and meeting with no encounter past on to <hi>Brus,</hi> from thence as farre as the little Lake of <hi>Puschiavo,</hi> from whence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <hi>French</hi> dislodged, and withdrew themselves towards the Countie of <hi>Chiavena</hi>; And fearing lest the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> might come in to the succour of the <hi>French,</hi> he writ to <hi>Serbellone,</hi> who was upon the Frontiers of <hi>Comasco,</hi> that making use of this propitious occasion, he should set upon the places held by the <hi>French</hi> on that side, that he might divert <hi>Rohan</hi> from bringing succour to the other side. But <hi>Fornemont,</hi> not having given in his Letters his due Titles to

               <hi>Serbellone,</hi> as it was said, and thereupon some distastes growing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, <hi>Fornemont</hi> not well satisfied, retired by the Valley of <hi>Pedenazza,</hi> into that of <hi>Lenia,</hi> and leaving his Forces there, went to <hi>Croren,</hi> a Towne in the Valley of <hi>Venesta.</hi>

But being set upon by the wonted fury of the <hi>French,</hi> and not having their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall with them, after having made some confused defence, they made use of the benefit which a little Rivolet falling from the Mountaines afforded them, and ran away; and in this their disordered retreat, lost in such as were slain and taken about 700 Foot. This businesse being done, and <hi>Rohan</hi> perceiving there was no meanes of subsisting in that Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley for want of Victualls, he returned to <hi>Puschiavo,</hi> and for the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his men, as likewise to regaine the places that were lost at <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi> he went to <hi>Tirano.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were no lesse amazed at this rout, then at <hi>Crequi's</hi> passing over the Mountaines with a <hi>French</hi> Army, for they probably fore-saw by the avenues of the <hi>Valteline</hi> being shut up from receiving any succour from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by <hi>Montferrats,</hi> and <hi>Piemonts</hi> being full of Souldiers, by the Duke of <hi>Parma's</hi> diffidency, and his high fancies against the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> and by the state of <hi>Venice</hi> her being armed upon her Frontiers, that if they should be set upon in these straights, not being above 8000 Foot and 2000 Horse, they should runne dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of receiving a great blow. Notwithstanding behaving themselves discreetly, and having received some recruits from <hi>Spaine,</hi> (700 <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Horse, and some other Foot being landed at <hi>Vado</hi>) they seemed to be a little comforted amidst their pressing troubles.</p>

               </gap>opes in these present emergencies lay in the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who if he should declare himselfe for them, they might easily evade the evills that over-hung them, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did againe renew their negotiations with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Duke <hi>D'Alvito</hi> and others, to whom they greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of what had beene lately done by the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to the agreement made at <hi>Montsona</hi> and <hi>Ratisbon</hi>; That therefore his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Majestie was to take up Armes in his owne defence, with whom they desired his Highnesse to joyne in league for the common safetie, or that if it stood not with his conveniency to declare himselfe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their friend, he would at least be Neuter, without any prejudice to the Territories of their King. But the Duke, who found himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt on all sides with the <hi>French,</hi> and who to the instant desires made unto him by the Embassadour <hi>Bellieure,</hi> had new propositions put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by <hi>Crequi's</hi> selfe, so as he could not follow the <hi>Spaniards</hi> advise without provoking the displeasure of the most Christian King, and draw the Warre upon himselfe, made such an answer as shewed how much he was displeased to find himselfe in such a condition, as that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55221:154"/>
he could not adhere to their desires; affirming, that the reason of State, and the experience of past-examples, fore-warned him from drawing so great and dangerous a Warre upon himselfe; And that therefore he was first to see what resolutions the Pope and other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of <hi>Italy</hi> would put on, each of which was interessed in the successe of this Warre; and that since he was not in a posture of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he pleased, he could not chuse but ratifie the Articles agreed upon formerly with the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Lusa</hi> and <hi>Pinarollo</hi>; yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he would endeavour so to governe himselfe as should testifie how well he was disposed towards the Crowne of <hi>Spaine.</hi>

                  </gap>qui</hi> having obteined leave from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to passe through <hi>Piemont,</hi> and all necessary Provisions for his Army, he advanced to <hi>Montferrat</hi>; so as Armes being taken up in all parts of the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> all the Militia of the Territories of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> in <hi>Lomellina</hi> beyond the <hi>Goyna,</hi> was suddenly put in readinesse. Three Companies of Foot were sent as a Garrison into <hi>Villata,</hi> a Town upon the Confines of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a bridge upon Boats over the <hi>Goyna,</hi> that upon occasion they might easily passe over men into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> to waite upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>French,</hi> who, entertaining themselves in Treaties and negotiations with <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi> (desiring that they might joyne all their Forces together, and set joyntly at one and the same time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the state of <hi>Milan</hi>) spent so many dayes therein, as that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> got advantage thereby, and tooke such breath, as afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served them in greater vigour.</p>
            <p>These so many reports from <hi>France,</hi> being brought to the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> did much trouble the King and his whole Councell; yet it being the propertie of wisemen, to make wisedome their buckler in adversitie, they were not slow in applying themselves to such expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies as were most behofeful for the safetie of their dominions. Many Companies of Foot were therefore raysed and entertained, with all carefulnesse in all parts, and men and moneyes were shipt away for <hi>Milan.</hi> 'Twas noysed abroad, that the King would goe himselfe in Person to <hi>Barcellona,</hi> that he might be neerer at hand to assist his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and that if need should be he would passe into <hi>Italy</hi>; yet this was given out more to comfort the people, then that the King or his Counsellours had any such intention. The Fleet which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Naples,</hi> consisting of 32 Gallies, 13 Galliouns, and other armed Barques, was commanded to be in a readinesse to goe whether occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should require; and though at the very parting from <hi>Naples,</hi> it met with such a storme, as that a good part thereof was broken and scattered, yet recovering the Haven at <hi>Longone</hi> in the Island of <hi>Elbe</hi> all (that was amisse) was in a short time repaired and amended.</p>
            <p>And because the government of <hi>Milan</hi> was no longer thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be intrusted to a Cardinall, but to some good experienced Souldier, the Marquis of <hi>Leganes</hi> had the charge thereof given him; he, who being with the <hi>Infanta</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> wonne immortall Fame in the Battell at <hi>Nordlinghen,</hi> and who by new orders from the King was returned to <hi>Spaine,</hi> to acquaint his Majestie with the affaires of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:55221:154"/>
and <hi>Germany.</hi> Though the Emperour in these perplexities (by reason of his late Victories, and the peace with <hi>Saxony</hi>) had an Army on foot (not onely able to defend himselfe, but to goe upon any other undertaking) yet fore-seeing that the Protestants being back't by the <hi>French,</hi> might easily breake out to new commotions, he made his Embassadour at <hi>Rome</hi> desire the Pope to send him good store of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to bring this Warre with the Heretiques (<hi>So my Author is pleased to tearme them</hi>) to an end, by the which the holy Church should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no lesse advantage. But the Pope, thinking that libertie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science granted by the Emperour to the <hi>Haunse</hi> Townes, and to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> did not correspond with the zeale which <hi>Caesar</hi> shewed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, bound up his answer in succinct tearmes, and excused himselfe in civill manner; and yet could not forbeare to say, he did not fight directly against Heretiques, since he permitted them their libertie of conscience. In briefe, Drums were beaten up in all parts, and convenient Provisions were not omitted to withstand the current of so great a Warre.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>French-men</hi> began on this side, so were they not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of what they had to doe towards <hi>Flanders</hi>; for having gotten an Army together in <hi>Picardy</hi> of 20000 men, under the command of Marshall <hi>Schatillione,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> themselves weighing well the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portancy of their owne interests, which consisted chiefely in keeping themselves from being invaded by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they might be in <hi>Picardy,</hi> it being an open Province, and fitter for such a purpose then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, bounding upon <hi>Artois,</hi> a Countrey held by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> wherein are many strong holds; from which invasion, if they could once socure themselves, they might the easier and upon better founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion march with their Forces towards the <hi>Rhyn</hi> and other places; The King went himselfe in Person to <hi>Amiens,</hi> the Metropolitan of <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and having first agreed upon the manner how to joyne his Forces with those of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which lay in great numbers about <hi>Maestricht,</hi> and which could not be done, unlesse passing through <hi>Lucemberg,</hi> and so crossing through the Country of <hi>Leige,</hi> he should joyne with the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> on the other side of the <hi>Maze</hi>; Marshall <hi>Schatillione,</hi> and Marshall <hi>Bresse,</hi> both of them Marshalls of <hi>France,</hi> began to march with their Forces thether-wards. The which being understood at <hi>Brussels,</hi> though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not beene idle, whilest the <hi>French</hi> were making such preparations, but were provided with all things necessary to withstand so numerous Forces, yet the <hi>Infanta</hi> mustered the old Army of those Provinces, one part whereof was about the Fort <hi>Philippine,</hi> which they indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take, but in vaine, and divided it into two bodies, the one of which consisted of about 8000 Foot and 2000 Horse, with 16 piece of Cannon, which hee sent under the conduct of Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to oppose the <hi>French</hi> Army; and hee sent the other in face of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> (who lay about <hi>Maestricht</hi>) thinking therewithall to resist the <hi>French</hi> Army, which was likely to have suffered much of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity in <hi>Legnoise.</hi> For 'tis likely the people thereof being in Armes for the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> would not have helped them to any

Provisions, save what they could get by the Sword, and Prince <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> following them in the Flancke, and on the Reere, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced them to keep close together, and consequently to meet with greater difficulties. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not successefull in their designes; for the Prince being arrived with his Army between <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi> and <hi>Marche,</hi> two Townes upon the <hi>Mesa,</hi> and (that they might not pretermit any occasion of damnifying of the Enemy) having made his men advance to surprise the <hi>French</hi> Vanguard, which was in a little Village not farre from thence, and who, as the Prince was falsly advertised, were carelesse in keeping their Guards; and the <hi>French</hi> being by their Spies advertised of the <hi>Spanish</hi> designe, and being all close together in a Body ready to receive them, made their Horse ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the sight of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Army, and to the end the <hi>Dutch</hi> might not know, that they had all their Forces together in that place, they made the greatest part of their men retreat behinde a little Hill, and seeming to take another way, they unexpectedly Charged <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koyes</hi> Horse, who no lesse valiantly advanced with his Squadrons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>French</hi>; but they giving upon the <hi>Flemish</hi> Troopes, who had not got to the place of advantage that they determined to have done, came so furiously upon them, as that opening their files, and breaking their Squadrons, they put them to rout, as they did likewise the Foot; who seeing themselves not backt by their Horse, betooke themselves to their heeles, and ran towards a little River, where being overtaken by the <hi>French,</hi> a great many of them, and many of their Officers were cut in pieces, some Ensignes lost, and the greatest part of their Baggage. The Prince who could not rally his men, though to that effect he did what could be expected from a brave Commander, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated with such of his Souldiers as hee could get together towards <hi>Andem</hi> and <hi>Namours.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Infanta</hi> who was parted from <hi>Brussels,</hi> and marched towards <hi>Tirelemont,</hi> with such Forces as he covld gather together, understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the way, that his side was routed, how strong the Enemy was, and that those of <hi>Leige</hi> who had taken up Armes in his behalfe, had laid them downe againe, not intending to contest against the victor, sent letters full of civility to Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> wherein he comforted him, and promised present succour, to incourage the cast-downe spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Souldiers. Hee accompanied these letters with advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the <hi>French</hi> Army, led by Marshall <hi>de la Force,</hi> being rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Duke of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> would be inforced to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the enterprise, and seeke to defend their owne Country. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall the Souldiers (as is usually occasioned by hopes) being much inheartned (though the newes was but artificially coyned) it wrought so good effect, that their scattered Souldiers re-united themselves, and relying upon succour from <hi>Germany,</hi> which was already marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace towards them, under the conduct of <hi>Picolominy,</hi> and upon the Neighbourhood of other people of those Provinces, they resolved to intrench themselves neer <hi>Tirelemont,</hi> upon the bankes of a little River that runs into <hi>Demer,</hi> and there to make head against the <hi>French.</hi> But hearing afterwards that they were joyned with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> neer
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:55221:155"/>
               <hi>Maestricht,</hi> and that having past the <hi>Mosa</hi> they marched merrily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, they resolved suddainly to begon from thence, lest they might be ingaged in a Battaile, by the losse whereof they might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard too much, and not greatly advantage themselves by the Victory; and so they did, retiring themselves to <hi>Loeven,</hi> a place of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, where they might be ready to defend the City, as also, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion should serve, to succour <hi>Namours, Malines, Breda,</hi> and other places thereabouts. The <hi>French</hi> hearing that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Camp was retired from <hi>Tirelemont,</hi> advanced thitherwards, where they were man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully withstood by 400 <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot, who were left for a Guard there, but being too weake to resist so great a Force, upon a briske Assault made by two Armies, they were, to their infinite glory, all of them cut in pieces by the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Tirelemont</hi> was followed by the like of <hi>Diest, Aer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schot,</hi> and <hi>Sichem,</hi> Townes upon the <hi>Demer,</hi> which compounded upon the first appearance of the Enemy, being so ordered to doe by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Commanders, who would not imploy their Forces in defence of such places which they knew would hardly be maintained. From thence they marched towards <hi>Loeven,</hi> intending to take that City, which was of no small moment, being situated in the heart of <hi>Flanders,</hi> between <hi>Brussels</hi> and <hi>Aerschot.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> Commanders, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they should not do well in sitting down before a well-munitioned Towne, and so afford the <hi>Spaniards</hi> leasure to re-unite themselves, but that it would be better for them to go straight toward <hi>Brussels,</hi> and take that, and then to <hi>Termanda</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and breake the Dikes of <hi>Callo,</hi> and so divide <hi>Flanders</hi> from <hi>Brabant.</hi> They thought this the best course to take; therefore seeming to passe over <hi>Demer,</hi> to enter into <hi>Champaigne,</hi> or make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> believe they would fall upon <hi>Malines,</hi> they wheeled about on the left hand, and turned towards <hi>Brussels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having notice hereof got thither before the <hi>French,</hi> and incamped themselves in the fittest places about that City, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thereby vaine the <hi>French</hi> designe. The Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> who knew how difficult a thing it would be to compasse this affaire, had Counselled the contrary, and thought it better to returne to <hi>Loeven,</hi> and set upon that Towne, the taking whereof would be very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to <hi>Flanders,</hi> for thereby the greatest part of the Country would be brought under composition, and other Achievements would bee furthered.</p>
            <p>Though this opinion were good, and given by so wise a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet some thought there was cunning in it; for 'twas thought the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did well enough approve of correspondency with the <hi>French,</hi> so farre as they might be the better by them, but that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired not their neighbour-hood, nor increase of power; for whilst those Provinces were under the obedience of a Crowne whose power was farre off and dis-united, they were sufficient and able, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shewes, to defend their liberties; which it would be harder for them to maintaine, when they should have to doe with a Potentate whose Forces and Dominions were united, and did border upon them.

            <p>Whilest <hi>Flanders</hi> was jusled on all sides by the Forces of two so great Kings, threatning mischiefe and troubles to <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the great preparations of both sides promised a storme, Marshall <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> who was in the Bishopricke of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> understanding that Peace was concluded between <hi>Caesar</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> as also the uniting of their Forces, foreseeing the breach which was likely to ensue between the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and knowing the first hostile act would be upon the City of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> as a place of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Elector (it being a very strong hold in the bosome of his Territories, and to which hee likewise laid pretence,) began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the Fortifications thereof, and to take order for such Provisions as should not onely be necessary for the preservation of the Towne, but for the maintenance of all the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces in those Provinces. These preparations being heard of at <hi>Dresden,</hi> the Elector desiring quiet, which made him make Peace with the Emperour, sent letters speedily away to <hi>Bannier,</hi> wherein by well grounded reasons hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to accept of the Capitulation of Peace made at <hi>Prague,</hi> for the publick quiet, and offered him a summe of Mony if he would friendly deliver up <hi>Magdeburg</hi> into his hands, and remove from that Bishopricke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Bannier,</hi> who was not to conclude, nor treat any thing herein without the consent of the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and the

other confederate Princes, returned no answer at all, but meeting with some Troopes of <hi>Saxon</hi> Horse, and skirmishing with them, wherein the <hi>Saxons</hi> had the worst, began the breach with the Elector; of whom the <hi>Swedes</hi> much complained,
<q>saying, hee was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the benefits he had received from their King, who to preserve his Dukedome from invasion, had not onely imploy'd his owne For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but shed his blood and lost his life; and that instead of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the memory thereof for ever in his heart, hee had secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Peace prejudiciall to the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and to the Princes and States of <hi>Germany,</hi> without acquainting his friends and confederates therwithall, as in all reason he ought to have done.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These complaints of the <hi>Swedes</hi> comming to the Electors eare, he presently published a <hi>manifesto,</hi> wherein was declared,
<q>That he had made this Peace, as a lover of the good of <hi>Germany,</hi> without the which all those States were in danger of being over-run by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Forces. That hee had contracted amity with the King of <hi>Swethland</hi> onely for preservation of the common liberty, the which being now yeelded unto by <hi>Caesar,</hi> the reasons were consequently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away for which he had joyned himselfe in that union. That as he intended it, the Crowne of <hi>Swethland</hi> was to be satisfied for all the expences it had been at, and to be included in the agreement made at <hi>Prague</hi>; but that the great Chancellour <hi>Oxesterne,</hi> and the other <hi>Swedish</hi> Officers, being ambitious to command in <hi>Germany,</hi> to injoy a better climat then their owne, and to inrich themselves by the spoiles of that exhausted Country, would not listen thereunto, though the businesse was faire and to be desired: In briefe, that he was a Prince who would not obey the vast desires of such Ministers of State as did not love the weale publicke; and lastly, that his proceedings were not prejudiciall to the interest of his friends.</q>
These excuses and declarations did not mitigate, but more inflame the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders, and invite them to revenge; for as good Wine makes the sharpest Vinegar, so their former good friendship turned to the greater enmity.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Austrians</hi> were not wanting in all requisite diligence, but knowing that <hi>England</hi> (though separated by a large arme of the Sea, which makes it as it were another world) if the <hi>French</hi> should grow to a greater power, would suffer by the shade of so over-spreading a tree; the people whereof, to boot with their owne politicke interest of not desiring their neighbours increase in greatnesse (whether it proceeded from envy, or from their naturall hatred, occasioned by the diversity of the Nations dis-agreeing in Tongue and Customes, or from the memory of the ancient cruell Warres between them and the <hi>French</hi>) were generally jealous of the <hi>French</hi>; indeavoured by the perswasions of such Counsellours as were of their partie, to move the King of <hi>England</hi> in their behalfe, so to weaken the <hi>French</hi> Forces by this friendship; for that being entertained in having an eye to these, they could not so easily reflect upon <hi>Flanders.</hi> This their indeavour did in realitie meet with many lets and difficulties, though in appearance all things were fairely carryed on. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the <hi>English</hi> no lesse mindfull of the <hi>Spanish</hi> actions, who under the colour of good neighbour-hood, had formerly indeavoured by an Armado at Sea to land their men in that Kingdome, and under pretence of comforting the oppressed <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> to conquer it, did very well know that the <hi>French</hi> could not be held under without promoting the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects they ought more to dread then the <hi>Brench</hi>; and in particular, because the <hi>English</hi> greatnesse consisting at Sea, which they must passe over who will set footing in that Kingdome, they had more reason to feare the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that were as well potent by Sea as Land, then the <hi>French,</hi> farre inferriour to them in shipping and strength at Sea. And for that the King of <hi>England</hi> was first to have satisfaction given him
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55221:157"/>
in his pretences of having the <hi>Palatinate</hi> restored to his Nephewes, which was a businesse the <hi>Austrians</hi> desired not to heare of, their thoughts proved imperfect, especially since the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon the Duke <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and likewise the Electorall Cap; so as it seemed not faire to bereave him of the title of Elector, though the <hi>Palatinate</hi> should be taken from him, and as good an estate given him. Divers Propositions were therefore propounded hereupon by the wariest Court-Counsellours. Some were of opinion,
<q>That <hi>England</hi> was by all meanes possible to be satisfied, not onely so to winne the love and affection of the King thereof, but to interest him in a League which might moderate the excessive power of <hi>France</hi> already growne to too great an height, and to take from the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants their pretence of taking up Armes against the Emperour, by restoring the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and Electoricall Dignitie, the which was knowne to many to be of great importance; since that it little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Emperour and his affaires, whether that state were in the hands of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or in the Prince <hi>Palatines,</hi> and yet the not restoring thereof was of great concernment. That by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this the <hi>Austrians</hi> became hatefull to the Protestant Princes, and 'twas a prevalent cause of raysing Warre, which being fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> did much endammage the Empire, as experience had already shewen; for the expences the <hi>Austrians</hi> had beene at in the late Warres, did twentie times exceed the full value of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; that notwithstanding, not to quit good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> nor breake faith with him, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready to disburse his owne monyes, and indanger his state for <hi>Caesars</hi> service, the <hi>Palatinate</hi> might be changed for the upper <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> as it had beene formerly done; And that the title of Elector might rest in the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> during his life, and afterwards returne to the <hi>Palatine</hi>; for that though they should not intend to doe so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they should by this promise winne time to put the affaires of the Empire in order, and get to be in a condition of altering their word at their pleasure: Others thought it good to feed <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with good words, but that their actions should onely aime at their owne interests; for though the <hi>Palatinate</hi> should be restored, the <hi>English</hi> would not notwithstanding declare themselves Enemies to <hi>France</hi>; for since it made for the interest of their Kingdome, that both these Crownes should be weakened by the Warre, they would endeavour to keepe the ballance equally poised betweene them, that so by their ruines they might the more secure the peace and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of their owne quiet Kingdome: And as for the distaste they might receive by the not restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> they should not any wayes apprehend that, for the <hi>English</hi> would never joyne with the <hi>French</hi> to oppresse the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> lest thereby they should augment their already excessive Forces, which necessarily they ought to be jealous of; but they would rather foment that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whose declination might make the other more dreadfull. Others affirmed, It were more convenient to give in Lieu of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> some Lands in <hi>Swabendland,</hi> and in <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> to the Duke of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55221:158"/>
                  <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and that the title of Elector should remaine to him during his life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, the most voyces were for the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; but the putting of it in execution was much hindred through the feare the <hi>Imperialists</hi> had of distasting the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> whose assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was now more necessary for them then formerly. And thus was this so weightie resolution retarded, and inveloped with other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations; when <hi>Maximilian</hi> wisely fore-seeing that the <hi>Austrian</hi> Ministers of State might resolve upon somewhat which might give satisfaction to <hi>England,</hi> and finding there was no better way to crosse it, then by obliging the Emperour to have a greater care to the interest of his owne house, he bethought himself of marrying the Emperours Daughter, as well to winne more upon <hi>Caesars</hi> good will by this new alliance, as to oblige his <hi>Imperiall</hi> Majestie, rather to favour his grand-children then strangers.</p>
            <p>This marriage was therefore managed with reciprocall desire; the Duke desired it, the more to oblige the Emperour and King of <hi>Hungary</hi> to continue friendship with him, as likewise, that he might have issue to succeed him in his Dominions, which as yet he had not. <hi>Caesar</hi> listened willingly thereunto, as well to shew his affection to <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as likewise to make him by this tye more firme to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Caesar</hi>; and to keepe him from being wrought upon by the perswasions and promises of <hi>France,</hi> as it was said was mainely indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by vast hopes, whereby to withdraw him from his siding with the Emperour; and certainly, if the Duke should, as things then stood, have given eare thereunto, such a resolution might have tended much to the prejudice of <hi>Caesar.</hi> The businesse was therefore wholly concluded, though some good wits murmured thereat, pretending to fore-see, that such fruits might proceed from this marriage as might prove bitter to the Emperours house.</p>
            <p>Whilest <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> were thus busied, each of them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what preparations they could for the present affaires; a <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> named <hi>Entholts,</hi> who being banished his Countrey, lived amongst the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and who was very ill satisfied with the states of <hi>Holland,</hi> because they had beheaded his Father, for having (as it was layd to his charge) conspired with other two of his companions, to deliver up the Fort of <hi>Tiell,</hi> seated upon the <hi>Wall,</hi> betweene <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi> and <hi>Niminghen,</hi> unto the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whilest he lived in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey that profest Neutralitie; this <hi>Entholts,</hi> holding intelligence with some kindred and friends of his, who often used to advertise him how affaires went in those Provinces, thought how he might effect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which might correspond with his desires, as it is usuall with men whose passion exciteth them to revenge; And being advertised, that the Fort of <hi>Skinck</hi> (a very strong place, situated upon the poynt of the Island made by the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> which dividing it selfe here into two parts, that on the left hand takes the name of the <hi>Wall,</hi> the other on the right hand continuing the name of the <hi>Rhyn</hi> till it falls into the Sea, so as it is made almost impregnable) had in it at that time not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 200 Foot for the guard thereof; that the Ditch might in some

good store of Victuals being put thereinto, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> though they did their uttermost, were stoutly resisted, and beaten back; Yet did they not (like gallant Souldiers) dispaire of successe, being sure that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not keep it, lying so farre from succour, and so neer their out-rages, and chiefely, for that being continually infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the <hi>French,</hi> they could not imploy those men to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of that Fort, which being to be divided for the preservation of other Cities, and Provinces, were not able to withstand the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> proceedings, in a place, whither by reason of the great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy thereof they had summoned all their Forces.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prevailed here, the <hi>French</hi> failed not to do the like elsewhere. Duke <hi>Crequi</hi> falling from <hi>Piemont</hi> into <hi>Montferrat</hi> with 8000 Foot and 2000 Horse, past over the <hi>Poe,</hi> and carrying his men on this side <hi>Sesia</hi> to within the jurisdiction of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> hee tooke <hi>Villata,</hi> (a place which in the former Warres of <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> was held by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>) meeting with little or no resistance.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>French-mens</hi> chiefe aime was, to get into the State of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> and to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thence, which when they should have done, they would not onely have secured themselves of the State of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but successefully carry on their Forces to further enterprises; the which they might easily have done, if they had not given eare to the perswasions of such, who openly appearing to believe much in the <hi>French</hi> Nation, spread abroad those Politique reports, and which Princes are so well pleased to heare, to wit, that with little expence, and not many men, they might effect their desires; for they believed that any small number of their men (as they were told by others) with the assistance of their Colleagues, would be sufficient to doe the deed; If they had not moreover been made believe that the <hi>Milanois,</hi> being weary of the <hi>Spanish</hi> subjection, and desirous of Novelty, would suddainly follow the <hi>French</hi> Banners as soone as they should see a compleat Army in <hi>Piemonte,</hi> which might be sufficient to keep in the confederates, awe the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> and to keep the Field in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Milan</hi>; And if the <hi>French</hi> Commanders, instead of passing their time away in making addresses to the Ladies of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and <hi>Piemonte,</hi> in arguing upon yea and nay, and in filling their purses with Gold, had directly marched on and set downe before the Walls of <hi>Milan,</hi> which was not furnished with men, nor resolution.</p>
            <p>Divers propositions were set on Foot in the Courts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piemonte,</hi> that the best and most advantagious might be chosen.
<q>The taking of <hi>Valenza,</hi> a Towne neer the <hi>Poe,</hi> between <hi>Tortona</hi> and <hi>Casalle,</hi> was propounded, as that which would in a good part have hindred such succour as might be sent from the State of <hi>Genua,</hi> to that of <hi>Milan</hi>; it opened the passage to enter into that State, and it cut off <hi>Alissandria,</hi> making the passage easie from <hi>Montferrat</hi> to <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which was the chiefe considerable thing in this affaire; for the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> not daring openly to declare himselfe in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile manner against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> because his state was too farre distant from <hi>Montferrat,</hi> from whence upon occasion hee was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect succour, it was consequently fitting, and in all reason approved
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55221:159"/>
of, that their first enterprise should be such as might give satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their Colleagues. <hi>Novara</hi> was talked of, whose Frontiers joyned upon that State, and there was nothing else to withstand them even to the very Gates of <hi>Milan</hi>: But this being a strength which was well-guarged by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and which had formerly proved unfortunate to the <hi>French,</hi> it was laid aside. Some of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest were of opinion, that they should passe by all the Forts, and strong holds, and suddainly over-run all the whole State of <hi>Milan,</hi> possesse themselves of the most advantagious passages, fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves there, infest the Country continually, and so bring the Townes and Cities to compound; for the Country being well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, full of Nobility, and Inhabitants, that lived commodiously, when they should see their grounds wasted, and their goods destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would easily be brought rather to thinke upon the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their owne estates and privat interests, then upon the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Forts; and this opinion was assented unto by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as known to be the likelyest to prosper; but this resolution requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more Men and Mony, and being by powerfull reasons disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> not grounded upon any good intention to the <hi>French,</hi> but upon his owne particular interest, with the which it did not well agree, that the State of <hi>Milan</hi> should fall into the King of <hi>France</hi> his hands, the enterprise of <hi>Valenza</hi> was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Before the which the <hi>French</hi> being to spend much time, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> consequently reaped thereby the benefit to provide for the defence of the other places, and to succour <hi>Valenza</hi> likewise; and the <hi>French</hi> losing many of their men before this place, 'twas easily descryed, they would be able to effect little or nothing; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held as a strong reason of State, that the <hi>French-mens</hi> further progresse in that Province, made not for the good of any <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, by reason of the good neighbourhood which they finde who confine upon great Potentates, particularly upon such, who desirous to inlarge their dominions, invent pretences to breake their word, and to usurpe what belongs unto their neighbours. Yet this Counsell was held by wise men not to fit so well with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent interest of the States of <hi>Italy,</hi> who gave for their reason, that the State of <hi>Milan</hi> being a new <hi>Carthage,</hi> which kept all its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in continuall motion, and being possest by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> a powerfull Nation, ambitious of glory, and which hardly ever parts with what it hath once gotten, <hi>Italy</hi> would alwayes be troubled with their pretensions; that the <hi>French</hi> were on the contrary unquiet, impatient of staying long out of <hi>France,</hi> thinking there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world but their own Kingdome; that it would not be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to drive out them when they should have driven out the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and so redresse that Kingdome under the power of some <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, as it formerly had been. They added, that to adde to the power of great Princes, was to nurse up a Serpent in ones bosome which at last would devour the nourisher; for great Potentates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not their neighbours good turnes, but are mindfull how they may commodiat themselves by the ruine of such as border
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55221:160"/>
upon them.</q>
Others more partiall to the <hi>French,</hi> replyed, <hi>That all the foolish</hi> French <hi>were dead, and all the wise</hi> Spaniards.</p>
            <p>All things requisite being in a readinesse, they gave order for their march thitherwards, which was for a few dayes retarded; for their were some who thought it was not good to undertake a businesse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any difficulty lay, with the <hi>French</hi> Forces onely, since <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi> had not covenanted openly to declare themselves, till they should see some Towne possessed by the <hi>French</hi>; and though some were of opinion, that the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who had a strength of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4000 Foot and 800 Horse, was able to have made an Impression in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> by which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces being in many places cut short, the worke would consequently be the easier for the <hi>French,</hi> yet did not this opinion prevaile; for the Duke not daring to declare himselfe openly an Enemy to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> till the <hi>French</hi> were so farre advanced as that they might easily succour him upon any occasion, kept his Forces upon his owne grounds, holding the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> onely in jealousie. But <hi>Crequi</hi> incouraged by the hopes hee had of the Duke of <hi>Parma's</hi> being well-inclined towards his King, and by the desire he found in that Prince to breake with <hi>Spaine,</hi> pitcht his Camp before <hi>Valenza,</hi> raised Workes, and planted his Cannon, and began couragiously to set upon it. The Marquis of <hi>Calada,</hi> who was a little before put in there as superintendent, Signor <hi>Francesco di Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> who was the governour of the Towne, and Captaine <hi>Spadino,</hi> a worthy Gentleman, knowing how acceptable the preservation of that place would be to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and how much glory they should thereby gaine unto themselves, began to shew as much courage and industry in the defence thereof, as the <hi>French</hi> did in their desire to win it.</p>
            <p>The newes of the <hi>French</hi> Armies arrivall in the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the knowledge of the Townes and Cities thereof, brought with it no small feare to the Inhabitants, and to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For those places wanting men sufficient for their defence, the whole Countrey was in a confusion: for the Souldiers of the Trained Bands, by their taking up Armes, were rather cause of grief &amp; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to their wives and children, (who quit the Countrey) then of comfort or incouragement to defence, they being generally known for white-liver'd men. Yet amidst these emergencies, was not the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Albernois,</hi> and the other <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents, wanting in courage, but according to their innate undauntednesse, began to make such Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they thought necessary, and as the shortnesse of time would permit them. Expresses were sent by Post into <hi>Spaine, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to sollicite the amassing of men and moneys; a new scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was made of all the people of the state, and out of every hundred men, eight of the ablest were chosen to place in the Forts, and Forrein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were removed from thence to be made use of in the Field. <hi>Il Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estro de Campo Roma</hi> was sent to <hi>Mortara,</hi> a Towne betweene <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Verculles,</hi> to be super-intendent there; <hi>Don Carlo Colombo,</hi> was sent to <hi>Alessandria,</hi> and divers other men of worth to the <hi>Fort Sandavall,</hi> and other places upon the Confines, and all those places were re-inforced
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55221:160"/>
with men; the Drummes beat up every where, and Provisions were made for the present occurrences. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> desisted not not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding to negotiate by their Agents with the Pope, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique of <hi>Venice,</hi> that if they intended not to succour them, neither should they assist the <hi>French</hi>; and chiefly they feared, lest the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> should declare themselves, who were instigated by mightie offers from the <hi>French</hi> to appeare in their behalfes, and to bring their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on this side <hi>Alda,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> being very strong, having 8000 Foot of sundry Nations, and 2000 Horse well in order in <hi>Lombardy</hi> beyond <hi>Mincio,</hi> under the command of <hi>Luigi Zorzi</hi> their Generall, a valiant man, much esteemed and feared, who to boot with his refined judgement, was couragious and resolute in his Warre-resolves; they had moreover, more men quartered in <hi>Crema</hi> and thereabouts, under the conduct of <hi>Michell Priuli,</hi> a sonne not unlike his father, who had formerly beene Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> an Heroick Prince, who had a noble heart, and was of an experimented wisedome; and others in <hi>Valca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monica,</hi> a Valley of <hi>Breskiano,</hi> which joynes upon the <hi>Valteline,</hi> under the command of <hi>Martin de Molino,</hi> a Gentleman of great wit and knowledge; and moreover, their Forts were all well provided, with Men and Ammunition, with chiefe Commanders and Senators, who if they should have declared themselves for the <hi>French,</hi> the wisest men were firme of opinion, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves very well knew, the state of <hi>Milan</hi> would be subject to the discretion of the <hi>French,</hi> or to the Republique of the state of <hi>Venice.</hi> Yet were all these suspitions ill-grounded; for though the <hi>Venetians</hi> might easily enough have done this, yet the object of the famous Republique and of those most wise Senators, aiming onely at the common peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the preservation of their owne flourishing Dominion, so opportune an occasion was not sufficient to make them alter their worthily propounded end. Nay, they would have their Ministers of State to indeavour somewhat to divert the breach of those two Crownes, and by them to remit <hi>Italy</hi> into its former quiet, whereby all Christendome would be advantaged.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was this meane while returned to <hi>Tirano</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh his men, who were wearied by their being continually kept in action in that Valley; where he understood, how that the <hi>Dutch</hi> which he had routed in the Valley of <hi>Levin,</hi> being got together again, by the arrivall of some Troopes from <hi>Tiroll,</hi> were very strong in <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio</hi>; and that it was given out they would fall lower, and try their fortunes with the <hi>French</hi> againe, to which purpose they were come to <hi>Mazzo,</hi> a Village neere the <hi>Ada,</hi> betweene <hi>Bormio</hi> and <hi>Tirano.</hi> He therefore resolved to encounter them, and to make use of Fortune which shewed her selfe favourable unto him. Having therefore mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered his men, which might amount to 4000 Foot and 300 Horse, he marched thitherward in sight of the Enemies Sentinells; but the <hi>Imperiallists,</hi> keeping themselves neere a Towne called <hi>Grossotto,</hi> upon the <hi>Ada,</hi> in a place of great advantage, and the <hi>French</hi> not thinking that a fitting place to fall upon the Enemy, <hi>Rohan,</hi> that he might draw them off from that advantagious seat, seemed as if he feared them,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55221:161"/>
and wheeling about, made as if he fled to <hi>Cologno,</hi> a little Village a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Tirano.</hi> Here possessing himselfe of the most adequat place, he ordered a great ambush in certaine little Woods neere at hand, and staid, expecting the Enemy, who being inheartned by the <hi>French-mens</hi> retreat, and not beleeving them to be in a condition able to resist them, they with this confidence passe over the <hi>Ada</hi> at <hi>Mazzo</hi> Bridge, and flew eagerly upon the <hi>French</hi> Troopes, crying out, that now they would revenge themselves for their former rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. But <hi>Rohan</hi> dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously drawing them neere the ambush, did unexpectedly salute them with a thick volley of Musquet-shot, and facing about, set so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously upon them with his fresh Battaglions, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> astonished at the accident, thought to retreat by the same way they came, and so betooke themselves to flight, wherein they left above 700 of their men slaine, and prisoners; and if the two Colonells, <hi>Pracher</hi> and <hi>Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasso,</hi> whom <hi>Rohan</hi> had sent on the other side to breake the Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Ada,</hi> had made a little more hast, few of the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> would have boasted of safetie. <hi>Rohan</hi> did not much value this happy incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unlesse he might thereby recover <hi>Bormio</hi> and the <hi>Bathes</hi>; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling together his Chiefe Commanders, and treating with them how to effect this his desire, it was resolved, (wherein Colonell <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesin,</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> who had then the Van, proffered his service) to undertake that enterprise; and he incouraged by <hi>Rohan,</hi> advanced so boldly towards the Walls of the Town, as though the ascent, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Cliffs, was difficult, and above 300 paces long, blockt up by three barricadoes well defended, he by maine force entred the Towne, putting all he met with at his first entrance to the Sword; And from thence, advancing towards the <hi>Bathes,</hi> a place guarded by 200 <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot, he likewise tooke it, though all industry and milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valour was used to keepe him from doing so, by a Serjeant Major who commanded there in chiefe; a Victory which proved notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing wofull, by reason of the death of the said Colonell <hi>Montesin,</hi> (wounded unfortunately by a Stone which fell from a woman out of a window) and of above 105 other <hi>French-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was of great consequence to the <hi>Hollanders</hi>; that <hi>Skinck-Sconce</hi> should remaine in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands; and wisely sore seeing, that if it were not regained, it would (as affaires now stood) be very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to all those Provinces, they indeavoured by all art and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary industry to win it; the defenders whereof fought obstinately, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> indeavours were desperate, insomuch as every day the flower of all the Souldiery was lost on both side.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who was not onely reconciled to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but had joyned his Forces with the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Commanders, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that his Treaties of Peace with the <hi>Swedes</hi> (though held in hand with some hopes by <hi>Bannier,</hi> who did it that he might winne time, and fortifie <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and furnish it with all things necessary, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place at that time of the greatest importance to the <hi>Swedish</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) were in effect deluded, resolved to remove his Campe, and set upon <hi>Hall</hi> upon the <hi>Sala,</hi> a place which being wonne, would facilitate the taking of <hi>Magdeburg</hi>; he therefore marched against the Towne,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55221:161"/>
which wanting Rampiers sufficient to withstand the Cannon, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled, and yeelded; and the <hi>Swedes</hi> that were of the Garrison forsooke the Towne, and retired to the Castle, a place somewhat fitter for resistance, that they might preserve themselves there, till the succour which they expected from <hi>Bannier</hi> should come unto them.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Valenza</hi> was bravely maintained by the defendants, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did little feare the bare <hi>French</hi> Forces, yet the almost certaine feare they had, that the Forces of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and of <hi>Parma</hi> should joyne with them, or that they should set upon the state in some other part, had no little reflection upon their thoughts; for they plainly saw, that when they should declare open enmitie against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it would be hard for them in such an emergency to make good all places. Therefore to boot with all other Provisions had, Marquis <hi>Lunatt,</hi> Master of the Campe, was sent into <hi>Alessandria</hi> to assist <hi>Colombo,</hi> together with the Senator <hi>Arios,</hi> Commissary of the Army Royall. Every one was permitted to beare all manner of Armes save Pistolls. Prince <hi>Trivultio,</hi> indeavouring to rayse a Bri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gade of Foot at his owne charges, made Colonell <hi>Carlo Mariani</hi> Campe-Master thereof. <hi>Colombo</hi> readily prevented a Treachery which was discovered in <hi>Alessandria,</hi> and detained the guiltie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which was one <hi>Don Diego</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and a servant of his, and Ensigne <hi>Gagni Alessandrino.</hi> Nothing was omitted that was thought behoofefull to obviate the imminent danger; and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the secret intelligence held with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was brought to a narrow compasse, and somewhat of unknowne was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by the Duke in favour of the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>

was in; and where he was wounded in the thigh with a Musquet-shot, which had well-nigh cost him his life. He was a Gentleman of a comely presence, of a tall stature, of a pleasing aspect, and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously spoken; In briefe, the expectation which his worthy indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did promise, is able to draw teares from any ones eyes that makes account of gallant men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gustavenberg,</hi> a Towne built by the King of <hi>Swethland</hi> (out of some great designe) over against <hi>Mentz,</hi> as hath beene said, was this meane while straightly besieged; &amp; being brought to great extremitie, <hi>Waymer</hi> not being able to succour it, who was gon to that purpose with his men to <hi>Mentz,</hi> was at last inforced to yeeld to the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> the <hi>Swedish</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison marching out, which were 1200 Foot, with their Bagge and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage: Whereupon <hi>Waymer</hi> fayling in his designe, and fearing to be invironed by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> who having past the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> came even to the gates of <hi>Mentz,</hi> resolved to retreat to <hi>Cruntzenach,</hi> which he did in great hast. He was followed notwithstanding by the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Horse, who setting upon his Reare, which skirmishing gallantly, kept the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarians</hi> off; yet being overtaken by fresh Troops, they were inforced in much hast to betake them to their heeles, wherein their Squadrons, which with much adoe got under the Walls of <hi>Cruntzenach,</hi> did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what suffer.</p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Gustavenberg,</hi> and <hi>Waymers</hi> retreat from <hi>Mentz,</hi> did so much inhearten the <hi>Austrians,</hi> as they bethought themselves to make some inrodes from <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> The Crabats, out of hope of bootie, which is the true bait that intices Souldiers on, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those of that Nation) and perswaded of good successe, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Picardy,</hi> and to the no little prejudice of those Townes and Villages, many of which they sack't and burnt, they past a good way in. At which, the King of <hi>France</hi> being highly offended, and sending readily many <hi>French</hi> Foot and Horse towards them, who cut downe the bridge of <hi>Some,</hi> betweene <hi>Abaville</hi> and <hi>Amiens,</hi> they were inforced to face about, and to retreat upon a round gallop to their former quarters, with no little losse and suffering; many of them being slaine by the <hi>French,</hi> and their Baggage lost.</p>
            <p>Mounsieur <hi>De Belieure,</hi> the extraordinary Embassadour of <hi>France,</hi> sent by the King to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> having received his dispatch, went to <hi>Genua</hi>; where having agreed with that Re-publique to keepe a perfect good intelligence with the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> (as those Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators seemed to pretend to doe in this Warre) and having taken his leave of that Senate (with satisfaction to the <hi>French,</hi> and no small jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie to the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) he came to <hi>Parma</hi> about the midst of <hi>August,</hi> where he had audience by the Duke,<note place="margin">

               </note> and with mightie promises and hopes inheartned him to keepe friendship with his Majestie, and to joyne his Forces with <hi>Crequi</hi>; and having received signes from him of probable good inclination to the King, he departed well satisfied; when he came to <hi>Mantua,</hi> he staid some dayes with Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing upon the present affaires, and exhorting him to continue in his devotion to his King. And because one of the <hi>French-mens</hi> chiefe foundations in this Warre, was to divert the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces led on
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55221:164"/>
under-hand by the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> or publiquely declared by the Re-publique it selfe, against the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> out of inlarging their Confines, he treated with his Highnesse to rayse men in <hi>Italy</hi> in his Majesties name, to which purpose Mony should be sent him to raise a body of an Army in that Dukedome, wherewithall hee might at least make jealous the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Cremona,</hi> if it should not bee thought fitting publiquely to declare himselfe; which offer the Duke would have accepted, as it was thought, being inclined to Armes, and no lesse to monies, if he had believed the Mony would have been sent him, and that the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Pope would have assisted him, in procuring of Men, Victuals, and Ammunition, in their flourishing dominions, without which he could not possibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake such an imployment; From thence hee came about the end of <hi>August</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> to move that Republicke to breake with <hi>Spaine,</hi> and assist <hi>France</hi>; upon which the <hi>French</hi> not without reason built very great hopes; for if that State should have declared it selfe, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would certainly have lost <hi>Milan.</hi> But because that wise and pious Senat intended not the perturbation, but preservation, of the publicke quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Embassadour had civill audience, was magnificently received, with such decorum as is usually practized by that splendid Republick to those who represent so great a King; but carried no answer away save words full of courtesie, and such as tended to the publicke quiet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> this meane while did straightly beset <hi>Valenza,</hi> and plaid upon it on all sides; and <hi>Crequi,</hi> who thought he had brought it to an ill passe, summoned the Towne, threatning fire and Sword if it would not yeeld, yet did these words little availe to abate the <hi>Spaniards</hi> daring, who more couragious then ever, answered the Trumpeter that brought the summons, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> used not to surrender any place for threats; that they could not give way to bravadoes; that the <hi>French</hi> should doe well instead of words to use deeds, wherein they should be answered; and should be taught that the Governour of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenza</hi> had learnt from his Ancestors, that threats never prevaile with well-borne Gentlemen. At the time of this summons, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who knew it was requisite to bring them speedy and opportune suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, before the <hi>French</hi> should have possest themselves of their out-Workes, to the preservation whereof good numbers of men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit, and that the losse of them would bee very prejudiciall to the Towne, and much impede the succouring thereof, resolved to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and resolutely to indeavour the bringing in of men. <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Colombo</hi> was therefore commanded to march thitherward, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to seat himselfe in <hi>Frescarolo</hi> about two miles from <hi>Valenza,</hi> who comming with 4000 Foot and 10 Companies of Horse on the seventh of <hi>October</hi> to <hi>Pieue del Cairo,</hi>

cast downe by the miscarrying of their enterprise, whereby they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much in honour, were not yet growne so confident, as to venter upon another which was uncertaine, and dangerous. And the good which they had promised unto themselves, appeared much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely; for the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the originall of all their mischiefe, not liking that they should get footing in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> did so craftily behave himselfe, and was so well able to cloake his feigned intent, as the <hi>French,</hi> who trust more to their Sword then to their judgement, not aware of his cunning, threatned much, but did little. 'Twas afterwards suspected that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was contented <hi>Valenza</hi> should be relieved; for hee finding all <hi>Crequies</hi> formerly said instances quite contrary to what hee expected, was not very well pleased, but beginning to doubt, 'twas said he made his complaints to <hi>Crequi,</hi> foreseeing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being victorious in their defence, might undertake some-what to his prejudice.</p>
            <p>The raising of the Siege from before <hi>Valenza</hi> caused much mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure between the <hi>French</hi> chiefe Commanders, and the other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, in their argumentations what had inforced them thereunto. Some openly complained of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as the authour and abettor thereof; others blamed <hi>Crequi,</hi> saying he cared not to end the worke, but onely that the Warre should bee prolonged for his owne interest; and others accused the <hi>French</hi> Commanders in generall, for that (not caring how their Companies diminished,) they little minded the preservation of their Souldiers; so as their Army lessening, and the <hi>Spania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this confusion of the Colleagues, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hopes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bud againe, which were well-nigh withered out of feare of losing that Towne: Though <hi>Celada's</hi> death who died within the Town of a malignant Feaver much lessened the contentment which every one had in the victory; for this young Gentleman had upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion given such proofe of his worth, as had filled all men with much expectation from him. After having returned thankes to God, with great demonstration of joy, they thought that since the <hi>French</hi> had failed in their taking of <hi>Valenza</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they should be prosperous in their intended purpose of driving <hi>Rohan</hi> out of the <hi>Valteline.</hi> Egg'd on therefore by this desire, which usually accompanies hope, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved thereupon.</p>
            <p>The enterprise was therefore agreed upon with <hi>Serbellone,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustelli,</hi> one of the chiefe men of that valley, and who depended upon <hi>Spaine,</hi> both which being ambitious to have their share in so great glory, were too lavish in their counsells, and reasons, and coveted by whatsoever meanes to free the afflicted valley, and drive out the <hi>French</hi> who were already dejected by their compagnions retreat from <hi>Valenza.</hi> All such Souldiers and Provisions as were thought requisite for such a businesse, were sent therfore away towards Fort <hi>Fuentes.</hi> But because <hi>Rohan</hi> was then at <hi>Tirano,</hi> about the building of a Fort there for his keeping of that valley, <hi>Serbellone</hi> wisely, as became a good and

experienced Souldier, would first be informed in what condition the <hi>French</hi> Army was in, and what they did, before he would advance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hee therefore sent a friend of <hi>Robustelli's</hi> from <hi>Morbegno</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward, that hee might discover and accordingly advertise them what the Enemy did, that so they might governe themselves as they should see occasion. This man, when he came to <hi>Tirano,</hi> at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in at the Gate, were it either by his pale lookes, or by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine answers he gave unto the Guard, who according to the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary fashion, asked him whence he came, and whether hee went, was laid hand of, and brought to <hi>Rohan</hi>; who like a wise man, after having very curteously received him, said unto him, My friend, I know wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are come hither, conceale therefore nothing, but tell the truth, which if you doe, I promise you not onely to save your life, but to send you safe backe whence you came. He not knowing how to answer to such questions, as one convinc'd, kneeling downe, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with all the affaire, and with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> designe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon imbracing the present occasion, which he thought very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and not to lose time, he called his Commanders and chiefe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers together, and acquainting them with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> designe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them all by calling to minde their past victories, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in hopes of more: which seemed like a flash of fire, that had made its way through some inclosed place; for all doubt and fear of the enemy vanishing immediately from out the hearts of those Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he speedily marched towards <hi>Sondrio,</hi> a Town in the midst of that valley, whether he came before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew that hee was gone from <hi>Tirano,</hi> where having refresht his men, who lay all night in the fields, (for he would not suffer them to come into the Towne, for the gaining of time) and being advertised that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Cannon was not yet parted from <hi>Delibio,</hi> a place between the Lake and the River <hi>Lesina</hi> beneath Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> nor yet the Souldiers who were there to guard them, hee advised with his Councell of Warre, what was best to be done, who all joyned in opinion, to advance forward, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay to set upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were about <hi>Morbegno. Serbellone</hi> hearing of the <hi>French-mens</hi> approach would not give one foot backe, but in all haste made the Count S. <hi>Secondo</hi> advance with his Horse on the right hand unto the foot of a Mountaine, behinde a little Church dedicated to S. <hi>Peter; Trivultio's</hi> Brigado placed it self towards the <hi>Ada,</hi> having the advantage of a little Fenne, not farre from the said Church; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> staid in the Reere upon the plaine of the Parish of <hi>Morbegno. Rohan</hi> advancing by the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian of <hi>Talemona,</hi> made Monsieur <hi>de Vandy's</hi> Regiment march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to possesse himselfe of <hi>Bit</hi> Bridge, but not comming time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he found the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had prevented him. <hi>Rohan</hi> finding these difficulties, resolved to make his Horse advance, wherin he trusted most; but the straightnesse of the place, and narrow wayes, would not suffer him so to doe: wherefore fearing lest they might fall upon some Ambush, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them to retreat, &amp; made Monsieur <hi>de Lecas</hi> his men to advance, which was composed of new men. He was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing fought withall by the <hi>Italians,</hi> and with no little losse to the <hi>French</hi> repulsed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:55221:166"/>
               <hi>Rohan</hi> being hereat mightily incenst, marcht himselfe in person in the head of <hi>Frideliera's</hi> Regiment, and gave upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who with equall valour withstood their fury; after an houres very hot ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and wherein they fought Sword to Sword, the <hi>French-men</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with great obstinacy, at whose head stood 100 Souldiers lighted from off their Horses, <hi>Trivulsio's</hi> Regiment was at last forc't to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe the Fenne, and consequently to retreat, which being confusedly done by those Souldiers, the greatest part of them being new men, who had never seene the face of an Enemy before, as the other <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> had usually done, they fled from the <hi>French,</hi> and lost many of their Souldiers and Officers of importance, and amongst others the Count S. <hi>Secondo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This losse made the <hi>Austrians</hi> perceive how the difficultie of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Valteline</hi> grew every day greater and greater: Yea, after <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellone</hi> was routed, a body of <hi>Dutch</hi> advancing towards the Bathes of <hi>Bormio,</hi> so to enter the Valley, was likewise routed and driven backe. Hereupon, they bethought themselves how they might bring the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours aide into the state of <hi>Milan</hi>; And lastly, knowing no other way but by the <hi>Switzers,</hi> they communicated their desires to the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> and other Papists <hi>Cantons,</hi> with promise of good store of money, who allured by profit, suffered them to passe through their Townes; Thus by their dexterious behaviour, did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come those difficulties by their moneys, which they could not so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have done by their Sword. The great Duke of <hi>Tuskany</hi> likewise, who was very affectionate to the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> to boot with the Brigado of Foot, which he raysed at his owne costs in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> did upon this occasion likewise assist the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> with 300 Horse under the command of Marquis <hi>Cosimo Richardi</hi>: Whereupon <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viere</hi> leaving <hi>Venice,</hi> came to <hi>Florence,</hi> not out of any intention to make the great Duke side with the Crowne of <hi>France</hi>; but at least to moderate the evill opinion which the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of that Crowne, by reason of the <hi>French-mens</hi> falling into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to keepe the great Duke, as much as possibly he could, from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the <hi>Spaniards</hi>: And because the opinion grew stronger every day, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> held secret intelligence with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> 'tis said, that to moderate in some sort this report, the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Agents held it fit to dismisse the Abbot <hi>Torre,</hi> who was the Duke of <hi>Savoyes</hi> Embassadour from <hi>Milan,</hi> under pretence, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the breach made by his Master against the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> it was not fitting a Minister of his should keep with those, against whom he had declared himselfe an open Enemy.</p>
            <p>At this time, <hi>Don Franchesco di Mello,</hi> a man of great esteeme, sent as extraordinary Embassadour from <hi>Spaine</hi> to the Emperour, tooke <hi>Milan</hi> in his way, and staid there, it being reported, he was to have beene made Governour thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> this meane while, building very much upon the Duke of <hi>Modena's</hi> declaring himselfe for them, as well for the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance they might expect from that Prince of warlike people, as for the credit of being reverenced by such an <hi>Italian</hi> Potentate, not respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting

            <p>The Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> having after some dayes stout defence made by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> taken the Castle of <hi>Hall,</hi> knew it was requisite for him to joyne with the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Troopes, who were then in good numbers about <hi>Franckfort</hi> upon the <hi>Oder,</hi> that they might joyntly invade those Townes which were by them pretended unto, and were held, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said them by the <hi>Swedes.</hi> He therefore marched towards <hi>Berlin,</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Brandenberg</hi> upon the <hi>Hault,</hi> where the <hi>Swedes</hi> were, who were much grieved at the uniting of those Forces, as making much against that which they intended; and being hereof advertised, <hi>Bannier</hi> thought it expedient to remove from thence.

            <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> was much troubled with this Hostility betweene the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> who confining upon them both, if he should declare himselfe for either side, he should bring the Warre home to his owne doores.

            <p>The <hi>French-men,</hi> fayling in their intentions of taking <hi>Valenza,</hi> which for the reasons formerly alledged they much desired; &amp; seeing that the numbers of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did dayly increase in the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> by the assistance of other Princes their friends, for now the <hi>Dutch</hi> began to march towards them under the command of Prince <hi>Borso</hi> of <hi>Este,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Giledas,</hi> together with other <hi>Switzers,</hi> to boot with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Foot that were raysed in the state of <hi>Modena,</hi> and in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and those that every day were landed from <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> thought it fitting to ease the quarters of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> (which began to be very

burthensome to those people) by sending backe the Duke of <hi>Parma's</hi> Forces into their owne Countrey.

            <p>On the other side the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was joyned with the Forces of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> and some other <hi>Dutch</hi> Regiments, which were come to serve him, by reason of the <hi>Swedes</hi> ill usage of them; the chiefe Commanders whereof appropriating unto themselves such contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions as they got from the Countries through which they past, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving these men to pay themselves out of the advancements due from the Townes which they had ruinated, and were forsaken by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, whereupon they became so insolent and licentious, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having themselves without any manner of discipline, they had the boldnesse to plunder and sacke their friends Townes; and flying from their Colours, came in great numbers to inrole themselves, under the Elector and <hi>Imperialists.</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> being thus recruited marched into the field, to oppose the inrodes of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> (who keeping in the State of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> did much infest those Towns which joyned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Saxony</hi>) and putting some of their Regiments to flight, they slew many of them, and tooke 7 Ensignes. <hi>Bannier</hi> being hereof adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised who was reinforced about <hi>Lunenburg</hi> with 4000 Souldiers

               <hi>Hannaw</hi> was likewise at this time streightly besieged by the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists,</hi> a strong hold, fortified after the moderne fashion, and seated upon the River <hi>Brints,</hi> which taking its head from <hi>Franconia</hi> fals into the <hi>Mayne</hi> before <hi>Franckfort.</hi> Colonell <hi>Vistum</hi> did herein command in Chiefe, one of the bravest Commanders the <hi>Swedes</hi> had, who having a stout Garrison, made frequent Sallies, wherewith he much troubled the Marquis of <hi>Grana,</hi> and <hi>Lamboi,</hi> who were the chiefe leaders of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Camp.</p>
            <p>News being come to the Court of <hi>France</hi> of their countrymens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from before <hi>Valenza,</hi> and how little good their Commanders had yet done, they took speedy advice about such things as they thought most fitting to continue the Warre in <hi>Italy,</hi> and somewhat to salve their losse of reputation. It was therefore foreseen, and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made appeare by the wiser sort, that little was to be hoped for in that Province, whilest they were not really and effectually assisted by other Potentates; or else, unlesse the King himselfe should march thither in person with a powerfull Army: For the <hi>French</hi> have no great desire to make Warre in <hi>Italy,</hi> which they call their Grave, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, as of 20000 Foot which came from <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> hardly 10000 came into <hi>Piemont</hi>; of which whole Squadrons fled daily away, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereunto out of the impatiency the <hi>French-men</hi> have of seeing <hi>Rome, Venice,</hi> and other Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they stay, lay downe their Armes, and betake themselves to such Trades as they formerly used in <hi>France</hi>; whereby the <hi>French</hi> Companies were so much lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as that their Captaines not daring to acquaint the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, (were it either out of shame, or for their privat gaine by the receiving of dead pay,) excused their delay, by invented difficulties: Whence it was, that thus to set upon an estate, full of strong holds, and having good Forces in the fields, was but a losse of men and time; And the King not being able to goe out of his Kingdome by reason of the great interests of the Crowne, or rather, as it was said by others, lest he might hazard that reputation and glory, which with the universall applause of Christendome and of the whole World he had wonne, when he freed the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> from evident <hi>Spanish</hi> subjection; it behoved either to quit the enterprise, or else to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to conclude a friendship and union with some such Potentate, as might be able to set upon that State in some other part, that by such a diversion the way might be opened to their desired proceedings. This Counsell though it were the most proper, and that which at their first taking up Armes was imbraced, yet was it not thought sufficiently effectuall. For those who cleerly saw the reason, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of States, argued by what was past, that the <hi>Italians</hi> more hated the neighbourhood of the <hi>French,</hi> then of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they being naturally more inclined to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by reason of their sympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55221:169"/>
in language, and gravity with them, then to the others, who much differ from them, both in customes, and vivacity of spirit. Yet building upon the opinion, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ill thought of, as those who being potent in <hi>Italy,</hi> doe infinitely desire to inlarge the bounds of their Monarchy; That they had beene the cause of so much ruine in <hi>Italy,</hi> as was witnessed by the fresh memory of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> they perswaded themselves, that particular hatred was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in some sort to obfuscat that wisedome, through which Princes regard not the memory of any thing that is past, that so they may be the more intent to the present interest of their State.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was in this interim, not well satisfied with those chiefe Agents, who had the government of the <hi>French</hi> Forces in <hi>Italy</hi>; who gave little appearance of concurring in advice with his Highnesse, keeping their men quartered in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> when both time and occasion required they should have beene imployed about the common interest, before such time as further Forces should bee brought into the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> as was expected from <hi>Spaine, Naples, Germany</hi> and elsewhere; and whereof some <hi>Dutch</hi> Troopes did already appeare, who were received upon the Confines by Signior <hi>Alexander Visconti,</hi> sent thither to that purpose from <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke foresaw, that through the Commanders negligence, who minded nothing but their owne profit, the Warre was at last to fall wholly upon his Country, which lay open for the <hi>Spanish</hi> invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But he was also comforted by hopes of receiving fresh aide from the King of France, and that hee himselfe should have the chiefe command of the Warre. A businesse which if it had succeeded, as it was wisely advised, the <hi>French</hi> might have hoped for better successe then they hitherto had. For the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> being a sprightly Prince, and of high thoughts, would have carried on the Warre with courage and ingenuity, and being sufficiently ill minded towards the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> would not have let slip such occasions as should have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely presented themselves, keeping his Companies compleat, and behaving himselfe like a generous Commander. And when the <hi>Milanesses</hi> should have seene such a Prince in the field, who can tell but that believing hee might prove another <hi>Lodowick,</hi> they would not have been so faithfull unto the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as now they seemed to bee, for feare of falling in subjection to the <hi>French.</hi> And this was thought by witty men, the best course the <hi>French</hi> could have taken; for when they should have appeared not to have beene any wayes interessed themselves, and that their onely end had beene to have driven out the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to have reduced that Dukedome under the Scepter of an <hi>Italian</hi> Prince, those who were subjects unto <hi>Spaine</hi> would have been glad thereof, so to have been eased from the government of strangers and the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> hoping to better their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by expelling the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and particularly by their dividing the State of <hi>Milan</hi> amongst them, they would have heartily fomented the worke; but strangers being to be exchanged for strangers, and an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited power as was then that of <hi>France,</hi> being to be drawne neere them, 'twas better for them to continue the State of <hi>Milan</hi> in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>

hands, whose Territories are farre off, and disjoyned. For to compose an Army fit to defend on one part, and to offend the State on another, much Mony and time would be required, and the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and their other States would be thereby much burthened, a businesse of so great consideration, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have very well bethought themselves of the end before they would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken such a Warre, and peradventure never have done it, till first they should have driven the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Montferrat</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> and so have hindered them from succouring of such Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> as should be by them opprest, wherefore neither did the Souldiers, nor any of the adjoyning neighbours like of such a change; and the rather, for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were more quiet neighbours then the <hi>French</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> resolved therefore to go to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> where he was received by the King with all beseeming pomp, graciously looked upon, and better treated.</p>
            <p>Marquis <hi>Villa,</hi> who during the Duke of <hi>Parma's</hi> absence, kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the abovesaid <hi>Savoy</hi>-Horse upon the <hi>Piacenzan</hi> Territories, being advertised that the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> did still ingage himselfe in further friendship to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that he furnished them with all things necessary out of his owne State, thinking it now no longer time to keep idle in his quarters, resolved upon some enterprise; and under pretence of remitting the Prince of <hi>Correggio</hi> into his estate, (who in the former Warres of <hi>Mantua,</hi> being accused by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian</hi> Agents of coyning false Monies, and extortion, was banished) to over-run the Country of <hi>Modena,</hi> and thereby indeavour to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> from his inwardnesse with <hi>Spaine,</hi> or rather to perswade him to joyne in league with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the other Colleagues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which could he have done, as he had small reason to imagine, (for that wise Prince minded not to interest himselfe foolishly in a Warre, whereby he could promise nothing to himselfe but the ruine of his State) it would have been so usefull a diversion for the <hi>French</hi> Forces, as they might easily have obtained their desired ends.</p>
            <p>Departing from his quarters, he so opportunely, and so unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly came upon the Territories of <hi>Modena,</hi> as that the Duke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and his Commanders dreaming of nothing lesse, afforded the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards</hi> opportunity to over-run some Townes of <hi>Rugio,</hi> and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>English</hi> thought the present conjuncture of time favourable for them to get the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> by reason of the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ruptures of these two Crownes for many yeares agitated with War; and undoubtedly hoping, that upon these emergencies the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strians</hi> would be very glad to keepe good intelligence with that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and rather indeavour their friendship by giving them satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then againe to render them distrustfull. Whereupon, as it is usuall to grant those things for need upon poore conditions, which in times of prosperitie were held in great esteeme, the <hi>English</hi> thinking that now they might easily obtaine the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> from the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> which had formerly beene denyed them, sent an extraordinary Embassadour to <hi>Vienna</hi> to obtaine it from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; who being come thither, and having made knowne his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, was by outward appearance more welcomed then formerly; as well in respect, that it is usuall to make much of such a Princes Ministers of State, so farre as good may be hoped from them; as likewise to cause the greater jealousie in the <hi>French.</hi> The negotiation hereof was committed to Monsieur <hi>Vicario,</hi> the Counts <hi>Mecaw,</hi> and <hi>Trantmistorfe,</hi> and to the Baron <hi>Stralendorph,</hi> the chiefe Officers of the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Crowne; and after many meetings and consultations had upon the businesse, <hi>Caesars</hi> good inclination thereunto was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by respect of the satisfaction that was to be given to <hi>Bavaria, England</hi> not being to be satisfied without the prejudice of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> they ought to set the greater value upon the Dukes friendship, by how much they knew the re-granting of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> advantagious to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55221:171"/>
the <hi>English</hi>; for it was not now time to make an uncertaine corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency with a Forraigne and farre distant Prince, thereby to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the certaine friendship of one who had alwayes deserved well of, and beene faithfull to the Emperour; and who being Master of a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Countrey, a considerable Exchequer, and a no despicable Army, if he should quit his Confederacy with the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and joyne himselfe with the <hi>French,</hi> (who failed not to indeavour it, by all the skill they had) the ruine was apparent which would thereby have fallen upon the Empire. Therefore the Propositions and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers were long held in hand, with such dexteritie as Princes use in businesses, whereunto they wish no good conclusion; so as the negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved abortive.</p>
            <p>The Emperour foreseeing the importance of the Warre with <hi>France,</hi> that he might as well preserve the Princes and Potentates of <hi>Italy</hi> well inclined towards him, and keepe them from holding any prejudiciall correspondency with the <hi>French,</hi> as likewise to procure from them some succour, if not of men nor money, yet of minds well disposed towards his affaires, he gave the charge hereof to <hi>Crast,</hi> one of his Court-Counsellours; who parting from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Venice,</hi> after having with all tearmes of courtesie and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confidence (but as was rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were now become strong and numerous in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> for to boot with the Horse and Foot sent to them from the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi>; there were likewise arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 8 of <hi>Gileda's</hi> his Companies, 6 Companies of Foot belonging to Colonell <hi>Lunardi,</hi> 10 of Horse to the Count <hi>De Slich,</hi> and other 10 of Dragoones to Colonell <hi>Girone,</hi> thinking it now time to move some whither, resolved to doe somewhat in recompence of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilitie used in the Countrey of <hi>Regio,</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> by the <hi>Savoyards</hi> and those of <hi>Parma</hi>; They therefore entred upon the <hi>Piacenzan</hi> Territories, set upon and tooke S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Castle, which suddenly yeelded, by reason of the flow advance of succour which came not time enough, though it were sent by Marquis <hi>Villa.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Towne being lost, retreated, which they could not so suddenly doe, but that being followed by those of <hi>Modena,</hi> they suffered some losse in the skirmish, which certainly would have beene greater, had not the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought this their retreat a strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to draw them into an ambush, so as they ceased from further pursuing them, and retreated to S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Castle; where, leaving a Garrison of 700 <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot, <hi>Gambaccorta,</hi> the Governour of the

            <p>The Pope and great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> who were not a little grieved at the troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> and in particular at the falling out betweene <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> from which they saw much of incommodity might in time ensue to their States, for this was a businesse wherein they were likely to be interessed both, the one for the one, the other for the other party, resolved to indeavour an agreement between them before businesses should be growne to a greater hight.

            <p>On the other side the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perceived there was no better way to bring the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to their devotion, then to reduce him to a necessity of being succoured by the <hi>French,</hi> upon the confidence whereof he had declared himselfe. For when he should see that their words, and their deeds did not correspond, (as they were confident they would not) he would have just cause to provide for his own safety; And they likewise knew, that to succour <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and to withstand the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces which were about <hi>Montferrat,</hi> it would be requisite
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55221:172"/>
for them to have a very great Army, of which there was but little likelihood, for the <hi>French</hi> came unwillingly into <hi>Italy,</hi> and the few that were there every day ran away, and their Commanders minded more their owne preservation, and their making good cheer in <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> then the winning of another Country, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in it so many and so great incommodities, &amp; difficulties.

Advancing further they lodged in the Townes of Count Saint <hi>Secundo,</hi> giving out that they did it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the heirs of that Count into their Territories, their father having lost his life in the businesse of the <hi>Valteline</hi> in the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In all which they prospered and met with no lets, there being no Souldiers to oppose them; for little lesse then their whole Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia was in <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and retreated into their strong places, to keep themselves safe till the arrivall of the promised succour from <hi>France.</hi> And <hi>Villa,</hi> who kept still about <hi>Piacenza,</hi> durst not come forth of his quarters with those few men he had, as not able to oppose the <hi>Spaniards.

The Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Townes thereabouts were sackt without any obstacle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not being yet joyned, came not time enough to succour them; <hi>Gamba Corta</hi> was therefore sent against them with a good party of Horse, and a considerable strength of Foot; who meeting with the <hi>French,</hi> skirmished some houres with them, where at last it behoved the <hi>French</hi> to retreat with some losse of Horse, by which good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the grosse Body of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about <hi>Biagras</hi> advanced, and made the <hi>French</hi> abandon <hi>Vespola,</hi> where the most part of their Forces were, and to retreat on the other side the <hi>Goyna,</hi> to <hi>Satirano</hi> and <hi>Bremo.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>French</hi> failing in their hopes to remove the Warre from <hi>Parma,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> continued the taking of Townes and Castles in that State, to the great prejudice of the Inhabitants, who were forced to fly, and forsake their houses, by reason of out-rages committed by the <hi>Dutch</hi>; the which the <hi>Dutch</hi> affirmed they did to retaliate the barbarismes committed by the Country-people against some of their Souldiers, who were found nailed to Trees. Miserable was the condition of this Province, and the behaviour of those of <hi>Regio</hi> unexcusable; yet when it came to the knowledge of the prime Officers, who were desirous to remedy such abuses, the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> by publick edicts and threats, forbad the Souldiers to commit any insolencies, or extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon the Country-people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:55221:172"/>The <hi>Swedes</hi> Forces were at this time quiet; for <hi>Bannier</hi> having reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Army to <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and quartered it in that Bishopricke, attended the recruiting and refreshing thereof, that afterwards hee might undertake some action; and the Elector kept likewise in his quarters, to prepare for the taking of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> a place of great concernment for him, being seated in the very middle of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and an important Passage; when on this side in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> the <hi>Imperialists</hi> knowing how little good they could doe in <hi>Lorayne,</hi> (which was well guarded by the <hi>French</hi>) and their want of Forrage, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals increasing daily, resolved to make <hi>Wert</hi> goe with his Forces from about <hi>Ramberviller,</hi> and to passe into <hi>Flanders,</hi> which Province was greatly threatned, by a powerfull <hi>French</hi> Army that was in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,</hi> and no lesse by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who instigated and fomented by the <hi>French,</hi> made considerable preparations to appeare in the field, and to doe some famous act. <hi>Wert</hi> comming into <hi>Lucemburg,</hi> and desirous to quarter his Souldiers in the Territories of <hi>Leidge,</hi> hee was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to doe so by order from the Magistrate thereof. At which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scandalized, and having caused some Country-people to be put to death, who would oppose him with weapons in their hand, those Citizens mightily incenst thereat, and becomming the bolder, for that the <hi>French</hi> Forces were not farre off, from whom they might hope for assistance and protection, they presently tooke up Armes, and sent 5000 Souldiers with some Cannon against <hi>Wert,</hi> declaring themselves for the <hi>French,</hi> protesting much, and making great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to the Court of <hi>Brussells.</hi> But this breach though it held for some dayes was afterwards accommodated; for the <hi>Imperialists</hi> having past the <hi>Mosa,</hi> and joyned with <hi>Picolominy,</hi> who was likewise in <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> ready to succour <hi>Flanders,</hi> it behoved them to retire into their City; which seeing it selfe beset on all sides, its Territories ruined, and having little hope of succour from the <hi>French,</hi> as they earnestly had requested, willingly could have wisht it had not been so forward in the demonstration it had made. Yet did it not seem any wayes to recede, for the Citizens thereof knew very well, that Princes who stand in need of other mens friendships, in their affaires, know how to use such meanes as may preserve their friendships, and not exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat them; but for Sallies and providing for Defence, they did not a little perplex the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> in their indeavouring to offend the City; which injoying freedome, and being seated upon the <hi>Mosa,</hi> in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try very considerable, between <hi>Maestrickt,</hi> which was possest by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Mamure,</hi> not far distant from the Frontiers of <hi>France</hi>; being likewise full of warre-like people, it would have been very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> interest in <hi>Flanders,</hi> if, laying neutralitie aside, it should by the assistance of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it selfe an Enemy to <hi>Spaine,</hi> which had received much of emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument from thence, and in particular in their levies of the <hi>Walloons,</hi> who are esteemed the best Souldiers in their Army. Orders were therefore sent to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commanders from <hi>Brussells,</hi> that they should proceed more gently with those war-like people, there being no likelihood of any other event, but the making of them desperate,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55221:173"/>
which would be prejudiciall to the <hi>Austrian</hi> affaires. But those <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall</hi> Commanders, who were accustomed to the quarters of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> where all licentiousnesse is used; and who as <hi>Caesars</hi> Souldiers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were to be entertained in all States comprehended within the Empire, would notwithstanding use violence, by which they did so incense those people, as that preparing more and more for Warre, they by their fierce sallyes did much indammage the <hi>Austrian</hi> quarters; who being at last inforc't to goe against the <hi>French</hi> Forces, and dispairing to effect their desires, nor well seeing how they could effect them, they accorded, and left all differences to be reconciled by the Elector of <hi>Cobn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While affaires went thus, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was in <hi>Paris</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> King, by whom he was courteously and affectionately recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and being informed how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> continued upon his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and that they persisted to use hostilitie therein, he earnestly begg'd assistance from his Majestie; and having got a favourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and sure promise of ayde, he tooke his leave of the King, the Duke of <hi>Orelans,</hi> the Cardinall <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and all the other Princes, and returned post to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> that he might prepare to passe into his owne Countrey, with such <hi>French</hi> Forces as were in <hi>Piemont,</hi> who were commanded by the King to accompany him till such time as a reall succour should arrive from <hi>France</hi> as had beene promised, or that the <hi>French</hi> should make such a diversion as might cause the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> looke to defend themselves, and not to offend others. But the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> although they were advertised of all this, lingred not, knowing that if it were believed in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> that the people (for the King payd for so many) was sufficient to doe the worke, yet were they not such, nor so many as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>re sufficient: So as they probably fore-saw, that <hi>Crequi</hi> not having so great a strength, nor desirous to appeare needfull of more helpe, would feed <hi>Parma</hi> with hopes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound difficulties to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and keeping himselfe in his quarters at <hi>Montferrat,</hi> would leave the Duke to the mercy of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Therefore they more then ever renewed their hostilitie in the State of <hi>Piacenza</hi>; and making more <hi>Dutch</hi> Troopes advance, they tooke the Castle of <hi>Rottofredo,</hi> betwixt <hi>Titon</hi> and <hi>Trebbia,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Valditaro</hi> and S. <hi>Donino,</hi> and wasted all those Territories: 'twas said, their intention in doing this, was, that if the Duke should come with a <hi>French</hi> Army into his Countrey to invade the State of <hi>Milan</hi> on that side, he should find neither Forrage nor Victualls to maintain himselfe, by which meanes they should secure themselves on that side; and so much the rather, for that the <hi>French,</hi> when they should be brought to that ruined Countrey of narrow Precincts, they being a Nation who cannot well endure hunger, if at other times, and in other places they were accustomed to runne from their Commanders, they would much the more doe so here, having the commoditie to goe see <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi> And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> greatly fearing that the <hi>French</hi> upon the Duke of <hi>Parma's</hi> comming, and their Commission from the King, should rather attempt somewhat in the State of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> they sent <hi>Don Alonso de Quiranes,</hi> the Lieutenant Generall of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55221:173"/>
the Horse, with 24 companies of Horse into <hi>Novara,</hi> to watch over the <hi>French-mens</hi> wayes, and to oppose them in such sort as his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence should bid him, till such time as necessary Provisions for defence were had in the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> And because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew of what importance <hi>Rottofredo,</hi> and the Borrough of <hi>Valditaro</hi> were, by reason of their situation for the present Warre, they resolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them; for that maintaining themselves there, though the <hi>French</hi> should come to succour <hi>Piacenza,</hi> they would be able to bring them to great sufferings, and to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from advancing on that side into the States of <hi>Milan,</hi> or of <hi>Modena.</hi> And for that the keeping of good intelligence betweene the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> was very requisite in many respects, they sent <hi>Don Francisco di Mello</hi> to the greater <hi>Cassall,</hi> whither likewise the Duke came, and speaking together, 'twas said, that <hi>Mello</hi> in his Kings name did againe assure his Highnesse of his Majesties perfect good inclinations to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned him, wishing him to cast away any umbrage of feare he might have, that the <hi>French</hi> passing into the Countrey of <hi>Parma,</hi> were to lay hands on the State of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Duke of <hi>Alcana</hi> came likewise at this time to <hi>Milan,</hi> who was reported should be entertained as Governour thereof, and who was much welcomed, and in stately manner met without <hi>Pavia</hi> by <hi>Leganes, Mello,</hi> and other Cavaliers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> were as diligent as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in examining what would make most for their advantage; and of all the rest, <hi>Crequi</hi> was offended that his fame should not now mount as high as it had done in his former actions, foreseeing that if by his valour he should not make good those hopes which the Court expected from the comming of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> and the Kings commands, he should goe lesse in reputation. The <hi>French</hi> Kings chiefe Commanders and Ministers of State, being met in <hi>Cassale,</hi> such Propositions were put to be wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed, as were thought fitting by such as were more passionate then others to see the honour of the <hi>French</hi> Forces lessen; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents whereof were,
<q>That the Army being brought together, it should immediately march towards the State of <hi>Parma</hi>; &amp; that when they should have driven the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from thence, &amp; made <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55221:174"/>
were not done, the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who had readily, without any respect to his owne particular, declared himselfe for them, might lawfully make his peace with the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Whereupon, together with the losse of so important a friend, they were to suffer, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their reputation, but even in their plighted faith; for all other Princes taking example hereby, would be careful how they built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hopes from <hi>France</hi>; That the friendship of the Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Italy</hi> was one of the greatest goods that could befal the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and contrariwise the greatest prejudice that could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to <hi>Spaine</hi>; That <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tua's</hi> obligations to <hi>France</hi> were knowne, the affection and intire friendship of the state of <hi>Venice</hi>; That doubtlesse, though the state of <hi>Parma</hi> should prove penurious as not to be able to maintaine an Army, it would be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed from <hi>Mantua, Ferara,</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi>; That the Princes would be glad of such a neighbour-hood, for that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by recourse unto their Townes, their Territories growing conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more populous, and they inriching themselves by their neighbours pillage, their Principalities would be thereby advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; That it was not to be believed that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then they were, would resolve upon a generall battell with the <hi>French</hi> Army, since by losing they should lose too much, and by win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning gaine but little; That therefore they were to furnish <hi>Brem, Cassalle,</hi> and other neighbouring Forts with all things necessary, to send speedy advertisement to the Court, to the end, that more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might with expedition be sent by the King to set upon the State of <hi>Mila</hi> on the other side, that so they might effect the work according to their desire.</q>
The other Commanders would easily have given way to these reasons, as appearing probable and valid; but conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the end and scope of the enterprise, there were some who openly opposed them; alledging,
<q>That the <hi>French</hi> had not about 7 or 8 thousand Foot, and 2500 Horse, wherewithall to keepe the Field; that this was a small number in respect of the difficultie of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and the recruits which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had received from divers parts; that they were for many miles to passe through the Enemies Countrey, having <hi>Valenza, Alessandria,</hi> and <hi>Tortona</hi> upon their Flanks and backs; that the Army would be perpetually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed; that they could not promise themselves any safe retreat if they should have occasion so to doe, it was rather to be feared, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by possessing themselves of the most advantagious Avenues, might crosse them in their march, and reduce them to some dangerous necessitie; that the Duke of <hi>Mantua's</hi> obligations to the King were true, but little of hope was to be grounded upon that Prince so impoverished by the late Warres; that the wise State of <hi>Venice,</hi> was onely intent upon the maintaining of their own Dominions, and the preservation of the peace in <hi>Italy</hi>; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not probable, they would like the neighbour-hood of the Forces of so great a King, who the further distant he was from their Dominions, was alwayes the more their friend; and that it was an infallible argument, that if they would not send their Forces into
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55221:174"/>
the <hi>Valteline,</hi> nor yet into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Territories, at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the <hi>French,</hi> who it may be hoped well therein, they would lesse suffer the neighbourhood of such Forces, to foment them, which by how much the neerer they were; the more cause of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, did they afford. That the friendship of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Tuscany</hi> with the house of <hi>Austria</hi> was apparent, so as nothing could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them, but help to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the contrary to the <hi>French.</hi> In briefe they concluded, that as the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were not satisfied that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should inlarge his power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, so would they not indure that the <hi>French</hi> should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themselves beyond <hi>Cassalle,</hi> since their possession of that place was sufficient to keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in perpetuall jealousie, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them from such thoughts, as they would certainly demonstrat, could they keep the <hi>French</hi> lockt up on the other side the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By these reasons the enterprise was laid aside, the danger being foreseen which the Army might run, of being destroyed, whose num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers was lessened by the running away and death of Souldiers, and who would certainly according to custome continue their disbanding, and by these objections the mouths of the boldest and most couragious were stopt, and they were of the more force, for that any such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe without greater strength, was onely built upon the aire, and meer imagination. Whereupon feeding the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> with hopes, and satisfying the Court with excuses, they grew at last to be so negligent, as it may truly be believed all the harme they suffered afterwards arose from hence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bannier,</hi> who was retired to quarter in the Bishoprick of <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> (where by reason of sicknesse he staid for about a month) having recovered his health, and divers <hi>Swedish</hi> bands being joyned with him, he went with his Army from thence, where he saw he could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice tarry any longer. And being followed by the <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> &amp; <hi>Saxons,</hi> about <hi>Hall,</hi> some skirmishes ensued, wherein the <hi>Swedes</hi> had the worst; whereupon the <hi>Imperialists</hi> being egg'd on to further enterprises, they marched forwards, to ingage <hi>Bannier</hi> in a Battaile; but he wisely knowing it was not now time, to hazard the gaines of so many yeares upon the few houres of one day, haulted at <hi>Ghilberstet,</hi> between <hi>Mansfield</hi> and <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and intrenching himselfe there, prepared to fight in that advantagious situation. The which when the <hi>Saxons</hi> perceived, fearing that if some other Forces that were not farre off with <hi>Agafelt</hi> should come up to <hi>Bannier,</hi> they should be too much ingaged, and some notable mischiefe might befall them, the <hi>Swedes</hi> being desirous (as those who for the peace lately made by <hi>Saxony</hi> did not a little detest all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Souldiers,) to fight, and revenge the ingratitude (as they termed it) used by the Duke to the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> they retired likewise upon the bankes of <hi>Sala,</hi> there to provide themselves of necessaries for the taking of <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> which they so much thirsted after.

            <p>Duke <hi>Waymer,</hi> who as hath beene said, by reason of <hi>Gallasse</hi> his comming, was retired to the Confines of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> knowing that it was not possible to keep any longer in those parts which were wasted, and now full of the Emperours Forces; and more impossible for him to receive succour from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who because they saw that after the defeat at <hi>Nordlinghen,</hi> it was behovefull for them to forgoe the Provinces of <hi>Franconia, Alsatia,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> as places too farre from succour, and wanting such commodities as the Armies had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly maintained themselves withall, raising great Contributions from thence, had resolved to quit the warre on this side, and to march with all their Forces to defend the Townes upon the Rivers of <hi>Vesser, Elb,</hi> and <hi>Oder,</hi> the preservation whereof was necessary for them, they being as it were united to the Kingdome of <hi>Swethland</hi>; for having meanes to transport what men and Ammunition they pleased by the Baltick Sea, of which the <hi>Swedes</hi> were Masters, they might easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend those places, and by the maintaining thereof inlarge their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and keep up their reputations in <hi>Germany</hi>; the Duke I say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto perswaded by the importunacy of the Officers and Souldiers, who either demanded pay or leave to depart; as likewise by the large offers of the <hi>French</hi> Agents, who daily solicited him to come and serve their King, which if he would doe he should be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of all his Forces; though the <hi>Imperialists</hi> failed not to doe what in them lay to reconcile him to the Emperour, and that these indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were assisted by the instigations of his brother Duke <hi>William,</hi> who had already accepted of conditions offered by the Emperour; yet did the <hi>French</hi> prevaile with him, who indeavoured by all meanes possible to win him over unto them, the which they did, for that by gaining this Prince to serve them, they added to their Forces about the number of 8000 old <hi>Dutch</hi> Souldiers, and who were the valian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of the present age, by reputation whereof, they should not onely keep the places possest by them in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> in fealty, whose Inhabitants were naturally ill disposed to the <hi>French</hi>; But they might hope for much better advancements in <hi>Germany,</hi> having one of that Nation for their Commander, who was generally beloved by many Cities, and Princes, then if their Generall should be a stranger, a <hi>French-man</hi> not knowne unto them, and the name of <hi>French-man</hi> being by antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy odious to <hi>Germany.

            <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> who had retreated from <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> being recruited by 8000 Souldiers which were brought unto them by <hi>Azfelt,</hi> Serjeant Major-Generall of the Battaile, did passe backe again over the <hi>Sala,</hi> to set upon <hi>Bannier.</hi> Hee hearing thereof, arose suddainly from those parts, and retired towards <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> to be aiding to that place, which he was very unwilling to lose, since the aboad of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces in those Provinces depended thereupon, it being a fitting place to invade <hi>Saxony,</hi> and a place whereunto to retreat in case of any hard incounter: But being followed at the heeles by the <hi>Imperialists</hi> hee could not make such haste, but that the <hi>Saxons</hi> got up to his Reer, routed them, and slew about 400 <hi>Swedes,</hi> who not long after cried quittance with them; for the <hi>Saxons</hi> running confusedly here and there, out of a desire of booty, they were met by the <hi>Swedish</hi> Horse, who routed two of their Regiments, killing, and taking about 500 of them, and thereby likewise they lost the Towne of <hi>Bernberg,</hi> sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the <hi>Sala,</hi> upon the Confines of the Bishopricke, wherein above 50 Souldiers that were there quartered were put to the Sword. <hi>Oranghell</hi> entring on the other side into <hi>la Marca,</hi> (a Province be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pomerania, Saxony, Brandeburg,</hi> and <hi>Slesia,</hi>) with about 8000 men, came without any withstanding to the Gates of <hi>Franckfort</hi> upon <hi>Oder</hi>; for by his unexpected arrivall, and that Province wanting men to make head against him, he had free leave to goe whither he would, and to sacke many Townes, from which the <hi>Swedes</hi> got rich booty, and good store of Beeves and Horses.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> knowing that these times wherein the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was greatly molested, might serve fitly for him to advantage his Crowne, (for that 'twas likely the Emperour would indeavour to give him satisfaction, thereby to winne his friendship, as also to make him breake with the <hi>Swedes</hi>) had upon this occasion dispatcht away an Embassadour to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to desire the Emperour to conferre the Bishopricke of <hi>Bremen</hi> upon a sonne of his, as also to negotiat some other affaires; who was graciously received, and sent away contented: For the Emperour that he might have good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with that King during these troubles, invested him in that Bishopricke which he pretended unto, which being in the <hi>Swedes</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, it was a good meanes to bring this King to breake with them; for he verily believed, they would not forgoe it, and the other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding right thereunto, this was the way to set them together by the eares, and thereby likewise to make a league with <hi>Denmarke,</hi> which doubtlesly would have succeeded, had the Parliament of <hi>Denmarke</hi> yeelded to the Kings desires; but the <hi>Danes</hi> not intending to breake peace with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> as knowing the prejudice of Warre, busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses proceeded slowly on, and nothing was concluded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:55221:176"/>Count <hi>Coloredo</hi> was upon the Confines of <hi>France,</hi> who thought to advance into that Kingdome, and by inrodes to inrich himselfe and his Souldiers. He therefore arose from his quarters with 24 Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Horse, and past over the <hi>Mosell</hi> to joyne with 2000 Crabats, and so invade the <hi>French</hi> to some purpose; yet did not this indeavour take effect, for the Crabats, mindfull of what had befallen them in their inrode some moneths agoe, denyed to goe with him; so as he advanc't with his owne onely Horse, and being got into <hi>Champania,</hi> sack't divers Villages, chased some <hi>French</hi> Troopes, and got so farre into the Countrey, as that Marshall <hi>De la Force,</hi> having time to march with his men to the <hi>Mosell,</hi> by which <hi>Coloredo</hi> was to re-passe, intercepted him, and after a gallant skirmish on both sides, he forced <hi>Coloredo</hi> to thinke upon a retreat, who not being able to recover any place of safetie, for all the passages of the River were pre-possessed, together with the losse of his bootie and most of his men, he himselfe was taken prisoner by the <hi>French,</hi> by whom he was civilly received, (as is the custome of that honourable Nation,) and treated with such courtesie, as is used by the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie to men of worth. The Marshall invited him that very night to supper, where he received much satisfaction from <hi>La Force,</hi> and all the <hi>French</hi> Gentry, who were much pleased to have bereft the Emperour of so ingenious and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>After the rout given to <hi>Serbellone, Rohan</hi> being desirous to proceed; and thinking how he might get footing in the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and open his way into the State of <hi>Milan</hi> (where many wise men are of opinion, he would have made some strange proofe of his valour) he having no more to doe in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> which was now wholly possest by the <hi>French</hi> Forces: And considering, that when he should have taken <hi>Pradell,</hi> over against the River, underneath the Mountaines, and neere the Lake, he might easily likewise take <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesca</hi> and <hi>Gravedone,</hi> little Townes along the Lake towards the West. On the third of <hi>Aprill</hi> he quit his quarters,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aprill</hi> 3.</note> and seeming by false fires to march elsewhere, he both by water and by land came to the said <hi>Pradell,</hi> the which he luckily tooke, as he also did <hi>Francesca</hi> and <hi>Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done</hi>; the which Towne he made his Souldiers sacke, knowing that he could not keepe it, as not having orders from his King to quit the <hi>Valteline,</hi> nor Forces enough to beat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> led on by <hi>Serbellone,</hi> who came eagerly against him. He therefore retreated to his former quarters, giving out that he had sack't <hi>Gravedone,</hi> as knowing if the <hi>French</hi> had not done it, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would.</p>
            <p>These happy successes being neglected by the <hi>French,</hi> who were thought able to have advanced into the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> as well for that <hi>Rohan</hi> had with him 4000 Foot, and about 600 gallant Horse; as also, that he was not onely accompanied by Fortune, but cryed up by Fame, which did immortalize his name, and render him reverenced and dreaded by his Enemies; made the <hi>Grisons</hi> somewhat suspect, that the Kings orders for his not going out of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> were not occasioned for his want of Forces, nor lesse out of feare, that the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had made himselfe Master of should be taken by the <hi>Austrians,</hi>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:55221:176"/>
(as was given out) but to keepe the <hi>Grisons</hi> from possession of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, which was faithfully promised them before the <hi>French</hi> came thereinto, and perhaps with intention when they should have achie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their ends in <hi>Milan,</hi> to have the same pretensions upon them as upon the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, as jealousies in poynt of libertie (chiefly amongst those who are accustomed thereunto) are of a nice and tender nature, and such as any little suspition is able to cause diffidence to, the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> who had brought the <hi>French</hi> Forces into the bosome of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, not out of any intention to assubject themselves thereunto, nor yet to let them partake of what they had gotten and promised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but to receive the usurped state from their protection, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that now, when they had obtained their desires, the <hi>French</hi> should make their words good, declaring themselves able with their owne Forces to preserve their recovered patrimony, began to have sinister opinions of the <hi>French-mens</hi> actions. From whence a desire of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent libertie budding forth, those evills ensued afterwards unto the <hi>French,</hi> which perhaps they had not met withall had they governed themselves otherwise. For by re-calling their Souldiers from those Valleys, and by maintaining necessary Garrisons of the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Grisons</hi> therein, they would not onely have held good correspondency with those Colleagues, &amp; have undeceived those Princes who thought their Armes tended onely to their owne greatnesse, but might have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for some considerable advantage from such a Chiefetaine as was <hi>Rohan,</hi> and from such a strength as was his, so experienced in other parts, at least if they would have made use of them. But as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate desire of government is alwayes hunger-starved, so as it can hardly come neere what belongs unto another without taking some morsells thence; so many will have it, that the <hi>French</hi> reaped not those effects which at the first was hoped for, by reason of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and too farre inlarged thoughts. And moreover, many are of opinion, that <hi>Rohans</hi> firme foundation in Protestanisme whereof he was a chiefe professor, and one who firmely believed he should never be forsaken by those of the same Religion, helped at first to make the <hi>French</hi> withdraw their friendship from the <hi>Grisons</hi>; for the interest of state is the onely hand which holds fast, or lets loose the affection as well of Christians as of Pagans.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Mentz</hi> was recovered by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> they re-called the Elector thereof, who when the King of <hi>Swethland</hi> appeared first in <hi>Germany</hi> in Armes, was fled to <hi>Cobn.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> fore-saw, that if the Emperour, who was now of good age, should dye during these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent emergencies, before his Sonne should be declared King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> there might be feare enough the Empire might not continue in the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> it being a difficult businesse to get all the Electors to a Dyet to that effect. For certainly the King of <hi>France</hi> would pretend thereunto, and consequently by promises, gifts, and threats, he might easily divert some of the Electors from their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of favouring the house of <hi>Austria</hi>; and more particularly, they apprehended the Ecclesiasticall Electors, as they who having
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55221:177"/>
their states confining upon those parts which were possest by the <hi>French,</hi> were more exposed to their hostilitie then the rest. The <hi>Hans</hi>-Townes being now freed of their Oath, might together with the other Protestant Princes, joyne in the Election of such a Protestant Prince to be Emperour as should put for it, which might make the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> looke after it, as one who hath had former Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of his house. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> when he should find cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie in the assistance of <hi>France,</hi> when he should know the edge thereof was not to be abated, and that <hi>France</hi> would at least indeavour that the Empire should no longer continue in the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> he might peradventure be perswaded to side with them: In fine, the <hi>Austrian</hi> greatnesse being envied, and feared by the greatest part, if not by all the Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> every one of them either openly or secretly embracing this occasion, would adde their helping hands to the dis-membring and weakning of it in <hi>Germany</hi>; where, as 'tis without all doubt, that if they had an Emperour joyned with the so Potent house of <hi>Spaine,</hi> there would be little cause of jealousie of any of the other Electors upon whom the Election should fall; for his power would be counterpoised by the other <hi>German</hi> Princes, and by the house of <hi>Austria</hi> it selfe, which set the Empire aside, was very powerfull in <hi>Germany,</hi> having for its inheritance <hi>Bohemia,</hi> part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the <hi>Austria's, Alsatia, Stiria, Carinthia, Croatia,</hi> and other Provinces in that Kingdome. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this apparent disorder was to be prevented, and that the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession should be secured whilest the <hi>Dutch</hi> fought under their Masters Standard: They therefore negotiated with the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> as the first Elector of the Empire, and perswaded him, as one much obliged to them for the re-possessing of his State, to intimate the Dyet at <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> wherein many matters pertaining to the safetie of the Empire might be treated on, as also a choice might be made of a King of the <hi>Romans</hi> to succeed the Emperour, so to secure <hi>Germany</hi> from such alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as might easily happen if the Emperour should doe otherwise then well. To this the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> gave way, inviting the rest of the Electors to meet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> on the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>Iune</hi> next ensuing,<note place="margin">

            <p>The <hi>Imperialists</hi> heard of the invasion made by <hi>Oranghell</hi> in <hi>La Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> wherein taking likewise <hi>Golchenitz</hi> by assault, he put all the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> Garrison to the Sword. Whereupon, fearing least likewise he might set upon <hi>Frankfort</hi> upon <hi>Oder,</hi> Colonell <hi>Vngher,</hi> who was in <hi>Slesia,</hi> was sent with 5000 <hi>Caesarian</hi> Souldiers to succour that City. At whose arrivall, the Inhabitants thereof were as much joy'd as they were much terrified at the newes of the invasion; so as it behoved the <hi>Swedes</hi> to face about and prosecute their first designe, which was to joyne with <hi>Bannier</hi> for the preservation of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and to oppose themselves to the wayes of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Imperialists,</hi> which when the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> understood, he made <hi>Maracini</hi> advance with his men towards <hi>Oder,</hi> to hinder <hi>Oranghells</hi> further proceedings, or his joyning with <hi>Bannier,</hi> which if it had happened time enough, that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55221:177"/>
Elector would have had somewhat else to doe, then to have sitten down before a strong Towne which had a prettie Army in the Field to assist it.</p>
            <p>The businesse of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> being by common consent agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Electorall Councell, and all Provisions made tending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, The Elector past over the <hi>Elb</hi> at <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> before any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Forces were come to <hi>Bannier,</hi> with 25000 fighting-men, and 38 piece of Cannon, and in battell array advanc't to <hi>Strastan,</hi> where <hi>Bannier</hi> was with the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army, who hearing of the <hi>Saxons</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach had fortified himselfe, and put his men in readinesse to fight, though this were rather but to shew he seemed not to feare them, then that he really had any equivalent strength; for <hi>Bannier,</hi> who was a very wise man in warlike affaires, knew very well he had not Forces sufficient to oppose so numerous an Army, all his men not amounting to above 14000. And therefore making it knowne that his courage failed him not, he privately by night parted from his quarters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying them, and all the Townes through which he past.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Saxons</hi> might not know whether he retreated, but be confused in their following of him, he left the Campe full of fires, though no body was therein; and having put part of his Foot into <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> he with his Horse, wasting all the neighbouring Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, retired to <hi>Serbest</hi> (some six houres march from <hi>Magdeburg</hi>) over-running all parts thereabouts, and pillaging the Townes even to <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Havell,</hi> to the end, that the <hi>Saxons,</hi> finding neither Victualls nor Forrage, might be incommodiated in their Siege, and not be able to keepe long before that Citie; and meeting with two Regiments of <hi>Saxons,</hi> who were advanced to watch over and oppose his designes, being in condition to withstand them, for some of <hi>Maracinies</hi> men were come up to him, he ingaged himselfe with them in a gallant fight, routed them, and tooke from them elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Standards, flew 200. tooke many prisoners, and returned againe to <hi>Serbest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Elector having sent some Barques of Ammunition, and instruments of Warre downe the River to <hi>Rossemburg,</hi> a Towne upon the <hi>Sala</hi> and <hi>Elb,</hi> he himselfe likewise advanc't thether, being joyned with <hi>Azfelt,</hi> who brought with him about 9000 fighting-men, and having made two Bridges upon Boats over the <hi>Elb</hi> and <hi>Sala,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Azfelt</hi> to advance towards <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> on the Bishopricke of <hi>Halberstats</hi> side, and he himselfe past with his men on the other side the <hi>Elb</hi> to set upon <hi>Bannier,</hi> to drive him from <hi>Zerbest,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Siege.

They therefore halted here, and fortified themselves, making a Bridge, that as time should serve they might succour <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> which being strongly set upon by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> those within the Towne did valiantly defend it, and by gallant and continuall sallies, did annoy the Enemy in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>The troubles of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> increasing every day, and <hi>Ruthen</hi> being arrived at <hi>London,</hi> who as hath beene said, was sent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely to acquaint the King of <hi>England</hi> how affaires went in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and that it was now a fitting time to demand the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> from the Emperour, and to remit the Princes of that most Noble Family into their patrimony: The Earl of <hi>Arundell,</hi> one of the prime and richest Subjects of that Kingdome, was sent about that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse to <hi>Caesar,</hi> which had been granted, had not those Countries, and that which imported more, the Electorall dignitie fallen upon the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> from whom it was not faire to take it away without good satisfaction, it being conferr'd upon him for the expence he had beene at in the Emperours service, in which he had alwayes upon all occasions contributed his Counsell, Moneyes, Forces, his expences arising to many millions of Dollars, and hazarded his life. Neither did it become the <hi>Austrians</hi> to leave him unsatisfied, who had been, and continued to be their loyall friend, thereby to please a Forreigne Crowne, which when it should have obteined all it pretended unto, would upon occasion forget the courtesie; for the friendship of Princes continues onely so long as their owne interest is therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, which they affirme ought to be preferred before all obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before all alliance. And if upon these present emergencies the Emperour should have forgone his good intelligence with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> one of the chiefe Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> served by a brave and veteran Army, he should have forgot the true way of corresponding with that which his proper interest required. The Embassadour was sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously received, entertained with extraordinary civilities, satisfied onely in hopes and complements, but prospered not in his negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And againe, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> did preferre the satisfying of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> before giving way to the King of great <hi>Britaines</hi> pretences, for that the neighbour-hood of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was more behovefull for them; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, for that it stood not with the self-interest of <hi>England</hi> to foment the <hi>French,</hi> since it complyes not with that great Potentate to see his neighbouring Princes grow greater, which may afterwards cause jealousies in himselfe; and it not being possible for the <hi>English</hi> to breake with the <hi>Austrians</hi> without much advantage to the <hi>French</hi>; the <hi>Austrians</hi> knew well enough, that though the <hi>English</hi> might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture barke, so to fright them, they would not for the aforesaid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons bite.</p>

into <hi>Franconia</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> The Landsgrave of <hi>Hessen</hi> was looked upon as a man of great concernment; who having refused con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of peace propounded unto him by the <hi>Caesarians</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi>; and having joyned in the League now againe contracted betweene <hi>Swethland, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> joyned all his Forces which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 7 or 8 thousand men with <hi>Lesley,</hi> who did then command the <hi>Swedish</hi> Forces in those parts; and after he had raysed the Siege from before <hi>Osnabruch, Hessen</hi> betooke himselfe to the taking in of <hi>Mynden,</hi> (a place of no small consideration in those times, and as affaires then went) by Stratagem; assisted therein by intelligence, which he held with some of the Inhabitants, who were not well inclined to the <hi>Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> partie, the which he effected thus: He conveyed into the Towne some choice Souldiers in certaine Chests, like such as Merchants put their Ware in, and sent others thither in Countrymens apparrell, seeming to have somewhat to sell; who comming to the Gates at the houre agreed upon, and the others getting out of the Chests which were conveyed into the Conspirators houses, those who guarded some Waggons, shot at those that were upon the draw-bridges, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, together with them, unsheathing their hidden Weapons, fell upon the Court of Guard, insomuch as the <hi>Romanists</hi> ranne rather where they might hope for safetie, then to their Weapons for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; it being usuall for men in unexpected accidents to faile of that courage, which upon better advertisement they are not wanting in. The <hi>Swedes</hi> therefore became masters of the Gate, by which they let the Horse in, who staid attending hard by; and thus did the <hi>Hessians</hi> winne a Fort by Stratagem, which they had small reason to hope to get by force. Of the <hi>Romanists</hi> there dyed about 400 Souldiers, three Captaines, and one Lieutenant Colonell; the Governour, together with many Officers and men of qualitie were taken prisoners, and the Citizens ransomed themselves from Military insolence, and sacking, at the rate of 100000 Dollars. The <hi>Swedes</hi> lost one Captaine, and about 35 Souldiers. Hereupon the Lansgrave taking heart, marched to succour <hi>Hannaw</hi>; which when <hi>Lamboi</hi> understood, who commanded the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Campe in chiefe, he rose with his Horse from his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and retreated to <hi>Stenheim,</hi> not thinking himselfe able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Forces that came against him; so as the <hi>Swedish</hi> horse gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly advancing, and being back't by their well ordered Foot, they relieved the Town with 300 Waggons of Provision, and changed the Garrison which was much lessened, and wearied by continuall action. They then set upon some lesser Forts thereabouts, where some <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists</hi> were left to defend them; for they understood their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour was not farre off, and were minded to returne to before that Towne, when the <hi>Swedes</hi> should be gone from thence which had so much indammaged the neighbouring Territories; but having made good their Trenches against two assaults, they were at last overcome and forced to flye by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who behaved themselves couragiously, that so they might doe their worke before the <hi>Imperialists</hi> that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Mentz</hi> should come up and succour their fellowes: They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about two a clock at night, made certaine fires to make the <hi>Swedes</hi>

believe that they prepared for defence, and that these were signes of some news of succour, or of some other intelligence held with the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and so quit their quarters, and went towards <hi>Franckfort</hi>; but they prospered not therein, according to their imagination; for the <hi>Swedes</hi> being aware thereof, pursued them with their Horse, tooke many of them prisoners, and brought them under their Colours. The Protestant Inhabitants who were not over-confident of being thus relieved, and therefore the more joyed thereat, did for three dayes together expresse their rejoycing, by drinking (according to the <hi>Dutch</hi> fashion) to the health of the said Landsgrave, and the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> Commanders, the Cannon going off, and the Drums beating at every health; insomuch, that were it for over-much content, or over-much wine, the chiefe Magistrate of the Towne drunke himselfe dead, whereat all his friends were much troubled; for he was a merry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited old man, a good companion, and one who was most heartily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the <hi>Swedish</hi> party, and the Protestant Commanders.</p>

long since taken into the King of <hi>France</hi> his pay, under title of field-Marshall.

After this, having victualled <hi>Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Sclestat, Colmar,</hi> and other Townes thereabouts which were in great scarcity of Victuals, they came before <hi>Zabern,</hi> a Towne joyning to the Mountaines towards <hi>Lorayne,</hi> which are foure leagues distant from <hi>Strasburg</hi>; which Towne is onely surrounded with Walls and Ditches after the ancient fashion; but those Walls are toughly cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and moreover well accommodated with moderne Trenches, and Palisadoes in the weakest part thereof; wherein were divers Companies of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> who incouraged by Colonell <hi>Milheim</hi> their Governour, and comforted by <hi>Gallasse</hi> with hopes of speedy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, seemed as if they would valiantly defend themselves; but a great Trench which the <hi>Imperialists</hi> had made being furiously set upon, they tooke it by force, and the Defendants fled into the City, where being pursued by the <hi>French,</hi> both the Duke and the Cardinall, that they might make use of the feare which they discried in the Enemy, did with their Swords in their hands enter the Gate; but the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son being quickned, at the news hereof hastned thither, and as they went did valiantly defend themselves, the streets were baracadoed up, Tiles and such like things of offence were throwne out of windowes, and from the tops of houses, insomuch as the <hi>French</hi> were inforced to give back, the Cardinall, and <hi>Waymer</hi> being lightly hurt, the former with a stone, the other with a Musket shot in the Arme.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>French</hi> moved on this side against <hi>Alsatia,</hi> at the same time the Prince of <hi>Condee</hi> (who had raised about 10000 Foot and 2000 Horse for the King in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and had mustered these men in <hi>Aussona,</hi> a place upon the Frontiers of the <hi>Franche</hi> County, seated upon the <hi>Some,</hi> invironed with strong rampired Walls, and had brought thither all things requisit for Warre) marched into the said County, and spoyling the Country, and plundring the Townes of Saint <hi>Ilie, Rochfort, le Temple, Gierey, Bermont, Santans, Chastean Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illan,</hi> and other neighbouring places, he set down before <hi>Dole,</hi> a chiefe City, where the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State keep, who have the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of that Province; that Town is seated neere the River <hi>Doux,</hi> upon the Frontiers of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> well fenced with Bullwarks, great Towers and Ditches, and guarded by good numbers of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; the Prince began to play upon it with 12 piece of Cannon, but the Towne bravely defending it selfe, kept the <hi>French</hi> aloofe off to their little profit.</p>
            <p>Let us now returne to the King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> who being invested

(as hath been said) by the Emperour into the Bishopricke of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>; and fearing lest the Townes thereof which were in the <hi>Swedes</hi> possession should not be yielded up unto him, did at this time send about 1800 Foot and 400 Horse to <hi>Glichestat,</hi> and quartered them in <hi>Altena,</hi> not out of any intention of breaking Peace with the Crown of <hi>Swethland,</hi> (for the <hi>Danes</hi> would not give way thereunto,) but to frighten them, and make them bethinke themselves of making him their friend, and to be the readier to yeeld to his demand, to the which the <hi>Swedes</hi> would the more apply themselves, it being usuall for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to put a value upon armed Neighbours, and therefore he thought they would bee carefull not to discontent him when they should see him in Armes, but did rather hope they would gratifie him, that so they might be by him assisted, more particularly upon the present occasions.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> who was in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> soliciting the <hi>French</hi> for succour, finding palpably that they would never consent to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their owne Forces, so to carry them into his Countrey not a little ruinated by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by his owne Souldiers; which if they had done, besides the ingaging of themselves therein, they would have made the other confining Princes and Potentates take up Armes, who studying the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was not to be imagined that they would assist them, but rather be averse (as it hath beene said) and indeavour their departure from those Confines, it being too dangerous to have a poore and desperate Army upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of a rich and opulent Territory; and considering that his long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aboad there, might be more prejudiciall to him, for when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Piacenza</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi> should have their Prince farre from them, and be themselves without succour, and so much annoyed by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, they might perchance bethink themselves of some alteration, and indeavour a Peace; hee resolved to depart secretly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied onely by three Gentlemen whom he most esteemed, and to go to <hi>Parma,</hi> as hee luckily did, it being whispered that he was not well satisfied with <hi>Crequi.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> perceiving this meane while that people murmured every day more and more at their delayes, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they did just nothing, after a long dispute what they were best to doe, they agreed all in a resolution, to march with their Forces into the heart of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and see whither they might thereby advantage themselves, before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should bee succoured by aides which were preparing in all parts. And though they foresaw it would be a difficult peece of businesse, seeing they had much fewer men then were requisit for such an enterprise, yet incouraged in that fortune favours bold undertakings; that there is nothing which more troubles mens mindes then great resolutions; that the counsels even of the wisest, are not more confounded with any thing then unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted enterprises; and that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At the news hereof, though it were one of the saddest that had yet befaln that State, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were no whit daunted, nor dismaide, but with all readinesse prepared to obviat the evill which was likely to prove greater unto them, if the <hi>French</hi> should advance further, or could be able long to maintaine what they had gotten; for <hi>Milan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of people, and wanting water, would have been brought to great streights, and so much the greater, for that she should not have received any reliefe from those Towns, from whence she was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnisht with abundance of Provisions, they being now sackt and Pillaged by the <hi>French.

            <p>The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> failed not in using all their cunning and industry to compleat the businesse of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> against which they playd continually with their Cannon and Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and had already reduc'd it to a bad condition, for <hi>Azfelt</hi> cut off the succour which was sent thether from <hi>Werben,</hi> under the command of Colonell <hi>Schulman</hi> neare <hi>Tergemonde,</hi> routing three Regiments of <hi>Swedish</hi> horse, and taking 9 Cornets. <hi>Iohn de Wert</hi> was all this while before <hi>Liedge</hi> to force that Citie, whose Inhabitants did so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves, as the <hi>Imperialists</hi> came alwayes by the worst.

which argued against the enterprise, unlesse they should first make themselves masters of the strong holds which were upon those Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, without which they could not advance but with apparent danger, for then they should have no place whereunto to retreat, in case they should meet with any hard incounter, which they were to expect; for <hi>France</hi> being a warlike Nation, and prone to take up Armes, they might easily be incompassed, and receive some notable rout. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing no great appearance of good to be done by force, the strong holds being well guarded and munited, they betooke themselves to cunning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to indeavour how they might winne the good will of some of those Governours and other <hi>French</hi> Officers, knowing that Nation to be desirous of noveltie, and that they are oft-times not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their present condition, and which is worse, not well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate to their King and the Ministers of State, proceed it either from their natures, or from the inclination of their ill composed minds, or from their envy to see others imployed, or their distaste for not being treated so well as they themselves thinke they deserve. They bent their braines unto the businesse, and to say truth, Fortune was not faultie to them in the enterprise; for all the <hi>Dutch</hi> being taken from the Territories of <hi>Liedge,</hi> the differences betweene which City and the Emperour was referred (as hath beene said) to the Umpirage of the Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> by whose meanes they were allayd, the rest of the Souldiers being yet quartered in the neighbouring parts, and an Army being gathered together of about 30000 Souldiers with 48 piece of Cannon, they made their Arsenall at <hi>Cambrai,</hi> a Citie upon the <hi>Schelde,</hi> betweene <hi>Hannault, Artois,</hi> and <hi>Picardy</hi>; and having cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Governour of <hi>La-Chapelle,</hi> a Fort belonging to the King of <hi>France</hi> upon those Confines, modernly fortified, they came before it.

            <p>The Governours of <hi>Chastellet</hi> and <hi>Corbie,</hi> places upon the same Frontiers, did the like soone after, with whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having secured their retreat, and opened their way into that <hi>Province,</hi> they marched speedily forwards, sacking many Villages, and comming e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to before the Gates of <hi>Amiens</hi> and S. <hi>Quinti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he being true unto his King, answered the Prince, that he was so well prepared to defend that place recommended to his trust, if his Highnesse would come in he would throw open the Gates, to the end that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might cheerfully enter, where they should be by him received as became a man of honour, and one who was faithfull unto his Master; so as the Prince, perceiving he could advance but little further, returned to <hi>Corbie,</hi> where all the rest of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my intrencht themselves.</p>

Yet was it not of force enough to have any outward operation, for the late example of <hi>Monmerancy,</hi> and other great ones of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy had sufficiently taught them, that the Subject might hope

to be borne withall, and pardoned for any other fault save that of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie. And every one knew very well, that if the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> had consumed sufficient treasure by the government of such Officers, yet were they secure from intestine Warres, whereby that flourishing Kingdome had so much suffered in former times, and which were easie enough to be renewed againe; for every little distaste taken by a <hi>French</hi> Prince, was sufficient to subvert whole Provinces; so as it was better to indure some Taxations, then to be exposed to the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of a friend, and violence of an enemy.

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> having possest themselves of the seat of <hi>Panperduto,</hi> and made their Trenches there in the open Fields, which gave them no small hopes of further advancement; and knowing, that without any more adoe they should bring <hi>Milan</hi> into great streights for want of Victualls, if carrying their Forces aside the great Lake, they should cut from them those Provisions which were thereby brought unto the Citie, they resolved upon the taking of <hi>Arona,</hi> a Towne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Tessine,</hi> in the mouth of the said Lake, which would make them to perfect their designe. They therefore marched with part of their Forces thetherwards, but were not proserous in the attempt; for all the neighbouring people taking up Armes, together with others, under the command of Count <hi>Iulius Caesar Borromeo,</hi> they were salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many Cannon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shot from divers places, which were held by the <hi>Milanois</hi> on those Hills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so as it behoved them to retreat that they might not dis-joint their Army which kept about <hi>Panperduto,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the event of that enterprise, by the benefit whereof they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, to marke where they might have greatest hopes of advantage. But these proceedings were not well interpreted by those of <hi>Milan,</hi> which made them murmur and complaine of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for that they had assembled so many men together, &amp; kept them so long in that State, to the so great incommoditie and losse of so many people, whom they had not courage to defend now that they stood in need of their helpe. At which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being much galled, who fore-saw the apparent danger that over-hung them if they should make any further delay, they resolved to alter their determination of keeping themselves in strong holds, so to reduce the <hi>French</hi> to a scarcitie of Victualls, and into a condition of receiving some great overthrow, and propounded, that content might be given to the <hi>Milanois</hi> by their undertaking some generous action, whereby the others minds which were so farre sunck in dispaire, might be somewhat comforted. <hi>Leganes</hi> therefore on the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi>

                  </gap>eville</hi> was speedily dispatcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>Vallet,</hi> with a succour of 6000 Souldiers, whereby that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was very well secured from any attempt of the Enemy; for the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Forces not being able to keepe in those Territories in any great numbers (as it behoved them to doe) for the scarcitie of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls in the Countrey, which was now by the continuall maintaining of Souldiers reduced to great extremitie; and the <hi>French</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall sufficiently provided, the enterprise would be upon too une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall tearmes.</p>
            <p>Whilest Warre was waged with much industry on both sides in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> proceeded with no lesse fervour and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> had his heart set upon the taking of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and fearing lest if the succour should come up to <hi>Bannier,</hi> which was upon their march towards him from <hi>Pomerania, Westphalia, Mechelberg,</hi> and other places, before the businesse were ended, he might faile in his enterprise, he did all that in him lay to put an end to that Siege. And <hi>Bannier</hi> not onely desirous to frustrate the Electors hopes, but to have the honour of preserving that Citie, laboured no lesse to bring it timely succour, for the which all things requisite were providing, that upon the arrivall of the expected and much requisite aides, he might quit his Trenches &amp; betake himself to the field. But the besieged finding their want of bullet, as likewise their scarcitie of Victualls, and being advertised of the losse of <hi>Tergemonde,</hi> together with <hi>Schulmans</hi> rout, who was upon the march to bring them some sort of reliefe, they put a period to the great expectation which was had by every one of some great action neere the Citie; for the Garrison being necessitated for the aforesaid reasons, resolved to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and to surrender up the Towne, upon conditions of marching out
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55221:189"/>
with their Armes and Baggage, and 4 pieces of Cannon, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers consisting of 1200 Foot, and 200 Horse, which were conveyed to <hi>Werben.</hi> The losse of this place being much regretted by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> not onely for that it was of so great consideration for their affaires, but also in that it fell into the <hi>Saxons</hi> hands who they most perfectly hated, afforded <hi>Bannier</hi> occasion of complaint, and to presse againe the <hi>Swedish</hi> Governours, that the Forces which were already assembled in sufficient numbers, might advance into those parts. But the Elector losing no time, but making use of occasion, put requisite Garrison in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Towne, providing all things necessary for the maintenance thereof, and sent his Army to before <hi>Werben,</hi> thinking to fight with <hi>Bannier</hi> before he should be strengthned by his expected recruits. Yet things fell not out as he would have it, for <hi>Bannier</hi> being a wary and wise Commander, and knowing it was not yet time to oppose the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Victorious Army with so few men as he had, which exceeded not 12000. had retired to betweene <hi>Demits</hi> and <hi>Lavemburg,</hi> having first left a Garrison in <hi>Werben,</hi> and spoyled all the neighbouring Townes and Villages, to the end the <hi>Saxons</hi> might not find where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to subsist in those parts. The Electors Forces set therefore upon <hi>Werben,</hi> as a place of some moment for their affaires; which though it were in a condition of holding out some dayes, yet the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thereof being slaine therein, it yeelded at the end of foure dayes, as also did <hi>Haselberg</hi>; The which places opening the way to <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> advanced thither, encamped themselves about the Towne, and beset it. <hi>Bannier</hi> seeing no appearance of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted supply, and perceiving that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Army drew daily neerer him, that he might shun such incounters from whence he could expect no good, he went likewise from <hi>Demits,</hi> and retreated to the Confines of <hi>Mechelberg,</hi> that he might there joyne with <hi>Lesley,</hi> who being about <hi>Luneburg,</hi> did divers things thereabouts, and with <hi>Oranghell,</hi> another <hi>Swedish</hi> Generall, who was quartered about <hi>Pernaw,</hi> to get some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution from <hi>Berlin,</hi> and the Electorate of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> without the which he intended not to move from those quarters. He grounded his reasons, in that the Souldiers wanting their pay, would runne away if they should part from thence, and but very few would follow him; but his chiefe ends aimed at his owne particular interest, which was the thing he onely cared for, and so the publique service did in this manner decline by reason of the Commanders avarice. These prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and of the Landsgrave of <hi>Hessen,</hi> who being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited with 4000 men, had betaken himselfe to the taking in off <hi>Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berghen,</hi> made the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Commanders looke about them, who were about <hi>Ghiessen,</hi> upon the banks of <hi>Lon,</hi> fore-seeing that if the Protestant Forces should increase in those Provinces, and that they should make themselves Masters of those Townes, they would be hardly recovered. Wherefore they resolved to march with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from those parts to the succour of <hi>Statbergken</hi>; they over-ranne the Territories of <hi>Hirschfelt, Swartsborne,</hi> and <hi>Homburg,</hi> belonging to the Countrey of <hi>Hessen,</hi> and seated upon the River <hi>Fulda,</hi> meeting with no opposition, for all the people were in the Campe before
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55221:189"/>
               <hi>Statberghen.</hi> But the Landsgrave hearing of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> march, removed from thence and raysed his Siege, retiring to <hi>Cassell</hi> to defend his owne State; and him the <hi>Imperialists</hi> would have set upon with some advantage, had not <hi>Lesley,</hi> who burnt as many Villages and Townes in <hi>Westphalia</hi> as denyed him Contribution, necessitated the Marquis <hi>Grana</hi> to advance to <hi>Hanttorph,</hi> to have an eye to his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; and had not <hi>Ghets</hi> likewise beene inforced to depart from that State, and to goe in re-inforcement of the <hi>Imperialists</hi> that pursued <hi>Bannier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time appoynted for the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> was already expired, when his <hi>Imperiall</hi> Majestie, with all his Court, and the Deputies of those Princes, parted from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and stayd some dayes in <hi>Lints,</hi> that he might afford time to the Princes, and others that were bound to be there, to arrive before him. The Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Coln,</hi> the Deputies of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> together with many other chiefe personages who were to assist in the Dyet, being come to <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> the Emperour parted from <hi>Lints,</hi> and made his solemne entry into <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> whither the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being likewise come, they began the Dyet, wherein three things were chiefly propounded; the first, That his <hi>Imperiall</hi> Majestie being now very old, and much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in body, a King of the <hi>Romans</hi> might be chosen; the second, That they should treat of matters touching the Electorate of <hi>Triers</hi>; the third, That they should thinke how to remit the Empire into its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer splendid condition, which if it could not be done, that the War was to be continued against the perturbers thereof. By these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Electors soone found that the <hi>Austrians</hi> ends were onely to make the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which when they should have effected, they would little care for the decision of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two poynts. In so much as some moved, that the other two heads should be resolved on before they came to choose the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the end, the <hi>Austrians</hi> might the more diligently intend the publique quiet; but such difficulties were overcome by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> dexteritie, who ingratiated themselves into the affections of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and their Officers; As also, for that the Earl of <hi>Arundell,</hi> who was Embassadour from <hi>England,</hi> for the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was then at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> who perceiving there was no mention made thereof in the Dyet, did againe move the Emperour, that it might be taken into consideration, and that they might thinke of what answer they would returne to his Kings desires; and this affaire was at last brought to the Table. But it not being then time to distaste <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or to rayse jealousies in him, the further Treatie thereof was deferr'd to the convention which was to be held at <hi>Cullen.</hi> Of which I have yet said nothing, because it being procured by the Popes mediation, who as the common father, was desirous of agreement betweene the Papists Princes; and it never being effected, although the <hi>Plenipotentiaryes</hi> of all the Potentates were named, and I not esteeming it yet so easie to be effected, by reason of the small desire that Princes have to part with what they have once gotten, I reserve my selfe to speake thereof when the effects thereof shall be seene, and that the Officers of those
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:55221:190"/>
Princes who are to compose it, shall be brought together. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour being not well satisfied, and clearely fore-seeing that the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was never to be regained but by the same meanes by which it was lost, resolved to take his leave, and returne unto his King.</p>
            <p>All the Gentry and Commonaltie of <hi>France</hi> was at this time in Armes, and people came from all parts to the Court; when the King knowing he had Forces enough in readinesse for his purpose, having mustered his Army at S. <hi>Denis,</hi> which consisted of 18000 Foot, and 3000 Horse, besides Voluntiers, and the Nobilitie of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which were to come with him, and having declared his Brother the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to be the Generall of his Forces, made all the Army march under his Highnesse conduct towards <hi>Picardy,</hi> to recover the places that were lost, &amp; to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thence. Who hearing of these great preparations which were made throughout all <hi>France,</hi> and fearing what they might doe, had fired the Countrey all about. 'Twas said, they did this to incommodiate the <hi>French</hi> in Forrage and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, and to streighten them so as they might not be able to keepe long in the Field. <hi>Piccolomini,</hi> together with <hi>Wert,</hi> retired to <hi>Noyon,</hi> the rest of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army intrenched themselves about <hi>Corbie,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation whereof was much endeavoured by the <hi>Austrians,</hi> for this Towne was so situated, as that by any reasonable Garrison therein, part of <hi>France</hi> might be kept in continuall jealousies.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> being advanced unto the Frontiers, made his first attempt against <hi>Roye,</hi> a Towne between <hi>Noion</hi> and <hi>Corbie</hi>; against which, having planted his Cannon, and the defendants having indured some assaults, they compounded, knowing themselves not able there to resist a Royall Army; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> finding that their longer stay in those Confines would be but a losse of time and men, whereof they daily lost many in skirmishes, and as they went to fetch Forrage, they drew towards <hi>Cambrai,</hi> leaving about 3000 Foot and 300 Horse in <hi>Corbie.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> having taken <hi>Roye,</hi> did lose no time, but furiously beset <hi>Corbie</hi>; and after having playd upon it many dayes with their Cannon, they assaulted it with a battalion of Voluntiers, who with their Pikes and Musquets, desirous to have the honour of making the first assault (as in such cases is usuall with those of that Nation) stormed all the Trenches and Fortifications that were about it; so as those within the Town, being set on on all sides, and playd upon by 36 piece of Cannon, which without intermission, day and night battered their Rampiers, and beat downe their houses, though with much undauntednesse they tended their defence, yet were they in great danger of losing the Towne; the losse whereof much grieving the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they caused <hi>Piccolomini</hi> and <hi>Wert,</hi> to come from <hi>Chapelle</hi> (whether they were gone from <hi>Noyon</hi>) and to furnish <hi>Cambrai</hi> with all things necessary, with intention to make the <hi>French</hi> rise from before <hi>Corbie</hi> by their setting upon <hi>Dorlens,</hi> a place of no lesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, seated in the Frontier of <hi>Artois,</hi> betweene <hi>Amiens</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>; they therefore sate downe before it, and began to thunder upon it with their Cannon; but this their enterprise lasted not long, for the King of <hi>France</hi> being come himselfe in Person to <hi>Amiens,</hi> where
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:55221:190"/>
hee was gladsomely received, and the Count <hi>Soisons</hi> going from thence with a good strength of men into <hi>Artoise,</hi> &amp; <hi>Corbie</hi> being in great streights, they were inforced to quit <hi>Dorlens,</hi> and to bethinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves how they might best relieve <hi>Corbie</hi>; but having sent some Spies into the <hi>French</hi> Camp, that they might be informed in what state the <hi>French</hi> Army was, and these being discovered and punished, they saw their designe was vaine, and so forwent it. Whereupon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged seeing their succour vanished, and that the <hi>French</hi> did every day increase in their offending them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 18.</note> they capitulated on the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> and surrendred the Fort to the <hi>French</hi>; who with great content, &amp; with the universall applause of <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Kings Brother, entred the Towne. At which it was said, the King was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and that therefore withdrawing him from so great an Authority, he became more wary in conferring imployments in the Army upon him; for it is not good to make those Princes Commanders of the Militia, who are neer in succession to the Crowne, since by winning the Souldiers love, they prove oft-times harmfull. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the contrary side, had assembled together an Army of about 10000 Foot and 1500 Horse in <hi>Novara,</hi> under the command of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of <hi>Castile,</hi> intending to invade <hi>France</hi> therewithall; where if they should finde no insurrection amongst the people, as they hoped, by reason of the naturall inquietude of that Nation, to do, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking was notwithstanding advantagious, that thereby they might divert the <hi>French</hi> Forces from their hostility against the States of <hi>Austria.</hi> They therefore entred into the nether <hi>Novara,</hi> took Saint <hi>Iohn de Lus,</hi> and besieged <hi>Bayon,</hi> making many incursions into the King of <hi>France</hi> his Dominions; wherefore many Companies of Foot and Horse were forthwith dispatcht away thitherward to re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Count <hi>Gramont</hi> the Governour of <hi>Bear,</hi> who already with those Forces he had, opposed them.</p>
            <p>Whilest the <hi>Spaniards</hi> grew every day stronger in the State of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> by people who continually landed in the Port of <hi>Vado</hi> from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells,</hi> and by the <hi>Dutch</hi> who came downe by <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and who forbare not their hostility with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> The <hi>French</hi> who kept themselves quiet, not doing any thing, afforded matter of thought not onely to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> but to all <hi>Italy,</hi> every one being desirous to see what the issue would be of the succour which was though requisit for the State of <hi>Parma</hi>; and so much the rather for that a great fleet of theirs being put to Sea from <hi>Marseilles,</hi> with a great many of Foot therein for Land-service, was now in the <hi>Genuan</hi> Seas. Some said the reason hereof was their want of Forces, others that they expected what the effect of the fleet at Sea would bee, and waited to see the men landed that were therein brought; which report did much comfort those of <hi>Parma,</hi> who were brought into great streights, and which were so much the greater by how much the lesse will they had to Warre, and onely hoped in succour from <hi>France,</hi> it being reported that the fleet came to this purpose: for there was no appearance that the Country of <hi>Piacenza</hi> should be succoured by <hi>Crequies</hi> Souldiers; were it either for that they wanted their pay, or for that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:55221:191"/>
were lessened, or out of their no desire to remove from their quarters wherein they kept, complaning rather of their ill-entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Italy,</hi> then that they were not imployed in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> as they were by their Commanders fed with hopes they should bee, before they came out of <hi>France,</hi> that so they might the easier bring them on this side the Mountaines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leganes</hi> this meane while being come from about <hi>Pavia</hi> to <hi>Tortona,</hi> and having reviewed the neighbouring Townes and places in <hi>Allessan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and provided for such passages as might be put for by those Forces which were in the fleet, which was said intended to land its Souldiers in the Haven of <hi>Specie,</hi> that from thence they might bee transported into the State of <hi>Parma,</hi> returned into the <hi>Piacenzan</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, to attend the businesse of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and secure himselfe in such sort thereabouts, that in case the succour should come (which yet was knowne by the best understanding people to be impossible) they should not be able to force him. And having by the assistance of good Engineers considered that <hi>Longina,</hi> a Towne in the <hi>Piacenzan</hi> Territories neere the <hi>Poe,</hi> was the fittest place of all others for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> to keep the command of the River, and streighten <hi>Piacenza,</hi> he went thither, and gave order for the fortifying thereof, wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pioneers were imployed; and then resolving to quarter his people in the Countrey of <hi>Piacenza</hi> that Winter, that so hee might ease the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> hee made Signior <hi>Iohn Cavalchino</hi> Commissary generall of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces in the Countrey of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to forbid upon paine of death that any Souldier should transport Cattell, or any sort of Victuals from those Townes, to the end there might be sufficient to maintaine the Army there. Hee brought his Forces before <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rso,</hi> which having given fire to some pieces of Cannon, rather for the honour of the Souldier then that the Towne was in a condition to defend it selfe, the Towne yeelded; by the taking hearof the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did so streighten <hi>Piacenza,</hi> as there was no hope left of its being succour'd unlesse by a compleat Army; for besides this place where they tooke up a quarter, they put Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons into Saint <hi>Domno, Monticelli, Bussetto, Firenzvola, Corte Maggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore,</hi> and into other adjacent Towns: by reason whereof the <hi>French</hi> who were imploid in the defence of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and wherein they began to suffer much (for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had tane from them the water of <hi>Treb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi>) began to fly to <hi>Cremona,</hi> where being allured by a crowne in Mony, and a Pasport which Cardinall <hi>Trivulsio</hi> gave to every one of them, many followed their examples. Other fitting orders being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Leganes</hi> returned to <hi>Pavia,</hi> to reforme some Companies which were much lessened; casheering the Commanders and reducing the Souldiers under other Colours.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Spaniards</hi> continued their hostilities against <hi>Piacenza,</hi> though Signior <hi>Dominico Pandolfini,</hi> who was resident at <hi>Milan</hi> from the great Duke, and the great Dukes Kinsman, indeavoured an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and it. And that moreover Count <hi>Ambrogio di Carpegna</hi> was come thither by Commission from the Pope, to perswade the Duke thereof to give way to the said composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55221:191"/>
Yet as it is usuall not to desist from injuries once done, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever interposition, but rather to renew them with the greater vigor, that so we may have what we desire at our owne rates, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> casting their eye upon a little Island in the midst of the <hi>Poe,</hi> not farre from <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and not much above Musket shot from certaine Mils which furnish the City with grist, and being advertised that those of <hi>Parma</hi> intended to send some thither the next day, so to intrench themselves the better, and secure the said Mils against the which the Cannon on the other side the <hi>Poe</hi> could doe no good, they on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> imbarqued themselves by night at <hi>Pizzighettione,</hi> and comming to the said <hi>Island,</hi> made themselves Masters of it; here plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Cannon in the same boates that had brought them thither, against a Bridge which those of <hi>Parma</hi> had throwne over a branch of the <hi>Poe,</hi> they afterwards turned them upon the Mils, and did so forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselves, as that they could not bee offended, neither by Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non from <hi>Piacenza,</hi> nor yet from the little Fort which was raised upon the bankes of <hi>Poe,</hi> for the defence of those Mils. Colonell <hi>Gilidas</hi> likewise came with his <hi>Dutch-men</hi> before <hi>Rivalta,</hi> a strong Towne seated upon the <hi>Trebbia,</hi> eight miles distant from <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>began to play upon it with his Cannon so furiously, as being no lesse desirous to have the honour of taking it then the defendants were to maintaine it, and keep it from him, cruell were the outrages which were offered to the besieged, who did desperatly defend themselves. So as the Duke seeing himselfe streightned on all sides, and hearing no tidings of any reliefe, he resolved to send an expresse to Count <hi>Scotti</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> openly protesting that if he were not succoured, hee would yeeld to propositions of agreement with the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Grisons</hi> in <hi>Rhetia</hi> did now bethinke themselves how they might take possession of the <hi>Vateline; Rohan</hi> indeavoured to satisfie them, and by his wisedome to lessen their anger. The <hi>Swedes</hi> increased in numbers every where, and provided for all things necessary that they might oppose the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who were too farre advanced. Nothing but Warre was noysed in <hi>France</hi>: The chiefe <hi>French</hi> Commanders in <hi>Piemont,</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> having their numbers much decreased by the death and flight of their Souldiers were much sadded, for not being able to effect that which their sprightly mindes carried them unto. The Cardinall of <hi>Vallet, Waymer,</hi> and <hi>Gallasse,</hi> having by reason of the ridgednesse of the season betane themselves to their winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, did nothing of moment.

observed in other places, and as hath beene said) the honour and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that they received thereby, so was it interpreted as an happy augure of the ensuing yeare, and pronounced as a favourable presage of good fortune to the Forces of his most Catholique Majestie, and it was not long ere the effects proved it to be so: For the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> wisely fore-seeing the Duke of <hi>Parma's</hi> ruine if he should continue his union with <hi>France,</hi> from whence succour would prove desperate, as well by reason of the farre distance thereof, and their want of men, as also of the causes which made for the interests of the <hi>French,</hi> whom it became not, though they had had a greater strength of men, to imploy them in a wasted Countrey, in the midst of their Enemies, without money or requisite Provisions for Warre, the issue whereof would have beene, that the greater part of their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers naturally impatient of suffering, and desirous of chance, would have runne away into the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Churches dominions, and into the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and thus weaken the Ensignes of <hi>France,</hi> and bring them to hard bargaine; And his Highnesse seeing the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> continued with great gallantry to strengthen <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which could not hold out much longer without reliefe, and being lost, would not so easily be redeemed, especially the Citadell, to keepe the which, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not want valide reasons and faire pretences; The great Duke being likewise not pleased, that his Kinsman should be bereaved of his patrimony, nor yet that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should inlarge his dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> he sent more strict Commission to <hi>Pandol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phini,</hi> that he should goe againe to <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and make the Duke see how palpable the danger was that over-hung him, and exhort him to make an accommodation with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom if <hi>Parma</hi> would give him leave, he (the great Duke) would Treat, and make an agreement which should be to his advantage. The Pope likewise, who was troubled that that Citie should be lost for that it held of the Church, ordered Count <hi>Carpegna</hi> to acquaint the Duke how his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, not intending that the fee-Farme-Lands of the Church should be further ruinated, wisht him to thinke of compounding the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; he likewise commanded <hi>Carpegna,</hi> to shew the Duke how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hopes there was succour, and of the performance of the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> promise, as he might daily see by the effects; for though they promised to doe wonders, so to keepe him in league, yet their actions did in no wayes correspond with their words. They at last made him comply with the counsell given him by the Pope and the great Duke, whereupon after many negotiations, in the beginning of <hi>February</hi> the businesse was adjusted, wherein the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was much obliged to the great Duke, who upon this occasion shewed himselfe to be his very good Friend and Kinsman. The <hi>French</hi> were brought out of the Towne under pretence of being mustered, the Duke unexpectedly began to complaine to Monsieur <hi>De S. Paule</hi> of the negligence of his Kings Officers in sending him his due and promised succour, and to shew him how faithfully he had behaved himselfe in the behalfe of <hi>France,</hi> which being done, he dismist all the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> as also out of <hi>Parma,</hi> and all other parts of his dominions, and sent
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:55221:193"/>
them to their owne homes, at which they very much repined, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves to be abused, though the Duke had alwayes behaved himselfe ingenuously, and done all that by his new friendship he was bound to doe; for it is alwayes lawfull for Princes to change their Copy when their States are at the stake. All the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were greatly pleased with this accommodation; for by such ruptures great troubles were likely to have risen in <hi>Italy</hi>; and now the Forces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themselves towards <hi>Piemont,</hi> the other Provinces were at quiet, and their peace was the more firmely established by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the two Crownes; it being the opinion of wisemen, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Potentates ought to indeavour the keeping of these two great Kings at oddes, with equalitie of successe, to the end, that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to Warre within themselves, they may not fall to prejudice lesse powerfull Princes. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> notwithstanding, who proceed leisurely, and wait patiently for occasions, which being by them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely layd hold on, brings them usually no little advantage, did inwardly like well enough of this accommodation; for here their jealousies being buried by the laying downe of Armes, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by their disbanding, their companies increasing, and their confining neighbours growing weaker by the want of those Souldiers, they with much contentment fore-saw, that if Fortune should favour them against the <hi>French,</hi> they should be able to inlarge the limits of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and to secure themselves from Forreigne invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for unarmed Princes, not being able on the sudden to poise up the ballance which panched a little downewards in the declination of the <hi>French</hi> partie, they were confident to bring their desired intents into a safe Haven.</p>
            <p>The accommodation with <hi>Parma</hi> being had, and the <hi>French</hi> being all gone out of that State (disposing of themselves, some one way, some another) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> presently quit their quarters in that State, slighted their Fortifications, and all that belonged unto the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> returned into its former condition. So as not having now any the least colour to keep their Forces on this side diverted, they resolved to proceed on against the <hi>French</hi> withall their might. And because the <hi>French,</hi> by the Fort and Garrison of <hi>Brem,</hi> kept the Territories of <hi>Lomillina</hi> in continuall Contribution, which is a gallant part of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and which for its fertilitie is tearmed the <hi>Granary</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> lying towards <hi>Piemont, Pavia,</hi> and <hi>Montesferrat,</hi> betweene the <hi>Sesia, Tesine,</hi> and the <hi>Poe,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> coveting the said Fort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other parts, as that which flank't upon them, and lay in the most important part of their Frontiers, as well in regard of invasion, (there being none else but <hi>Mortara</hi> which protects <hi>Milan</hi>) as for the safetie of <hi>Montferrat</hi>; for it was probable by reason of Warre, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could never come before <hi>Cassale</hi> if they had not first rid themselves of this; a good strength of men advanced therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Goyna,</hi> and <hi>Leganes</hi> commanded that some already begun workes about <hi>Lumello</hi> should be perfected, whereby <hi>Lumello</hi> might be secured from danger. By which meanes, the excursions of the Garrison of <hi>Brem</hi> should not onely be stopt, but the State of <hi>Milan</hi> being thereby
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:55221:194"/>
more secured on that side, they could not but upon good occasion hope to make use thereof for their more easie taking <hi>Brem</hi>; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people of those parts were therefore trained, and imposed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the defence thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crequi</hi> was much confused when he heard of the D. of <hi>Parma's</hi> acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and seemed to be the more grieved thereat, for that it had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the great advantage of the interest of the <hi>French</hi> Forces, as likewise to the prejudice of his owne honour, for those that were no way concerned in the businesse exclaimed against him for not being willing, or else not able to succour <hi>Parma</hi> as was by all men expected he should, and according as the many promises made unto the Duke required. He therefore went forthwith to <hi>Turin,</hi> and sent newes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to <hi>France,</hi> desiring more men and further orders; and he himselfe soone after, seeing his bad successe in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that his Souldiers by their continuall sufferings were reduced to such a condition, as to the shame of the <hi>French</hi> Chiefetaines, they were seene in tattered rags, and worse lookes to beg in Churches and in the streets, resolved to passe over the Mountaines, and in his owne person acquaint the King with the condition of <hi>Piemont,</hi> as also to desire leave he might returne home: The which notwithstanding he could not obtaine; for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie putting a great esteeme upon so famous a Souldier, and one who had alwayes given extraordinary proofs of himselfe, would not for one turn of Fortune forgoe the hopes which he had in the worth and valour of his good servants. This news being notwithstanding not well liked of at Court, Count <hi>Scotti,</hi> who was sent by the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to solicite the expedition of succour in his behalfe, was committed prisoner, and the Kings Ministers did more carefully apply themselves to the consideration of these affaires. Some were of opinion, that <hi>Crequi</hi> should be dismist and imployed elsewhere, as one that had had but ill successe in those parts, and the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was propounded by some to succeed him, he being one, who growne white in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Warres, had so wisely demeaned himselfe, as his worth and valour caused wonder in many. But this opinion, though peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one of the best, was not followed; For <hi>Rohan,</hi> by reason of the past convulsions of that Kingdom, by his diversitie of Religion, and peradventure through inconstancy of opinion, not having such credit or such supporters in Court as others, who had long before insinuated into the favour of the King &amp; his Ministers of state, had not the fortune to have that imployment, which certainly would have yet raised him to a higher pitch of glory.
<q>For he, though a <hi>French-man,</hi> being no lesse cautious in his proceedings then the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> subtill in the conduct of affaires, diligent in the prevention of mischiefe, assidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and carefull for matter of provisions, and that which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things is most remarkable in a perfect Commander, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of selfe-interest in him, but above measure generous, and no way sensuall or lasciviously given, excellent events must needs have beene expected from his behaviour.</q>
But that <hi>France</hi> might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be so poore in men of worth, as a Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy the precedency before all others: Or were it for that, it was
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:55221:194"/>
not expedient to remove him from the <hi>Grisons,</hi> amongst whom he had wonne great reputation, as being of the same Religion, all further thought of him concerning this affaire ceased.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prospered in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> they did not so in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> for <hi>Gallasse</hi> faring ill in his proceedings in that Province, and being forced to raise the siege which he had laid before Saint <hi>Iohn de Losne,</hi> by reason of the succour which was sent to the Cardinall of <hi>Vallette,</hi> and Duke <hi>Waymer,</hi> under the command of Duke <hi>Longveille</hi>; and it being a difficult matter for him to maintaine himselfe any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with so many people, in a Countrey which was impoverished by the daily quartering of Souldiers, it behoved him to forgoe his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer resolutions, and to returne to <hi>Alsatia</hi>; where not being able (neither) to stay for want of Victuals, hee past on into the Country of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>; and having quartered his Army in the Townes thereabouts, he himselfe went to <hi>Ratisbon</hi> to the Emperour, that hee might be present at their Counsells of Warre, and receive such Commission as he was to observe in the future. When <hi>Waymer</hi> with his Army leaving their quarters in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> marcht speedily into the Countrey of <hi>Burgundy</hi>; and having broken a convoy which was conducted by <hi>Lamboi,</hi> and taken <hi>Ianville,</hi> together with the death of 150 <hi>Burgonians,</hi> he made the <hi>Imperialists</hi> dislodge, who under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Merci</hi> were returned to the Siege of <hi>Montebelgarde.</hi> Hee then with his Forces which were about 8000 Foot and 3000 Horse, left the Cardinall of <hi>Vallette,</hi> and unexpectedly fell into the upper <hi>Alsatia</hi>; and passing over the <hi>Rhyn</hi> at <hi>Basill,</hi> he took <hi>Lausfemburg, Valdsbut,</hi> and <hi>Sickinghem,</hi> places of small defence, and betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the taking of <hi>Rhinfield,</hi> which in a few dayes yeelded unto him, whereat the Papists <hi>Swissers</hi> were much offended, who thought that in regard of the ancient alliance, which the <hi>Helveticke</hi> body or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration holds with the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and for all other respect, the <hi>Austrians</hi> should not have suffered stranger Princes to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached their Townes, and more particularly not <hi>Waymer,</hi> who fighting under the pay of <hi>France,</hi> it was no reason that the Forces of that great King should so dilate themselves, and flanke upon <hi>Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bannier</hi> being retired into <hi>Meckelberg,</hi> and having at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Lesleyes</hi> succour of above 8000 men, and 4000 more being come to him from <hi>Swethland</hi> and <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and being likewise joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Oranghell,</hi> he knew himselfe now strong enough not onely to make defence, but to incounter the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the Emperours Army in the field; hee therefore begun to march, and was seene not farre from the Townes of <hi>Saxony.</hi> Which news when the Elector and <hi>Azfelt</hi> heard, they presently sent forth their Army against the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who came boldly forwards; a great skirmish hapned between the Horse of both parties, wherein whilest the <hi>Saxons</hi> were attentive, and were ready to succour their Companions, the <hi>Swedes</hi> secretly fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to retire themselves into a Wood, came behinde them, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly set upon their Rear, routing, and putting to flight three <hi>Saxon</hi> Regiments which guarded the Baggage, which they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:55221:195"/>
Masters of, and worsted the <hi>Saxons.</hi> But they taking heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and coping with the <hi>Swedish</hi> squadrons, the businesse grew so hot, as it was now no longer doubted, but that it would turne to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Battail; at last the <hi>Swedes</hi> prevailed, &amp; the <hi>Saxons</hi> knowing their disadvantage, kept within some intrencht places, &amp; bravely defending themselves retreated to their quarters, though they lost in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict about 2000 Souldiers, and 400 Carriages; <hi>Bannier</hi> incouraged by this Victory, advanced with the body of his Army, that he might follow the <hi>Saxons</hi> who were got to <hi>Verben,</hi> but he had not the fortune to come up unto them; for they diligently continuing their retreat, were already come neer <hi>Leipsicke,</hi> and into the strong places of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>; where they staid to refresh their men, who were wearied with their sufferings before <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> and in this other action, wherein they had suffered much for want of Victuals; as also to expect the succour which <hi>Ghets</hi> and <hi>Glessing</hi> (two <hi>Imperiall</hi> Captaines) were bringing to them, and which was already come neere to <hi>Erfurt. Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> incouraged by his good successe, and by his daily increase of men, march't forward to <hi>Helmstet,</hi> and then to <hi>Elghen,</hi> Towns not farre from <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> not meeting with any to withstand him; for <hi>Azfelt</hi> who had formerly retreated into those parts, knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be much inferiour to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> had got for his safety into the so famous <hi>Herecinian</hi> Woods, which inviron all <hi>Bohemia.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> at the news of this misfortune well-weighing that it was requisite to bring speedy and fitting remedies, whereby to withstand the incursions which the <hi>Swedes</hi> might make, brought his Militia to <hi>Marsburg</hi> upon the <hi>Sale,</hi> incamped himselfe with his owne men, and the Emperours Forces about <hi>Halla,</hi> having first put good Garrisons into <hi>Verben, Magdeburg, Witemburg,</hi> and <hi>Torgaw.</hi> But <hi>Bannier</hi> not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing these the <hi>Saxons</hi> preparations marched forward as farre as to <hi>Mansfielt,</hi> planted his Cannon against it, and forced it to surrender; as <hi>Glisleben</hi> did likewise afterwards, another Towne in those parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the no small feare of those people, he came to within two Leagues of <hi>Erfurt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such were the proceedings of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Armies, and such were the conditions of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> when the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> being broken up, and his <hi>Caesarian</hi> Majesty after some dayes spent there in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation of affairs of State and Warre, returning somewhat ill to <hi>Vienna,</hi> at last, when it was hoped he was upon the mending hand, was seized on by a great cold, which occasioned in him a violent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whereupon being now 59 yeares old, and much weake in body, he soone after upon the 14 of <hi>February</hi> dyed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 14.</note> to the great discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not onely of all the Princes and people of <hi>Germany,</hi> but also of many strangers.
<q>For truly he was one of the most religious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that ever was in Christendome, and so much interessed for the preservation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Faith, as that for having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preferr'd Religion, and divine Worship, before his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of State, he instead of peace, had the continuall vexations of Warre; wherein increasing in glory (the King of <hi>Swethland</hi> not being yet entred <hi>Germany,</hi> nor <hi>Walesteine</hi> being discharged from his
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:55221:195"/>
place of Generall) all <hi>Germany</hi> appeared to reverence, and bow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which none of his predecessors had obtained, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them had indeavoured it. Hee was a Prince of a sanguine, and manlike complexion, of a middle stature, and Majesticall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; his exercises were Hunting, and Musicke; the one for the exercise of his body, and the delight he took therein, the other for the glory of God, and to solace his spirit, bent upon the interest of the Empire; in these he spent the idle houres of his Reigne, and much Mony. Who beheld him could not chuse but love him, and whosoever heard him speake must confesse hee was beholding to him; his presence was affable, his look mild, his voice pleasing, his gesture grave and comely, attracting the good will of lookers on in all his actions. Hee lived 18 yeares a crowned Emperour, in which time he constantly maintained six Warres, in five of which he was victorious; to wit, against <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania</hi>; against the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and those that sided with him in <hi>Bohemia</hi>; against <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> the chiefe leader of a League of foure Kings; against <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi>; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the D. of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and at last against the King of <hi>Swethland</hi>; in which Warre, if in the Battaile of <hi>Leipsick,</hi> and in other incounters, his Armies had the worst, it was easily seen, that the blame and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice of the Warre of <hi>Mantua,</hi> whereunto he was perswaded by the selfe-interest of his Ministers of State, could not escape unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and unrevenged before the Tribunall of Justice; nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions used by his Souldiers in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and left unpunished; which proves that such as were mercilesse, and blowne up with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and ambition, would have Idolatrised in the triumphs of their owne glory. Some affirme, that as in his former successes and victories, no whit at all varying from his accustomed and naturall modesty, he devoutly paid his acknowledgements to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by thanksgiving, that he no lesse in these his adversities and last misfortunes, did praise and glorify him, whereby hee wonne unto himselfe deserved credit. Hee had wont to say to those that brought him any ill tidings, 'tis good, 'tis Gods pleasure, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> contented. Hee termed those unhappy who dyed happy, and those fortunate who died without fortune. In his Court, charity, devotion, and piety did flourish. Hee was glorious in pardoning, nor did he ever more freely pardon, then when the offenders hoped least therein; his indeavours were to have faire repute, not to be magnified or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. Neither did he desire by his victories so much to inlarge his Dominions, as to increase his power of shewing mercy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>None of his predecessors did ever exceed him in generosity of minde, in extending favours, in the well accepting of actions, and in sincerity of good will. His rewarding services received, his magnanimity of honouring such as deserved well, and his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of affection to his faithfull servants, were so many Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets to invite unto his service even those that lived most remote from him. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was so very good and requisite in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that his people they wonderfully loved him, out of meere
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55221:196"/>
gratitude.

the like on the other side, they might bring their busines to good effect. And when they should prosper in their designes of taking <hi>Milan</hi> from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> they might the more freely afterwards throw off their counterfeit Maske, with the which wisemen upon occasion ought to cover their actions. But as the felicitie of Princes doth by hopes and confidence puzle the fore-sight of the wisely advised, these reasons were over-borne by other reasons. For those who were of a contrary opinion, and who did not believe that <hi>Rohan</hi> ought to be sent thither, as one who was acceptable to the Nation; nor that those ought not to be trusted, who pretending to governe themselves onely according to their owne interest, would as willingly have applyed their mind to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Pistolls, as to the <hi>French</hi> Crownes. And they further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That it being hoped that the State of <hi>Venice</hi> would at last declare themselves for their King, it would be a most considerable point to perfect the enterprise of the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> That the <hi>Grisons</hi> would never dare to undertake so dangerous a busines against <hi>Rohan,</hi> not only a wel-wisher of theirs, but (which imports much) in great esteem, and much feared by every one, having the strong holds in his possession, and upon such an occasion likely to be assisted by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had many Souldiers upon those Confines. And it was thought they would not suffer the <hi>French</hi> to be driven from thence, because if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should get footing there, they should be debarr'd those passages, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would grow the greater. But thoughts which are built upon bare opinion, and raysed onely upon hopes, not being established upon the interest of others, were of no validitie; for the <hi>Grison</hi> Captaines and Colonells laying claime to much money, and others who were destined to have the government, claiming the restitution of the <hi>Valteline</hi> according to promise, they mutined, and betaking themselves to Armes throughout all <hi>Rhetia,</hi> they secured the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> in the Fort of <hi>Maynfelt,</hi> and behaved themselves so, as the <hi>French</hi> to escape being buried in those Valleyes, were inforced to forsake them, and to returne to their owne Kings Dominions; and thus was this Valley freed in the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> and the <hi>Grisons</hi> Garrisons entred thereinto, and recovered their libertie, which was not in their power to doe whilst it leaned upon the protection of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All feares and jealousies caused in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the Armes of <hi>France,</hi> under the command of <hi>Rohan,</hi> seemed to cease; and <hi>Rohan</hi> not being able to escape from <hi>Coira,</hi> whither he was brought from <hi>Maynfelt</hi> as an hostage, there to remaine untill such time as his men were gone out of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> to his great griefe failed in a designe he had by intelligence with a great friend of his, one Colonell <hi>Smith</hi> of <hi>Zurick,</hi> who was then keeper of the said Castle in the behalfe of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> with whom he had secretly wrought, that the said Fort should be kept for the <hi>French</hi> party, by which means he might easily again re-enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rhetia,</hi> &amp; revenge himself for the injuries he had received, by means of <hi>Waymers</hi> Army, which was not farre from the <hi>Grisons,</hi> though the Fort were in the <hi>Grisons</hi> power, and the <hi>French</hi> already past over the <hi>Rhyn.</hi> The passage of the <hi>Valteline</hi> being thus freed, by which way the

               <hi>Dutch</hi> might with most ease passe to the succour of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> which till then the <hi>French</hi> had gaine-said; The <hi>Spainsh</hi> Forces were dis-ingaged which were kept there to wait upon the <hi>French,</hi> and might to their great advantage be sent towards <hi>Piemont.</hi> The consequences which were concerned in the intelligence, held betweene the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> being vanished by his late peace made with <hi>Spaine,</hi> that diversion being taken away, which occasioned the keeping of a great part of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army on that side, and the succession of the Empire being provided for in the person of the Sonne of the late <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> by the Election of the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> no greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment could in these present emergencies befall the <hi>Austrians,</hi> nor was it possible for them to become more famous, then by having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come three such difficulties which had not a little troubled them.</p>
            <p>These successes did therefore so exalt the <hi>Austrians</hi> hopes, as they thought it not onely an easie matter to drive the <hi>French</hi> to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the Mountaines, and to secure <hi>Flanders,</hi> but also to beat back the <hi>Swedes</hi> beyond the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea. And to effect these vast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, <hi>Piccolomini</hi> and <hi>Wert</hi> were sent for back into <hi>Flanders,</hi> the one or them Generall to the Emperour, the other to <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who a little before were come from the Low-Countries for the affaires of the Empire to their Masters Dominions, so to guard those Provinces the better from being invaded by the <hi>French,</hi> as likewise, if Fortune should prove propitious, to undertake somewhat in <hi>France,</hi> and to get some of the Forts of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not indure should be in the power of the <hi>French</hi>: For besides that, <hi>France</hi> was thereby increased by the addition of a good Dukedome, lying betweene <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> those Provinces were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently much weakned by that division. They therefore sent Foot and Horse by the way of <hi>Navarre</hi> against <hi>France,</hi> to re-inforce the Siege before <hi>Bayon,</hi> intending, if not to proceed further, at least to divert the Army of <hi>France</hi> from that side.</p>
            <p>After the fight and rout given to <hi>Azfelt, Bannier</hi> advanced cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully towards <hi>Turingia,</hi> where he had already taken <hi>Mansfelt</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt,</hi> and other places of those Provinces; wherefore <hi>Ghets</hi> and <hi>Glissing,</hi> who were then with about 10000 men in <hi>France,</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded when the Forces should be gotten together which were in the <hi>Hercinian</hi> Woods, to joyne themselves with the <hi>Saxons</hi> Army (which after the taking of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> was about <hi>Marsburg</hi> and <hi>Halla,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh it selfe for the sufferings it had indured before that Towne) and to oppose the Enemies proceedings. And because <hi>Orenghell</hi> also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-runne <hi>Slesia</hi> with a great strength of <hi>Swedes,</hi> to the great prejudice of those people, the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Commanders, who had the charge of guarding that Province, were commanded to take what men they could from the neighbouring Garrisons, and joyne with other Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who were already on their way from <hi>Moravia,</hi> and with all diligence to oppose <hi>Orenghells</hi> furthers proceedings: So as the <hi>Austrians</hi> thought they had done reason on this side, by the assistance of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandemburg,</hi> and of those other people which they had sent to those parts, the rather to keep those Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors

in their loyaltie, then totally to drive the <hi>Swedes</hi> from such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theirs as they were possest of: By reason whereof, some more speculative then others, gave out, that the <hi>Austrians</hi> intentions were grounded upon a strong reason of state, to keepe the Warre still on foot in this part, for that the mischiefes thereof being nourished in the State of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Duke whereof was a Protestant Prince, and at the present, one of the powerfullest of all the Empire, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey having preserved it selfe better then any other from the miseries of Warre, by which all other places had beene greatly wasted, it was likely his strength might be weakned; and that afterwards the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France</hi> being compounded, the Emperour might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily bring all <hi>Germany</hi> to his obedience; the Princes whereof, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their past-sufferings, would not be able to weigh against the <hi>Austrian</hi> power; and as it is usuall for the weakest to tollerate more the actions of great ones, so it would behove them to respect <hi>Caesars</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie more then formerly; And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> chiefe aime being to preserve <hi>Alsatia</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to drive the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> having thus provided for the urgencies of <hi>Germany,</hi> they set themselves wholly upon the getting of <hi>Piemont.</hi> Those people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being drawne out, who after the retreat from <hi>Piacenza,</hi> were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Territories of <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Lodiggian,</hi> and a new inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some Companies which came from <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the State of <hi>Milan, Leganes</hi> resolved, when he should have perfected the Fortifications spoken of about <hi>Lumello,</hi> a Bridge should be throwne over the <hi>Tessine</hi> at <hi>Sesto,</hi> a Towne neere the greater Lake, that he might make use thereof, in the more speedy leading of the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> which were expected from <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Swabenland,</hi> into the Territories of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> at any time when he should betake himselfe to the taking in of that place, where in the neighbouring Townes he resolved to lodge them: And therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with a part of his Army to <hi>Pavia,</hi> he commanded <hi>Emilius Ghedini,</hi> who was in the parts of <hi>Allessandria,</hi> with some <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies belonging to <hi>Ghelidas</hi> his Regiment, and some other <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Troopes, to advance to before <hi>Ponsone,</hi> a Castle situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Langhe,</hi> between <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Allessandria,</hi> and that he should indeavour to take it, as a place of much consideration upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasions; for he thereby the better secured the communication of the Havens of <hi>Vado, Finale,</hi> and <hi>Codoretto,</hi> with the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> At the appearing of these men, the Towne suddenly yeelded, which wanting fitting Fortifications could not hold out; the <hi>French</hi> retired themselves into the Castle, which being incompassed with great Towers, and seated on high, suffered not the <hi>Sapniards</hi> at the first to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance further; whereupon <hi>Ghedini</hi> staying in the Towne, and making himselfe master of such passes by which <hi>Crequis</hi> men might come to the succour of that Castle, he speedily advertised the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> thereof, who likewise fearing that it might be succoured by the <hi>French</hi> (for the losse hereof would be a greater detriment to them for the aforesaid reasons) sent <hi>Don Martin d' Aragona,</hi> Generall of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery thither, with such Forces as he had with him about <hi>Pavia</hi>; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the arrivall of which strength, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> presently planted their Cannon against the Castle, which after some days defence, no relief ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, yeelded, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were masters thereof to <hi>Crequi's</hi> great griefe, who was come from <hi>Cassalle</hi> to <hi>Turine,</hi> expecting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves of his King, which by reason of the agreement made by <hi>Parma,</hi> he thought might be altered; and fore-seeing, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened by their successes, following their good fortune, might easily fall upon some greater enterprise before the <hi>French</hi> could receive fresh supplyes, he sent the Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> with 4000 Foot and 1000 Horse, to observe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> proceedings in those parts. And because for want of pay his Souldiers did daily disband, and those that remained with him were discontent, and greatly complaining of the miseries they suffered, he sent againe an expresse messenger to desire leave of his Majestie to returne home, which as he himselfe by his own mouth could not obtain, so neither was it granted by these his desires. He had notwithstanding good words given him, and some moneys sent him, with which the Souldiers were satisfied, and seemed againe to renew their courage, and he himselfe re-assumed that confidence, which to say truth he had never layd downe. And because to boot with the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies that the <hi>French</hi> had of the Duke of <hi>Savoyes</hi> actions, they had the Jesuits in some suspition, &amp; more particularly one Father who had formerly beene the Dukes Confessor, and was now one of the bosome Counsellours to the Dutches; suspecting therefore that these Jesuits might imploy themselves wholly in Spaniolising those of <hi>Piemont,</hi> they secretly desired the Dutches, that she would dismisse that Father the Court, and they themselves had a better eye to the proceedings and actions of such Monasticks.</p>

many in keeping of those places he had tane, as his Army amounted to little more then 10000 men, they therefore approved not of the Counsell of some, that incited thereunto rather out of foole-hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then reason, were desirous to fight, and not to appeare cowardly by retreating; but the <hi>Swedish</hi> Commanders did more maturely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve not to waite the comming of the <hi>Imperialists</hi>; and therefore raising their Tents from where they were pitcht, the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army retreated to between <hi>Leipsick</hi> and <hi>Torgaw</hi>; and <hi>Bannier</hi> knowing that without more addition of men, he was not able to fight against an Army of above 20000 men, he called Major-Generall <hi>Stalans</hi> in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his helpe, who was attending what the Duke of <hi>Luneburg</hi> would doe, (who having quitted the <hi>Swedish</hi> party, and joyned himselfe with the Emperour, and having already taken <hi>Mulhusem</hi> upon the River <hi>Vnstrat,</hi> from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> used all manner of hostility against them) <hi>Bannier</hi> fortified himselfe in these parts, to keep there till such time as he might bring the Corne of the neighbouring Townes into <hi>Stetin</hi> whether he meant to withdraw himselfe, and backt thereby, together with the benefit of the Sea, to withstand the <hi>Austrians</hi> further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.

came to 20000 Souldiers, and went thitherward; they set upon the trenches which were before the Bridge, where they found such opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it behoved them to retreat with much losse.

            <p>The <hi>French,</hi> who to boot with their Forces, had a powerfull Navy at Sea, sailing at this time with some Galliownes, and 12 Gallies from the Haven of <hi>Tolone</hi> to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> came unexpectedly to shore upon the said Island, and having landed 2000 Foot, they without any gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say made themselves Masters of the Haven of <hi>Orestan,</hi> a place of no strength, and abandoned by the Inhabitants by reason of the unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somenesse of the Aire: but considering afterwards how it would be hard for them to get further footing there, as also that they could not well keep themselves in that Island, in succour whereof <hi>Leganes</hi> had already sent some Captaines, and Ingineers, to boot with orders gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Signior <hi>Gianatin Doria,</hi> to have an eye with his Gallies to the preservation thereof, they therefore went from thence, and making towards the Island of Saint <hi>Marguerit,</hi> and landing advantagiously there, they possest themselves of a Fort which was not long before built by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for the preservation thereof; and from thence going before another Fort-Royall which was but negligently looked unto, and <hi>Doria</hi> not being able to bring it necessary succour, they made themselves Masters of it, as they did also of the Island Saint <hi>Honorè,</hi> an Island in the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> over against <hi>Provence.</hi>

And knowing it was behovefull to advise of such expeditions as would be most advantagious for the continuation of the Warre already begun, and which he inherited from his father, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst so many, and so powerfull Enemies, he sent for <hi>Piccolomini</hi> from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> for <hi>Wert</hi> from the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> for <hi>Gallasse</hi> from the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> and for all the other chiefe Commanders, with whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving held divers consultations, and resolved on the way that was to be

               </gap>ee failed not afterwards to make use of such meanes as might make most for his advantage, in those streights whereunto the Empire was reduced. Hee ratified the same good correspondency which his Father held with the Electors, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dependant Princes; being desirous to hold good corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> hee condiscended to her just desires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the intertainment of her Embassadours in ordinary, in that Court. And in respect that they had chosen Signior <hi>Giovanni Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,</hi> a Senator highly esteemed of in that Republique, of deep wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and greatly eloquent, to be their extraordinary Embassadour, hee dispatcht away Count <hi>Rabatta,</hi> a Gentleman of approved worth and wisedome for his Embassadour in ordinary to that State. Signior <hi>Rainero Zen, Procurator</hi> of Saint <hi>Marck,</hi> and <hi>Angelo Canterini,</hi> both of them chiefe Senators, were sent from <hi>Venice,</hi> the one to condole the Fathers death, the other to congratulate the assumption of the sonne into the Empire, and were received with unusuall civilities, and great expressions of courtesie. Hee moreover shewed his good inclination to a universall peace; and to this purpose did confirme and ratifie the Election made by his father of the Plenipotentiaries at the Covention which was to be held at <hi>Cullen</hi>; as likewise did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were then very ready, and well disposed towards the Peace of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And instead of the Duke of <hi>Alcala</hi> (who falling sicke upon the way died in <hi>Villacco,</hi> as he was going to <hi>Vienna,</hi> that he might from thence go to <hi>Cullen,</hi> at which the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and as many as knew his great worth and endowments, were very much grieved) they chose Signior <hi>Don Francisco di Melo,</hi> a man highly esteemed aswel for his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as for his Chivalry. He comming at this time from <hi>Spaine</hi> to the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> where not many Moneths before he had resided, went in company of the great Chancellour of <hi>Milan</hi> towards <hi>Cullen</hi>; though afterwards the rest not appearing who were to be present there, hee altered his way and went into <hi>Flanders</hi> as shall be said here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Yet were these the <hi>Austrians</hi> hopes, affirmed (by those who maintaine they ought not to be trusted unto nor believed) to be arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall; who gave out that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> seeing their affaires fadged but ill favouredly, did but thus indeavour to fence themselves from the hatred which other Princes bare them for their great desire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing their Dominion. And because some discord begun to break forth in <hi>Hungary,</hi> between the Papists and Protestants of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as likewise to provide for other affaires of that Crowne, and to have an eye unto the Consines and Frontiers of the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> the Emperour summoned a Diet at <hi>Presburg,</hi> the Metropolitan of that Province; He moderated the excesse in hunting and musicke; in briefe
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:55221:200"/>
he gave signes of being a Prince deserving that Crowne, and of being very well inclined to the government of the Empire, and the good of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grisons,</hi> being (now that the <hi>French</hi> were gone out of <hi>Rhetia</hi>) free masters of all the Forts, &amp; of indeed all the <hi>Valteline,</hi> saw it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for them to be upon good tearmes with the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> without which it would be in vaine for them to dreame of peacefully possessing that Valley; for they would either easily be driven from thence by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or else to maintain it, it would behove them to have recourse to Forreigne ayde, and particularly to the <hi>French,</hi> who being warned by their past-proceedings, would either refuse to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them, or else being by reason of state to lend them assistance, they must expect to be demanded such large conditions as the <hi>Grisons</hi> should not easily afterwards remove the <hi>French</hi> from those holds in which they should againe have nestled themselves; so as to shun the being domineered over by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> they must fall under the yoake of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They therefore wisely weighing what meanes would be best fitting for them to maintaine their libertie (which, though they were a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous people and bare of money, they loved more then gold) they resolved before they should slight those Forts, wherein they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves kept Garrisons, to send Embassadours to <hi>Milan</hi> to agree with the Agents of <hi>Spaine,</hi> what course they had best take for the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> thinking that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would feare that they might againe fall under the protection of the <hi>French,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would be glad to comply with them upon any conditions. But because the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents had not, or feigned not to have authority from <hi>Spaine,</hi> to resolve this affaire, or were it their desire to procrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Treatie, and entertaine the <hi>Grisons</hi> with words and hopes, that they might advise with time, of which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions make no little use, they wisely prolonged all resolution, that they might see what their successe would be against the <hi>French,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereunto they might highten their pretentions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Frederick Enriques,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassadour with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Dutchesse <hi>Claudia</hi> in <hi>Ispurch,</hi> was sent for to <hi>Milan,</hi> as one who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly interceded in accords made with the <hi>Grisons,</hi> did very well understand those affaires; and in the meane time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made very much of the Embassadours, entertaining them at the Kings charge, as it is usuall with Princes to doe, that they may captivate the good will of such State Ministers as are with them, to negotiate such affaires as concerne their owne interest, though their resolutions were to send them to the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where they might be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously received by the King, and sent satisfied away; to the end, that they might the meane while take some order with the Forts of <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vena, Tirano, Sondrio</hi> and <hi>Grossetto,</hi> and demolish <hi>La Riva</hi> and <hi>Mantello,</hi> as situated too neere the State of <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Treaties with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were much prejudiciall to the <hi>French,</hi> who to boot with being deluded by the <hi>Grisons</hi> through their good correspondeny with the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> were to meet with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:55221:201"/>
difficulties in what they were to undertake in these parts, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the passages lay open to the succour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and of the State of <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rohan,</hi> who at this time entertained himselfe privately and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, sometimes in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> sometimes with Duke <hi>Waymer,</hi> was commanded to re-assume, by the meanes of his Protestant friends, a friendship with the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and to divert them from their begun-Treaties with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> offering them money, and upon any need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full occasion sufficient aide to maintaine their libertie; for it no wayes complyde with the <hi>French,</hi> that they should contract friendship with the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> In obedience whereunto, <hi>Rohan</hi> used his best dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie; but for that the favours of private men doe seldome subvert the reasons of a State, especially of Common-Wealths, who being alwayes jealous of their libertie, know no greater obligations then those which tend to the preservation of themselves, nor never mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing save the publique interest, his ingenious negotiations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not. For the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dubloones, working more upon particular affection then did <hi>French</hi> Crowns, and the publique aime being to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that in peace which they had at last with so much labour regained, they were contented not to imbroile themselves in new affaires. And the correspondency with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whilest they maintained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves quietly in their owne possessions, did better suit with the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> then correspondency with the <hi>French,</hi> whose state lay farre from theirs, and from whose Kingdome they could not reape that profit which they did from the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Territories, and from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>; for they being a poore people, their greatest incomes lye in their Traffique with those of <hi>Milan,</hi> and of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of merchandize which passe from <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> and in many passe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, <hi>Rohan</hi> more incenst against them then ever, failed not to presse,
<q>That his King ought no longer to Treat with them who did with such disparitie correspond to benefits received; That great Princes ought to secure themselves of their interessed friends fidelities by force; that way was to be made by Armes where negotiations could not prevaile.</q>
And insisting, That the <hi>French</hi> should againe march with their Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Valteline,</hi> he propounded, That <hi>Waymers</hi> Army was sufficient to that purpose, with which entring afterwards on this side into the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> those of <hi>Piemont</hi> by such a diversion, might easily much advantage themselves, and totally confound that State; but such considerations proceeding from <hi>Rohans</hi> passion, who impatient to live idlely after so many Victories, and so great a renowne, was by his valour and animositie incited to the contrary, were not approved of. For <hi>Waymer</hi> had occasion enough to imploy himselfe in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> the getting whereof was of greater importance to the <hi>French</hi> then was the <hi>Valteline,</hi> not engaging himselfe among the unpassable Mountains of <hi>Rhetia</hi>; for if he should once set upon them, besides the difficulties
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:55221:201"/>
of bringing Cannon, Ammunition, and the streightnesse of passage, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under pretence of assisting the <hi>Grisons</hi> might get footing there, which would rather be the way to effect the <hi>Austrians</hi> ends then to satisfie the <hi>French-mens</hi> aimes. But <hi>Rohan</hi> still continuing his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against the <hi>Grisons,</hi> having grievously complained of them to the <hi>Switzers</hi> of <hi>Zurick,</hi> and to every one that he spake withall, he gave out, that going blindly to work, they themselves did hammer out a Chain, wherewith afterwards they should find themselves fastened to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will. To which purpose, I will not omit the extract of a Letter written by the said <hi>Rohan</hi> from <hi>Zurick,</hi> to an <hi>Italian</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the contents whereof were:

The Garrison marched out with their Armes and Baggage, and retired to <hi>Cassalle,</hi> to the no little resentment of the <hi>French,</hi> who blaming the Governour thereof for his distrust of succour, tooke it ill that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did not punish him, by way of example to others. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having left some Souldiers to defend this place, divided their Army into two parts; with the one of which, <hi>Leganes</hi> came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Alba,</hi> a Citie of <hi>Montferrat</hi>; and with the other, <hi>Don Martine d' Aragona</hi> went to the taking in of <hi>Agliano,</hi> a Fort, by reason of its si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, and in respect of the present times, of great importance. And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knowing of what consequence <hi>Nizza</hi> was in these present emergencies, they resolved to keepe it, and began to fortifie there, and by the taking thereof, the Garrisons of <hi>Montegrosso</hi> and <hi>Castiole,</hi> being of no use, they tooke them away. And the Passe at <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale</hi> in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> being of mighty consideration, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they might the better secure it, sent the Regiments of the Princes <hi>Reignold</hi> and <hi>Borso,</hi> from <hi>Este</hi> into the <hi>Langhe,</hi> that they might there watch over the proceedings of the <hi>French,</hi> over whom <hi>Crequi,</hi> after his desires thrice to the contrary, had his Commission of command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; He therefore made all possible preparations to drive back the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into the State of <hi>Milan</hi>; and <hi>Leganes</hi> rising without any fruit from before <hi>Alba,</hi>

            <p>A reciprocall and affectionate correspondency was now more then ever held, betweene the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> and the States of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces of <hi>Holland</hi>; and in this present conjuncture, their clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest intelligence tended to the lessening of the <hi>Spanish</hi> greatnesse; wherefore their intentions were, that the one of them should set upon <hi>Flanders</hi> on one part, whilest the other did the like in another part, that so they might divert the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, and consequently make their other resolved on enterprises lesse difficult. The Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> went therefore unexpectly forth with many Boats which were provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Dordrech</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>; and having imbarqued many Souldiers therein, he made towards <hi>Flushing</hi>; and from thence, comming pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:55221:202"/>
to shore upon the strond of the Marish, which lies between <hi>Sluce</hi> and the River <hi>Scheld,</hi> he indeavoured the taking of <hi>Hulst,</hi> a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fort, which lies upon the Confines of <hi>Flanders</hi> towards <hi>Zealand,</hi> which if it should have fallen into the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hands, it lying neere the Marish, and bordering upon <hi>Brabant,</hi> they might the easilier have besieged <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> and done other greater matters in <hi>Flanders</hi>; but they being discovered failed in the enterprise, and the Prince find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no good to bee done here, returned to his former Quarters.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> being upon this agreement advertised of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> preparations, entred <hi>Hannault,</hi> tooke many Towns, and appeared before <hi>Cambray,</hi> threatning as if they had had some designe upon that place, the maintaining whereof (it being the very key which opens and shuts the ingresse into <hi>Flanders,</hi>) put the <hi>Infante</hi> to his trumpes, for hee knew the Forces of <hi>Flanders</hi> were not of themselves alone able to defend themselves against so numerous a <hi>French</hi> Army on the one side, and from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> who were very powerfull on the other. Hereupon he renewed his importunities at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which being by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents represented to the Emperour, obtained orders from him to <hi>Piccolomini,</hi> (who had haulted with 10000 Souldiers in the circle of the <hi>Rhyn</hi> to observe whether the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Waymer</hi> would enter into <hi>Franconia</hi> or no) that he should march to succour the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> where it should be most requisit. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves deceived in their intention upon <hi>Hulst,</hi> and being advertised that the <hi>French</hi> had betaken themselves to the taking in of <hi>Landresi,</hi> (a strong place, considerably situated, lying upon the Frontiers of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi> by which to boot with their better securing the Confines of <hi>Picardy,</hi> they opened the way to greater matters) and that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already begun to set upon it, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were upon their march to succour it, who that they might appear with more men in the field, had drawne out many from their Garrisons, they indeavoured to take the Fort <hi>Philippina,</hi> placed to withstand the incursions which those of the Garrison of <hi>Sluce</hi> might make; but they failed therein; for the <hi>Infante</hi> comming to the succour of it, whereby the worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came difficult, they quit their designes on that part; and being by secret intelligence certified, that <hi>Breda</hi> had but a small Garrison in it, and that it wanted many things requisit for Warre, they be thought themselves how they might recover so important a strength. To this purpose all things necessary for the enterprise being provided, the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> imbarked the Army which hee had led into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and went to <hi>Bergenopsome,</hi> and from thence about the end of <hi>Iuly</hi> incamped himselfe before that Fort. Where before the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could gather their Forces together, or thinke how to succour the Towne, he had so well intrenched himselfe round about it, as it was easily discerned he meant to keep there close to his tacklings. About this time the marriage between <hi>Vlidislaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>Cicely</hi> the late Emperours Daughter and this mans Sister was concluded; which was effected with reciprocall content to the <hi>Polander,</hi> that hee might keep on Foot his correspondency with the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> by the assistance whereof he might in time promise himselfe some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:55221:203"/>
good. For when the Warres in <hi>Germany</hi> should be quieted, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> under pretence of bringing in aid from <hi>Germany</hi> for the Warre which he was to resume againe with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, might by thus introducing of Forraine Armies, easily in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting time force his Parliaments to make that Kingdome be heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him and his, which now was but elective. And this alliance with so neighbouring and confining a King was good for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in regard of the supply of men which hee might expect from his Brother in law, now that <hi>Germany</hi> was thereof so exhausted. Prince <hi>Casimire</hi> the Kings Brother, who came to <hi>Vienna</hi> on the 24th of <hi>Iuly</hi> attended on by many Nobles and Cavaliers of that Kingdome,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iuly</hi> 24.</note> did therefore marry the Queen in his Brothers name, and carried her from thence in great pompe into <hi>Poland</hi> to her Husband.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> fought prosperously in the Lowe-Countries, the <hi>Austrians</hi> were not abandoned by fortune along the <hi>Rhyn</hi>; for <hi>Iohn de Wert</hi> constantly continuing his siege before <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesteime,</hi> had reduced those within the Towne to such a condition as they could no longer hold out for hunger, nor had they any hope of succour. For the Fort being in the midst of the Territories possest by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> not being likely to bring their Forces into a Country farre distant from their Frontiers, and full of Townes garrisoned by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> not having any place to retreat unto for safety; and on the other hand, the Landsgrave of <hi>Hessen</hi> being held in play by the Marquis <hi>Grana,</hi> and not able to move thitherward, unlesse he should forsake his State and leave it to the discretion of the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists</hi>; the <hi>French</hi> Governour that commanded in Chiefe therein, called unto him all the Officers of the Garrison, and acquainting them in what condition the Towne was, wanting Victuals, and having no hope of being relieved, they jointly agreed to give up the place, before they should be brought into a greater streight, and whilest they might have good conditions from the <hi>Enemy</hi>; there was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Parle propounded, wherein the besieged and the besiegers dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon tearmes; but <hi>Wert</hi> wisely knowing that Military affairs are subject to unexpected accidents, and that no cavill ought to be had with such as demand conditions, and that his longer stay there would turne to his prejudice, the Articles were agreed on upon the 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iun.</hi> 21.</note> that the <hi>French</hi> were to march forth with their Armes and Baggage, and be convoyed to <hi>Orsoi</hi>; and the Forces of the Elector of <hi>Cullen</hi> were to enter the Towne, and to keep it, till such time as the Elector of <hi>Triers</hi> were either remitted into his State, or that some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should succeed in his place; which when it should so fall out, the Elector of <hi>Cullen</hi> was bound to restore it to its proper owner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wert</hi> having by the taking of this strong hold freed himselfe of all impediments that his Army could meet withall in those parts, and consequently being able to betake himselfe to what hee should thinke best; knowing likewise that hee should doe no good, in going against <hi>France,</hi> the Frontiers wherof were very wel provided for; thought there was no enterprise more fitting, nor wherein hee was likely to speed better then in that of <hi>Hannaw,</hi> a place of great importance, and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:55221:203"/>
wherein there was an experienced Governour, and a gallant Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who, with their frequent excursions, did not onely keep that Country, but the neighbouring Territories in continuall watch and ward. Hee therefore leaving <hi>Hermesteime,</hi> marched with his men, which might amount to about 8000, thitherward, and being come to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> hee quartered his Souldiers some few dayes upon the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages of the Landsgrave of <hi>Darmestat,</hi> a little to refresh them, and the better to inable them for what they were to doe. Advancing forward to the <hi>Mayne</hi> hee beset <hi>Selinghestat,</hi> between <hi>Franckfort</hi> and <hi>Ashburg,</hi> wherein was a <hi>Swedish</hi> Garrison, and having throwne downe the walls, and the defendants having valiantly withstood two Assaults, they would not try their fortune in the third, which was preparing to bee given them, but upon agreement yeelded it upon condition of march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth without the beat of Drum, or Matches lighted but they kept not this condition, for in their march one of their Drummers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of forgetfulnesse, then for any reason there was thereof beat up his Drum; at which the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> as those who when they finde an advantage imbrace any occasion whereby they may honest their actions, making this their pretence, took forthwith all the <hi>Swedes</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, pillaged the Captaines and Officers, and mixt the Souldiers amongst their owne Companies; Whence it may be observed how requisite solidnesse and wisedome is in Military affaires, without which all indeavours are in vaine. Passing after this over the <hi>Mayne</hi> they invironed <hi>Hannaw</hi> on all sides, and presently indeavouring to surprise a little Fort which the <hi>Swedes</hi> had built without the Gates, they were so briskly received, as that with the losse of 50 men, they were inforced to retreat in such disorder, as the Governour percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, he made the Garrison fall upon them, who had time, before the others could beat them backe into the City, to get some Corn and bring it into the Fort. Yet this their gallandise was soone quelled, for <hi>Wert</hi> advancing in person himselfe, hee drew his lines neerer the Fort, and securing them with perfect Trenches, hee used the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse so as the <hi>Swedes</hi> prospered not in their sallies, as they did before; for they alwayes came off with the worst, and were forced to retreat with losse of honour.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Waymer</hi> hearing of <hi>Iohn de Werts</hi> proceedings, and how he had besieged <hi>Hannaw,</hi> hee presently rose from his quarters which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Remiremont</hi> in <hi>Lorayne,</hi> and was desirous to succour this Fort which had alwayes kept faithfull to the <hi>Swedish</hi> party, whilest all the rest either basely or voluntarily yeelded to the <hi>Caesarians,</hi> and therefore it deserved to be succoured. To this purpose hee came to <hi>Hagg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>naw,</hi> and whilest he thought to passe over the <hi>Rhyn</hi> at the Bridge at <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> the Passage was denied him by the Magistrate of that City, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence that those Citizens intending to keep neutrals, and not to declare themselves, either for the one, or the other side, they would shun the occasion of being prejudicialll to either of them. At which <hi>Waymer</hi> very much wondring, for upon all other occasions hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all manner of helpe from that City, hee desired to know what the alteration might be which had made them put on this resolution.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55221:204"/>
But the communality of that City, desirous peacefully to preserve the liberty which they for so many yeares had enjoyed, wisely foresaw, that if the <hi>French</hi> should get the upper hand of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and should drive them farre from the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> their City should run a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of losing its Franchise; and they therefore desired that neither the <hi>French</hi> should grow stronger in those parts, nor the <hi>Austrians</hi> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; for their Towne being free, as in the midst between too great extreams, would alwayes be defended by the one of them, against the injuries that should be offered her by the other; and each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive advantage from her situation, they would both of them strive who should most win her good will. <hi>Waymer</hi> failing herein, and it not being now time to shew how ill hee tooke it, hee returned to his former quarters in <hi>Lorayne,</hi> and marched from thence, towards the Bishopricke of <hi>Basill,</hi> intending to passe the <hi>Rhyn</hi> there, and then to doe what he should thinke fittest to make <hi>Wert</hi> leave <hi>Hannaw</hi> by way of diversion, or else to doe somewhat himselfe that might coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise the losse of that Towne. But the Duke of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> who had with him some seven or eight thousand men for the preservation of the rest of the Country, foreseeing this, studied how he might hinder <hi>Waymer</hi> in this his voyage. Hee to this purpose went to meet the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and indeavouring to withstand them with more courage then force, hee at the first encounter lost about 400 men, and the rest being fearfull, he found his designe vaine; so as quitting the field unto the <hi>Swedes,</hi> left hee might meet with greater losse, he betooke himselfe to strong holds. Whereupon <hi>Waymer,</hi> by reason of this so happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, changing his purpose of falling into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> haulted, and sent his Horse to Pillage the Towns of the County, and he with all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my incamped himselfe not farre from <hi>Bisanson,</hi> intending to take that City, but neither did his purpose take effect here; for not being able for want of Victuals to keep longer there, it behoved him to retreat, and pursue his former voyage towards the <hi>Rhyn</hi>: At which the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists</hi> of that Province were so afraid, as that presaging their ruine, and not thinking themselves safe in their owne Country, they forsook all the neighbouring Townes, some of them flying to <hi>Strasburg,</hi> some to <hi>Basill,</hi> placing their best moveables and Armes in <hi>Brisack,</hi> the preservation of which Fort, made whatsoever the <hi>Swedes</hi> got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides in <hi>Alsatia</hi> last but a little.</p>
            <p>Thus did affaires proceed in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> when the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> every houre more molested then other, by the incursions of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> (as much his Enemies now as formerly his friends) not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving competent Forces to resist these Souldiers long verst in the mischiefes of Warre, did strongly presse the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> that according to established agreements the Emperour might thinke of assisting him; and 'twas given out, that from these delayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was fed by the <hi>Austrians,</hi> some prejudice might ensue to the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Crowne, as doubtlessely it would have hapned, if that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor had reconciled himselfe with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and joyned Forces with them; So as his succour could no longer be delayed, though the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strians</hi> principall scope, and willing desire, was to have the War main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:55221:204"/>
and nourished in <hi>Saxony</hi>; for that all other parts having beene visited sometimes by their friends, sometimes by their Enemies, and consequently destroyed and ruinated, if <hi>Saxony</hi> should likewise be in the same manner weakned, the <hi>Imperiall</hi> dignitie would at last be the more secured. Hereupon <hi>Gallasse</hi> received orders, that having first provided for the places of greatest importance in <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> where his men were then quartered, he should march with the rest of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which came to about 10000, towards <hi>Saxony</hi>; and that joyning with <hi>Azfelt,</hi> who not long before was gone in succour of the Elector, he should not only have a care to defend <hi>Saxony,</hi> but should indeavour to suppresse the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army, and to recover such places as were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the Enemies hands. Which <hi>Gallasse</hi> readily obeying, he went after <hi>Bannier,</hi> who was about <hi>Torgaw,</hi> and charged him with such dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie, as though <hi>Bannier</hi> behaved himselfe gallantly in his retreat, being farre inferiour to the <hi>Imperialists</hi> in number; yet for all his warinesse, when the <hi>Austrians</hi> Vanguard came up to his Reere, it behoved his Reere to face about, and fight with them, that so they might not incurre the name of Cowards, and lose the reputation they had already won; after a bloody skirmish, wherein the <hi>Swedes</hi> lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 500 Souldiers, he with the rest of his Army retreated gallantly under the shelter of the Cannon of <hi>Torgaw</hi>; where calling a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Warre, the present occasions being wisely weighed, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found impossible for them to maintaine themselves there without greater strength, it was with a joynt consent agreed upon, That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first burnt and spoyled all the Countrey thereabouts, they should retreat to the strong holds in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and keepe themselves there; the which strong holds they might the easlier make good, because to boot with their strength of situation they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually be supply'd by Sea; and on the contrary, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> wanting necessaries to fit themselves for such an enterprise, by reason of the distance of place, they could not long maintaine their Army in those parts which were wholly ruinated, and all whose goods and best things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into their strong holds.</p>
            <p>From these Arguments a probable Consequence ensued, that the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Army being destroyed by Famine, they must, to their little honour and great losse, be forced to retreat without doing any good; and in the meane time the promised aydes comming from <hi>Swethland,</hi> and <hi>Orenghells</hi> Forces being joyned to <hi>Banniers,</hi> (who was againe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him by reason of affaires fallen out elsewhere) the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army being re-inforced, and the <hi>Imperialists</hi> weakned, they should not onely returne with advantage to the places they had forsaken, but bring their Forces into the heart of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and into the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Having then broken the Bridge at <hi>Torgaw,</hi> and left 3000 of his best Souldiers to guard that Towne, and so much Provision of all sorts, as they might well maintaine themselves there six moneths, he marched towards <hi>Landsperg</hi>; but being pursued by <hi>Gallasse,</hi> who indeavoured how he might ingage the <hi>Swedes</hi> in a Battell; and <hi>Bannier</hi> knowing himselfe not able to contest with him in the Field, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pursued his former intention of getting into strong holds; and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55221:205"/>
quitting the Field unto the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> he left <hi>Landsperg</hi>; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a skirmish which happened betweene his Horse and the Enemies, with little losse to either side, he retreated to <hi>Stetin</hi>; that he might stay there, and from thence send supply to such places, as being set upon by the <hi>Austrians</hi> stood in need thereof. <hi>Gallasse</hi> marched forwards, and planted his Cannon before <hi>Landsperg</hi>; he opened their Trenches, and the <hi>Imperialists</hi> falling upon the Ditch, which was defended by Traverses, he sent the <hi>Dutch</hi> to make an assault, who were desirous to end the businesse, being already weary of what they had suffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any refreshment, the Countrey being ruinated. This assault was bravely withstood by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Gallasse</hi> being angry at the delay, (for had he beene to have kept before it but foure dayes, either his men must have been destroyed, or must to his little honour have given over the enterprise) he prepared for another fierce assault; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences being drilled through by the Cannon, and the Towers beaten downe, the besieged perswaded the Governour to Treat of an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he being a gallant Souldier, and rather desirous to dye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably, then live with any the least staine of infamy, answered,
<q>That the custody of Forts was committed to Governours, to the end, that they within might with a few resist the violence of many with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; That they ought not to be astonished at the noyse of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and grounding their reasons upon some invented necessitie yeeld up the place; That the surrender of the Towne was not to be thought of, unlesse compell'd by such generall necessitie as was not to be withstood by valour; That it was the dutie of a Governour, first to consider the number of his defendants, which if he should not find to be sufficient, he was to make his desires knowne before the Enemy were approached; That it was more honourable to dye with Sword in hand, then to prejudice the publik interest for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a few. And at last, putting them in mind how they had wont to walke those streets vaunting, that they feared not <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe, he resolved upon defence. He therefore obstinately made good the breach, but neither could his, not yet his Souldiers valour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Enemies violence, who stormed the Citie, killing many of the defendants, and taking many of them prisoners.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Imperialists,</hi> increasing in their hopes by the getting of <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperg,</hi> they forthwith marched for <hi>Pomerania,</hi> hoping to meet with the same successe; but as all things have their vicissitudes, and suffer alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, the <hi>Austrians</hi> found not their proceedings so smooth in <hi>Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rania</hi> as they did here; for though <hi>Gallasse</hi> took <hi>Ribnets</hi> and <hi>Damgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> places of no great consideration, he prospered not in his oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Anclam,</hi> (a strength of great moment, lying in the heart of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania,</hi> not farre from the River <hi>Pene,</hi> betweene <hi>Volghast</hi> and <hi>Stettin</hi>) by the taking whereof, they should not onely the better secure their owne abode in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> but keepe all the Townes in continuall jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie which lye betweene <hi>Straelsundt</hi> and <hi>Stettin,</hi> and make the <hi>Swedes</hi> weary of keeping longer in that Province, where they could onely have their Provisions by Sea. <hi>Gallasse</hi> therefore drew neere unto it, and began to play upon it with his Cannon; but the strong Garrison
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55221:205"/>
rendred all his attempts, and all that he could doe, vaine, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally held the <hi>Caesarians</hi> worke in their owne quarters. For <hi>Bannier</hi> with the grosse of his Army, which was re-inforced by numbers of men landed at <hi>Wolghast,</hi> lay about <hi>Gripswold,</hi> from whence by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all surprialls, sometimes upon one, sometimes upon another quarter of the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> he greatly incommodiated their Campe. So as <hi>Gallasse</hi> seeing the difficulties grow greater, and the want of Victualls continue, the expected moneys from <hi>Vienna</hi> not appearing, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Souldier in that behalfe who began to mutiny, and his Army being much lessened by the death and running away of many, as on the contrary, the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army continually increased, he resolved to rayse his Siege, (having lost about 800 of his best Souldiers in it) and to returne to <hi>Marca Nova,</hi> that he might refresh his men, and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the moneys which he by sundry expresses much solicited, and without which he could neither move from where he was, nor keepe his Souldiers from running away.</p>
            <p>The Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> Sonne to the late Elector <hi>Fredericke,</hi> whose State was taken from him by the Emperour, was at this time at <hi>Meppen</hi> upon the River <hi>Amasia,</hi> (which running from the Confines of <hi>Paderborne,</hi> into the Countrey of <hi>Lippe,</hi> falls into the Sea between <hi>Emden</hi> and <hi>Munster</hi>) where he was by moneys, which his Uncle the King of <hi>England</hi> furnisht him withall, raysing an Army wherewithall to recover in these times of trouble the <hi>Palatinate</hi> from the house of <hi>Austria.</hi> And because the men, that by his procurement were imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued in <hi>England</hi> were not yet come, he delayed his march; which the <hi>Austrians</hi> in no wayes dreading, seemed not much to care for; and this was onely attributed to the small experience of the Souldiers which were but then taken from forth the peacefull quiet of <hi>England.</hi> When the Landsgrave of <hi>Hessen,</hi> who notwithstanding the offers and intreaties of Peace, made unto him by the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> kept constant to the <hi>Swedes</hi> partie, seeing <hi>Orenghell</hi> gone from his State, as also the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Grana,</hi> who was imployed in the Siege of <hi>Hannaw,</hi> bethought himself to stand no longer idle, but mustering together the Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Melander,</hi> &amp; thinking himself able to relieve <hi>Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>naw,</hi> he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thitherward over-ran many Townes, tooke <hi>Victenaw,</hi> and betooke himselfe boldly to the succour of that Fort; but the Elector of <hi>Ments</hi> hearing of this, who was most concerned in the taking of it, as flanking upon his Territories, he assembled together his Forces, together with those of Colonell <hi>Meternich</hi> who guarded those passages; He made them wade over the River <hi>Chitzing,</hi> by the intelligence of the Count <hi>D'Hannaw,</hi> who till then had kept Neutrall, and who making use of the correspondency which he held with many of the <hi>Swedish</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, being neerly allyed to the Counts <hi>Ringraves,</hi> the chiefe Captains of the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> he so wisely behaved himselfe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> as one Gate of the new Fort being surprised, and the Cannon being turned against the old Fort, he made <hi>Ransaw</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thereof resolve to parley, and incline to the surrender of the place, which ensued with all the advantagious conditions the <hi>Swedes</hi> could desire, and with the disbursement of some moneys by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the Garrison.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therfore thinking this a good occasion to perfect that enterprise, they brought the greatest part of their Army upon the Territories of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> &amp; taking <hi>Carasona,</hi> a Town neer <hi>Sofia,</hi> between

He with his Horse pursued the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who under the command of <hi>Don Martin</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> were gone to plunder the Towns in the Territories of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and having layd an anbush, whilest the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> were returning to their quarters with great heards of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, he unexpectedly set upon them, and after a bloody skirmish, wherein though the <hi>Italians</hi> behaved themselves with courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, they were notwithstanding at the last put to the worst; <hi>Bocca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pianola</hi> (a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> and Field-Master) was there slaine, as also <hi>Don Iohn di Lelmo,</hi> Captaine of the Horse, Captaine <hi>Spadino</hi> was taken prisoner, and about some 60 Souldiers, of which, some were of good esteeme; for Commanders usually imploy their best Souldiers in businesses of greatest danger. On the other side, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> (who upon newes of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> approach, fearing <hi>Vercelles,</hi> was come in person thither) understanding that the Princes of <hi>Este</hi> were retired with their men to <hi>Leganes,</hi> commanded Count <hi>Verva</hi> to go with 4000 Souldiers into the <hi>Langhe,</hi> where he sack't many Townes, past over the <hi>Poe,</hi> fired <hi>Pieve del Cairo,</hi> and indeavoured, though in vaine, to take the Castle of <hi>Arazzo</hi>; for it being well defended by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and <hi>Don Martin</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> comming speedily into the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of it, the <hi>Savoyards</hi> rose from before it, having lost about one hundred of their men.</p>
            <p>During this revolution of affaires, the presént condition of the Crowne of <hi>Spaine</hi> was justly weighed by the piercing wits thereof, and the powerfull Forces of <hi>France</hi> was to their great griefe examined, which being wholly united did much annoy the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent example did deceive those who fed themselves with hopes of kindling civill dissention in that Kingdome, and did chiefly apply their wits thereunto. For the Kings reconciliation to his Brother the Duke of <hi>Orelans,</hi> from whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had received so many assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, made them know they were to ground but little beliefe upon the faith of that Nation, which being rivall to theirs, would upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion make it appeare, That though it were treacherous to its King it, would be much more false to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and that those means were

now become desperat, by which in former times, when the King was under age, the Princes of the Kingdome tooke the boldnesse to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe Lawes to the unlimited Regall power; and that the Cardinall <hi>Richelieu,</hi> a faithfull servant of that Crowne, and one of an exquisitely refined judgement, knew how to countermine the <hi>Spanish</hi> Plots. They therefore resolved to follow the example of <hi>Scipio Affricanus,</hi> by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Warre into <hi>France,</hi> whilst <hi>France</hi> made War out of <hi>France.</hi> To this purpose, they began to provide for all things necessary to set upon <hi>Languedock</hi> (a Countrey which extends it selfe from <hi>Provence</hi> unto the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Mountaines, and which is of a temperate climate, very fruitfull, and populous) by the invasion whereof, their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not onely to divert those Forces which threatned <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> but (that which was of greater consequence) to frighten those Inhabitants, and see whether by their assistance they could make them take up Armes against the Kings Ministers of State, as those who had occasioned the War in <hi>France.</hi> And because almost all the Military men that had imployment in <hi>Italy, Flanders,</hi> or elsewhere, were sent for from far into the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Dominions; for the Councell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> thought it not fitting to give the government of an Army in <hi>Spaine</hi> to one of the same Nation; for the preferring of one Subject before the rest in his owne Countrey, is to derogate from the pretensions of many others, who thinke themselves not inferiour to the partie preferred, and to rayse him to too great an height whom they so exalt; they were aware of this, and therefore sent for Count <hi>Iohn Serbellone</hi> to command those Forces, a Subject of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> of great esteeme, and of experienced worth in Military affairs; as well to take him from the pretences he had in the Armies of that State, as for the fore-mentioned reasons of shunning emulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves; as also for Marquis <hi>Phillip Spinola,</hi> Nephew to that great Generall <hi>Ambrosius,</hi> under whom he had beene discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. When these came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> they were received with much civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie by the King and Queene, and all the Court, as those who were thought might be serviceable unto them in the time of War; though the wiser sort were of opinion, That these were but counterfeit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of contentment, such as are frequently used by such as stand in need of anothers assistance; for it was held for certaine, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who envie all other Nations, desire to monopolize all their Grandezzes within themselves. The Duke of <hi>Cardona</hi> (who was commanded to rayse as many men as he could in those Kingdomes) had now assembled together an Army of betweene ten and twelve thousand men, to boot with other Souldiers remaining in <hi>Novar,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke of <hi>Nocera,</hi> to watch over the <hi>French,</hi> who by reason of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entring in hostile manner into those parts, were now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come strong, and had driven the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from <hi>Bayon,</hi> where they had met with hard usage. The <hi>Spaniish</hi> Commanders, thinking it now fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting time to effect their resolves, and <hi>Serbellone</hi> desirous at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to doe somewhat handsomely, they turned their march towards <hi>Leucata,</hi> a Citie in <hi>Languedock</hi> neere <hi>Narbone,</hi> and not far from the Sea, as a place very fit to make way for greater enterprises. Their
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55221:208"/>
Army being brought before it, <hi>Serbellone</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Mortara,</hi> tooke up their quarters on the side towards <hi>Narbonne; Francis Specchi,</hi> Master of the Field, with his men quartered at <hi>Franchina,</hi> and the Duke <hi>De monte Reale,</hi> tooke up his abode at the place called <hi>Sferra Cavalli</hi>; they set a great number of Pioniers on worke in the digging of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as well against the Citie, as to keepe off succour, and thought verily to take the Towne, for the <hi>French</hi> Forces were afarre off; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it comply with them to remove them from the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> and from <hi>Flanders,</hi> to imploy them here. They planted their Cannon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and beset it; the <hi>Catelonians,</hi> using more bravery with their tongues then with their Swords, as never having seene any Squadrons, unlesse of Cattell, they being for the most part Countrey people. But as things suddenly raysed, are oft-times as suddenly razed, they failed in what they intended; for the Allarme being given to all the <hi>French</hi> thereabouts, and those Confines being strengthned by Troops of Horse and Foot, speedily sent thither from the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces by the Governours thereof, these men naturally hating the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> did with such hast and fury, as is naturall to the <hi>French,</hi> flock to ayde the besieged; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being for the most part fresh-men of the Trained Bands, and not used to Warre, they either knew not how, or were not able, to resist the fierce assault, which the <hi>French,</hi> not valuing their lives, made upon their Trenches, about three a clock at night on the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi>

            <p>The newes whereof being speedily brought to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> was very welcome, and made the <hi>French</hi> looke about them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for that, which had they not beene awakened by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> perhaps they would never have drempt of.

            <p>At this time <hi>William</hi> Landsgrave of <hi>Hessen,</hi> a sprightly Prince, and

given to the Warres, exhorted the King of <hi>England</hi> all that he could, to make use of this opportunity, in remitting the Counts <hi>Palatine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their State, to which purpose many men were raised about <hi>Meppen</hi>; and aswell for this, as for other common causes, the League between <hi>France, Swethland,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> was againe established; in which <hi>France</hi> promised to pay 12000 Souldiers, <hi>Swethland</hi> 5000, and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 5000.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Landsgrave being now gone in person to <hi>Meppen,</hi> to consider what course was to be taken for the mannaging of this Warre, and from thence to <hi>Holland</hi> to agree with those States what was best to be done in these present emergencies, whilest he returned well-satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his negotions to his owne Country, he fell into a malignant Feaver in <hi>Leer,</hi> a City which lies neer the <hi>Amasio,</hi> between <hi>Meppen</hi> and <hi>Embden,</hi> whereof hee dyed, to the great griefe of the Protestants who loved this Prince exceedingly,
hee being a constant defender of their Religion, and very firme in his friendship with his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, never failing in his promise, though unevitable ruine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared thereby to his Dominions.

The Landsgrave was a comely presence, his body well composed, hee injoyed a proportionable activity, his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect was pleasing; whilest he was young he went into <hi>Holland,</hi> and and lived under the Discipline of that great <hi>Maurice,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi>; by obeying he learned how to command; as Students get learning from good Masters, so he seconded by his warlike genious learnt in this famous Schoole that exquisitnesse which is required in a perfect Captaine. Going afterwards from <hi>Holland</hi> hee visited all the chiefe States of Europe, and through a generall knowledge which he acquired, he knew so worthily and so judiciously to behave himselfe, as that his subjects reverenced him out of duty, loved him out of affection, and out of gratitude adored him; the Souldier out of wonder admired him, and tooke glory to obey him, and happy was the man who by any action could out-strip another, that so he might obtaine thankes from him, or but one gracious word. The gravity of his Condition mixt with his affability to inferours, won the praise of all Tongues; hee lived like a Prince, did like a Souldier, and treated like a Companion; he past away his leasure houres in exercising his Armes, in the perusall of good bookes, and in drawing, and designing; hee had wont to say, a Prince had no greater Enemy then rest, that when the body was at quiet, the mind was most unquiet, and that the labour of the body did quiet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect; hee affected not pompe; he was not subject to ambition; hee used no subtleties;</q>
hee held that gravity in a Souldier, was a vizard or maske, which made men mistake how hee was affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
<q>for to him that makes honour his chiefe, and the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement he can have, and the greatest reward he can receive, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55221:210"/>
He said, That such men were like disguised mulitiers, who being set upon a couragious Horse, and thinking it to be their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed Mule, they through indiscretion runne head-long upon the rocks of hatred and desperation: Fishes by the Hooke, and Birds in a Net, are taken with such baits as are proper for their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triture, not with meat contrary to their nature; He put no greater a valuation upon lascivious men, nor accounted them no better then women; He said, He could not thinke they had any heart, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it off from glory, had basely imprisoned it in the sickly thoughts of fading pleasure; Anger lasted no longer in him; then did the fire last which first kindled it, as he was apt to take up anger, so was he apt to lay it downe even like a fire of straw; He mightily blamed those, who reserving a private hatred in their breast, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themselves by their Princes hand, and detested their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who armed with their Princes Authoritie, made use thereof to compasse their owne odde ends; He affirmed, It was a signe of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to resent any thing done by an inferiour, or one of lesse power; That not to consider ones private passions, when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique interest was in question, was the effect of a generous mind; In briefe, he was very punctuall in care of preserving his good name, which imploying all his indeavours thereunto, he obtained; and he was constant in his desire to be thought constant to his friend, or wherein his freind was concern'd, as not regarding even reason of State, when his promise was once past, he would rather be thought indiscreet then false of his word; Nay, he would maintain that reason to be false, which will have a Prince to be like a clock, which stands still or goes about, onely as driven by the counterpoise of his owne interest, alledging, that those Princes, who so easily tack about, distrusting all men, though they become not a prey to their Enemy, they rest at last inslaved to their owne minds; for their feare of repenting, is sure to make them repent. To conclude, if the Landsgrave, who was knowne to be one of the worthiest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all <hi>Germany,</hi> had knowne how to hide (at least to dissemble) his perfect hatred against <hi>Romanists,</hi> no doubt but his very Enemies would have commended him, and have confest him to have beene a Prince that deserved all honour, and a better condition. But both by his tongue and his deeds, he exprest himselfe too bitterly against them upon all proffered occasions, and otherwise then became the qualities he was indowed withall, which did much lessen his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne. Amongst many things he said, He had wont to insist much upon one, though upon false grounds; to wit, that it might be permitted to some of regular orders of Fryers, to keepe Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Schooles of seculiar Sciences, alledging for his reason, that every religious order being like a Re-publique, which alwayes aimes at its owne preservation and interest of greatnesse, by season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Pupills during their younger yeares, in the rules of their severall orders, they make them onely fit for a Pulpit or Quire, and so deprive their Prince of many a Subject, who if imploy'd in the Warres or State-Affaires, might have proved very beneficiall to their King, and to their Kingdome.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:55221:211"/>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was come to <hi>Vercelles</hi> upon the newes of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being upon those Territories, was there suddenly seized upon by an indisposition of health, which suddenly bereft him of his life on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to the great griefe of his Duchesse, and of all his Subjects; for having left behind him onely two Sonnes and one Daughter, all of them very young and incapble of government, they knew that by this death, no small troubles would arise throughout <hi>Piemont.</hi>
               <q>He was of an aspect not unpleasing, of a reasonable sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and curteous in his behaviour (as are all the Princes of that Family) He governed himselfe very wisely; he by his wisedome compast all his actions, and by dexteritie knew so well how to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his weaknesse, as he was esteemed of, and held by many for a much knowing man. If on the Mothers side he had partaken some of her Fathers Character, and had shared of his owne Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, he might have been truely tearmed Son of that great <hi>Charles,</hi> whose worth and vertue no tongues are able sufficiently to celebrate; and Heire, not onely to his Principalitie, but Intellect also, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which smiles not alike upon all, had suffered him to governe in another conjuncture of time. He seemed to be more inclined to Peace, and quietly to increase his State, then addicted to the novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Warre. He governed himselfe with much Policy in all his Affaires, making it appeare, he trusted more to his wisedome then to his daring. He lived a friend to glory, indeavouring greatnesse, and and coveting esteeme: He therefore invented the title of Regall <hi>Altezza.</hi> He made new pretences, not formerly found out by his Predecessours. And thinking better of himselfe then his Forces would make good, he seemed more by the prerogative of his birth then by the increase of his Dominions to pretend to a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme then his Predecessors had. He was a good Prince for his Subjects but not for his friends, his principall scope being his owne proper interst, and having no other particular affection. He dyed when he was 51 yeares old, a bitter death, since by nature he might have lived many yeares longer; but very well to be borne withall, and no wayes to be wondred at, by one whose indispositions were such as was his, for besides the Cough of the Lungs, he was of a very weake Complexion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewise much resented the death of this Prince, for he being a great Polititian, and one who desired to keepe faire with the <hi>French,</hi> to the end that they might permit him quietly to enjoy his owne State, but with no intention that they should get further footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> many were of opinion, that he held secret intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that this was a chiefe cause why the State of <hi>Milan</hi> was no further indammaged; for cloaking the secrets of his mind with outward simulation and appearances, he dexterously governed the affaires of Warre, as they most conduced to his owne end. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> fearing least upon this occasion the <hi>French</hi> might be brought into the best Forts of <hi>Piemont</hi> by the Duches meanes, in regard of the feare she stood in of her Subjects who were not well inclined to the <hi>French</hi>; and that that State should no more in effect belong to the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55221:211"/>
house of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but onely in outward shew; so as they losing the hopes they had therein, as the Trench which divides <hi>Italy</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> they must be inforced to keepe Forces continually on Foot in the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> to defend it from the incursions of the <hi>French,</hi> their contiguous neighbours. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being much moved for the said reasons, sent speedy advertisement of this accident to <hi>Spaine, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and did moreover give out, That the Duke was poysoned by <hi>Crequi</hi> his procurement, that by such a report they might the more incense his subjects against the <hi>French,</hi> who never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from those Towns, as at first they did, began to be very burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the Inhabitants. The Marquis <hi>Leganes,</hi> and the other State-Ministers of <hi>Spaine,</hi> advised what they were to doe upon the present emergency; at last, this being acknowledged to be a wound, which if it were suffered to runne on and grow worse, all remedies that could be apply'd thereunto hereafter would prove vaine, they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in a joynt opinion, that they were to doe their utmost, as well by force of Armes, as cunning and industry, in using such meanes as should be most opportune for them, without losse of time, and whilst by the Dukes death all <hi>Piemont</hi> was in a confusion, and whilst the <hi>French</hi> had not yet thought of establishing any government there, though the <hi>French</hi> that were in <hi>Italy</hi> sought rather how they might get into the strong holds of <hi>Piemont,</hi> then into those of <hi>Milan.</hi> By command from <hi>Leganes,</hi> all they that were in <hi>Comasco</hi> went into the Countrey of <hi>Allessandria,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> hearing that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was discovered in the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> over against <hi>Italy,</hi> and fearing, lest landing their men they might attempt some enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, <hi>Don Martin</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Don Iohn de Garray,</hi> were sent with some Souldiers into the <hi>Lang he,</hi> to looke to any incursion the <hi>French</hi> might make on that part; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> march being discovered by the <hi>French,</hi> who were quartered in <hi>Montferrat</hi> towards that side, they came forth against them, and fought with them in the <hi>Lang he</hi>; where the <hi>French,</hi> who were more in number then the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, <hi>Don Martin</hi> was necessitated to retreat into the Territories of <hi>Allessandria,</hi> with the losse of 400 of his men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Austrians</hi> this meane while, understanding that those of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> being much opprest by the <hi>French,</hi> who treated them as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, would willingly imbrace any occasion whereby they might drive them out, did cheerfully consent that the Cardinall of <hi>Savoy</hi> should come into <hi>Piemont,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> conceiving, that if he were introduced, and admitted to the government of that State, who was a friend to <hi>Spaine,</hi> and a very understanding Prince, he would have a care to preserve his Nephewes authoritie, would have an eye to the sinister proceedings of the <hi>French,</hi> and that being upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions fomented by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it would not be hard for him to make them forgoe their quarters in <hi>Piemont,</hi> especially since the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were growne stronger, and the <hi>French</hi> weaker. By nourishing the Warre in <hi>Piemont,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> kept the evills thereof from out their owne Territories, and which was of greater importance, by putting enmitie betweene the <hi>Savoyards</hi> and <hi>French</hi> (to boot with the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:55221:212"/>
increase of Forces of the one, and decrease of the others) they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by driving the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> to become Masters themselves of the chiefe strengths of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and consequently keepe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof at their beck; so as if they could have secured themselves from the power of <hi>France</hi> on this side, they certainly would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very dreadfull to all the rest of <hi>Italy.</hi> To this purpose the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall parted speedily from <hi>Rome,</hi> and came to the State of <hi>Genua,</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Piemont,</hi> where he found himselfe deceived in his opinion; for the <hi>French</hi> protested to the Duchesse, that if she should bring her Brother in law into <hi>Piemont,</hi> they would turne their Forces against her State. The Duchesse was therefore inforced to signifie unto him, that he should forbeare comming further, for she would by no meanes receive him then, she her selfe being sufficient to take upon her the government of her Sonne, and that so it was her Husbands will she should doe. This answer was very bitter to the Cardinall, as he witnessed by his sharpe rescenting thereof; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that he very well fore-saw the eminent dangers which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that State, which in other times had beene the Theater of <hi>Italies</hi> greatnesse, in so much as he declared; That by the Fundamentall Laws of that State, he was to take upon him the administration of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that his Brothers will was voyd and invalid, and that the Statutes of that Dukedome were unalterable, which containe; that if the Duke dye, and leave his Children Orphans, the Princes of the Blood be admitted to the government both of the State and them. But (as no reason is of validitie with those that will not be governed thereby, and when there wants sufficient force to compell obedience) the Cardinalls pretensions were not allowed of, but his Sister in Law sent him word againe, willing him to returne to <hi>Rome</hi> from whence he came. And the <hi>French,</hi> fearing that since the Cardinall could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile by his perswasions for admission, he would indeavour to effect his desires by the force of <hi>Spaine</hi> which were all already brought upon those Frontiers, and had caused no little suspitions. <hi>Crequi</hi> having now to his no small contentment the sole supreame command of all the Forces in <hi>Italy,</hi> (for it is usuall with great men not well to brooke an equall or superior in authoritie) thinking that he should now be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe some great matter in <hi>Italy,</hi> went with his Army from <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> to <hi>Poma,</hi> a Castle betweene <hi>Valenza</hi> and <hi>Casalle,</hi> neere the River <hi>Roaldo,</hi> guarded by 200 <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who not able to defend themselves, forsooke it when they heard of the <hi>French mens</hi> approach; and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Bridge to be throwne over the River <hi>Poe</hi> on the side of <hi>Brem,</hi> gave out that he would quarter his whole Army that Winter in the State of <hi>Milan</hi>; but these words tooke not effect; for <hi>Leganes</hi> having brought the greatest part of his Army about <hi>Valenza,</hi> the Marshall altered his mind, and returned to Winter in his former quarters of <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Montferrat.</hi> Whereby the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> finding it an easie matter to take <hi>Brem,</hi> they had many reasons to goe about it before they should betake themselves to their Winter quarters, and before the <hi>French</hi> should receive more recruits from <hi>France.</hi> But the season pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afterwards so exceeding wet, and the wayes so deepe, as they could
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:55221:212"/>
not without much incommoditie march with their Cannon; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon better advice <hi>Leganes</hi> resolved to leave garrisons on the Frontiers, particularly in <hi>Lumello</hi> and <hi>Carasona,</hi> whose fortifications were not yet perfected, and disperse his Army in the Townes of that state, with intention to appeare in the Spring with greater numbers in the field, and doe that which though it was deferred was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p>The face of affaires was changed in <hi>Lombardy</hi> by the death of <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios Amadreo</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as also by the decease of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi>

Others said the Duchesse being but young, and much solicited by her mother <hi>Marguerit</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Empresse <hi>Elli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> she might perhaps listen to a new marriage. And that when the <hi>Infante</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> could get footing in <hi>Mantua,</hi> and in the right of the young Lady lawfully keep what he had gotten in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> hee would willingly yeeld to marry her, and that the Princesse would not be unwilling to better her condition in these present emergencies, from whence great troubles must needs arise; for if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should once get into <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the Citadell of <hi>Casalle,</hi> there was no hope (though they might intend to restore the state to the lawfull heire) that ever they would take their garrisons out of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant places. Whereupon, every Potentate apprehending the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> greatnesse, they would prepare to obviat what might prove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to them, and so those poore Countries would bee the Scaene of Warre.</p>
            <p>Some notwithstanding replied to the discourse touching this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with reasons not improbable; to wit, that it would hardly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; for that the Princesse being esteemed to be fruitfull, it did not comply with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that their Kings brother should have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, out of the reason of State of keeping the government in one onely, and that therefore when they should thinke upon a match for him, they were to provide a Wife that were barren; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side they aswell saw that if the <hi>Mantuans</hi> should keep constant to the <hi>French,</hi> they should not onely be treated by them as subjects, and the Duke of <hi>Mantua's</hi> Authority be assubjected to the pleasure of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:55221:213"/>
               <hi>France</hi>; but (which was of greater consideration) if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not beare that the <hi>French</hi> Forces should bee in <hi>Cassalle,</hi> they would consequently never be contented till they were removed from thence. So as the Warre hapning in an Orphans state, his subjects were likely to prove the mischiefes thereof; although others refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting hereupon, and who were not of opinion that this made for the Duke, did probably maintaine that Warre was little or nothing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to those who were therein brought up, and that both parties being desirous to keep that warlike people well affected to them, they should be gently proceeded with by them both; and being well trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they might consequently by making the best of their affaires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more profit from Warre then from Peace. But it was not long ere the effects of such cogitations began to shew themselves; For the Princesse taking upon her the government of her sonne, and being more addicted to the <hi>Italian</hi> gravity, then to the <hi>French</hi> freedome, seemed little satisfied with the proceedings of the <hi>French</hi>; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular she seemed not to be well pleased with Monsieur <hi>de Torre,</hi> who commanded under <hi>Charles</hi> as generall of all his Forces; for he not able to submit the <hi>French</hi> liberty to the moderation of <hi>Italy,</hi> had by his affability won the good will of many, and almost got all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Mantua</hi> to follow his Capricioes; so as basterdizing the customes of <hi>Mantua</hi> with the mode of <hi>France,</hi> his actions were no wayes pleasing to the Princes, nor yet to others, who knew it was not fit to introduce such a noveltie: So as, aswell to free her selfe from such a spectacle, as also to injoy that soveraignty which became her, and which was by this man through his Kings authority in some sort moderated, as also that by so doing she might partly shew the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> her Mother, and her Aunt, that she was independant as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>France,</hi> and for other reasons, the Princesse so behaved her selfe as she made Monsieur <hi>de Torre</hi> depart from <hi>Mantua</hi>; who going to <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence being sent for into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the superintendency of <hi>Cassalle</hi> was committed to his charge; and the <hi>French</hi> by these demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations growing jealous of the Princesse, and her Ministers of state, they fell to such resolutions in <hi>Casall</hi> as shall hereafter be mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But to returne to the Duke, he was well enough composed in the parts of his body, and no lesse inriched in those of his minde; for to boot, with a generall knowledge he was easily appeased and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by reason; his being, borne and bred up in <hi>France,</hi> was the cause why he (as all others who naturally affect their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) taken with the courteous behaviour of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, by the good entertainment he partook of at the Court, and by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his naturall clymat, could not when he was transplanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> overcome his nature by art; so as rather then to forgoe his affection to <hi>France,</hi> he incurr'd the anger of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and submitted his state to the discretion of their Forces; which peradventure hee might have shunn'd, and would have been more advantagious to him then Warre, if with the change of soyle hee could have changed that genius which made him beare so great an inclination to the <hi>French</hi>: Hee had a solid judgement, a temperat minde, a goodnesse
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55221:213"/>
not despicable; he was given to Warre, worldly enough, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of riches, knowing, at least imagining that he being a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and esteemed by his Subjects, to be the cause of their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, they did not much affect him, which made him not confide in them; nay his diffidence grew to so great a hight, as he writ what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was of most importance with his owne hand; he had wont to keep in writing all the faults committed by his Officers, that hee might shew when he would make no further use of them, hee had reason for what he did. Thus did he dismisse <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Caffin,</hi> the two Secretaries of state, shewing them their faults registred; for what remaines, hee was of good example, had a good conscience and perfect will, his onely fault being his too much love of Mony; hee lived ten yeares Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> died when hee was 61 yeares old; of such a strength of body, as naturally hee might have lived longer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> did above all other things labour to finde out a means whereby to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from entring into the strong holds of <hi>Piemont,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1638.</note> with which they were as much troubled, as were the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences great which did depend thereon; for hardly should they be able to drive them from those holds, wherein being to bee imployed without any impediment from <hi>Dolpheny</hi> which joynes upon <hi>Savoy,</hi> those Townes would be as it were annext to <hi>France,</hi> and consequently in processe of time, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would no longer confine upon a Duke, but upon a puissant King, nothing inferiour to them in strength, and should thereby receive such prejudice, as states doe by having potent neighbours. These considerations causing therefore much thought in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they at last light upon one of the best and most singular remedies that could be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>plied to this malady: Which was to send for Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> into the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> as one who was much beloved by the people of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piemont</hi>; to the end that entring <hi>Piemont</hi> with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, he should either by force perswade the Duchesse to deliver up unto him the government, and drive away the <hi>French</hi>; or else by the adherence of the people, and holding good intelligence with the Nobility of <hi>Piemont,</hi> make way for such proceedings as happen usually upon like occasions. But many things were requisit before this resolution was to be tane; secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was chiefely esteemed necessary, that the <hi>French</hi> might not be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous hereof, and then they were to contrive their intelligence with such as sided with them; they therefore cloaked this their intention, and seemed onely to minde the bringing in of more Souldiers from <hi>Germany, Swisserland, Spaine</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi>; which occasioning a beliefe in the <hi>French,</hi> that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would rather use their power then wits, they kept quiet within their owne stations, not moving any whither. But <hi>Don Francisco de Melo,</hi> who was already gon (as hath been said) towards <hi>Cullen,</hi> and then towards <hi>Flanders,</hi> having notice of these designes, altered his course and turned towards <hi>Vienna,</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiat there not onely concerning these agreements, but to get suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour for the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> which might be sufficient to effect the businesse intended of bringing Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> into <hi>Piemont.</hi> To the

which (the affaires of the Empire being very urgent) the <hi>Dutch</hi> Counsellors did not consent, for <hi>Caesars</hi> necessity was much greater then was the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and the people who were continually grieved with contribution and free-quarter, knew the danger of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching evill, and murmur'd that those who should be kept for their defence, should be sent out of the Empire to assist others, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not without reason of the Emperours ministers of State: Yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> desires prevailing alwayes with the Emperour, it being they that furnish Gold for the succour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and doe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most indeavour to maintaine the <hi>Imperiall</hi> dignity; they got leave to raise other Regiments, and were in the same sort be-friended by the Arch-Duchesse of <hi>Ispruch,</hi> who suffered them to raise Forces in her State.

            <p>This meane while Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who had been advertised by the <hi>Infante</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intentions, to give a beginning to the businesse, thought it fitting to send the Baron <hi>Pallavicino</hi> to his brother the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall with whom he might work a perfect understanding, so as they might agree secretly upon what would be most advantagious for their Nephews state, to the end that it might not be usurped either by the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spaniard,</hi> they thought the occasion fair to send the same <hi>Pallavisino</hi> to the Duchesse their sister in law to condole the D. death, he being fittest for such an imployment, and not at all suspected at the Court of <hi>Turine</hi>

               </gap>00 the end that whil'st he made that his errand to the Duchesse, he might underhand agree things with those that were friends to the Cardinall &amp; Prince. <hi>Leganes</hi> not failing likewise on his part did continually solicit the Viceroyes of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicely,</hi> to ship away other Souldiers that were raised in those Kingdoms; and sent <hi>Don Diego Patigne</hi> to <hi>Genoa</hi> to agree there for monies. He visited the Count <hi>Montery,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> at <hi>Pegi,</hi> as he was going for <hi>Spain</hi> in his return from his government; that he might inform him of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent affairs of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and so <hi>Montery</hi> might punctually inform the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of all things better by word of mouth, then <hi>Leganes</hi> could do by letters. He reformed his weak Companies, &amp; added their Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to other Companies that were more compleat; he sent likewise Count <hi>Biglia</hi> with some Monies to <hi>Coira,</hi> to keep the <hi>Grisons</hi> true, who were again tampered with by the <hi>French,</hi> to make them breake with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; he pretermitted not any thing that might make for the safety of the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> which of all other states was most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; for if they should once have lost it, it would be hard for them to recover it again, for that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had no other Territories joyning upon it, wherein to raise necessary succors, the honour of their Army would be lost, and they should runne hazard of losing all they had in <hi>Italy.</hi> For the Passages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shut up to any succour from <hi>Germany,</hi> and the succours from

               <hi>Spaine</hi> being weake and uncertaine, the Protestants of <hi>Italy</hi> might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from out their Countrey, and particularly out of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> the subsistance whereof, as also all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Grandezza in <hi>Italy</hi> depended upon the State of <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the newes of these preparations, the Duchesse of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was a very couragious Princesse, began notwithstanding to be somewhat apprehensive; for she very well fore-saw that <hi>Piemont</hi> was likely to be the Sceance whereon all the Warre betweene those two Crownes was to be acted: She called her Counsell together, and advised upon what was fitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> to be done upon the present, and did openly declare; That though she were the King of <hi>France</hi> his Sister, yet she was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that she thought her selfe more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in her Sonne then in her Brother. The present affaires were had in consultation, and very well discust. It was generally agreed upon by all, that if they might be suffered to be Neuters, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themselves for either partie, it would be the wisest course they could take. The bringing of the Cardinal into the government was also discoursed of, to which some were inclined; for if he shold come thither, the King of <hi>France</hi> his Forces might be prejudiced by assistance from <hi>Spaine</hi>; and doubtlesly, the <hi>French</hi> turning their threats into hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some desires and efficacious promises, would rather indeavour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Duchesse from siding with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and to hold good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency with her Brother, then exasperate her against them, and peradventure this would have beene the best resolution they could have put on. But there were in it such difficulties, as it behoved them to leave the thought thereof; for besides that, the government of one so neere of blood to the Heire afforded cause of jealousie, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse (as are all other Princes) being desirous to be chiefe in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and not to admit of a Companion, would not give way thereunto. But that which did chiefly hinder the taking such a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was the King of <hi>France</hi> his protestation, who threatned that if the <hi>Piemontois</hi> should take the Cardinal into the State belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he would presently wage Warre with them; and the <hi>French</hi> being already masters of the strongest and most important passages of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> they would straightwayes have brought that State into evident danger. They likewise fore-saw, that they were not to ground their hopes upon assistance from <hi>Spaine</hi>; for though the <hi>French</hi> should be beaten, (which would not easily be done) if they should really intend such a Warre, it was not to be doubted, but that whilest the <hi>Spaniards</hi> warred in <hi>Piemont,</hi> those Townes which should have escaped the insolencies of the <hi>French</hi> would have tasted the <hi>Spaniards</hi> indiscretion; and so much the rather, for that they had not as then any hope to carry the Warre on the other side the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; for the <hi>French</hi> being possest of <hi>Casalle,</hi> and the greatest part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> it would require some time to drive them from thence, and therefore the Warre would be maintained in the bowells of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> to the great prejudice of those Inhabitants. They being then of two evills to chuse the least, resolved to put themselves totally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the protection of <hi>France</hi>; and to this purpose, the Marquis <hi>Parelo</hi>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:55221:215"/>
was sent by the Duchesse to her Brother to desire succour and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, although this was knowne to be a hazardous resolution; for not being able to put themselves into the protection of <hi>France</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving the <hi>French</hi> into their strong holds, they would not be easily got to forgoe them: so as either, by permitting them to Lord it there, the Dukes authoritie must be lost; or else the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces which most apprehended this neighbour-hood, if they should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to drive them out by force, the State of <hi>Piemont</hi> would first be ruin'd by their encamping; and if afterwards things should happen successefully, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be brought into that State, they would have the better pretence to keepe it, as the purchase of their Swords. Whence it is easily seene, what prejudice such States receive as have Infants for their supreme Lords.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Austrians</hi> prepared by all meanes possible to ruine <hi>France,</hi> so were not the <hi>French</hi> idle in contriving how to countermine the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cunning, which they much apprehended; and at the same time that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> built their designes upon the Prince of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> who confided very much in Duke <hi>Waymers</hi> valour, began to lay the foundations of their future Fabrick. So as <hi>Waymers</hi> Army being much increased by recruits from <hi>France,</hi> and by moneys he had received from them, wherewithall to satisfie the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he thought it no longer time to keepe idle in his quarters, but fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in <hi>Chapell</hi> and the Countrey of <hi>Fistemberg,</hi> he kept the Fields with his united Army in those Territories; which caused the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The <hi>Imperiall</hi> Commanders, whose Forces were increased by succours sent from <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Franconia,</hi> thought it not honourable for their Prince, nor that it became their reputation to suffer such a Citie besieged but by a few, to be lost whilst they looked on; mature deliberation being had in the Councell of Warre concerning what was to be done, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that Duke <hi>Savell,</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Wert,</hi> should goe to the succour of it; they therefore marched with their Army, which consisted of about 12000 fighting-men, in good order to effect their purpose: But being advertised, that <hi>Speureter,</hi> one of their Colonells, was come to about <hi>Lindaw</hi> and <hi>Constance,</hi> with 4000 Souldiers, with command to joyne with them, they resolved to expect his comming before they went any further; Therefore they haulted in <hi>Obercal, Schoma,</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat,</hi> Villages betweene <hi>Friburg</hi> and <hi>Rinfield,</hi> and by great fires gave notice to the besieged, that they were upon their march to succour

But the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who desirous to see the end of this Siege, was for his pastime come from <hi>Zurick</hi> to <hi>Waymer,</hi> being knowne to be extreamely good at Military stratagems, by the powerfull reasons alledged, and which were approved of by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> with-held <hi>Waymer</hi> from coping with the Enemy; he thought it better for <hi>Waymer</hi> to conceale his courage, and by seeming rather fearefull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make the <hi>Austrians</hi> the more vaine-glorious, who (it being usuall for confidence to produce presumption, whereby enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises are oft-times lost) seeing the <hi>Swedes</hi> retreat, and concluding thereby that they were not in a condition to resist, would conceive greater hopes in their advancing. <hi>Rohans</hi> advice was therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, which was, That the <hi>Swedes</hi> seeming to feare the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Wert,</hi> who was an old and an experienced Commander, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing advisedly, did temporise, lest he might fall upon the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush; he haulted that he might the better informe himselfe of the <hi>Swedes</hi> proceedings, who now retreating contrary to their custome, made him believe they had some stratagem on Foot. And that hee might the better discover the <hi>Swedes</hi> condition, and prevent their cunning, he advanced with part of his Army and all his Chiefe Commanders.

But <hi>Savell</hi> through intelligence held with some upon the place, and by corrupting the Guard, made an escape, to <hi>Waymers</hi> great resentment, who was much troubled at the losse of this Prince, as he severely shewed upon his complices. <hi>Rohan,</hi> who in this skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish was lightly hurt with a Musquet-shot in the Leg, was much importuned by <hi>Waymer,</hi> who exceedingly loved him, to withdraw himselfe and have his wound drest; but he esteeming it but a small hurt, it at last gangrend, in so much as he dyed thereof not many dayes after, to the great griefe of <hi>Waymer,</hi> and all the other Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and of all the Protestants;
<q>For he was a very wise man, and who governing his actions more by his considerate discretion, then by his daring force, had gotten many Victories. And had he beene a <hi>Romanist,</hi> so as the King of <hi>France</hi> might without any suspition of his loyaltie, or scandall of his other <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Subjects, have intrusted him with the managing of his most important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, what might have beene expected from him commanding a powerfull Army, who with the weake power of the Protestants had alwayes maintained himselfe against the King in <hi>France</hi> it selfe? <hi>Rohan</hi> was a <hi>French</hi> Prince, Duke and Peer of <hi>France</hi>; being bred up, and educated in the Warres under <hi>Henry</hi> the great, he attained to such experience, as following the opinion and partie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, he was by them chosen to be their Generall, in which charge he alwayes worthily behaved himselfe, till such time as he got the Kings pardon; He was civilly behaved, courteous in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, and of a very sweet condition, which made him much approved of by such as had dealings with him; He had a sharpe wit, was wary in his proceedings, and advised in his Counsells; He was not proud, nor seemed he to be ambitious, nor were there any reprehensible faults knowne in him; He was noble in his expences, and despised increase of wealth (a gallant part in a compleat Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.) And when any discourse was offered upon this point, by
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:55221:216"/>
any who were straight-handed and had betaken themselves to the War onely for lucre sake, he had wont to say, that such men ought to be abhorred by all Princes: because where particular interest mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litats, the glory of the publick keeps not the field; and good will dwells not where Avarice keeps house; that that soule wants the freedome of sacrificing it selfe to glory, which is fettered by Gold; that nothing of worth, nor generousnesse can be expected from him, who studies onely how to acquire riches. He was alwayes diligent in what concerned businesse, infinitly inquisitive after novelties, desirous of correspondency with men of worth; he used such subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all his actions, as that he atchieved his ends more thereby then by his Forces; he spared not for Mony in rewarding Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, which he kept in all parts, and affirmed that such were the eyes of an Army; he was so suspicious, as where he held a bad opinion, he feared even truth it selfe; he was of such an impression, as where once he fixt his minde, even reason could hardly alter him. He discoursed willingly, spoke with all men, was very inquisitive, and would know every the meanest matter; whereupon hee had wont to say, that as ever hearb hath its vertue, so every man hath his saying, and that oft times that was learned from the meaner sort, which was not had from the greatest; and hee added, that those Princes were of no great worth, that were not the subject of the peoples chat. He loved, and acknowledged himselfe beholding to a pen that could write without paine, to an easie pen; and hee held that those Princes were happy in this behalfe, who were reverenced by an ingenious writer; hereby said he the understanding is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, doubts are expounded, mens mindes are cleered, and Counsells are strengthned; hee thought notwithstanding there were but few that were good at the knowing, remembring and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, what they had seen and heard; and on the contrary he pittied those who were guided by a presumptuous information, by a false signification, by an ill grounded judgement, for by these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels doe miscarry, wisedome is confounded, resolutions are perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Hee oft-times interpreted things quite amisse, and was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in what he conceited, that he thereout framed to himselfe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured confidence; he was so great an Enemy to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as hee hated even those that spoke well of them; and when his King had not as yet any warre with them, his antipathy was such unto them, as he indeavoured their mischiefe as much as in him lay; and would say that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> love, nor esteem not any Nation but their own, so all men knowing their affections to be feigned ought to hate them; he left no heirs male behind him, had onely one Daughter, who as is reported is one of the fairest Ladies in all <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>Those of <hi>Rinfeild</hi> being strangely cast downe by this defeat, failing now of the hopes they had of being succoured, and being more and more pursued by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who desirous to proceed to further enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises did sorely torment them, they resolved to treat, and to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up the place; which insued upon their permission to march out with their Armes and Baggage, and to be convoyed to <hi>Brisack. Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:55221:217"/>
being incouraged by these prosperous successes to thinke upon greater enterprises, advanced forward, tooke <hi>Chitzenghem</hi> and <hi>Triburg,</hi> and to the great griefe of all the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who much dreaded this affaire, he sat downe before <hi>Brisack,</hi> and began to make exact workes and redoubts for his owne defence, and to put an end to that siedge. And that the Army might not want munition, nor any thing necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to boot with the provisions made by the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Colmar, Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> chose <hi>Rinfield</hi> for the Magazine, whether all things requisit to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the worke was to be brought.</p>
            <p>These proceedings of <hi>Waymer,</hi> together with the defeat and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment of <hi>Iohn de Wert,</hi> as they were of great importance, so was the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> the more troubled thereat, who being a wise Prince, foresaw what prejudice might redound to his Dominions, if the <hi>French</hi> should nestle themselves in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and particularly, if by the losse of <hi>Brisack,</hi> they should together with this place of refuge have the Passage free over the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> whereby his state would ly open to their invasion, and might easily become a prey unto the Enemy; or else he must be inforced to keep a great Army to defend it, which would be very grievous to his Subjects. Hee substituted <hi>Ghets</hi> in the place of <hi>Iohn de Wert,</hi> and made him Generall of all the Forces of the League, and commanded him to raise what few Forces he could in the Dukedome of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> that hee might have an eye to <hi>Waymers</hi> proceedings, and use his best skill for the preservation of <hi>Brisack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to returne to the other side, the Marquis <hi>Leganes,</hi> who had provided all things necessary in the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> not onely for the maintaining of that Dukedome, but was so increased in numbers by fresh recruits from <hi>Spaine, Naples</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> as that he had an Army on Foot, able in respect of the weaknesse of the <hi>French</hi> to undertake any thing, not willing to temporise any longer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, whilest the Enemy proceeded so prosperously in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> afford his enviers occasion of murmuring against him, but so to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that what the <hi>Austrians</hi> lost in one place, they might get in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; hee therefore whilst <hi>Waymer</hi> was busie about <hi>Brisack,</hi> brought his Army to the Territories about <hi>Valenza,</hi> disposed of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for a Camp in the neighbouring Townes, tooke some pieces of great Ordnance from the Castle of <hi>Pavia,</hi> and provided hay for the Horses; so as all <hi>Italy</hi> stood expecting what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were; And diverse were the discourses and considerations that were had hereupon:
<q>Some who weighed the importancy of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack,</hi> wondred not a little, that at a time when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ought to preserve that Fort, which was the key of those Provinces, and the sanctuary of their subsistance in those parts, they should onely minde the agrandizing of themselves in <hi>Italy</hi>; and that instead of succouring a place of such importance with Forces from <hi>Italy,</hi> as at other times they had done, they should demand and take men from those Provinces, the more to strengthen their Army in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy.</hi> Others said that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> now saw how hard a matter it was to raise men in <hi>Italy,</hi> as also elsewhere by reason of the so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall drawing forth of Souldiers, consumed in so many, and so long
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:55221:217"/>
Warres; that therefore <hi>Germany</hi> being of a contrary climat to <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it was a bad businesse for them to deprive themselves of that strength of Militia, which upheld the <hi>Spanish</hi> greatnesse in <hi>Italy.</hi> Others affirmed that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not greatly mind those parts, because they little feared the <hi>French</hi> Forces should make any great progresse there, aswell for that neither the <hi>Swissers</hi> nor <hi>Dutch</hi> were well-pleased that so great a King should extend his power to their Frontiers; as also that they thought the people of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Emperours Forces sufficient to succour that Towne, and they hoped that the jealousie the <hi>Dutch</hi> had of the <hi>French,</hi> who by antipathy are not greatly liked of them, would make them thinke of a meanes to moderate their excesse of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But those who thought they could dive deepest into the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> bosome said, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did so much value the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> and were so desirous to Lord it in <hi>Italy,</hi> as they did more consider that then all the world besides. For the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> possessions in <hi>Italy</hi> being the greatnesse of his Crowne, and the Dukedome of <hi>Milan</hi> of it selfe, and for reasons of State the most considerable place he was Master of there, consequently the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> intentions were not onely to preserve it, but to increase it; and because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were of all things else most vext, that the <hi>French</hi> had opened the way into <hi>Italy,</hi> and concentred themselves in the most important Fort of <hi>Casall,</hi> flanking upon their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby their power was much diminished, and the power of the <hi>French</hi> increased, to their so much griefe, as they were formerly content to see themselves the one Arbitrators of affaires in those parts. So as not regarding any other interest in comparison here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they chiefely indeavoured to drive the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> to remit themselves into their former Authority, and to make themselves be more reverenced, intending afterwards when they should be victorious in <hi>Italy,</hi> to recover the places they should have lost in <hi>Germany</hi> the more easily; for the <hi>Dutch</hi> weary of the spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conversation of the <hi>French,</hi> would be readily disposed to remit themselves to their own more flegmatick society; so as the <hi>French</hi> being on all sides shut up within their Kingdome the way would be open for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to obtaine their coveted ends. To these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests were added the <hi>Spaniards</hi> naturall inclination to the clymat of <hi>Italy,</hi> because that this more complying with their complexions then any other, they more willingly came hither then to any other part; where to boot with the wholsomenesse of the aire, and the bettering of their condition, they much valued the respect that was shewed unto them, and the affection wherewithall they were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For the <hi>Italians,</hi> being naturally courteous, discreet, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually gentile, not being able to withdraw themselves from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Forrainers, and of two evils the lesser being to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, doe more willingly succumbe to the <hi>Spanish</hi> nation then to any other; for that by their civill and courteous proceedings, and by the hopes of honour and greatnesse, of which they are aboundantly lavish in all professions, to those they know fit for it, and whose good
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:55221:218"/>
will they desire to win, that they may thereby oblige the Nobility, make their subjects obedient, and their Empire tollerable, they are better borne withall then are any other Forrainers. To this may be added that the <hi>French</hi> not using to impart any of their greatnesse in <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Italians,</hi> where they are not suffered by the <hi>French</hi> to have any great Commands, and the <hi>French</hi> not possessing any states in <hi>Italy</hi> wherewithall to satisfie them there, it hence ensues, that the hopes being greater which are grounded upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> then upon the <hi>French,</hi> many who are governed by their selfe-interests are more affectionat to <hi>Spaine</hi> then to <hi>France.</hi> So as all these reasons being put together, they are sufficient to gainsay any opposition that may be made by other maximes. Others also would not forbeare to say, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had alwayes their thoughts more bent upon <hi>Italy,</hi> when they fared worst elsewhere; for it was supposed they might hope whilst their Armies were put to the worst elsewhere, the other <hi>Italian</hi> Princes growing thereby confident, would not so easily apprehend their preparations in <hi>Lombardy</hi>; so that the hopes that they would not put for any novelty in <hi>Italy,</hi> whilst they were ingaged elsewhere, afforded them time and meanes, by which they might afterwards onely tend their increase of greatnesse in <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <hi>Crequi</hi> being advertised of <hi>Leganes</hi> military preparations, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> designes might bee upon <hi>Rossegnano, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calvo,</hi> and <hi>Pontestura,</hi> as places which would much facilitate the taking of <hi>Cassall,</hi> hee tooke his men from their quarters in <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> and went to the Frontier, intending to disturbe the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He never imagined that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> without greater Forces or Provisions would have dreamt upon the taking of <hi>Brem,</hi> it being a Fort Royall, and very well seated, and which might very well hold any Army how great soever play for some time; there was therefore little appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>Leganes</hi> could doe any good before it, and the rather for that it might be easily succoured by the <hi>French</hi> Army, or they might great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incommodiat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by cutting off their Victuals: but it proved cleane otherwise; for to boot that the Garrison within were not well paid by the King, <hi>Mongagliard</hi> who was governour there, had brought in some <hi>French</hi> Merchants thither, who by their negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had already erected a warehouse of <hi>French</hi> merchandize in the Fort, and that they might have the better vent for their Ware, hee permitted any one to come in that would spend his mony. <hi>Leganes</hi> under pretence of buying commodities did by understanding men informe himselfe of the condition of the place, and having learnt that by reason of the last Winters Ice a great part of the Rampier was broak down, as being only made of Earth and coped with Turfe; that moreover the Palisadoe of the ditch was weak, that the ruins were not yet repaired, that there were but few Souldiers in it, and the greatest part of them sick and weak, and that all other things that concernd the defence of the Town were but ill-favoredly governed, hee thought the taking therof would not be so hard a matter as was imagined by many. He therefore unexpectedy appeared before it with his Army, 2 houres before day on the eleventh of <hi>March,</hi> where Count <hi>Ferrante Bollognino</hi>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:55221:218"/>
advancing with his Brigade of Foot against a halfe Moone upon the Gate towards the <hi>Poe,</hi> he with no great adoe tooke it. <hi>Don Girollamo Sottello</hi> with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot tooke his station on the neither side; <hi>Don Iohn Vasques Coronado,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cremona,</hi> quartered himself with the <hi>Lombards</hi> on the upper side; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> haulted neere <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logninoes</hi> station. Here Workes were raysed, and approaches made on all sides; the Batteries were made, and the Fort was playd upon by the Cannon. <hi>Mongayliard</hi> thought to hinder their Works by a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant salley that he made, but at his comming out of the Gate with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40 Horse, himselfe being bravely mounted upon a Daple Gray, he was saluted with so thick a haile of Musquet-shot, as his Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slaine under him, and many of his men unhorst, he returned back into the Fort, upon which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Cannon thundring from all sides, the defendants began to feare, and were greatly afflicted for that they were inforced to supply the duties of the Garrison.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Crequi,</hi> who liked not that this place should be lost, upon the first newes he heard thereof, made some Boats be prepared and furnished with Men, Munition and Armes, and sent them downe the River on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the same moneth that they might relieve the Fort. But these being discovered by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they handled them so ill as but a few Souldiers got into the Towne. Whereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hoping well to effect their desires, they continually built lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Forts at proportionable distance, and threw a Bridge over the <hi>Poe,</hi> which they fortified on both sides, to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from playing upon <hi>Bologninoes</hi> quarters. <hi>Crequi</hi> being informed of all that past, though he had deferr'd the succour a few dayes, intending first to let the <hi>Spaniards</hi> be a little weakned and consumed, and that he himselfe might be the stronger; yet fore-seeing, that if this place should be lost whilst he looked on, to boot with the importance of the Fort, it would redound much to his dishonour, he resolved to advance, and to indeavour by all meanes possible how to relieve it. But Fortune, which when she will forsake her Favorites, takes first from them the use of their understanding, and then the like of their body, having for many yeares favoured the wisedome of this valiant Captaine, now taking from thence that heedfulnesse which keepes it alive, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi> after having seene how unadvised he was in not making necessary Provision for the defence of that Fort, contrary to that wisedome which formerly he was indowed withall, ranne furiously to shunne the danger which over-hung his honour and his loyaltie, if that place should be lost, and boldly advanced to discover the position of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Campe; he went with some of his Domestiques on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side the <hi>Poe,</hi> and leaning against a great withered Tree, he with a perspective Glasse indeavoured to discover the position of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies quarters. A Cannonier of <hi>Bologninoes</hi> quarters espied him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other that were about the Tree, for he was clad in Red, which made him be the better discerned a farre off; and imagining that he must be some man of eminency, because usually the great men of <hi>France</hi> weare that colour in the Warres, he levelled a Saker of twelve pound Bullet against him, and gave fire thereunto, the Bullet
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55221:219"/>
whereof hit <hi>Crequi</hi> on the left hand wherewith he held out the perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Glasse, and on the belly, bereaving him immediately of his life, and the Bullet stuck in the body of the Tree, which being afterwards found by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was kept in memory of <hi>Leganes. Mongagliard</hi> hearing of this accident, desired to be informed of the truth thereof from <hi>Leganes,</hi> who civilly acquainted him with what had happened, from whence he tooke an occasion to come to a rendition, of the which, his avarice and negligence had beene the onely cause.

Mongagliard</hi> and foure other Captaines of that Garrison were onely suffered to come into <hi>Cassall,</hi> who by the command of the Embassadour <hi>Emmeri,</hi> were presently made prisoners. <hi>Leganes</hi> having left 1500 Foot in <hi>Brem,</hi> with all things necessarie, under the command of <hi>Don Carlo Sfondrato,</hi> with directions to slight the Workes made during the Siege, and to repaire the Fortifications of the Towne, returned to <hi>Milan,</hi> where a thanksgiving was observed, and their joy exprest in Feastings, Maskes and Turny, throughout all <hi>Milan,</hi> as indeed they had reason; for who shall consider the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy of this situation, must needs confesse, it was the happiest thing that at the present could befall the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> unlesse it were the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Cassall</hi>; for this Towne being seated in the very bowells of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> opened the way thereinto, and afforded the <hi>French</hi> occasion to thinke upon the taking of <hi>Mortara,</hi> a very strong place, and well guarded by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which if it should have fallen into the <hi>French-mens</hi> hands, doubtlessely the State of <hi>Milan</hi> and all other parts thereabouts would have tasted the miseries of Warre.

Duke <hi>Crequi</hi> was of a gallant behaviour and gratefull presence, his courage, and the esteeme that every one had of him might be read in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; He was bred up in War, educated amongst Souldiers, and had his growth in Armies, and by his actions he shewed he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55221:219"/>
the Character of a worthy gallant gentleman. His many acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the many victories won by his Sword made him be dreaded, and trumpeted his deserts, his alliance with <hi>d'Esdeguieres</hi> whose Daughter he married, conferred respect upon him, and made way for the greatnesse to which at last hee arrived; He lived splendidiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly, preformed punctually the duty of his charge, and mannaged his Kings affaires with much advantage; hee was of a high spirit, witty, and very advised. In briefe had he not been a little too vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, and too much given to the satisfying of his sences, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of amisse could have been said of him; but hee affected too much his owne appetite; he was aswell a sonne of <hi>Venus</hi> as of <hi>Mars,</hi> hee too much exposed his wisedome to the surprisals of folly. The faire looks and good demeanour of every Lady imprisoned his heart; hee cherished all manner of censuallity; as soone as hee came to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towne, his first inquiry was after women of composition, and would preferre his familiarity and domestick licenciousnesse with them, before any respect of his place, gravity, or condition; his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in discourse with-drew much from his estimation; hee died an old man being past 70 yeares old, and forsaken by that good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which had protected him in so many bickerings.</q>

            <p>The losse of <hi>Brem</hi> made the <hi>French</hi> Forces be ill-thought of by the <hi>Italians</hi>; for whilst it was thought they would have manifestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> they on the contrary suffered their strongest holds to be lost their Armies looking on, and by the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, and sufferings of their Souldiers, lost whole squadrons. It fared otherwise with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whose numbrrs still increased, having at this very time received a Regiment of <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Horse, under the command of Duke Saint <hi>George,</hi> and two Brigades com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the two field Marshals, <hi>Achilles Minutelo,</hi> and <hi>Pompey de Genaro,</hi> together with other recruits which were continually made in the <hi>Austrian</hi> dominions. The <hi>French</hi> commanders foreseeing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> emboldned by these fortunate successes would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves therewithall, but indeavour to proceed further; and their Army being in great confusion by reason of <hi>Crequi's</hi> death, whose authority as it was great with the Souldiers, and Kings Officers, so were his desires with more diligence listned unto. Monsieur <hi>d'Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> who as Embassadour was upon this accident superintendent of all the Kings affaires, and the Count of <hi>Guiscia,</hi> Generall of the Horse, acquainted the King and Cardinall <hi>Richeleiu</hi> how affaires stood, and did earnestly desire his Majesty to send speedy and requisit provisions answerable to the occasions; and gave him an exact account of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Force and condition. Whereupon the King casting his eye upon these parts, his intention being that the Warre should be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>Italy,</hi> if not to proceed further, at least to divert the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, which being assembled in the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> might to very good purpose re-inforce <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> when they should bee of no further use in <hi>Lombardy</hi>; and so much the rather, for that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diversion in these parts, the taking of <hi>Brisack</hi> would prove a hard businesse, which was gallantly carried on by <hi>Waymer</hi>; Because the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:55221:220"/>
               <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were much concerned in the preservation of <hi>Alsatia</hi> for the afore mentioned reasons, would as formerly they had done, use their utmost power and indeavours to relieve <hi>Brisack,</hi> and entring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with the <hi>Italian</hi> Forces joyned to the <hi>German</hi> into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> would occasion no little trouble to the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Lorayn</hi>; and though some were of opinion that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though they should not bee troubled with the <hi>French,</hi> would not so easily bee drawne from <hi>Italy,</hi> before they had freed <hi>Montferrat,</hi> yet these considerations being weighed by the King and his Councell, 'twas resolved that greater care should be taken of the affaires of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and that to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> further progresse, the Army should bee recruited with Men and Commanders fitting to mannage the Warre. To boot ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the levies already ordered to this end in <hi>Dolpheny</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> Monsieur <hi>d'Argentone</hi> was incontinently dismist away with Monies to <hi>Turin,</hi> to view the Souldiers, and pay them their Arrears; and after him the Regiments of the Count <hi>de Guiscia,</hi> Monsieur <hi>D'Alincourt,</hi> the Count <hi>de Saw,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Vagelach,</hi> were sent to <hi>Cassall</hi>; and the Cardinall of <hi>Vallette</hi> sonne to the Duke of <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none,</hi> one, not onely wise in politique affaires, but very valiant, and who very well understood the affaires of Warre, was chosen Generall of his Majesties Forces. The Count <hi>de Guiscia</hi> minding the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Cassall,</hi> provided for all things requisit for that Fort; he had an eye to the actions of some of the Princesse of <hi>Mantua's</hi> Officers, who he was jealous might bring some Forces thither; hee tooke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der throughout all <hi>Montferrat,</hi> that such as were fitting to beare Armes should be ready to be mustered, and to joyne upon any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the <hi>French</hi> to oppose the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; neither was hee negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in providing all things necessary for that state.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The intentions of the <hi>French</hi> in the opinion of many foreseeing men were grounded upon good reason, not to indeavour for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent any further advancement in <hi>Italy,</hi> but onely to preserve <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> and to injealousise the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in those parts; for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance whereof, and out of their desire of making further atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they probably might beleeve that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not care what losses they might undergo elsewhere, so as they might proceed on there, but would keep the greater part of their owne Forces, and all their <hi>Italian</hi> Militia imployed on this side; and which was of more importance, bereaving the <hi>Caesarians</hi> of the best <hi>Dutch</hi> strength, that they might preserve <hi>Milan,</hi> and dilate the bounds thereof, they little valued the weakning of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; they therefore intended as was held by the speculative to keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> onely busied in the state of <hi>Milan,</hi> and in the meane time to indeavour by all possible meanes by winning the strong holds in <hi>Artoise,</hi> to secure the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy</hi> against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes and attempts of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on that side; And to possesse themselves of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> as also of the strong holds seated upon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> by which meanes <hi>Burgundy</hi> wanting succour, and means how to have it conveyed, would not onely fall into their power, but by the <hi>Rhyn</hi> they should secure their peacefull possession of <hi>Lorayn</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55221:220"/>
any invasion of the <hi>Dutch</hi>; And then turning all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon <hi>Italy,</hi> they might not onely make themselves masters of <hi>Milan,</hi> but of all other states that were under the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> To ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect these designes <hi>Waymers</hi> Army being recruited with Men, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; Victuals, from <hi>France,</hi> he was charged to attend the perfecting of his workes about <hi>Brisack.</hi> For though this Fort if it should fall into their hands, was by establisht agreement to be conferr'd upon <hi>Waymer</hi> in fee-farme both from the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (which was done to moderate the opinion which those people had taken, that the <hi>French</hi> intended to dilate their dominions in <hi>Germany,</hi> as also to satisfie <hi>Waymer</hi> and make him the more fierce up on the enterprise) yet they thought that when <hi>Brisack</hi> should bee taken, <hi>Waymer</hi> might be satisfied either by Monies or some other equivalent place. So as they applied themselves by their art, force, and industry, to the taking of this place, as that which was to bee their owne. There were some notwithstanding who thinking they descried the <hi>French-mens</hi> drift, did from thence draw this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and consequence, that they should doe wisely not to minde the affaires of <hi>Italy,</hi> for that the other <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, appearing not to approve the <hi>Spaniards</hi> increase of greatnesse, they would either openly or underhand declare themselves for the declining party, and would not for their owne sakes suffer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> increase of power in <hi>Italy</hi>; so as when the <hi>French</hi> should begin to fare ill in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes would appeare for them; and so the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intentions being by them counterpoysed the <hi>French</hi> might by the assistance of others maintaine the Warre in <hi>Italy,</hi> and keeping <hi>Montferrat</hi> in their owne power might the better vex the <hi>Austrians</hi> elsewhere, and bring afterwards their owne Forces in a fitting time into <hi>Italy,</hi> and reduce those Provinces to a bad condition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were wholly bent upon the getting of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and driving of the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> either were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to succour <hi>Brisack,</hi> or cared not though for want of succour it should fall into the hands of the <hi>French</hi>; The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> who wisely foresaw the mischiefe that might ensue hereupon, and who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended much that <hi>Waymer</hi> might obtain his ends, after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated these particulars at <hi>Caesars</hi> Court and plainly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of state (who still persisted in desiring more men for the state of <hi>Milan</hi>) the danger that this Fort was in, and the consequencies that depend thereupon; 'twas resolved that all the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Forces that were in <hi>Swabenland</hi> and in <hi>Wertemberg</hi> should abstaine from going towards <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and march to the succour of <hi>Brisack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee therefore having drawne all the men he could out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons of his owne state which came to about 9000 Foot and 4000 Horse, mustered them at <hi>Nordlinghem,</hi> and under the command of <hi>Ghets</hi> sent some of them into the Dukedome of <hi>Wertemberg,</hi> to drive the <hi>Swedes</hi> from their quarters, and the rest of them went towards <hi>Friburg,</hi> intending by keeping between <hi>Friburg</hi> and <hi>Rinfield,</hi> to streigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Enemies Camp of Victuals; especially since the Emperours

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch were the preparations for Warre made on all sides by the <hi>Austrians,</hi> and such was the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Saxonies</hi> constancy in union with <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> against the Crowne of <hi>Swethland,</hi> as that the <hi>Swedes</hi> being thereat confused and no lesse incensed, they were frequent in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells, and in using all oportune expediences how to prevent that mischiefe which they saw ready to fall upon them; and they were much the more troubled for that they saw the Princes of the same Religion ready to fall into the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice; for they knew that in policy it was not good for that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, but was repugnant to the reasons of State, to suffer the <hi>Sweeds</hi> to be driven beyond the Sea; For by their being Masters of the strong holds in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> a diversion was maintained, &amp; a counterpoyse, which at any time when the Imperiall Power should aime at the absolute Monarchy of <hi>Germany,</hi> would fitly ballance, and maintaine the authority of the Electors, and of the other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> in their vigorous degree; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midst between two great ones, when one of them should plot to bring them to their subjection, they would presently out of state interest be assisted by the other; and so being able by the helpe of the one, to contend with the other, their correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency would be the more esteemed by their neighbours on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side. The Elector notwithstanding (as it oft times fares with those, who being mastered by their passions, doe sometimes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the right way, and especially when their Counsellours being by their owne particular interests made to side with other Princes, sooth their Masters in what they are most inclined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) being now as much an enemy, and hating the <hi>Sweeds</hi> as much as he formerly was their friend, and shewed himself affectionate to them, continuing his spleene, and preparing by all meanes to work them mischiefe, afforded the <hi>Sweedish</hi> Ministers of State occasion of thought. The <hi>Sweeds</hi> knew of what consequence the maintaining of their armies in <hi>Germany</hi> was to the interest of their Kingdome, wherein they now having gotten a great repute, and their name being grown famous, which formerly inclosed in the most remote corners of the North, was unknown to other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such an augmentation of State was of great consideration, the Crowne of <hi>Swethland</hi> being thereby the more strengthened, and they reaping no usuall advantage by the Warres of <hi>Germany,</hi> so as they were not to forgoe such meanes whereby they might proceede how to keep what they had gotten. To boote with the publique Interest the <hi>Swedes</hi> were moved hereunto in regard of their own particulars. For by the plunder of those Townes they enriched their owne persons, most of them being but of meane fortunes; and by their traffique in the Havens of <hi>Pomerania</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> from the like in <hi>Swethland</hi>; they enriched their publike magazines and Ware-houses, bettering thereby as well the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique as the private; so as so specious an atchievement, and which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55221:222"/>
was with so much labour gotten, ought to be by all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preserved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> being moved by these and other greater reasons, and understanding how the <hi>Saxons</hi> strengthened by continuall <hi>Austrian</hi> recruits, pursued <hi>Bannier</hi>; they summoned a Dyet of the States Generall of <hi>Swethland,</hi> wherein the importancy of affairs being maturely discussed, it was with joynt consent agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the War should be continued, and to that purpose that a new levy should be made of 12000. Foote and 3000. horse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruite their Armies, and to provide for all things that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the maintenance thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> likewise were not unmindefull to provide for such things as made most for their greatnesse, and for the continuation of the Warre. And they found there was no more powerfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to weaken the <hi>Spanyards</hi> Forces in <hi>Flanders</hi> &amp; in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> upon which their thoughts were then wholly bent, then by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying fire home to their owne houses, to the end that being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to quench that, they could not so easily runne to extinguish farre-off combustions. They found no better way how to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw those Councells, which being solidly taken in the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> do usually produce ingenuous wayes how to get what belongs unto another, then by affording them occasion of spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their time in thinking upon their own defence. They knew that to boote with keeping the forces of <hi>Italy</hi> employed in the State of <hi>Milaine,</hi> so as they could not over-run <hi>Alsatia,</hi> it was also not little advantagious to stop the recruites which might from <hi>Spaine</hi> come into <hi>Flanders</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy</hi>; for the <hi>Spanyards</hi> were to keep an Armie in their owne Kingdome; and that this was one of the most probable courses which could make for the good of the <hi>French:</hi> to wit, to deprive <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> from being assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted from <hi>Spaine</hi>; whence it proceeded that these being Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes much esteemed of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and not able to receive u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall succours from them, those of <hi>Germany</hi> must demand aide from the Emperour, who if he should grant it, the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bereft thereof, in such case the <hi>Swedes</hi> progresse into <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and Duke <hi>Weymars</hi> in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> would be the more easie; so as either in <hi>Spaine</hi> or else-where the <hi>French</hi> must needs prevaile.</p>
            <p>To boote therefore with many warlike preparations made in <hi>Guien,</hi> a Province which extends it selfe from the <hi>Pirenean</hi> mountaines, to the Confines of <hi>Guascony,</hi> where all things were prepared fitting for the Warre of <hi>Biscay,</hi> and the Body of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my assembled consisting of 12000.

And to the end it might not be believed that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this warre should be the ending, or at least the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the rest, to boot with the directions and reinforcements sent to <hi>Weymar</hi> to put an end to the businesse of <hi>Brisacke</hi>; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishall

            </p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Vallette</hi> whose assistance in <hi>Piemont</hi> was very requisite, came about this time to <hi>Turim,</hi> and encouraged those who were dismaid to see the sumptuous preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and the weake applications of the <hi>French.</hi> And understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had sent the Abbot of <hi>Vasques</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to treate with the Dutchesse, and that <hi>Don Diego de Scaivedera</hi> was gone thither likewise, he imagined their businesse might be concerning the affaires of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and suspected that the Dutchesse of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who was said to be more inclined to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> then to the <hi>French,</hi> by reason of her consanguinity, and as more approving of their behaviours, not being able to endure that the <hi>French</hi> should appropriate unto themselves the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage or protection of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and that she should only have the bare Title thereof without any manner of authority, might have plotted some intelligence with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to free those parts from being quartered upon by the <hi>French,</hi> where their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode was not well liked of by the <hi>Mantuans,</hi> who pretended that that State should be independant upon any other Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the <hi>French</hi> should not patronize themselves thereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the specious pretence of the Dukes Protectors.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall thereof fore-seeing the prejudice which might ensue unto the <hi>French</hi> Forces, if <hi>Cassalle</hi> which was the place of refuge for their Armies should bee taken out of the <hi>French mens</hi> hands; and this his suspition being now become a certainty, for that the intelligence was discovered by a little note, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> casually fell from <hi>Octavius Montegli</hi> Governour of <hi>Cassall,</hi> and came to the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> who had not deserved to bee so rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Mantuans</hi>; hee therefore under severall pretences brought many <hi>French</hi> troopes into the Towne, wherewith hee drove all those of <hi>Montferrat</hi> out of the Citadell, took the said <hi>Montegli</hi> prisoner, and set a good guard upon him, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dismissed out of the Town the Counts <hi>Iacomo</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando Nata,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Langosco,</hi> and Father <hi>Capriato</hi> a Capuchin Fryar, and looking more narrowly to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> hee was very carefull of the preservation of that place, as of all

the rest in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> wherein having only <hi>French</hi> Garrisons, he caused such jealousies in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as this was sufficient to keep the assistance of <hi>Italy,</hi> which was so much dreaded in <hi>Alsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> within the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> But all these provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>French</hi> for the maintaining of <hi>Montferrat</hi> and <hi>Piemont</hi> were greater in appearance then in substance; For the Cardinall came into <hi>Piemont</hi> with an intention to vindicate the credite of the <hi>French</hi> Forces, but with so small a <hi>Militia,</hi> as that it was plainely seene the <hi>French</hi> either wanted Forces to manage the war in <hi>Italy</hi> to their advantage, or that they cared not then for the affaires of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> having greater businesse in hand elsewhere. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who above all things else were troubled with the neighbour-hood of the <hi>French,</hi> by which the authority they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have in <hi>Italy</hi> was much lessened, knew it was not now time to loose oportunity, but to betake themselves to such things as might make most for the State of <hi>Milan.</hi> Thus <hi>Leganes</hi> having mustered his Army about <hi>Valenza,</hi> under pretence of feare of the <hi>French</hi> who were come along with the Cardinall, he resolved to betake himselfe to the taking in of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> as a place flanking too much upon the State of <hi>Milan</hi>; and by the winning whereof, he should not only bereave the <hi>French</hi> of a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, who being hereby backt, might the easilier make Warre against the <hi>Millanoise,</hi> and did the better secure themselves from being invaded in <hi>Montferrat</hi> or <hi>Piemont</hi>; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should enlarge their Territories, and open their way into the heart of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and place themselves neare <hi>Montferrat,</hi> against which they might with more oportunity take fitting resolutions. And that which imported most, was, that by the taking hereof, the <hi>French</hi> would be ill thought of by those of <hi>Piemont</hi> for not having succoured them, and by opening their way into <hi>Piemont</hi> it would be no difficult businesse upon Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his arrivall totally to alter that State, and to bring many of the Inhabitants to side with the Princes of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> fearing lest by the moving of their Army their intentions might be discovered, and that consequently a stronger Garrison might be put into <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and greater provisions made for the defence thereof, so as they should meete with greater difficulties in the attempt; that they might make the <hi>French</hi> believe their intentions were to invade <hi>Montferrat, Leganes</hi> sent <hi>Don Vincensa Gonsaga</hi> with some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of horse towards <hi>Trino,</hi> and <hi>Don Ferante de Monti</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troops of horse towards <hi>Cassall,</hi> and he himselfe by night on the seventh of <hi>May,</hi> taking his Army from out their Quarters, came before <hi>Vercelles</hi>; where dividing immediately their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Leganes</hi> placed himselfe at Saint <hi>Bartholmeo</hi> a mile without the City; he placed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Burgonians</hi> betweene the River <hi>Sero,</hi> and the Church of the said Saint <hi>Bartholmeo,</hi> he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the <hi>Italians</hi> from Saint <hi>Bartholmeo</hi> to the Monastery of Franciscan Fryers; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Grisons</hi> extended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the said Monastery to the Sesia; and suddenly a great
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55221:224"/>
many Trenches, Redoubts, Workes, and Barracadoes being made by Pyoners to withstand the succour which might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by the <hi>French,</hi> he began to make his approaches, &amp; to plant his Cannon against the wals. The Marquesse <hi>Dogliony</hi> who was Governour of the Town in behalfe of the Dutchess of <hi>Savoy,</hi> surprized by the unexpected accident (for hee could not believe that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would bring their Forces before a Cittadell of the Duke of <hi>Savoyes,</hi> considering the good intelligence which they held with the late Duke) no wayes quailed in his courage, but prepared according to his due loyalty to defend the place, he viewed the men that were to defend it, which appeared to bee very few in respect of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and of the compasse of the Workes which were to be defended, as also the Ammunition to be very short; and having acquainted the Dutchesse therewithal by trusty Messengers, as also the <hi>French</hi> Commanders, to the end that they might thinke of relieving him, hee made a gallant sally annd tooke a sconce neere a Winde-mill about a quarter of a mile from the Towne, where hee intended to fortifie, that hee might keepe the enemy so farre further from the walls; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being aware thereof, presently set upon him, &amp; made him remove with some losse.</p>
            <p>The newes hereof comming to <hi>Turim</hi> as it was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, so was it the more wondred at; since it concern'd the setting upon one of the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Forts, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that policy according to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it was thought the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would govern themselves towards his highnesse. For the wiser sort of people thought that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would never have so far exasperated those of <hi>Piemont,</hi> as to make them call in the <hi>French</hi> into their strongest places for their defence, with whose neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood in <hi>Montferrat</hi> they were too much troubled. They therefore exclaimed against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; also against the <hi>French</hi>; for that resting secure under their protection, they saw little appearance of their safety, by reason of the <hi>French-mens</hi> weak preparations for War, which made them not only fear the losse of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> but foresee greater mischief which might ensue to that State: so as the <hi>French</hi> Commanders were strangely netled hereat, and in particular the Cardinall of <hi>Vallette,</hi> who was more troubled then all the rest, to see the <hi>Spaniards</hi> advance whilest his Army looked on. He chiefely considered his reputation, wherein if hee should suffer at this his first entrance into <hi>Italy,</hi> as stones which tumble downe from an high place are hardly stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not without much adoe returned to their former place, so should he hardly by any ordinary actions recover his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when once in the wane, which would be a great hinderance to his actions; For it is true, that States and Armies are oft times more maintained by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>redite and reputation then by force; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bethinking himselfe how to evade so great a misfortune, he applyed himselfe to relieve the Fort. After having by speedy Messengers signified the present state of affaires to the Court, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55221:224"/>
demanded a recruit of men and moneys from the King, hee mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered all the Forces that were quartered in <hi>Piemont,</hi> and <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> and drawing thereout as many men as with safety to the strong holds he could, hee came betweene <hi>Santia,</hi> and St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to watch how he might convoy fitting succour into <hi>Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles.</hi> Which when <hi>Leganes</hi> knew, who would not be diverted from the siege, wherein as well his owne honour, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Masters Army was concerned, he feared lest the men he had brought along with him, might not be sufficient to withstand the <hi>French</hi>; to secure himself therefore from them, he solicited the comming of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> (who were continually taken into pay for the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> service) and the imbarquing of the <hi>Neopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans</hi>; moreover he drew forth the former Garrisons from out of all Forts, and supplyed their places with fresh men of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and by these meanes as also by continuall making of works and Trenches, hee prepared to frustrate the endeavours of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Opposite to the good success of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>Lombardy, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> his men who were quartered in <hi>Brunswicke</hi> and <hi>Alberstat,</hi> were as unfortunate; for to boote with their Armies being much diminished through the running away and death of their souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Gallas</hi> could not goe upon any service, as well for that the Countrey was wholly consumed, so as it was not possible for him to keepe longer in those parts, as also for want of moneyes, without the which the Armie not being to be contented, 'twould be but in vaine to bring them before an Armie re-inforced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troopes of Souldiers newly landed in <hi>Pomerania</hi>; for by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the greater part of the Souldiery which began already to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, would have acted their threats which they forbore not to make, without any respect either to their Commander, or to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself. Wherefore <hi>Bannier</hi> growing hereby bold &amp; much more encouraged by a great recruit of men, money and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition which was landed in the Island of <hi>Vsedon</hi>; knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe able during these troubles of the Emperours Army to effect some-what of importance, he tooke <hi>Garts</hi> and <hi>Vermond</hi>; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards <hi>Saxony,</hi> wherewith the Souldiers were well pleased by reason of their hatred to that Elector, hee caused great feare in those people, who greatly valuing the <hi>Sweedish</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, fearing lest their proceedings might bee answerable to their feares. Yet did not the Electors councel faile in making necessary provisions, they doubled the Guards in all places of chiefest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, they mustered their Army, together with the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Country, and sent their earnest desires to the Court of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> for their promised assistance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> knowing that the march of the <hi>French</hi> Armie composed of gallant Souldiers was an excellent diversion to keep those Forces busied in those parts which might oppose their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and probably perswading themselves, that during these the <hi>Spaniards</hi> molestations, they might doe some notable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55221:225"/>
act, they resolved to march into the Field, and try whether or no Fortune would smile upon them in the enterprize of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which was the most considerable thing they could undertake; having therefore mustered their men, part about <hi>Nimminghen,</hi> the chiefe City of <hi>Ghelders</hi> upon the wall, and part about <hi>Breda,</hi> they seemed as if their intentions were upon <hi>Gheldern,</hi> that they might draw the <hi>Spanish</hi> forces thither-ward; and imbarquing many of their men at <hi>Dorditch</hi> under the Command of Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> a Gentleman of great experience, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly fell upon the Fort <hi>Callo</hi> neare the <hi>Schelde,</hi> a League and a halfe from <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> and setting upon it with Petars and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aling Ladders by night on the fourteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> they luckily tooke it, and put the Garrison to the sword. And their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being to cut the Dikes which keepe in the water, that so they might drowne the Territories about <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by facilitate the surrender of the City, they passed forward and tooke the Forts of <hi>Hemband</hi> and <hi>Trarembacke,</hi> and came with their Trenches before the Fort of Saint <hi>Mary</hi>; but here Count <hi>Nassaw</hi> found not such fortune as hee desired; For the Marquesse of <hi>San Federato</hi> comming into the succour thereof with many troopes of Souldiers, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> not being able to raise their Batteries, by reason of the low scituation of the place they were on, and being continually plaid upon by thirty piece of Cannon from the Fort of Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> it behooved them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. And as usually retreates beget feare and confusion, so did the souldiers shew lesse fervour in their actions now, then when they were enheartned by successe. Count <hi>Nassaw</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing would not quit the Enterprize, but hoped when hee should receive the addition of men which hee expected, hee might easily compasse his desires, which did so frighten the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as forsaking their owne houses, they hastily fled into the strong holds, and the Citizens of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> were not lesse afraid, strongly suspecting least the enemie might hold intelligence with some of the City. But this enterprize conteining in it considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consequencies, and being of very great importance, caused the comming in of the <hi>Spaniish</hi> Forces, led in by the <hi>Infanta</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> accompanied by <hi>Picolomeny, Isemburg, Bucquoi,</hi> and <hi>Feria,</hi> with other chiefe Captains of Warre, who comming boldly on, after a long dispute the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and being encouraged by the <hi>Infanta's</hi> presence, who did by his owne example invite his men to fight, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being much the weaker, and not able to make head against the <hi>Austrians,</hi> who came still upon them with great strengths, they thought it best not to joyne Battell, but to keepe themselves within the advantage of their own stations, till such time as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being acquainted with their condition, and they being re-inforced by timely succours, they might undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly fate the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For the chiefe of all other directions which the States give unto their Captaines, being that they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55221:225"/>
should have a care to the preservation of their men, and not hazard themselves upon any uncertain Battell, since one bad encounter would very much endanger those Provinces, it not being so easie for them to raise new Forces, which are not to be had without much labour and great expence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> who had taken upon him the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of that affaire, not thinking it fitting time to exceed his Masters Commission, kept himselfe within the advantage of his position, hoping that by his keeping there till the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of the Prince, hee might easily have repulsed the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as it oft times chances that things fall not out according to fancy, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> falling on without delay upon the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who were not able to withstand their violence, being invironed on all sides, and the Bridge which they had throwne over the <hi>Scheld</hi> being at the same time broken by the great presse of people, the greatest part that were on this side the River were either slaine or taken prisoners. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> pursuing their victory, recovered ther former Forts, and rendred the attempt vaine, on which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had built so great hopes.</p>
            <p>The Siege before <hi>Brisacke</hi> continued all this while, and Duke WEYMAR confident of good successe continued his Workes, and Trenches, as well against the Towne, as against the succour; whereat the <hi>Austrians</hi> being not a little grieved, and in particular the Duke of BAVARIA, who had mustered a great many men under the Conduct of <hi>Ghets,</hi> all the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Commanders were charged that they should come up to the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Army, that they should then passe over the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi> at <hi>Dutlinghem,</hi> and doe their utmost to remove WEY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAR from that Siege. <hi>Ghets</hi> thought it a difficult businesse to set upon the <hi>Sweedes</hi> on this side the <hi>Rhene,</hi> where the Enemies greatest strengths were; wherefore he past over the <hi>Rhene,</hi> to try whether he could get into <hi>Brisacke</hi> on that side or no. But WEYMAR who was much concerned in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this place, as well in his reputation as in his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respect, being faithfully informed of all things that past by his Spyes, and by some Protestants of <hi>Wertemberg,</hi> who hated the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and <hi>Austrians,</hi> threw a Bridge over the <hi>Rhene,</hi> betwetne <hi>Brisacke</hi> and <hi>Brussells,</hi> and was very vigilant in observing the Imperiallists wayes; who for want of Forrage, being to enlarge their quarters, afforded the <hi>Sweedes</hi> occasion to surprize one of their quarters, and to evill intreate the Regiments of the Collonels, CORPUS, HOORST, and REIGOTOCH, who being set upon at unawares, and not able to draw out in good order, lost about five hundred Souldiers and fourteen Colours, and made <hi>Ghets</hi> know that this was not the way to succour that Towne; but that keeping quiet till the arrivall of more Forces, his best course would be to try the other side of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> where he might be much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55221:226"/>
advantaged by the sallyes which those within the FORT might make at the same time, and by the Cannon from the Towne, which commanded the fields round about. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rose from his Quarters hee was in, and passing backe againe over the <hi>Rhene,</hi> hee encamped himselfe neare <hi>Offemberg,</hi> with intention to keepe there, till by new Orders and fresh re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cruites, hee were made able to effect the necessary and desi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red succour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having planted their Cannon against VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLES, and drawing by their covered Workes nere unto the Walls, though they were replyed upon by the besieged with reciprocall valour, and stout sallyes, yet the Cardinall of VALETTE knowing that strong places are oft times lost for lacke of succour, and wisely weighing in his Councell of Warre, the difficulties hee should meete withall, in bringing suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour thereinto, hee bethought himselfe how hee might effect his desires by stratagem. To this purpose he sent eight hundred Foote under the name of one of their Leaders, who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly received as a party of their owne, which passing by some Sconces carelesly looked unto by the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> they meeting with nothing to hinder them, conveyed about 600.

               <hi>Leganes</hi> finding that without speedy and fitting remedie hee should be hereby much gauled, and forced to quit the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, he considered what best course was to be taken, and found there was none likelier to take effect then diversion.

hundred Horse which which were sent from the siege of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> another bodie of an Armie was framed, whereof though the greatest part were unexperienced men, yet were they sufficient to effect the thing desired.</p>
            <p>With these the Cardinall, and <hi>Don Martin Gallicano</hi> Master of the Campe, accompanied with a great many of the Gentry of <hi>Millan,</hi> came to <hi>Vigerano,</hi> and from thence by orders from <hi>Leganes,</hi> they advanced towards the Fort <hi>Sandavall,</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that if the <hi>French</hi> should keepe their station in the <hi>Sesia,</hi> they should set upon them on their backes, whilst <hi>Leganes</hi> should charge them on the Front, and so force them from thence with much losse.

The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being by this retreate the more encouraged, and encreasing their offensives against the Towne, the Governour seeing the <hi>French</hi> were retreated, and thereby finding how hard a matter it would bee for the Towne to bee relieved, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed by the joynt consent of all the chiefe Officers of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison to come to a Treaty, before they were reduced to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter necessity; For the number of of the Defendants were much lessened by their continuall sallyes, and they much feared the Mynes made by the <hi>Spanyards</hi> underneath their wals.

            <p>These excuses availed but a little to pacifye those of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who mightily afraid, knew not whether to turne themselves; for on the one side they were displeased with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as expecting to have their Countrey ruinated, and themselves opprest by them; on the other side they were but ill satisfied with the <hi>French,</hi> for being the Authors of the Warre, and not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend them, they saw that all their mischiefe had its rise from them, so at it was easily seene they shewed not such affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards them as at the first. But you may give loosers leave to talke; These mens laments were little valued by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and lesse by the <hi>French,</hi> for each of them minded onely what made most for their owne Interest. Some notwithstanding, who will not let any thing passe uncensured by them, said that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> actions were mysterious, the <hi>French</hi> had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise their ends in their designes, and were not lesse deepe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; For though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by taking of <hi>Vercelles</hi> had opened their way into <hi>Piemont,</hi> and had made the <hi>French-men</hi> lose the good will of the <hi>Piemontesians,</hi> and by the comming of Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> were likely to effect their desires of getting into the best Towne of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and by bereaving the <hi>French</hi> thereof, to strengthen <hi>Montferrat</hi> the more; 'twas notwithstanding seene that this might prove but a baite to draw them into some dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous precipice. For by the addition of so many Conquests, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Jealousie in the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> they might easily draw on a League against them, from which if nothing else should have ensued, the very taking up of Armes by those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was of Notable consequence, for it would occasion the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, and make it a more difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to raise men for the service of the Crowne of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Since the souldiers partly weary with the sufferings of War, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allured by the desire to change fortune, and to get new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of pay, partly through the feare which they brought with them from <hi>Naples</hi> into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and others being called for backe by their naturall Princes, would have much lessened their Companies by their flight. So as what by those who were run away, and what by those that were slaine in service, the State of <hi>Milan</hi> would be reduced to such a scarcity of defenders, as the <hi>French</hi> might easily have flown in upon those parts.</p>

it should bee so, that they were before <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> which caused no little confusion in the people of those Provinces, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the <hi>French</hi> to undertake the siege of Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> which though it were an enterprize of great difficulty, yet was it the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier by reason of the present conjunctures.

            <p>They therefore drew neare to this place which they very much desired to take, and employed all their witts how they might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were very much troubled that so famous a Citie as this should bee lost, it being the key of those Provinces; minded the importancy of the affaire. Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> tooke with him part of the Army that was then in <hi>Brabant</hi> by reason of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> new undertakings, and Encamped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe betweene <hi>Duminghen</hi> and <hi>Ardres,</hi> two Forts from whence the Victuals and Ammunition was brought to the <hi>French</hi> Campe, intending to reduce their Armie to so great a scarcity by cutting of their Commerce with those Forts wherein they had placed all their Provisions requisite for that siege, as they should be necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to give over the enterprize, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Towne without the losse of blood, and so it fell out: For the accustomed Victuals not being able to bee any longer brought either by Land or Water to the <hi>French</hi> Camp from those places, which lay most commodious for that purpose, and their numbers daily decreasing by their excessive sufferings and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duties, and by the running away of their Souldiers, they were by the gallant behaviour of the Besieged brought into a bad condition, and the succour not appearing time enough, which was expected to come with the Marishall <hi>De la Bresse,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Saint Prejule,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> raised their Siege on the twelfth of <hi>Iuly</hi> to their great prejudice, having lost about sixe thousand men before the Towne, and retreated neare <hi>Ardres</hi> a place of great consequence belonging to the King of <hi>France,</hi> that they might hault there, and attend new Orders from the Court, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the expected succour, which they heard was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon the way towards them.

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55221:228"/>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> who could not endure to stand idle in these present occasions of <hi>Flanders,</hi> molested by the <hi>French,</hi> though they were much afflicted for the blow they had received at <hi>Callo,</hi> and that this unfortunate accident was knowne by many to be a fore-runner of other bad events that yeare; yet as undaunted Souldiers, and accustomed to the variety of Fortune, not at all declyning in their hopes, but confirmed in their opinion of not letting the winter approach without atchieving some-what worthy of their Forces, they resolved upon the enterprize of <hi>Gheldren.</hi> Having therefore led on their Armie towards <hi>Niming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen,</hi> and made some new <hi>Dutch</hi> Troopes passe over the <hi>Rhene</hi> at <hi>Skinschconce,</hi> they marched 16000. strong before that Town, and taking up their Quarters, began to draw their Line. The Newes hereof being forth-with brought to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who was at this time recruited with sixe thousand <hi>Collonians</hi> brought unto him by <hi>Lamboy,</hi> to boote with <hi>Picolomenies</hi> men, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in person thither-ward, and <hi>Lamboy</hi> with his <hi>Dutch-men</hi> fell so furiously upon Count <hi>Casamire de Nassaw's</hi> Quarters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous either to dye or not to goe out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as <hi>Picolomeny</hi> did after the attempt before <hi>Mastricke,</hi> and with his sword in his hand amongst the first Files of his men assaulted some of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Trenches not yet perfected, and after a long and bloody dispute hee wanne the Station, and put some <hi>Dutch</hi> to the Sword who did defend it. This was reported to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened through intelligence had with the <hi>Dutch</hi> themselves.

Wherefore the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> wisely knowing hee could do little good by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring a revenge; to shunne the hazard of joyning Battell, hee forth-with rose from where he was quartered, and retreated to <hi>Capell.</hi>

            <p>But though the designes of the <hi>French</hi> had not good successe in <hi>Artoise,</hi> they notwithstanding prospered in <hi>Bischay</hi>; for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having assembled a great Army, he couragiously advanced into the <hi>Spanish</hi> Dominions, and unexpectedly came before the Port of <hi>Passagge,</hi> a chiefe Citie in <hi>Biscay,</hi> seated upon the Sea, betweene <hi>Bayone,</hi> and <hi>Fonterabbia,</hi> called also <hi>Airo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> invironed only with bare walls after the auncient fashion, but with a strong Haven within, to keepe from being injured by the Enemies Vessells, where the Gallions destined for the <hi>Indies</hi> are usually built; hee planted his Cannon against it. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> who had the custody thereof, (as it oft times fares with them, who nurst up in peace, and not acquainted with the noise of Warre, know not what belongs to an Enemies Armie) being surprized at such an novelty, and full of confusion, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether to turne, or how to defend themselves, embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>French-men</hi> to assault the Towne, who with little resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55221:228"/>
made themselves masters thereof, in the beginning of <hi>Iuly</hi>; which the officers of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court were much troubled at, for besides the losse of the seat wherein they provided for the tackling of their <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, and of many Gallions and other ship provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: this business made the <hi>Spanyards</hi> now that they saw the war brought home unto them, linger no longer about the necessity of waging War afar off, but giving over the applying themselves to the Wars of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> bethinke themselves how they might hinder the <hi>French</hi> from proceeding further on that side. The <hi>French-men</hi> presaging good success unto themselves by this happy encounter, brought their Army before <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> one of the best places the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath in those parts, intrencht themselves, and ordered their Cannon against it; whereupon the <hi>Spanyards</hi> greatly fearing to lose this place, the importancy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was very great, and it being requisite to use all possible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to provide against this unexpected novelty, all the Stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries of those Kingdomes were by order from the King summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon paine of life, and charged to goe toward <hi>Pampalona</hi> in <hi>Navar,</hi> and <hi>Vittoria</hi> in <hi>Bischay,</hi> there to be commanded by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mirall of <hi>Castile,</hi> who having already assembled a good strength on the other side, had an eye to the proceedings of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These preparations grew every day greater, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> without any regard either to their goods or lives, ran to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of those Frontiers, &amp; which served for an out-fence to their Countrey; and many souldiers ranne every day from the <hi>French</hi> Camp, who cursing the mountains of <hi>Spain,</hi> knew not how to live out of the pleasant fields of <hi>France,</hi> so as the businesse began to grow more doubtfull. Yet did those undaunted Commanders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to continue the begun siege, till by the arrivall of new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were a raising on all sides in <hi>Guien,</hi> and in <hi>Gascony,</hi> they might the better pursue their desired ends.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Valette</hi> growing by the losse of <hi>Vercelles</hi> more jealous of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in whom he only feared surprizals and stratagems, looked the more narrowly to the safety of <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> and having placed his men in the frontier Townes thereof, he went to <hi>Cassall</hi>; where he found <hi>Montegly</hi> his processe made, &amp; him therein found guilty of holding correspondency with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> wherefore hee on the suddaine caused his head to be struck off, and had a better eye to the Inhabitants of <hi>Cassall.</hi> Yet <hi>Emery</hi> the Embassadour of <hi>France</hi> was not well pleased with this sentence, who as it seemes had promised <hi>Montegly</hi> that hee should be pardoned. And this piece of Justice was thought the more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, for that <hi>Montegly</hi> being a servant of the Dutchess of <hi>Mantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's,</hi> and bound to obey her commands, 'twas reported that he did nothing but by her allowance.

friends, should dispossesse her of that wherein she acknowledged no Superiour but God, and which her very enemies by all their treacheries could never bereave her of.

               </gap> further into a Mil-stone then others; some said that the Dutchess could have wisht that the businesse had succeeded according to agreement, and that agreement was that which hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
<q>For 'twas said that dealing under-hand with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> she had resolved to drive the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Cassall,</hi> and yet not to receive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in; with which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were well contented, as being satisfied that the <hi>French</hi> should not bee there, and that those places should continue in neutrality. It was commonly given out that the agreement was, that <hi>Montegli</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into the Towne, should have dismis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Swissers,</hi> for the payment of which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would lend the Dutchesse money. So as the Towne being taken out of the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and yet not fallen unto the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; the Dutchesse and Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> would have enjoyed the Prerogative that belonged unto their Soveraignty; and that this State standing in the midst betweene two others, each of which was desirous to hold good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency wth her, they would consequently vye which of them by their fair entreating of the Subject, &amp; by their respect born unto the Dutchess should reap such advantage as might make most for them. Others held, that if this should have happened, the effect would not so easily have ensued; because the <hi>French</hi> being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at scandalized, would presently have ruinated <hi>Montferrat,</hi> being Masters of the best Towns therein, and if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would defend it, the event must be War, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have done the same thing the <hi>French</hi> did; for if the Town should have fallen into their hands, no wise man will believe that ever they would have quit it uncompel'd. Wherefore since it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to evade war, or to shun the falling into the hands of one of these two great Potentates, a mischief was undergone on the one side, and a greater mischiefe on the other; so as it was best the <hi>French</hi> should keep possession thereof, as those who were not so neare neighbours, and were to passe through the State of <hi>Millan</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before they could make any further progresse; and that it should not fall into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who when they should have secured themselves on that side, would afterwards give the Law in <hi>Mantua.</hi> Others said that the <hi>French</hi> by doing such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Justice had deviated from the Laws of good policy, because they might have bereft <hi>Montegli</hi> of his life, &amp; have secured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from any thing the other Officers could have done, after another manner; that by doing thus they warned other Princes not to introduce the forces of greater Potentates then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55221:229"/>
into their owne homes, since it plainly appeares they give away that to the one, which they fight for and deny unto their enemies. And they further added, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> being exasperated, it would be hard for the <hi>French</hi> to keep in that Province if they should fal out with them. But those who know the interest of States to be of so nice a nature, as every the least jealousie is sufficient to raise suspition, conceived that the <hi>French</hi> had done very wisely, &amp; affirmed they had learnt this of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; proved that they had good grounds for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the fort. For this being that which upheld the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and esteem of their arms in <hi>Italy,</hi> without it, all their designes would have miscaried. They maintained so great a King ought not expose himself to the injuries of an inferiour; that those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions are always good whereby a State is enlarged, and such negligence blamable as draws on ruine, that what is taken away may at all times be restored, but that not alwais recovered which is lost. That it it is not unlawful to ceaze upon that which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceazed upon, causes greater mischief to him that ceazeth not on it..</q>

<q>But <hi>Cappello</hi> who knew what the agreements were between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Ottomans,</hi> wherein it is declared, that the <hi>Turkish</hi> Pirats must not enter the gulf, nor harbor within the Forts or ports of the grand Seignieur, which if they doe, it is lawfull for the <hi>Venetian</hi> fleet to take them; He therefore not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the duty of a gallant Captain, &amp; to the honor of our chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, boorded the great gallies, &amp; beating down their fences

with his Culverins, he sent forth many souldiers in armed barques and Schifs to the assault.</q>
The Pirats amazed hereat, forsook their station, and began to flye; and to be brief, on the 15. of <hi>August</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> made themselves Masters of all the aforesaid Gallies, which were al presently sunk, except 2 which by the grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eurs arms were known to be come out of the Arsenall of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> This victory being doubtlesly the greatest that hath been had since that of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> as it was of great joy &amp; consolation to all Christians, who could not sufficiently return thanks unto, and praise the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> which had obviated so much harm to Christendom, so were the <hi>Turks</hi> as much displeased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at; for as it is usual with their cruelty, who value nothing but their own greatness, the news hereof comming to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and much exaggerated by the Pirats, those barbarous people, profest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to christianity, exclaimed very much against the <hi>Venetians</hi> the <hi>Chaimecham</hi> (for so they call the <hi>Visier Basha,</hi> who in the Kings absence hath the command of the Port) put a guard upon the <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olo Veneto,</hi> &amp; sent speedy news thereof to the grand Seignior, who was at this time gone to warre against the <hi>Persians</hi>: who when he heard thereof, being highly incenst, as wel for the loss of his fleet, and the injury received in his owne Havens, &amp; chiefly for that the fautors of these Pirats did by all meanes possible endeavour to trouble the peaceful correspodency between those two <hi>Potentates,</hi> hee was ready to shew some great piece of barbarisme against the <hi>Baiola,</hi> had not his <hi>Basha's</hi> dexterity diverted him; telling him how that Princes in their treaties with Princes ought to be Prince-like, and that to injure those who represent the publique, was to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the law of Nations; yet were not the guards withdrawne, nor the threats against the <hi>Venetians</hi> lessned; For the <hi>Turks</hi> declaring they would wage war, they gave some signs thereof by inhibiting commerce, &amp; by imbargoing the <hi>Venetian</hi> ships in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and did many other things, which put all Christendome in no little jealousie. This news arriving at <hi>Venice</hi> was not any wayes able to move the ground-work of that undanted constancy which abiding in the bosoms of those wise &amp; grave Senators, hath alwais made it be known by effects they feared not the greatest combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of force the world could make against them.

that depended upon the <hi>Venetians,</hi> had private commissions how they might behave themselves in their negotiations, and in <hi>Venice</hi> preparation was had for war. Thirty Gentlemen of the best Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the Common-wealth were chosen to be Captains of smaller Gallies. Signior <hi>Antonio Pisani</hi> a Gentleman of great esteem, and worthy to be Generall, was chosen Captaine of the Galliouns or great Gallies, and to the two that were abroad were added 2 more newly built in the Arsenal of <hi>Venice</hi> of a strange structure, the one of which was under <hi>Pisani,</hi> the other was recommended to the charge of <hi>Sebastian Veniero,</hi> an exquesitely wise, and wonderfully valiant Senator.

            <p>They sent Signieur <hi>Iavanni Nanni</hi> Procurator of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> a very worthy Gentleman, and much esteemed of, for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in the mannaging of publique affaires, Embassadour Extraordinary to the <hi>Pope:</hi> and for the present they only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided some Foote under the Command of the Marquess <hi>Bentivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> the Marquess <hi>Malatesta,</hi> and some other Lords; for not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the <hi>Ottamans</hi> were likely as yet to have a Fleet at Sea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to encounter the <hi>Venetian</hi> Navy, they did wisely to deferre those expences, which being to be shunned, were of great ease to the publique Treasury, And the King being shortly expected in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they would make their preparations answerable to what they should see he would do. But the grand Signior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at last to his Court in great Triumph, he presently declared himselfe that he would have warre with the <hi>Venetians</hi>; He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called unto him the <hi>Bashaw</hi> of the Sea, whom he commanded to get together all the shipping he could, so as the appearing hope of accommodation suddenly vanished. Whereupon those grave Fathers not failing in their requisite wisdome, chose <hi>Luigi Sforzi</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Marke,</hi> one famous amongst the Captaines of that age, who to his infinite glory had by all his actions spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his fame, to be their Proveditor Generall under the name of <hi>Capitan Generale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as Princes speake alwayes boldlyest, when they have their weapons in their hand, the Common-wealth being now in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, and no wayes inferiour in their power at Sea to the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and mannaging all these affaires to their best advantage. Signieur <hi>Luigi Contarini,</hi> a Gentleman much verst in the affaires of Princes, and who had purchast much glory in passing through all those first Embassies conferred by his Country, did so stoutly behave himselfe, with so much zeale to his Common-wealth that at last, to the universall content of Christendome,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55221:231"/>
and to the great honour of the Common-wealth, and her Agents, the differences were agreed, and the former Article betweene the grand Signieur and the State of <hi>Venice</hi> again ratified.
<q>And the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> to boot with their taking the 17. Gallies, gained the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription to a new Article, wherein it was expresly declared, that it might be lawfull for the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies without any manner of respect to pursue such Pirats as should enter into their Sea, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Havens of the Grand Signieur, and underneath his Forts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Weymar</hi> this mean while strongly besieged <hi>Brisack,</hi> &amp; by new forces received from <hi>France,</hi> he secured the field defences, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> shewed he meant to end that siege with profit; so as what the issue of that affaire would be was plainly discerned, unless the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allists</hi> within the Fort, who for want of necessaries began already exceedingly to suffer, should receive speedy &amp; oportune succour. <hi>Ghets</hi> who had the superintendency of the <hi>Papists</hi> Army confer'd upon him by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> being continually prest by the Duke to raise the Siege, endeavoured how hee might with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent satisfie the expectation of all the Empire. Therefore after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving maturely sifted the danger and difficulties of overcomming the Enemies Trenches, <hi>Savell</hi> and <hi>Golts</hi> both of them Sergeant-Major Generalls of the Battell, were of opinion that they should in good order set upon the <hi>Sweeds</hi> Trenches; that the most coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious amongst them should throw themselves headlong upon <hi>Weymars</hi> Works, whereby they doubted not but to beate the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and to free the Citie, and they offered to give on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the first ranke.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But <hi>Ghets</hi> upon whom the whole burthen of the businesse lay, and upon whom the blame would be laid, if any evill should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen (as it is usuall to impute the success (be it good or bad) to the Commander in chiefe) very well foreseeing the difficulties which doubtless they were to meete withall, differed in opinion from them, alleadging that Duke <hi>Weymars</hi> Army was stil the same, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> not long before had defeated their Army, when commanded by <hi>Wert</hi> a gallant Commander. That it was not to be doubted they would hope for the like victory, for that victorious souldiers fight with as much courage as the losers doe with feare. That it was very well known what a Commander <hi>Weymar</hi> was; resolute in what he took in hand, &amp; that hee would rather dye gloriously then run away; that they were not to undervalue the enemies forces, who were assisted by strong troops of old and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>French,</hi> led on by worthy Captaines, and (which imported most) fortified in covered Trenches. That wise &amp; prudent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought chiefly to have a care to the safety of their men, &amp; not build upon uncertain hopes which are oft times overthrowne by fickle fortune. That therefore his opinion was rather to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour succour by stratagem, then by force; that he should like it better to bring their Army neer unto the Enemies Camp in good covered Trenches, and then making use of some favourable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55221:231"/>
to set unexpectedly upon them. But as all men though of the same <hi>Genius</hi> differ in their <hi>effigies,</hi> so did these Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders differ in their opinions. <hi>Savell</hi> and <hi>Golts</hi> adhered to their former opinion; which was boldly to fight and buckle with the Enemy, which could not hope for greater advantage then to see the <hi>Romanists</hi> rather beaten with their owne fear, then by their weapons, they approved of the reasons alleadged, to weigh the difficulty, and not presumptuously to precipitate their forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their fame; but said that delay was the greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to any enterprize, when it is not grounded upon some great piece of cunning; that bold enterprizes were favoured by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and that great spirits were encouraged by the enemies fear. What will our enemies say (said they) if they shall see us, who pretend to be so strong both in numbers &amp; in courage, lie encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and not draw neer them? what hope wil our Enemies have, if it being once noised among them, that we are afraid of them, they fight with us possest of such an opinion? but what wil they say at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Monacho</hi> when they shall see the fruits of our fair promises to be amazement before we see the enemies sword? The prolonging of resolution profiteth not, when all delays are harmfull. If the field Fortifications be now unpenitrable, what will they be, when by the addition of others they shall be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the Forces which intend to march from <hi>Piemont,</hi> and other pars, shall be come up unto the enemy, and have made them so much stronger? and in conclusion, they protested to <hi>Ghets</hi> that the occasion was now fitting, and that it was not by any meanes to be let slip.</q>
               <hi>Ghets</hi> finding himselfe hereby to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two rocks, &amp; that he must needs give against one of them; For if he should keep to his first resolution of temporizing, they would blame him of Cowardise, and if any mischiefe should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, they would say they fore-told it, and so lay the blame upon him; and if he should fight, he clearly fore-saw the little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he was to reap thereby; so as choosing the least danger of the two, he resolved to be governed by them. Order was given how they should behave themselves upon this occasion. <hi>Golts</hi> leading on the Van, was to invade the <hi>Sweedish</hi> quarters with part of the Army: <hi>Ghets</hi> was to follow them with the Rear, &amp; to be in readiness to assist them when they should be gotten into the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or if they should be beaten backe, to make good the retreate. This being resolved upon, <hi>Savell</hi> and <hi>Golts</hi> on the 9 of <hi>August</hi> in the head of 5 of their best Regiments fell upon the <hi>Sweeds</hi> works, which were with like courage defended, whilst the battle was stoutly fought by both sides, and the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> had they been succoured by <hi>Ghets,</hi> who was more then once desired to advance with his fresh men, doubted not the victory. <hi>Weymar</hi> came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in person on this side with 4. <hi>French</hi> Regiments and 2 <hi>Dutch</hi>; so as the Battle was again very hotly begun, the <hi>Sweeds</hi> constantly defending themselves, and the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> worthily behaving themselves, hoping still to be succoured by <hi>Ghets</hi>: and here <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:55221:232"/>
was like to have lost his life; for his horse rising up before, &amp; startling at the fire of a Pistoll, fell backewards with him to the ground, where some souldiers came in, and fighting miraculously between him and the enemy, afforded him time to get upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther horse, wherewith he was readily furnisht; whereupon going upon a full trot in the head of two gallant <hi>French</hi> Squadrons, hee charged upon another body of <hi>Dutch,</hi> led on by no lesse courage by <hi>Goltz.</hi> And here he fighting himself with his sword in his hand, and by his example infusing courage into the other souldiers and Captaines; the battle grew so hot, as shooting being given over, nothing was seen but swords smeared with blood, men and horses overturned and trod on by their own companions. <hi>Ghetz</hi> all this while looking on, that hee might come in according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when <hi>Goltz</hi> and the other Captaines should have made the breach, which they vaunted they would doe, advanced not one inch, for knowing that the enemie had likewise a reserve, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to hazard the whole Army, unlesse hee should see the <hi>Van</hi> prevaile somewhat, he therefore kept his station, and would not follow his compagnions. They being therefore hotly pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Weymars</hi> fresh men, were forced to think of a retreat, which ensued in such disorder, as some <hi>French</hi> troopes had leisure to do no small execution upon the <hi>Caesarians; Weymar</hi> pursuing <hi>Goltz</hi> in the same manner, handled him so, as the greatest part of his men were either slaine or taken prisoners; whereat <hi>Savell</hi> and <hi>Goltz</hi> were so incensed, exclaiming against <hi>Ghetz,</hi> and upbraiding him with cowardize and unworthinesse, as they by their letters to the Emperour &amp; Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> did accuse him of being the cause of all their losse and mischiefe; Which being received as a trueth, (for great men must never acknowledge to have erred in their Commissions) the miscarriage of their men, and <hi>Weymars</hi> valour being attributed to <hi>Ghetz</hi> his mis-governement; <hi>Philip</hi> Count <hi>Mansesielt</hi> Captain of the Emperours Guard was sent into <hi>Alsatia</hi> with ample authority to enquire into this accident, &amp; to provide for what was necessary to the preservation of that importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t place. The <hi>Romanists</hi> Army was much troubled at these disagreements; For besides the losse of 4000. of the best men <hi>Ghetz</hi> had, they greatly murmured against <hi>Ghetz</hi> his backe friends, as if they had accused him falsely, and seemed not to be well pleased with the processe that was making against him, giving out in a skarpe and bitter manner, that good and faithfull servants were through the wickednesse of their enemies and envyers rewarded with impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, so as the mischief that was hereupon likely to ensue was very great. <hi>Ghetz</hi> having foreseen all these proceedings (for hee very well knew that this successe, as it would be related by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of other Commanders, would not only prejudice his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but bring his life in danger; (for such omissions as prove harmfull to the State are seldome favourably interpreted by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and oft times judged by Justice it selfe when blinded with passion) he made his addresse to the Emperour, with whom for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55221:232"/>
his ancient services he was held in some esteem, and who he knew had better respect unto, and did more love his faithfull servants, to the end that enterposing his Imperiall authority with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> he might not suffer him to be injured by the false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of his enemies, nor that integrity abused, with which hee had at all times served his Prince; offering willingly to enter himselfe into any of his <hi>Caesarian</hi> Majesties Forts, and submit to the sentence of his just Tribunall. To which the Emperour in his good nature was ready to condiscend, had not the Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> who was advertised hereof, sent suddenly an expresse messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to entreat his Majestie not to undertake the defence of an Officer of his, whose faults were of too tender a condition; and assuring him that all right and Justice should be observed in his processe. Wherefore <hi>Ghetz</hi> being sent for to give an account of his actions, was with a good guard brought into <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> being risen from before Saint <hi>Omer,</hi> and Marishall <hi>Schattillion</hi> being joyned with Signieur <hi>de St. Previll</hi> in the parts about <hi>Ardres,</hi> to make amends for the last ill successe, and recover the reputation wherein the <hi>French</hi> seemed to suffer; he resolved to storm <hi>Rentij</hi>: For this Fort being built upon a passe of no small consideration upon the Frontiers of <hi>France</hi>; by the taking of this place of refuge from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they would not know how to make inrodes into the parts thereabouts, and the way would be the more open for the <hi>French</hi> to enter freely into the dominions of <hi>Spaine.</hi> He therefore came unexpectedly before the place, and planted his Cannon against it, and in a short time tooke it by storm, and the <hi>French</hi> not having need thereof, as having other Forts neer at hand, it was forth-with slighted by command from the King, and the people therein disperst into the neighbouring parts; and haulting upon these Frontiers, quarters were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten up, &amp; skirmishes made by the horse of both sides, &amp; the Commanders were very vigilant in keeping what they had got.</p>
            <p>At this time 15. Gallies were come into the Port <hi>de Vado</hi> with about 1500. Foot, part from <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and part from <hi>Cesely,</hi> who
expected orders here from <hi>Milan</hi> where they should land their men: When <hi>Don Roderigo de Valesco,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls absence commanded therein in chiefe, understanding that the <hi>French</hi> Gallies were discovered to be in the <hi>Genoan</hi> Sea, and knowing them to be but 15. and a Brigandine, called a Councell of the chief <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where it being argued whether they should fight or keepe quiet in the Haven, it was the joynt opinion of all that they should set upon the <hi>French.</hi> They therefore put to Sea, and were little above seven miles from <hi>Genoa,</hi> when they began about ten a clock in the morning on the first of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to salute each other with their Cannon, and at last falling to boord with their swords and half-pikes, the action grew so bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as great was the slaughter which was made amongst the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and much was the blood which ran out from the fore-decks and sides of the Gallies; for many of the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55221:233"/>
in the <hi>French</hi> Gallies, who are accustomed to Sea-fights, the fight was very hot on both sides; but at last the <hi>French</hi> prevailing, it behoved the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to flye with the loss of 6. of their Gallies, amongst which the <hi>Capitana</hi> of <hi>Secely,</hi> and <hi>Padrona</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> And taking there of the <hi>French</hi> Gallies which for want of souldiers and Marriners were left at Sea, and which were <hi>La Marishalla, La Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle,</hi> and <hi>La Sernier,</hi> the rest saved themselves within the Haven of <hi>Genoa.</hi> The fight continued the space of 2. hours; which being thus ended, a storm arose the next night, wherein the <hi>French</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies lost <hi>La Patrona di Spagna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They are said to be certaine kind of boates.</note> by the breaking of the rope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she was towed, which being afterwards found by some <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> and <hi>Coraline,</hi> was brought to <hi>Genoa,</hi> having first taken out of her all the money &amp; goods that was in her, which was left with the chiefe Magistrate of <hi>Albenga</hi>; and which was all afterwards restored to the <hi>French,</hi> though to the small satisfaction of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> as causing strange rumors. The <hi>Spainish</hi> gallies parting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards from <hi>Genoa,</hi> came to <hi>Porto Fino,</hi> to mend the harms they had received by canon-shot, &amp; sailed from thence towards <hi>Ligorn,</hi> to provide themselves of Galli-slaves and other things necessary for their putting again to Sea. This blow being heard of in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> great was the grief occasioned thereby in those people and Officers; and they were the more vext, for that they profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to have the prerogative and dominion of those Seas, and to be the <hi>Arbitrators</hi> of all such ships as saile thereon, they could not endure that the <hi>French</hi> should Lord it there, and inlarge their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer as well by Sea as Land. Applying themselves therefore to the consideration thereof, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State forth-with began to make new preparations. They gave out new Patents for Foot, to whosoever would undertake to raise them, the number of <hi>Artificers,</hi> in their Arcenals were encreased; they hired Merchants ships, and were diligent how to repaire their loss, &amp; to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a condition of not meeting with the like misfortune, which was prejudiciall to that reputation which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend to wear upon their swords point. And they pursued their affairs the hotter, because they feared lest the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all sides invironed by the <hi>French</hi> forces, might in processe of time come to some capitulation with that Crown; which they knew to be one of the greatest mischiefs that could befall the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose greatness in <hi>Italy</hi> depending upon the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noea's as well for the borrowing of moneys as for the fitnesse of their scituation to succour the State of <hi>Milan</hi> by Sea, if this were taken from them, those who understood any thing of State affairs verily believed they would have been very much strieghtned, as on the contrary, by the friendshipip of <hi>Genoa,</hi> they might strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintaine themselves in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Now when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had taken <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and having since then till now kept quiet vvithin their quarters, not only to recruit their men, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, but to put themselves in a readinesse for new enterprizes, &amp; to see where the <hi>French</hi> would fixe their thoughts, which was said
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55221:233"/>
would be upon the recovery of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> when they should have received the succour they expected from <hi>Dolpheny; Leganes</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the preparations of the <hi>French</hi> were much less then what they were given out to be; for not above 2000. foot, and those ill appointed, were as yet past the <hi>Alpes,</hi> he resolved not to suffer the winter coming on, without some further atchievement. After ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny consultations had between <hi>Leganes, Don Francisco de Melo, Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> &amp; other chiefe Commanders, they resolved to goe for <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> and taking <hi>Alba,</hi> to proceed forward into <hi>Piemont,</hi> as well the better to secure the passages of the <hi>Lange,</hi> as that by meanes of this place, they might winter all their army in the enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and thus besieging <hi>Cassall</hi> at a distance, they might by little &amp; little so strengthen it, as bringing their forces afterwards about it, before the <hi>French</hi> could come into the succour of it, they might reduce it to their obedience, so as giving out they would take St. <hi>Ia,</hi> a strong fort in the Territories of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> which being possest by the <hi>French,</hi> hindred the assembling together of a great part of those Territories. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> rose on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Sept.</hi> from their quarters, &amp; with 10000. foot &amp; 3000. horse under the command of <hi>Don Francisco di Melo</hi> (for <hi>Leganes</hi> was not then very well in health) came to the Town of <hi>Candia</hi> in the <hi>Lumellina,</hi> and here mustering his men, he past over the <hi>Poe</hi> at <hi>Brem,</hi> and divided his Army into two bodies; with the one he himselfe came before <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> a Castle between <hi>Cassall</hi> &amp; <hi>Valenza,</hi> and <hi>Don Martin d' Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona,</hi> marched with the other towards <hi>Acqui,</hi> that he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards come before <hi>Alba.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> awakened by this the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> march, called a Councel of Warr, wherein wisely exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> drift might be, and considering upon fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting remedies, some were of opinion, that leaving a convenient Garrison in <hi>Cassall,</hi> the main body of the army should immediatly march towards <hi>Alba,</hi> and endeavour to light upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whilst thus disjoyned, which when they should have beaten, they should have so weakned the rest of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they might afterwards freely keep the fields, and look to the preservation of <hi>Alba,</hi> a place at this time of great importance; for if they should once have gotten this, they might easily afterwards bring their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before <hi>Carmagneola,</hi> a Fort in <hi>Piemont,</hi> between the <hi>Poe</hi> and <hi>Tanare,</hi> from whence succour might be brought to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> so as if they should likewise become Masters thereof, they possessing <hi>Asty, Verna,</hi> &amp; <hi>Trino,</hi> should almost have invironed <hi>Cassall</hi>; which being in midst the <hi>Spanish</hi> forces, &amp; not so easily to be succoured by the <hi>French,</hi> it might at last be inforced to yield. But the Duke of <hi>Candalle</hi> being otherwise minded, and being therein seconded by his brother the Cardinal of <hi>Valette,</hi> and by Count <hi>Guiscia</hi> 'twas concluded, that <hi>Alba</hi> not being then in any danger, as well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all things, they should goe to disturb the <hi>Spaniards</hi> designs, on the other side, and to scour the countrey; for when they should once have beaten these (as it would not be hard to doe, since they were disjoyned) they might easily afterwards dispatch the rest.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55221:234"/>
Whereupon the <hi>French</hi> came part of them to <hi>Trino,</hi> and part to <hi>Pontestura,</hi> &amp; throwing a bridg over the <hi>Sesia,</hi> they presently came upon the Territories of <hi>Lomellino,</hi> with intention to force out the <hi>Spanish</hi> armie; and if they might not fight with them upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they might at least for want of victuals and forrage compell them to abandon their design. But this advice availed not, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infested on all sides by the Garrisons of <hi>Lumello</hi> and <hi>Carasona,</hi> and being reduced to great necessity of victuals, particularly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forrage for their horse, wherein their greatest strength consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, they quit their design, &amp; returned to their former quarters. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> the mean while assaulted <hi>Poma,</hi> &amp; took the Town by storm, whereupon the Castle afterwards yeilded upon discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knowing of how little vantage it would be to them to have this place to retreat unto, they undermyned it, and gave fire unto the Myne, which wrought so wel, as that all the walls thereof were blowne into the aire, and thrown down. They then went all from thence towards <hi>Aich,</hi> there to take fitting resolutions upon the present Emergencies. <hi>Oxesternes</hi> arrivall at this time in <hi>Pomerania</hi> with a great strength of men raised in <hi>Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benland, Livonia,</hi> and elsewhere, made <hi>Bannier</hi> begin to hope wel againe, who for want of men had receded many Leagues from <hi>Gallasse</hi>; so as mustering his souldiers together who were disperst in the neighboring quarters, he appeared in the field, not so much out of his being well armed, and provided of all things necessary as out of a desire to fight, and recover any reputation he might be conceived to have lost. Whereupon <hi>Gallasse</hi> finding how trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a matter it would be to lye in the fields, in those parts impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished through long wars, and yet not daring to quit his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for feare his souldiers should mutiny for want of money; <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> had oportunity to assault <hi>Volghast,</hi> and to take it, which hee luckily did. He afterwards with his horse which were led on by <hi>Tortenson,</hi> advanced too neer the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> quarters, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had divers skirmishes, for it behoved <hi>Gallasse</hi> much against his will to retreat as far as <hi>Volbery</hi> towards <hi>Elbis,</hi> for he fore-saw hee was likely to reap but little good by that War, since the <hi>Sweedes</hi> were recruited in all parts, &amp; the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> every where lesned. To boot with these defaults which hindred him from proceeding on accordingly as he had hoped, he was much grieved for the death of <hi>Lelio Pompey</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman of <hi>Verona</hi> by birth, who had by many Princes been very wel esteemed of, as wel in peace as war. The <hi>Sweeds</hi> being the more encouraged by this retreat of <hi>Gallasse,</hi> came before <hi>Dimmin,</hi> of which, after many Cannon-shot, and three fierce assaults, they made themselves Masters; Wherefore <hi>Bannier</hi> marched cheerfully on toward <hi>Landsperg,</hi> by the winning whereof, the way was opened into <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> whether the <hi>Sweed</hi> did desire to come to take revenge for the injuries they had received from that Elector.</p>

like from <hi>Naples, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Germany; Francisco Giacintho,</hi> the young Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> seised on by a violent Feaver, dyed on the third of <hi>October,</hi> whose death as it bore along with it weighty consequences, so were not the effects which were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fore-told by our curious newes-mongers late in their arrivall, for there being none left of the Issue of <hi>Victorio Amedio,</hi> save one Infant Prince named <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> but five years olde, of a weake constitution of body, and who was at this time sick of the small poxe (a disease which raigned much that yeare) 'twas easily fore-seene that if he should saile, great troubles would arise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the succession, for the government falling upon the Prince Cardinall, and hee having of late declared himselfe to adhere to the <hi>Spanish</hi> faction, it would ensue, that upon this occasion the <hi>French</hi> would never tollerate a Prince in this State which should be independant upon them; so as keeping the Townes in their own possession, and not suffering the lawfull Prince to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, it would fall out, that the Subjects being well affectionate to their naturall Princes, and incensed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> against the <hi>French,</hi> the War must needs grow greater, which would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce bloody events. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore, who as hath beene already said, hath formerly laid great foundations upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Prince Cardinall, and Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> knowing this to be a fitting occasion, sent presently for the Cardinal from <hi>Rome,</hi> for that being by meanes of their Forces brought into <hi>Piemont,</hi> he might the better be prepared to take possession of his right, in case his other Nephew should dye. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> invited him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto out of greater hopes, for that they knew the Inhabitants of <hi>Piemont</hi> were not very well satisfied with the <hi>French</hi> after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> because in steed of defending them, and helping them to recover what they had lost, they seemed rather desirous to possess themselves of all the rest that belonged to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> pretending not to confide in the people, and to have some caution of their good in their hands. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were stil carefull to maintain their Crown in its greatness (for they knew what advantage did accrew unto them by the dependency of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes) and endeavouring all means whereby they might reap any good after their accustomed fashion of civility, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to correspond in gratitude, to the satisfaction they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> a wise Prince, and very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionat to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose good correspondency his Highness out of reason of State thought requisite, for besides the great advantage which those of <hi>Modena</hi> gat by their commerce with the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> it may be added, that confining upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> between whom and the Dukes of <hi>Modena,</hi> there was never any great inwardness since the loss of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> To boot then with what was already done, for the Emperour had already invested him in <hi>Corraggio,</hi> a Town in the heart of the Country of <hi>Modena,</hi> &amp; by al other friendly demonstrations, made him know what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation his most Catholike Majesty put upon him.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:55221:235"/>He was under various pretences invited to the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and more particularly, for that the Queen being great with child, was ready to lye downe; the King the more to win his friend-ship would have him to be God-father to his childe, yet this was but a pretence, to hide the true occasion which was not so easily seene by all men; for the emulation being very great betwen the <hi>Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> they could not disgest that demonstration of obsequiousness of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> whilst he went to visite him at <hi>Paris,</hi> without the like comming of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Italian</hi> Prince to <hi>Madrid,</hi> that it might be known that if <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> did depend upon <hi>France,</hi> others did side with <hi>Spaine.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> therefore being a sprightly Prince, and well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to make this voyage, that he might see new Countreys, and receive honours and profitable terms for his State, which he could not chuse but do from so great a King; went to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> where he was received with greater magnificency then ever was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prince of <hi>Italy.</hi> Those who see far into State-affaires, affirmed that this the <hi>Spaniards</hi> civility proceeded from the need they had both of his person, and state, and therefore they said they had brought him into <hi>Spain,</hi> with an intention of giving him the chief command of his Majesties Forces against the <hi>French</hi> in those king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; the which they did not onely to obleige that Prince unto their pay, but that they might have out of his Countrey which was very populous, as many souldiers as they could, to make use of them in their owne kingdomes. It was also reported that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State thought to make a change with this Duke, and to give him the Kingdome of <hi>Sardinia</hi> for his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Modena,</hi> which would have been a very good change for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> for augmenting the State of <hi>Millan</hi> by the addition of that of <hi>Modena,</hi> &amp; becomming on this side also the <hi>Popes</hi> neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they would have heightned their authority in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; and the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> bound up between the Country of <hi>Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> would have beene inforced to depend upon <hi>Spaine</hi>; and by how much the <hi>Spanyards</hi> power encreased in <hi>Italy,</hi> so much did the power of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes lessen; and <hi>Sardinia</hi> being but a barren Island, &amp; in a clymat almost unknown to the <hi>Italians,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have lost but little by loosing it. But the Duke being wise, and no ways wrought upon by these the <hi>Spaniards</hi> fetches, but answering their Civilities with as much courtesie, thanked his Majestie for the honours he had received, and took his leave of the Court, the King having notwithstanding declared him to be his General of his Navy at Sea, that by that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he might keep him as a servant to that Crown. The Duke came by gally to <hi>Genoa</hi> to the great contentment of his Subjects, who by his absence, and because of the report that hee was to change his State for <hi>Sardinia</hi> were much sadded. And his Councell not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it fit for him to deny the raising of 2000. men out of his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who had shown so much affection to his Highness, it was concluded it should be done, that he might
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55221:235"/>
thereby witness his gratitude to his Majesty of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours he had received from him; yet were not the <hi>Spaniards</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to carry away full 2000. men, for that the reason of State shews that Principalities may be termed poor, which are poore in Subjects. The <hi>French</hi> all this time continued their siege of <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbia,</hi> which as it made much for their affaires, so was it very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> since great consequences arising from the loss of this place, all the neighboring parts would have run ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of falling under the dominion of the <hi>French.</hi> Therefore the Admirall of <hi>Castile</hi> with an army that he had got together, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to assail the enemies Camp. The which he did on the 7. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> and obteyned his ends; For the <hi>French</hi> who were before the Town being much lessened in their numbers, and who were desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to tarry no longer where they suffered so much, did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves according to their accustomed valour. And though the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and other chief Commanders beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves with such courage, as becomes men that are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of glory, and did endeavour to withstand the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> yet were they not able to doe it; for the souldiers villified rather with their being there inclosed, then by their enemies valour were so confused, and fought so coldly, as they were fain to raise the siege, which was joyfull news to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and as unpleasing to the <hi>French,</hi> and in particular to the King; who not thinking that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> had behaved himselfe answerable to the expectation that was had of him, the Prince began to be ill thought of at Court; though when the businesse was maturely scand, those lost their first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, who immediately surprized at the appearance of evill, stop their eares, and will not let in truth. But if the <hi>French</hi> were sad for their no better successe before <hi>Fonterabbia,</hi> the <hi>Dolphins</hi> birth, which was on the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> caused such joy among them, and gave such generall contentment throughout all <hi>France,</hi> as they every where exprest such Jubilies and rejoycings, as it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well became them to do, for so great a blessing from God. They who by reason of their Queenes barrennesse for the space of 22. years, had given over all hopes of seeing any Issue by their King, and who therefore much feared the mischief that might befall the Crown by change of Successor, in an instant cleared up their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, and were greatly consolated at this so great mercy from Heaven. The King being piously given, threw himselfe upon his knees before a Crucifix, &amp; humbly returned thanks and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to God Almighty for his so great goodnesse towards him. The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who till now was in nature of the Kings Eldest Son, next heir unto the Crown, came in all hast, and with great respect unto the King, and humbly acknowledging the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> beg'd of his Majestie that as he had hitherto held him for his son, his Majesty would now love him as his Cadet. The King taking him up in his armes and imbracing him, witnessed his neernesse of blood, and the tendernesse of his affection. All <hi>France</hi> was full of jollity, as they expressed by their voyces, gestures, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55221:236"/>
actions; bon-fires abounded every where. In briefe, as Marriners are comforted by the change of a crosse winde, into a favourable gale, so did this sterrility being turned to fruitfulnesse, make the <hi>French</hi> rejoyce, wherein such as depended on them did share, but their enemies were hereat displeased.</p>

But before their undertaking any greater business, 'twas adjudged fit by men of understanding, not to leave any Towns behind their backs which were possest by those of the League, since thereby they might easily bring the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> to great scarcity of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, if their Army should unadvisedly engage it selfe.

But <hi>Azfelt</hi> being solicited from <hi>Vienna,</hi> to have an eye to the proceedings of these new Forces, and the rather for that the Elector of <hi>Mens,</hi> and other Ecclesiasticall Princes had very earnestly desired, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these their desires with protestations, that the War might not be suffered to be made upon their Territories, hee came thither &amp; made towards these new souldiers with about 8000. good men drawn out of Garrisons, whose places he supplyed with new men taken out of the <hi>Arch-bishopricke</hi> of <hi>Cullen.</hi> The Prince Elector being therefore brought to great scarcity of victuals, and not able to endure that his men should perish as they daily did through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodiousness, which was very prejudicial to the <hi>English,</hi> (who taken from the commodiousness of their own country, are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their first entrance more sensible of sufferings in the field, then are other Nations) resolved to fight, whereunto he was also inticed by his Captains, who troubled that they should find their hopes fail them, desired rather to hazard their lives in atchieving an honourable victory, then poorely to die through sufferings. Both the armies joyned therefore together in battle betweene the <hi>Vesser,</hi> and the County of <hi>Osnapruch,</hi> on the 18. of <hi>October,</hi> where the Prince Electors souldiers being new professors of War, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55221:236"/>
their Commanders no less unexperienced, they retreated so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly at the first going off of the Canon, as being pursued by the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> horse, and on all sides invironed by the enemie, (who helped their victory by the seeming appearances of more Colours) those who saved themselves not by flight, were either slaine or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoners, amongst which Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> Count Palatine of <hi>Rhene,</hi> and br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This victory, though it were not of much moment, as some would have it to be, for by this the nests were not destroyed from whence new troubles were to be expected, and it would rather serve for a further incitement to the King of great <hi>Brittan,</hi> to proceed against the <hi>Austrians</hi>; yet howsoever who shall consider the business, and knows what advantage the States of the <hi>Roman Catholikes</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the securing of those Forts, &amp; the reputation of their arms, will finde it to be greater then it appeared to be. For besides the freeing of the <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Provinces from the feare they stood in of those forces, great was the consequence of the recovery of those places, which whilst possest by the <hi>Protestants,</hi> kept the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Inhabitants in continuall agitation, and made the widow of the late <hi>Landsgrave</hi> strong in her adherence to the <hi>Sweedish</hi> party.

The King of <hi>Poland</hi> was likewise hereat well pleased; for his brother Prince <hi>Casamire</hi> being some moneths before taken prisoner by the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Bucary</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Provence,</hi> as he was going in a Galley from <hi>Genoa</hi> to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> about some business, and from thence carried to the <hi>Boys</hi> St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> he thought this Count Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine would be a fitting change for the said Prince <hi>Casamire.

            <p>To thwart the succesfull proceedings in these parts, Duke <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> who gallantly surrounded <hi>Brisacke,</hi> did in part recover what those of his faction had lost in the Prince Electors business; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving advertisement how that 7. <hi>Imperiall</hi> Regiments led on by <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Loreine, Bossompier,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> being come from <hi>Burgondy,</hi> were upon their march towards <hi>Tan,</hi> that they might fall down from thence and joyne with the other <hi>Austrians</hi> on this side the <hi>Rhene,</hi> &amp; so joyntly endeavour that succour which <hi>Ghetz</hi> failed in; he presently parted from his Camp before <hi>Brisack</hi> with 6000. commanded men, six pieces of Cannon, and 4.

did <hi>Weymar, Mercyes</hi> horse was killed under him, &amp; in his retreat the courage of the <hi>Caesarians</hi> seemed also somewhat to give backe; <hi>Weymar</hi> pursued them closely, and though he had received a slight hurt, for which his men desired him to withdraw, he by no means would give backe, but growing more incensed by the sight of his own blood, he charged upon the Front of the enemies horse, and made them turn back, and then pursuing them behind, did great execution upon them. Greater peradventure would the mischief have been, had not a great battaglion of foot commanded by <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sompiere,</hi> and placed in a convenient place, stayed the <hi>Sweedes</hi> in their pursuit by hailing down musquet shot amongst them; for it behoving <hi>Weymar</hi> to hault here, lest he might be engaged in some dangerous encounter, the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> had time to retreat, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling together againe under the shelter of those musquetiers, to fight vigorously: but this availed them but a little; For Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Rose</hi> advancing with the rest of the horse and 1500 choise foot, whilst the <hi>Imperiall</hi> foot and the <hi>Sweeds</hi> foot were here figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>Weymar</hi> with his horse charged furiously upon the Duke of <hi>Lorreyns</hi> Squadrons, and routed them, putting many of them to the sword, so as the <hi>Imperiall</hi> foot being invironed on all sides, they were all either slain or taken prisoners, save some few of the reer who saved themselves by flight; they lost their baggage, their Cannon, <hi>Bossompier</hi> and some other Commanders of account, and about 1500. souldiers. To second this happy encounter, <hi>Smitbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hearing thereof, who commanded the Camp on the other side of the <hi>Rhene</hi> before <hi>Brisacke,</hi> he valiantly assaulted the little Fort before the bridg, and after a long dispute took it by storm. So as the Town being besieged on all sides, and brought to great streits, and not being to be relieved on any side, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ministers of State were earnestly desired from those of <hi>Caesars</hi> Court to send suddainly a flying squadron of betweene sixe and 8000. souldiers from the State of <hi>Millan</hi> into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> thereby to relieve this place wherein their common interests were so much concerned: but these their entreaties could not prevaile with the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; For though they were very much grieved that <hi>Brisacke</hi> should be lost, they more valued the State of <hi>Millan</hi> then all <hi>Alsatia</hi>; neither did they think it fitting to remove in a season so near winter; For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that they were likely to lose many men in their march by hardnesse, and by flight (for the <hi>Italians</hi> being made wary by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer examples, do not willingly pass the mountains) they greatly feared to loose that reputation which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do with such punctuality cherish, if the businesse should not succeed according to their desires, as they much doubted it would not.

And because <hi>Asti</hi> was nearest them, and not hard to be taken, by reason of the good intelligence which they held therein they applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereunto. The Army being therefore removed from where it was on the Sixteenth of <hi>November,</hi> and assigned over unto the Cardinall, great was the expectation which was had thereof. But the Embassadour of <hi>Savoy</hi> who was resident at <hi>Rome</hi> gessing by the Cardinales hasty departure, that he had some secret designe upon <hi>Piemont,</hi> gave speedy advertisment thereof unto the <hi>Dutchesse</hi>; And the <hi>French</hi> being no lesse vigilent, so great was the suspition caused thereby in the <hi>Dutchesse,</hi> and her faithfull servants, as not knowing whom to trust, nor what to promise unto herselfe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of mustering the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Turin</hi> she brought in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1000. <hi>French-foote,</hi> and securing thereby the Citty and her owne person, she began to provide against the secret and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous machinations of her officers. And because the <hi>Spanish</hi> forces which were brought to the territories of <hi>Allessandria,</hi> though their outward appearance was to winter in those parts, made those Frontiers feare they had some other end, by order from the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>de Vallette,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Candalle</hi> made many companyes of <hi>French</hi> advance to those confines; and having an eye to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>Dutchesse</hi> of <hi>Mantoa's</hi> officers, he dismist the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis

Vallis,</hi> and <hi>Count Gabionetto,</hi> who was president of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestracy, from <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and made it be knowne by publique Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that under paine of incurring his Kings indignation, none should dare to hould any practice or intelligences with the <hi>Marquis Alfonso Guerriere,</hi> Governour of the Port of <hi>Mantoa,</hi> it being thought that by his meanes all the affaires of such like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence was continued. The guarrison of <hi>Asty</hi> was strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all things provided for that might prove harmefull; they likewise sent back for some men, who were already on their way to assist <hi>Weymar,</hi> before <hi>Brisack.</hi> And the <hi>Dutchesse</hi> beleiving more and more that she was betrayed, imprisoned many of her subjects in <hi>Turin</hi>; amongst which, Colonell <hi>Renso,</hi> the Secretary <hi>Clareois</hi> the Cardinalls favorit, <hi>Don Silvio</hi> the Governour of <hi>Carmagneola, Valerio Rossio,</hi> and every other body of whom there was the least shaddow of suspition, that they should be adheerers unto, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon her Brother in Law. She moreover brought into the Cittadell a brigade of <hi>French,</hi> called the <hi>Dutchesse</hi> Regiment; and suspecting the Governours loyalty, she suddainly removed him from thence, and in his stead gave the custody of the Cittadell to the <hi>Marquis</hi> of St. <hi>Iermane,</hi> whereupon the Cardinall, finding his plot discovered, seeming as if he had no such intention, went to <hi>Nizza della Paglia</hi> and within a few dayes after came from thence to <hi>Certosa di Pavia,</hi> that he might speake with <hi>Melo,</hi> with whom after many consultations it was agreed upon, that Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> should in all hast be sent from <hi>Flanders</hi>; because he being trained up in Warre, well liked of by the people of <hi>Piemont,</hi> val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued and feared by the Nobility, and being well reputed of in Warre, might peradventure doe more by his owne experience, and assist more by his credit then the Cardinall. For those who thought not the Cardinall able to defend them with the sword; would peradventure have liked well enough of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was thought capable of taking upon him the weight of a <hi>Principality</hi> and to governe it by Armes.</p>
            <p>By reason of <hi>Ghets</hi> his aforesaid defeate, the <hi>Austrean</hi> affaires were not onely frown'd on by fortune in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> but (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported more) they ran to ruin by reason of the contention &amp; emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the cheefe Commanders, for such as were enemyes to <hi>Ghets,</hi> and rejoyced at his restraint, laid all the blame of what had happened amisse upon him, and his friends, and such as would patiently give eare to sound reasons were grieved at, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained upon the actions of his evill wishers; yet did they this but covertly and under hand, since there are but few that will pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely take upon them the defence of such faults, as have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther protector but God and truth. So as the actions of <hi>Ghets</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publiquely declaimed against by some, and other some privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insinuating into the mindes of many their evill opinions of his accusers, the more his enemies did outwardly expresse the rancor against him, the more did they inwardly burne with anger that did defend him, whereupon the desire of doing well and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55221:239"/>
being supprest, their own strength decreased, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies power increased, the time was wholly spent in councells, in hopes, and in laying of badly sustained foundations; for <hi>Brisack,</hi> languishing every day more then other, was now brought to her last will and Testament. Duke <hi>Savell</hi> notwithstanding, upon these great emergencyes, seemed, though with small hopes of any good effects, willing to extrinsicate his desire in a business which so much conceirned his <hi>Prince.</hi> He therefore marched towards <hi>Burgondy</hi> to joyne with some of the Duke of <hi>Loreynes</hi> troopes, that yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that <hi>Province,</hi> and then joyntly with the remainder of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Army, to indeavour the recovery of that reputation, which if it were not altogether lost, was little better. But whilest he indeavoured to execute his intention with 1000. horse and 1500 foote, <hi>Monseiur de Ficchiers,</hi> being advertised thereof who with part of the <hi>French</hi> army kept upon the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>Loreyne</hi> which lay towards <hi>Germany,</hi> that he might be ready to march wheither occasion should require, went forthwith to encounter <hi>Savell</hi>; &amp; as fortune doth not so easily turne to favour those whom shee hath once turned her back upon, when they were come to <hi>Blowes,</hi> the Imperialists being on all sides invironed by the <hi>French,</hi> who were many more in number then they, <hi>Savell</hi> with much adoe saved him selfe and his horse, leaving the Foote to the discretion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, who tooke many of them prisoners, and got about 80. Carriages of Victualls and Baggadge; which when <hi>Reynock</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Brisack</hi> understood, knowing that his last hopes were vanisht away in smoake, and seeing it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the <hi>Fates</hi> that that place should be lost, which was brought to its last gaspe, and there being neither force nor industy that can fight against hunger, he condiscended to yeild the Towne up to <hi>Weymar,</hi> and to receive those honourable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were offered him, he therefore on the eighteenth of <hi>December</hi> marched out with Banners flying, with Armes and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadg, and other such accustomed ceremonyes. Thus were the <hi>Austerians</hi> deprived of this so important a place, to the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Court; and very great resentment of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who having long before foreseene the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the ruine that was likely to ensue had given exact in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation thereof to the Emperour and his Ministers of state, and thought the Emperours officers had failed much in their duty, in taking no greater care for the preservation of a place which was the very soule of all those Provinces; for they might easily have victualled and munitioned it for a longer time. And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> leaving sufficient forces for their Warre in <hi>Itally</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> might easily have succord it, and have kept afflicted <hi>Germany</hi> from those new wounds, which that they might heale their owne, they suffered her without compassion to receive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bavaria</hi> was moreover greived at this losse, because it being the key of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> a <hi>Province</hi> which serves for an out Bull-worke to his states, more perticularly to the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> his Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55221:239"/>
got in thither, would keep his dominions in perpetuall feare and agitation. And though some saw that this place being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine free in <hi>Weymars</hi> possession it might easily hereafter be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made to have no dependency upon <hi>France,</hi> or else returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the <hi>Austreans</hi> hands either by composition or strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, yet the feare least before this should happen, the <hi>French</hi> might get footing there, which when they should have done, they would not so easily be driven out, was a thing infinitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in reason of State. By how much therefore the <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> were hereat afflicted the <hi>French</hi> were as much pleased, and <hi>Weymar,</hi> who blowne up with glory, in having wonne a place of such importance, before the face of so many forces conspired against him, 'twas feared he might inlarge his thoughts, and afflict the remainder of those states, noe lesse then the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had done, whereof he was debar'd by his suddaine death, as in its proper place shall be said. <hi>Weymar</hi> having placed a Guarrison in this Towne, and all things necessary or requisite for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof he left Collonell <hi>Erlack</hi> for the Governour thereof, a <hi>Swise</hi> by nation; and marched with his Army into <hi>Burgondy,</hi> that he might winter there, and be at the King of <hi>France</hi> his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall, whereat his first entrance he tooke many places, amongst the rest the Castle of <hi>Ioux</hi>; and Collonell <hi>Rosa</hi> staied to take in <hi>Tan</hi> that he might deprive the Enemy of that place of retreate; and the better secure the passage from <hi>Burgondy</hi> into <hi>Flanders.</hi> Passing forwards from <hi>Ioux, Weymar</hi> made himselfe Master of <hi>Ponterlin,</hi> which was no strong place, of <hi>Nosaret</hi> another weake place towards the River <hi>Daime</hi>; and being tould that some of the Enemyes troopes were quartered about <hi>Ornans,</hi> a Towne upon the River <hi>Lonne,</hi> he over run all those neighbouring Townes, but to little purpose, for upon the newes of his coming the <hi>Burgonians</hi> had forsaken them, and were got into <hi>Bisansonne.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Banniers</hi> forces being now increased by the accesse of the people which the <hi>Swedish</hi> Ministers of State sent him in from all sides, and <hi>Gallasse</hi> on the contray, being inforced to retreate through the want of victualls, and of money, and by reason of his Armies being much diminished by sufferings, and by the plague, did without any manner of feare keep the feilds in those parts, where finding he was dreaded, and knowing the power of daring, when the adversary gives back, he advanced to make further acheevements, and continued firme in his opinion, of bringing all the Warre upon the Enemyes Country, and of easing those Provinces which being quartered upon now by the one, now by the other side, the people which yet remained therein: were brought into great want<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He therefore rose from his winter quarters in the one, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Marca,</hi> and in <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and having mustered his Army which he found to be about 26000. fightingmen, he in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der marched towards <hi>Turingia,</hi> a bould undertaking, but rendred feasible, by reason, of the confusion and paucety of the <hi>Imperiall</hi> forces in those parts. The newes whereof coming to <hi>Dresden</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55221:240"/>
to <hi>Prage,</hi> and this neighbour-hood being very prejudiciall to that Duke, and to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> convenient provisions were earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demanded of the Emperour, who no lesse fearing these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, held daily Councels touching the present Emergencies. Orders were sent to <hi>Azfelt,</hi> who was yet about <hi>Westfalia,</hi> having an eye to the proceedings of <hi>King,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Elector,</hi> who endeavoured all they might to rally their Forces; to march with part of his souldiers towards <hi>Fulda,</hi> and to discover what the <hi>Sweeds</hi> intentions were. The people who were quartered in the Bishopprick of <hi>Munster,</hi> and others in those Provinces were sent towards the <hi>Wesser,</hi> that they might come to <hi>Gallasse</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who being indisposed in body, but much more in minde, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Azfelts</hi> prosperous fortune, who began publiquely to say hee would no longer be subordinate or subservient to him, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to withdraw himselfe to a private life. At which the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Councell being not a little troubled, he was comforted with good words, and had leave given him to tend the recovery of his health, but not to quit his charge; obliging him as soone as hee should be recovered to reassume the employment, which in his absence was committed to Colonell <hi>Slich.</hi> But <hi>Gallasse</hi> thinking that these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances proceeded not from the heart, because he saw that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the change of Officers, the estimation was also chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which was formerly put upon his merit and quality; but that it did proceed from simulation, where-withall the spots of the mind are covered, and that <hi>Azfelt</hi> was desirous to enter into his place, and thereunto perswaded by the backing of such as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him, he continued his former desires, and obtained leave to stay in <hi>Bohemia</hi> til he should have perfectly recovered his health, in which interim, time might peradventure teach him to thinke upon some other course. <hi>Marcini</hi> was likewise commanded to joyn with the Duke of <hi>Saxons</hi> men, and that afterwards joyning with <hi>Salis</hi> the Generall of the Artillery, who was about <hi>Sala</hi> with some 6000. souldiers, they should unanimously oppose the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies proceedings on this side, whilst <hi>Azfelt</hi> molested them on the other side. And the Emperour that he might be neerer them, to give them fitting orders, resolved to remove his Court to <hi>Prague.</hi> The Regiments of Colonell <hi>Cheinitz</hi> and Colonell <hi>Posen,</hi> both of them the Duke of <hi>Saxons</hi> subjects, were brought into <hi>Lypsia</hi>; and for what remained, nothing was left undone which was thought convenient to the wisedome of Councells; some moneyes were sent to <hi>Slich,</hi> who was already come into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> wherewithall to satisfie the souldiers and appease the tumults which were made for want of pay, and the usuall contribution of the countrey which was already wholly desolated. But as provisions which are made in hast, and in sight of the enemie, use to be but of little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailement, for the feare they have of no good successe, and the confusion occasioned by hast, doth exceedingly impede that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which otherwise is had when men are in a readinesse to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves with sufficient strength, so these hasty prepatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55221:240"/>
serving but to imbase mens minds, &amp; make the souldier fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, did little good. For <hi>Bannier</hi> (whilst these spent their time in advising) losing no time, tooke <hi>Torgaw, Newenburg</hi> upon the <hi>Sala,</hi> and other places belonging to the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>; and without any opposition, was already Master of the field, keeping about <hi>Lipsicke,</hi> and the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to the great astonishment of those people, many whereof not thinking themselves safe in <hi>Prague</hi> it selfe, fled with the best of their moveables into Townes towards the <hi>Danube.</hi> And their apprehensions were so much the greater, in that <hi>Salis</hi> the <hi>Austrians</hi> Serjeant-Major Generall, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to beate backe <hi>Bannier,</hi> and hinder him from advancing further, went to the parts about <hi>Elchenitz</hi> to relieve <hi>Zucka</hi> which was besieged by the enemie, where he met with some <hi>Sweeds</hi> who scoured those countreyes, and who charged him so eagerly, as that his fore-runners turning backe at the very first, and the rest apprehending feare by their flight, <hi>Salis</hi> had much adoe to save himselfe and some few of his horse by getting into <hi>Egra,</hi> having lost about 500. of his men, 10. Standards, &amp; 14. Ensignes, the newes whereof comming to <hi>Zucka,</hi> they immediately surrendred the Towne on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> as likewise did <hi>Chimenits,</hi> which was besieged the same time</p>
            <p>Whilst the <hi>Sweeds</hi> prospered daily more and more in <hi>Germany</hi> against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whilst <hi>Weymar</hi> tooke in such places in <hi>Burgon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> as being weakly scituated and walled, could not withstand his fierce assaults; and whilst preparations for War were daily made upon the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy.</hi> Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> went post from <hi>Flanders</hi> and came to <hi>Trent,</hi> from whence sending speedy adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to <hi>Milan,</hi> and to his Brother the Cardinall, <hi>Don Iohn d'Artagia,</hi> Captaine of the Guard, was forth-with sent by <hi>Leganes</hi> to meete him upon the Confines. The Cardinall came to <hi>Lodi,</hi> and sent the Counts of <hi>Mossano</hi> and <hi>Masserati</hi> to welcome him, &amp; when he came on the tenth of <hi>March</hi> to <hi>Vaniero, Leganes, Don Martin d'Aragona, Don Antonio di Sermiento,</hi> the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and an infinite number of Cavalliers and Tituladoes came to meete him. Where having stayed some sixe hours, and agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way how he might enter into <hi>Piemont,</hi> they returned the same night to <hi>Meltsi,</hi> a place belonging to Cardinall <hi>Triuulsio,</hi> and the next morning to <hi>Millan,</hi> strict orders being afterwards given to the Governour of <hi>Alessandria,</hi> and to those of <hi>Brem,</hi> and <hi>Vercel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> that they might make greater provision of Hay and corne for horses in those parts. <hi>Don Martin d' Aragona</hi> was sent towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessandria,</hi> with orders to assemble together all the souldiery, and to be ready to put in effect such resolutions as should be agreed upon. And because Princes never use to let slip any negotiation, when the keeping of them on foote is not prejudiciall to them, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> sent the Baron <hi>Palavesine,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle</hi> to his Sister in Law the Dutchesse <hi>Dowager,</hi> to acquaint her with his pretences; who returning from their fruitlesse journey, informed his Highnesse, how that great were the cummotions in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55221:241"/>
               <hi>Turin,</hi> and throughout all <hi>Piemont,</hi> occasioned by his comming, and by his pretences, whereupon he tooke better heart, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hoped more in their designes. For the Inhabitants of <hi>Piemont,</hi> who pretended that all their misfortunes arose from the <hi>French,</hi> and who would be better pleased with the government of their owne naturall Princes, then in making tryall of the interest they had of the <hi>French,</hi> or of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hostility, greatly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red though to their own losse, to be quit of that feare which was insupportable to them. Therefore after many consultations they put on such resolutions as were thought convenient to effect their designes; and Commission was sent to <hi>Aragon,</hi> who had already gathered together about 7000. Foot, and 1500. horse in the parts of <hi>Alessandria,</hi> that he should goe to the <hi>Lange</hi> to take in <hi>Cingio,</hi> a place not contemptible, and wherein was a <hi>French</hi> Garrison; And it was ordered that Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> should goe to <hi>Novar,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Vercelles</hi>; And that the Cardinall should goe towards <hi>Astigiano,</hi> with some other Forces, to see whether he could get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Citie or no; for the <hi>French-men</hi> going into the <hi>Lange</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the proceedings of <hi>Don Martin,</hi> Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> might easily effect what was agreed upon amongst them.
<q>And therefore after <hi>Leganes</hi> was come on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> to <hi>Margiano,</hi> where both the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> were expecting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> resolution to their desires; which were that they might enter <hi>Piemont</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, but as in their owne right, and here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine consultations being had of what course was best to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; the Princes againe demanded that they might be permitted to enter <hi>Piemont</hi> with the <hi>Spanish</hi> forces, as lent unto them by the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and not otherwise, for that the Subjects being hereby encouraged, would be the more willingly brought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them, when they should see their Princes enter in their owne names, and the Nobility would have better grounded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to side with them, since their reason for so doing would appeare legitimate, it being to keepe that State from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of strangers. They further shewed, that to have the <hi>Spaniards</hi> enter into lieu of the <hi>French,</hi> was not the right way to win the affections of the Subjects, and to dispose of them as they desired; for when they should see that on one side or other, They were to commit Treason against their Prince by receiving in of Strangers, and submitting themselves unto them, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being much more hatefull to the Inhabitants of <hi>Piemont</hi> then are the <hi>French,</hi> they would be more wary in falling upon any such resolution.</q>
But though these reasons were very strong, yet did they not prevaile with <hi>Leganes</hi>; for he pretending hee could not alter his directions he had received from <hi>Spaine,</hi> declared, he intended not to make War for any others then for his King, nor that he had any other directions then to prosecute the <hi>French,</hi> and those who should assist them; hee said hee would acquaint the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> with their desires, and endeavour that they might be satisfied therein. But all this was an outward shew, for it was

plainely seene the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not engage themselves in any thing whereout they could reape no profit. For they considered that when the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> should by meanes of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces have possest themselves of the strong holds of <hi>Piemont,</hi> or by some other way come to an accord with the Dutchesse, or by the young Dukes death, the Cardinall should become Duke there was no doubt, but when any of these should happen, they would so behave themselves, as that neither the <hi>Spaniards</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> should be suffered to nesle themselves there in such sort as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come arbitrators of their wil. Moreover since it complied not with the Duke of <hi>Savoyes</hi> interest, that <hi>Montferrat</hi> should fall into the hands of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> 'twas apparant that the business of <hi>Cassalle</hi> would either openly or under-hand be impeeded, nor would they suffer that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should keep in <hi>Vercelles</hi> nor in the other Towns of that State. So as it seemed more probable if it should so fall out, that they would joyne with the <hi>French,</hi> to recover what they had lost to better their condition by some new atchievement; and to keep the <hi>Spaniards</hi> within their own limits, then obliege themselves to depend upon them and upon their pleasure. And though there were some that said these things would not easily happen, since Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> his Wife and Children were in <hi>Spaine</hi> as Hostages of his Loyalty, and greater then which none can be given, yet were these reasons rejected by those that knew that the Dukedome fell not upon Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> but upon the Cardinall. The Spanyards therefore who maturely considered all these particulars, persisted in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of not entering into <hi>Piemont</hi> in any other manner then hath beene said; For when their Garrisons should be in the Dukes Forts, the Conquest would be the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards,</hi> and keeping themselves therein, the businesse of <hi>Cassalle</hi> would be the more easie; and the <hi>French</hi> fore-going <hi>Italy,</hi> would at the same time easily be driven out of <hi>Piemont,</hi> which otherwise would hardly be effected. And if <hi>Piemont</hi> should fall into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that the <hi>French</hi> should be shut up on the other side the mountains, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having no further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to feare the ficklenesse of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> there is no doubt but that being secured from the incursions of the <hi>French,</hi> they would by their armies endeavour to possess themselves of the rest of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> These were the hidden ends and the ambitious desires of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; though these endeavours were by some thought to be ill undertaken, as likely to prove harmfull to the undertaker; For the bundle they grasped at was too great, and the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> growing hereat jealous, and the <hi>French</hi> better advised, the one and the other of them would put on such resolves, as yet they kept secret within their owne breasts; Yet the <hi>Spaniards</hi> enamoured of their owne vast hopes herein, fixed their mindes here, and used all the art they could how to erect so great a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. 'Twas therefore knowne the <hi>Savoy</hi> Princes were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly pleased with these proceedings, who clearely saw the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55221:242"/>
               <hi>Spaniards</hi> ruinous ends; Notwithstanding, since what is once fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med abroad, doth oft times draw after it the repugnant will, and the desire of glory blinding the wisdome of the intellect, these Princes not being able to disingage themselves without failing in their enterprize, covering the bitternesse of their soule with the sweete of simulation, they seemed outwardly as if they would wholly depend upon the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and disposed themselves to follow their advice, till they should have compast that, which once had, they would afterwards appear in such colours as should make most for their purpose. And therefore having at the same time more clearely learned what good will the people of <hi>Piemont</hi> bore them, and the forwardnesse of those that sided with them by the arrivall of <hi>Il Patremoniale Molletta</hi> who was receiver of the Rents of <hi>Piemont</hi> which belonged to these Princes.

               <hi>Don Martin d' Aragona</hi> being at this time encamped before <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,</hi> and having to facilitate the businesse, shut up all the passes of those mountaines, by which reliefe might be brought, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it no lesse requisite to take the Towne and Castle of <hi>Salicetto,</hi> not farre distant from the said <hi>Cingio,</hi> wherein there was a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of about 300. <hi>French,</hi> he sent <hi>Don Lewis de Lancastro,</hi> with some troops to make himself Master thereof.

Amongst other good things that were observable in him, he was very sincere and faithful in all his words and actions, whereupon if any one at any time should seeme not much to rely, or to confide in, he was wont to say believe it, and feare not because I am a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> I promise it thee as a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallier. <hi>Don Lewis</hi> notwithstanding not abasht for this misfortune but rather setting more hotly upon <hi>Salicetta,</hi> hee enforced it to surrender before the succour came. So as all the Forces being brought before CINGIO, much diligence was used in the opugning of that place, and the more, for that <hi>Don Antonio

            <p>This was cause of much content to <hi>Leganes,</hi> for the <hi>Lange</hi> being better secured hereby, and consequently the passage from <hi>Finalle</hi> to the State of <hi>Millan,</hi> made more commodious, hee considered he might the better turne his Forces else-where. <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini</hi> being left Governour here, those forces marched towards <hi>Montferrat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Leganes</hi> understanding that the <hi>French</hi> were marched towards <hi>Cingio,</hi> the Prince came from <hi>Pavia,</hi> where hee had finished his purgation, and arrived at <hi>Vercelles</hi> where <hi>Leganes</hi> was: and making use of the intelligence which hee held with the Governour of <hi>Chinas,</hi> a place neere the <hi>Poe</hi> betweene <hi>Cressentine</hi> and <hi>Turin,</hi> hee on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> came by breake of day with two thousand horse before the gates of the Towne, and without effusion of blood made himselfe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thereof; For the Governour who held correspondedcy with him, not endeavouring any defence, after the playing of one Petar, suffered the Prince his men freely to enter.</p>
            <p>By this meanes the way being opened into the heart of <hi>Piemont,</hi> the Cardinal was presently sent for thither by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that by doing so, they might honest their no ways gratefull intentions towards those people, who seeing their Forts assigned over into the hands of their owne naturall Princes, would the easilier be perswaded to side with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though the Garrison and Governour which was put thereinto being <hi>Spanish,</hi> it might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede rather be said that the Cardinall had put himselfe into the hands of the Towne, then that the Towne was put into his hands.</p>

came before <hi>Aglie,</hi> a Towne belonging to a Count of the same name, which standing out, he sacked it. From thence he marched with his horse within sight of <hi>Turim,</hi> hoping through intelligence which he held with some of the Towne to doe the deed; but hee found hee was deceived by reason of the strict guard made by the <hi>French,</hi> and the Dutchesse her people; so as after having given the Governour to understand that if hee would receive him in, hee should not only purchase his favour, but better his own condition much, and finding that neither promises nor threats would work upon his loyalty, he retreated lest he might give upon the <hi>French,</hi> who prepared to light upon him at unawares. Passing from thence to <hi>Hivenea,</hi> a City placed upon <hi>Doria Bautia,</hi> he took it by storme, and tooke afterwards the Towne and Castle of <hi>Bard,</hi> which is the key of the valley of <hi>Osta,</hi> by which he likewise reduced the City of <hi>Osta,</hi> and all that valley, the people comming in unto his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The <hi>French</hi> were much terrified thereat. For they could not at the same time march forth against their enemies, and keep an eye upon their friends fidelity.
<q>The taking of this valley was thought to be of great consequence; for besides the getting from thence a considerable strength of men, the possession of this passe made much for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for thereby they might the more easily passe into <hi>Burgondy.

what was theirs, and drive out the <hi>French,</hi> who were the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of that State, to ruine together with themselves the whole State, and their faithfull Subjects, and assubject themselves to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to whose proceeding the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> alwayes had an eye. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> chiefe ends being that they might get into the best Forts of <hi>Piemont,</hi> &amp; particularly into such as might help them to get <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which they so thirsted after, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in some sort to satisfie the Princes in their desires, &amp; with specious words and faire promises, he did all that might seeme outwardly faire; but at the same time he had an eye to his chiefe aime, which was to streighten <hi>Cassall</hi> by taking <hi>Trino</hi> and other neighbouring places.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The meeting being dissolved, the Cardinall went to stay at <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verea,</hi> to keep those people in their fidelity, and to raise some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in those parts; Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> came before <hi>Sigliano,</hi> in the way to <hi>Cresentino; Leganes</hi> sent <hi>Don Iohn de Garray</hi> against the army, which after the taking of <hi>Cingio</hi> kept thereabouts, wherefore changing his first intention, which was to come on the other side above <hi>Maudoni,</hi> to assaile <hi>Turin,</hi> he was to march by the way of <hi>Aich, Nizza,</hi> and <hi>Annone,</hi> and crossing the <hi>Astigian,</hi> to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Verva.</hi> Then joyning with Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Sigliano,</hi> they came before <hi>Verna</hi> on the ninth of <hi>April,</hi> and in a few hours tooke the Towne by assault, and the Castle wanting necessary defence yeilded; the next day they also tooke <hi>Crescentino,</hi> both of them Townes neere the <hi>Poe,</hi> the one on this side the River, the other on the other, places fit to hinder what was wont to be carried by water to <hi>Trino</hi> and <hi>Cassall.</hi> And because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew of what importancy <hi>Hiveria</hi> was, a place very fitting to keepe the command of that Country which lies between <hi>Doira Bautia,</hi> and <hi>Sesia</hi> above <hi>Canavese,</hi> they resolved to fortifie it round about with perfect Fortifications. So as sending <hi>Fra. Ferrante Bolognino</hi> with other souldiers to strengthen the Garrison, and Pioners to perfect the Works, they fell very busily to it.</p>
            <p>In this revolution of affares, the Cardinall of <hi>Vallette,</hi> not daring to march into the feilds, for feare of the insurrection of the people, thought good to come to <hi>Turin,</hi> where there was greater suspition of meeting with some treachery, And to quarter his army about that City till such time as the Duke of <hi>Longeville,</hi> who was already parted from <hi>France,</hi> to assist the forces of <hi>Italy,</hi> with the recrewtes promised by the King, were come to the edge of <hi>Piemont,</hi> where they would then resolve upon what might make most for the Kings service, and increasing in the <hi>Dutchesse</hi> her suspition of the inhabitance of <hi>Turin,</hi> he made their armes be taken from them, the guardes be dubled, and dilligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry to be made into the actions, gestures and speeches of such as were suspected of treachery. But Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> being comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by those who could bring him into <hi>Turin,</hi> that he might loose no time in appearing before the Towne, marched thetherward with <hi>Leganes</hi> and the whole army; and haulting at <hi>Gruliasco,</hi> two
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55221:244"/>
miles from <hi>Turin,</hi> hee there attended the houre to perfect his worke, and being advertised by a Princes, a sister of his, who was a <hi>Nun,</hi> that such a <hi>Fryer</hi> was gon towards him, with intention to kill him, the <hi>Fryer</hi> coming soone after to present him with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were it true that he had any such intention, or were it his misfortune, to come in such a nick of time as did correspond with the suspition had of him, he was arrested and sent to his Brother the Cardinall at <hi>Hiverea,</hi> to the intent the truth might be there found out, but agreeing with the keeper who had him in custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as he was upon the way, he and his Keeper made an escape.</p>
            <p>Parting from <hi>Gruliasco,</hi> on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Aprill</hi> he drew neere to <hi>Turin,</hi> where meeting with the <hi>French</hi> horse, a skirmish happened betweene the Dragoones, and <hi>Dutch</hi> of the <hi>Spanish</hi> army, and some of the <hi>French</hi> troopes, who were put to the worst, and were forced to retreate with the losse of about twenty Mules loaded with marchandise which they were convoying. The <hi>Dutchesse</hi> having afterwards sent <hi>Commissary Monte</hi> with a good strength of horse and foote, to reinforce her men, and <hi>Leganes</hi> having sent some Companyes of <hi>Bolognini</hi> and <hi>Sottellos</hi> Brigades to meet with them, the skirmish began a fresh againe, in such sort as the <hi>Marquis Villa</hi> comming in on the <hi>French</hi> side, and <hi>Don Carlo della Gatta,</hi> with all the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> horse on the <hi>Spanish,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being many more in number then were the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> skirmishing in an admirable good order, got under the shelter of the Cannon of the Cittadell, with the losse of some Souldiers, and of the Count <hi>De Giu</hi> a Frenchman.</p>
            <p>Incurraged by this retreate, and by the hopes of intelligence, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> suddainly advanced to set upon the borough of <hi>Poe</hi> neere <hi>Turrin</hi> and intrenched 3000. foote there, hoping by meanes of their partakers to enter the towne that night, but they failed in their intent; for the Cardinall of <hi>Vallette</hi> being vigilent every where, rendred all the indeavours of the treacherous vaine, and possessing himselfe of the Capuchians scituation, and fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe there he levelled his Cannon against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> quarters which were commanded on this side, So as finding the place too hot for them, they after a few dayes retreated, and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their army; the one part thereof went with Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> to <hi>Villa nova d'Asti</hi> which he presently stormed and pillaged, and <hi>Leganes</hi> went with the other parte to before <hi>Moncaluo,</hi> and after having taken the Towne, and left 2000. foote there to reduce the Castle, he joyned againe with the Prince, and with one accord on the thirtieth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> they came with a great force before <hi>Asti,</hi> and the next day without any gainesaying entred the City, which the Commendator <hi>Balbiani</hi> who was Governour thereof, thinking he would not keep it, he withdrew himselfe to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadell, where he thought to defend himselfe better. But <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagnivola</hi> being taken by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> upon the which the <hi>French</hi> had built a litle fort, the Castle was thereby commanded,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55221:244"/>
so as wanting succour and ammunition yeilded upon treaty, way being made hereby to further acheevements, the Cardinall of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was at <hi>Hiverea</hi> removed his Court hither, as well to keep the subjects in their logality, and faithfulnesse to him, as to raise men who might have no dependance either upon <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> which when he should have done, he was sure he should be willingly received into many Townes, where they should be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to be guarisonised by people put into them by their owne Princes, and not by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> to which some would not submit, <hi>Bolognini</hi> who parting from <hi>Hiveria</hi> was commanded to take in the Castle of <hi>Pontestura,</hi> had likewise no worse successe, for being reduced to great extreamity it compounded, and the <hi>French</hi> marched out; and <hi>Trino</hi> being by this Castle divided from <hi>Cassall,</hi> they might easily effect their desires upon that place. A convenient Garrison being afterwards left in <hi>Cassall</hi> under the command of Marquess <hi>Pietro, Antonio Lenati,</hi> and the Garrisons of <hi>Salicetto, Montaldo, Aliano,</hi> and other places being by reason of this place superfluous, the whole Army came before <hi>Moncalvo,</hi> and streightly besieging the Castle which did valiantly defend it selfe, by meanes of a myne which blew up one of the great towers thereof, he forced it to yeild to the great displeasure of the <hi>French</hi>; for this place being in the very hart of <hi>Montferrat, Cassall</hi> was thereby the more streightned. The Cardinall of <hi>Vallette</hi> fearing therefore lest under the happy Augure of these victories, they might likewise bethink themselves of taking <hi>Cassall,</hi> he conveyed in thither divers sacks of salt, a thing which the Inhabitants ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much wanted, and hee added 400. horse, and 800. Foote of the <hi>Montferrians</hi> to the Garrison thereof. And his Brother the Duke of <hi>Candalle</hi> being not long before dead of a Feaver, who commanded there in Chiefe. Hee by orders from the King made <hi>Monseiur de Toures</hi> Governour thereof, hee who whilst <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantoa</hi> lived, was Generall to his Highnesse in <hi>Mantoa.</hi> By this time the actions of the Cardinall of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were generally murmured at, for that being exasperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the State of their innocent Nephew, they made it the scean of so bitter and unhappy a warre, and because the Nobility and common people being divided, some did secretly adhere unto the Princes, and did also manifest their resolutions, some kept con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the Dutchesse, thinking it absolute fellony to forsake her who was their Dukes Governesse, and represented his person; so all parts were full of horror and confusion; some fearing to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by the Dutchesse and the <hi>French,</hi> others being frightned at the Princes threats backt by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               <q>And the Princes pretending to have law on their side in their laying claime to what could not be denyed them; and being therein much more confirmed by a late Declaration made by the Emperor wherin he declared the late Dukes last will and Testament as <hi>null</hi> &amp; invalid, and the pretences of the two just Princes, they printed a <hi>Manifesto</hi> in <hi>Asti,</hi> conteyning all the reasons why they were forced to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55221:245"/>
by force of arms to get the Guardian-ship of the Duke their Nephew, answerable to the Lawes of the State, and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in afterwards signifie how that whatsoever the Dutchesse had done as Governesse to her Sonne was invalid, as in particular the League she had made with her Brother the King of <hi>France.</hi> And they ordained upon paine of life, and the danger of incurring high Treason, that no Subject whatsoever should for the time to come take part with the Dutchesse nor obey her. They likewise declared the orders of the <hi>Annuntiata,</hi> and of the Crosse of Saint <hi>Maurice,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> conferr'd by the Dutchesse upon divers Cavalliers to be <hi>null</hi> and of no validity unlesse they should come at the same time to have those orders confirmed by them; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that the Governours of all Towns should acknowledge them for their superiours, and come and receive the confirmation of their governments from them; otherwise if they should remaine in their obedience to the Dutchesse, they should be understood as guilty of High Treason, forfeite their Honours and their Estates.</q>

            <p>The <hi>Sweeds</hi> being inhartened by the taking of <hi>Zuicka,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereby secured the passes over the <hi>Mulda,</hi> upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of retreat, they came with part of their army before <hi>Freiberg,</hi> that by the taking thereof they might the easilier enter into <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> but as this was a place of great moment to the Elector of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi> so did hee employ all his Forces to the defence thereof, and some of his troopes joyning with <hi>Marcini,</hi> they marched thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to releive it, as they did. For <hi>Bannier</hi> not having made any considerable Works or Trenches about it, nor having men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fight, it behoved him to retreat. So to shun the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of giving battle, having formerly stood a charge upon his reere, wherein he suffered some losse, and he himselfe was light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt with an Harquebuse. But if the <hi>Sweeds</hi> were not pleased with the businesse of <hi>Freiburg,</hi> they recovered the losse they there received by their good successe at the same time before <hi>Demmin,</hi> which they had besieged some moneths before. For the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to great extreamity, yeilded upon parley to the <hi>Sweedes,</hi> who having hereby made themselves Masters of all <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania,</hi> wherein they had many uselesse Garrisons, they drew from thence as many people as they could, and marched towards <hi>Bannier,</hi> who being gone from his former quarters, was retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards <hi>Aldemberg</hi> to expect those recruits. <hi>Marcini</hi> invited thereunto by his good successe, and encouraged the more by this retreate, pursued him with more daring then forces to <hi>Valtheim,</hi> For <hi>Bannier</hi> expecting the succour which was already upon their march towards him, did cunningly by his retreate entice the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie after him, that they might be so farre engaged in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit as not to be able to shun battle, wherein he might have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon them. But his expected succour not appearing, though he knew they made long marches, he intrencht himselfe neere the River <hi>Scope,</hi> which runs between <hi>Chimnits</hi> and <hi>Freyburg,</hi> not

farre from whence <hi>Marcini</hi> also haulted to expect the arrivall of some Troopes which were comming to his succour from <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and that he might not engage himself any further, for the losse of <hi>Demmin</hi> being of great consequence, and all those people mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching towards <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he fore-saw he should incurre some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe without a greater strength. Letters were therefore with all diligence dispatcht away to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to solicite the hasting away of men that were raised in <hi>Morania, Hungary,</hi> and else-where, as also to desire that the Emperour would come to <hi>Prague,</hi> by whose presence the people there would not be a little sollaced, they being much mastered by fear &amp; confusion, by reason of the <hi>Sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who knew how prejudiciall it would be to them to be deprived of the <hi>Dutch</hi> assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, behaved themselves dexterously with those that were of their party. And they likewise knowing what loss they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to undergoe without the support of moneyes from <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Emperours Coffers being empty, no contribution being to be had from the harrassed Country, nor so many armies being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be maintained, the sequell was, that the one and the other of them concealing and cloaking their distasts according to exact po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, they applyed all their consultations to the common interest.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Many notwithstanding wondred, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who put so great an esteeme upon the <hi>Imperiall</hi> greatnesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their owne <hi>Grandetsa</hi> is likewise upheld, should only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their owne interest, and provide for the safety of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> by drawing the best Souldiers from out the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Armie;</q>
               <q>and that chiefely fearing the power of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:55221:246"/>
they endeavoured most of all to fence themselves against it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were more speculative affirmed the cause of this not to proceed so much from what hath been said, as from a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found end; for they held the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not so intensively mind the affairs of the Empire, as well for that they more valued what was their owne, then what appertained unto another, as that it seemed no such prejudice could be received by the <hi>Sweeds</hi> then, as the ignorant people talked of; For before they could come into the heart of the <hi>Imperiall</hi> patrimony, the <hi>Sweeds</hi> were to passe through the States of <hi>Brandemburg, Saxony,</hi> and the States of other Protestant Princes, who had made their peace with the Emperour, so as those States would be first exposed to the miseries of Warre; and it made for the Emperour that the Warre might fall out amongst the Protestants, who when they should be by themselves weakened, the Emperours pulse would beate the higher. So as when afterwards they should have defended <hi>Flanders</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> and have come to some accommodation with that Crown, or by any new acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent some intestine broyles might againe rise up in <hi>France,</hi> they might then turn all their strength against the impoverished and weakened Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and reduce them more easily to their obedience, and accomplish that vast designe which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aimed at. The <hi>Dutch</hi> observing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> manner of proceedings, wherein they never found the effects which they comforted <hi>Caesar</hi> and his Court with, neither knowing whether they had been faithfull to them or no in their relating to them the pleasure of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and his Counsell, but rather fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that his agents might have altered or with-drawne from his orders, <hi>Haniball Gonsaga,</hi> brother to the Prince of <hi>Bozolo,</hi> was sent Embassadour extraordinary from the Emperour to acquaint the Court of <hi>Spaine</hi> with the condition of <hi>Germany,</hi> with the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy of the losse of <hi>Brisacke,</hi> and with what need there was of a puissant army to recover it, and to hinder the further advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Weymar</hi> and <hi>Bannier,</hi> who being Commanders of great esteeme, respect was to be had to their experience and successe</q>
The Arch Dutchess of <hi>Inspruch</hi> did likewise send to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Pagano</hi> a Jesuite, a very understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding man; for knowing what influence the Jesuites have upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose councels are for the most part governed by them, shee thought him fitter then any other Subject of <hi>Tiroll</hi> to obtaine what was desired. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colomeni</hi> was ratified Generall of the <hi>Flanders</hi> Forces. <hi>Gallasse</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered his health, was entreated to reassume the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Armie, and to have a care to the preservation of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> which the <hi>Sweedes</hi> seemed much to threaten; all the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies of men were in great haste sent to the Frontiers; <hi>Lamboy</hi>
was likewise sent to treat with <hi>Weymar</hi> under-hand, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could entice this brave Commander from adhering to the <hi>French,</hi> and (which imported more) to get him to relinquish <hi>Brisacke,</hi> by offering him the Dukedome of <hi>Cobury,</hi> and by other
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55221:246"/>
promises. The <hi>Grisonne</hi> Embassadour returned very well satisfied in their negotiations from <hi>Spaine,</hi> where they had been very well treated, and were nobly received at <hi>Millan,</hi> with presents and other demonstrations, which made them very well satisfied with the new friendship they had contracted with <hi>Spaine</hi>; in briefe, great preparations were made in all parts, and negotiations ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly pursued.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Austrian</hi> preparations were great in all parts of their dominions, the King of <hi>France</hi> came not short of them in his vast designes; For to boote with a great Armie which hee had got together upon the Frontiers of <hi>Artoise,</hi> between <hi>Amyens</hi> and <hi>Abbeville,</hi> commanded by <hi>Monsieur de Millervy,</hi> chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Artillery, and other souldiery towards <hi>Mets,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Monsieur Ficchieres,</hi> &amp; the Viscount <hi>Arpagia,</hi> more men were continually raised in <hi>France,</hi> and taken into pay, to the end that their army might stil be kept in vigour, &amp; their places be supplyed, who perished or ran away. Wherefore the <hi>Infanta</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>French</hi> had some great design in hand, he sent for some of <hi>Picolomenies</hi> men who were quartered about <hi>Cleves,</hi> and dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them away with Colonell <hi>Breda,</hi> and <hi>Horch</hi> towards the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi> that there they might have an eye to the <hi>French,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them the best they might. And <hi>Picolomeny</hi> who was at <hi>Bona</hi> in the Country of <hi>Cullen,</hi> to be assistant with Colonell <hi>Glem,</hi> and the Marquesse <hi>Caretto</hi> at the Councell of Warre which was held concerning the present affaires, when hee understood the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> march, he forth-with returned post to his army, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it from its former quarters, he came betweene <hi>Mosa</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssell,</hi> and halted there, preparing to execute the <hi>Infanta's</hi> orders. But all this kept not the <hi>French</hi> from going on with their reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; For it was agreed in the Kings Councell that <hi>Theon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uille</hi> should be this yeare endeavoured to be taken, a Fort of mighty importance, which lying upon the <hi>Moselle</hi> benath <hi>Mets,</hi> kept the way open for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from <hi>Lucemburg</hi> to <hi>Loreyn,</hi> whereinto when things should succeede well, they might enter. The <hi>French</hi> therefore that they might make this place sure, sent <hi>Ficchiers</hi> with sixteene thousand men to besiege it on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi>; and because they had resolved at the same time to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take somewhat else elsewhere, <hi>Milleray</hi> having mustered his army neer <hi>Abeville</hi> on the 13. of <hi>May,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he found to consist of 18000. men, together with a good traine of Artillery, hee went to take in <hi>Hesden,</hi> a strong place, invironed with exact and regular Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, scituated in the Champion which extends it selfe from the Sea to <hi>Dorlens,</hi> a passage of great consideration to open the way for further enterprizes in <hi>Flanders</hi>; he therefore planted his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and began the siege. On the other side likewise the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> &amp; Marishall <hi>Schamburg,</hi> who had raised another great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in <hi>Languedocke,</hi> about <hi>Tolowse,</hi> went to the taking in of <hi>Salsa</hi> a Fort upon the confines of <hi>Catalonia</hi> belonging to the K. of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by which the ingresse being opened on that side, they might
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55221:247"/>
bring some troubles upon those Kingdomes; and Duke <hi>Weymar</hi> went at the same time before <hi>Salies</hi> a City in <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Four Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at one and the same time of remarkable consideration, and which do evidently witnesse the power of that Kingdome, which to boote with the Armies before these Forts, three of which are thought to be the best of all <hi>Europe,</hi> did at the same time main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a Warre in <hi>Italy,</hi> an Armie in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> a Fleet at Sea, and contributed great summes of money to the <hi>Hollanders, Swissers, Sweeds</hi> and others; all which was done by that Kingdome alone without the aide or assistance of any others. The Commanders fought a vye against these Forts, to try who should have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour first to perfect his undertaking; so as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were greatly troubled not only in respect of the imminent danger, but out of their emulation, for they now saw the greatnes of <hi>France</hi> did much with-draw from the preheminence which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto in <hi>Europe</hi>; yet not giving way either to fear or passion they provided to defend themselves on the one and the other side. <hi>Picolomeny</hi> was sent towards <hi>Theonville,</hi> that with his valour and experience hee might relieve that place. The <hi>Infanta</hi> encamped himselfe with 14000, men neere <hi>Borbocke,</hi> to endeavour the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Hesdin</hi>: Souldiers were raised every where in <hi>Spaine</hi> to keepe <hi>Salsa</hi> from being lost; and because the Prince of <hi>Oringe</hi> was at the same time marcht towards <hi>Nimenghen</hi> to raise jealousies in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to divide their Forces in such manner as they should not be able to defend themselves both against him and against the <hi>French,</hi> the Countrey <hi>Militia</hi> being made to take up armes, who were put into places least suspitious in lieu of the Souldiers that were drawne thereout, another great body of men was sent to <hi>Gheldren.</hi> In fine, wisedome nor dexterity not being wanting in any part, <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> and all other States belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to these two Crownes, were full of Armes, and abounded in Councells how they might prosperously effect their ends.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things went thus, <hi>Bannier</hi> not seeing the expected recruits appeare (for <hi>Scallans</hi> who had the leading of them, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained himselfe by the way in taking in of some places held by the <hi>Imperiallists,</hi> which though they were not much valued, yet by reason of great contributions which were taken from them, were advantagious to the <hi>Sweeds</hi>) and being advertized how the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riallists</hi> grew daily stronger, thought to passe over the <hi>Elbe,</hi> so to keepe himselfe the better from their hostility, and joyning with those who were in <hi>Slesia,</hi> to encamp there till the expected succor should arrive. But <hi>Maracini</hi> being advertised hereof, though he had not Forces sufficient to buckle with the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more bold, for that they saw their safety depended more upon the edge of their swords, he being encourgaged by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good successe, and by the retreate, which is oft times estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a kinde of flight, gave on with more of hope then security between <hi>Chimnits</hi> and <hi>Suika,</hi> upon the horse led by <hi>Plato</hi> Sergeant Major of the <hi>Sweedish</hi> Battle, who was cunningly placed by <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:55221:247"/>
in the reer upon agreement made between them, that if the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> should appeare, he should only entertaine them with skirmishes, and should rather seeme to flye away then to resist, for that the enemie being thereby much inhartned, might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare fall upon the Ambush which <hi>Bannier</hi> had laid of 2000. Foote, and 500. Dragoones, and 12. pieces of Cannon loaded with musquet bullets placed at the entrance of a certaine passage, and of 1 500. horse which were ready with <hi>Banniers</hi> selfe to fall upon the <hi>Imperiallists,</hi> when they should be falne into the Net which the <hi>Sweeds</hi> had laid for them; for knowing the greediness of Souldiers, and particularly of such who kept fasting from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall contributions and pay, doe headlong without any manner of respect fall to plunder; he thought that the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> at the first sight would not keepe from falling upon them. And <hi>Plato</hi> in conformity to the appointment made, skirmishing with some few troopes, and retreating, the stratagem tooke effect; for the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strians</hi> desirous to doe some-what to up-hold their reputation, and fill their pockets, charged furiously upon the enemies horse, and came in sight of the baggage, in defence of which the <hi>Sweeds</hi> seeming to advance with some files of Foot; the other flew upon them, who being charged in the reere of <hi>Banniers</hi> horse, as they thought to wheel about on the other side, fell so full in the mouth of the Ambush, as that the Cannon playing suddenly upon them, and some musquets wherewith the hedges were lyned, their files were so routed, and their ranks so disordered by the falling of their men and horses, which were either slaine or wounded, as that they fled away in disorder, and fell foule upon their owne Foote, in horror and confusion, overthrowing all order. So as being pursued on all sides by the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> great was the slaughter that was made.

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who not able to endure to stand spectator of this bad successe, desired to lose his life together with the battle; two fierce and bloody encounters were had; But the <hi>Imperiallists</hi> being no longer able to make head against the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> having continually 400.

comfort to them. The Emperour who was ready to go for <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> deferred his journey; and all the forces of <hi>Moravia, Austria</hi> and the other neighbouring <hi>Provinces</hi> marched towards the Frontiere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bannier</hi> encouraged by this happy encounter, would not leave <hi>Freibury</hi> behinde him upon his back, but whilest the people were possest with feare, &amp; his victory was in force he would indeavour to take it. He therefore came before it with 10000. fighting men, and first by promises, and faire meanes invited the Governour to surrender, who being an experienced Souldier, returned such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming answer as his duty bound him to; so as faire meanes not prevailing, he must betake himselfe to foule; to dig trenches and plant his Cannon; but the inhabitants behaving themselves gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, <hi>Bannier</hi> found t'would be a hard peece of worke, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he might loose no more time before that place, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently afford the Imperiallists time to rally themselves, he turned his march towards <hi>Bohemia</hi> and having taken <hi>Melnish,</hi> and <hi>Latmerits,</hi> upon the <hi>Elbe</hi> he haulted there, for all the <hi>Austrians</hi> being run to <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>Gallasse</hi> who had reassumed his command being encamped upon the white hill with 10000. foote and 4000. horse, he found that City would not so easily be taken, nor would he without good grounds hazard to loose the honour he had wone; haulting therefore at <hi>Latmerits,</hi> and fortifying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe there, he intended to make a <hi>Magasine</hi> there of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the army thereby to keep <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Saxony</hi> in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, so as the Imperiallists and <hi>Saxons</hi> being come to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their owne Frontiers, the other Swedish Commanders might the more easily proceed on in <hi>Slesia</hi> and else where.</p>
            <p>And because <hi>Brandeis</hi> stood a litlle higher neere the <hi>Elbe,</hi> also it being a place whereby <hi>Prague</hi> might the easilyer be assayled and entrance be made into the center of the Kingdome, (the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy of which place being known, <hi>Offchercheim</hi> was gon thither with a good body of men, who was now become one of the Duke of <hi>Saxons</hi> chiefe Commanders, having left the <hi>Sweedes</hi>) <hi>Bannier</hi> desirous to make himselfe Master of this place also, went from <hi>Melnick</hi> with 7000.

               <hi>Millan,</hi> they might have given some great blow unto the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>; The Cardinal of <hi>Vallette</hi> went therefore with five thousand Foot and two thousand horse from <hi>Puerin,</hi> a place between <hi>Chter</hi> and <hi>Carmagneola,</hi> and hoping to finde successe according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations he hastned his march; but the Prince being acquainted with all these proceedings, and the fore-named Captains being so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly imprisoned, together with some others that had a hand in this business, and the little gate of relief in St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Bulwork, wherby the <hi>French</hi> were to have bin let in, being found open, they through vigilancy prevented all mischief. The Cardinal of <hi>Valette</hi> who was already come to St. <hi>Domiano,</hi> within 3 miles of <hi>Asti,</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, returned to <hi>Montferrat</hi>; &amp; being informed how that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they might make use of their men in the field, and not thinking that the <hi>French</hi> could then oppugn any considerable place, had drawn out of <hi>Chinas</hi> a great part of the Garrison there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he marched thitherward, and making himself master of all the important places about it, he approached to it with his Cannon &amp; Trenches. <hi>Leganes</hi> who dreamt of nothing lesse then this, and who was with his Army between St. <hi>Ia,</hi> and <hi>Trino,</hi> where he heard of it, sent forth-with <hi>Don Iohn Geray</hi> with some troopes of horse and other intelligent Commanders towards them, to discover the position of the <hi>French,</hi> as also to draw out 300.

knowing thereby the importancy of the scituation of <hi>Cressenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> they went thither, and began to fortifie it, intending to make it a considerable place for the better maintaining of their forces in that Province; finding it now to be apparant, that as they were very good to Towne, so were they not much inferiour to the FRENCH in the field.</p>
            <p>During the Siege of <hi>Chinas,</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>Savoy</hi> who was in <hi>Asti,</hi> did with some of the Garrison of that Town, part of them like of <hi>Annone,</hi> and others, unexpectedly on the 17. of <hi>Iune</hi> take <hi>Cecca,</hi> a Towne not farre from <hi>Mandoni,</hi> and <hi>Tanario,</hi> and some other Castles and places held by the <hi>French,</hi> the which he did that he might the better open his ways towards <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Province,</hi> the Governour whereof fearing lest the <hi>French</hi> should get in thither, had already acquainted the Cardinall that he kept it for him.</p>
            <p>

He made the hazard of so great an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking be knowne, concealed not the worth of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, the bravery of their horse, and the forwardnesse of their Voluntiers, to the end that his men not ignorant of any

thing might put on an extraordinary resolution either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their enemies, or if they should doubt it, to take their leave; for he would presently give leave to any one that did not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow him to be gone, since the feare of a few may distast the daring of many, and concluding that hee himselfe marching in the Front, would make way for others. He caused their Huts to be set on fire, &amp; marched in good order towards the <hi>French</hi> camp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fichiers</hi> upon the newes hereof, having held a Councell of Warre with the chiefe of his men, it was resolved on by all, that they should by no meanes for all these threats remove from their stations, but boldly face the <hi>Germans,</hi> and give them battle if it should be needfull. Some horse were sent abroad to discover the enemie, and the order of his march, to the end that the FRENCH Armie might put themselves in the most behove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full order to give them Battell, and being informed by these that they advanced in a close body, and in a threatning man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and (by what was affirmed by some prisoners taken by the said Horse-men) with a resolution to fight. The <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> put themselves in Battel-array, betweene the <hi>Mossell</hi> and a deep ditch which is there in the Champion towards the West, and stood firme expecting the <hi>Germans.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Picolome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> advancing immediately, set upon divers Sconces, from whence being couragiously repulsed, the <hi>Germanes</hi> having at last got to a place which commanded the Flanke of the Enemies Armie, and placed some Cannon there, they made so good use thereof, as the <hi>French,</hi> that they might be no longer subject to the mischiefe of those Cannon which went through their Battaglions from one end to another, as they were retreating to make a stand else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Picolomeni</hi> gave in furiously upon them with his horse, and after having found some resistance, though not such as hee expected, hee wrought himselfe into the FRENCH Squadrons and made them turne their backes. Then <hi>Monsieur de Fichiers</hi> comming boldly on with squadron of <hi>French</hi> horse, did with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of bravery make head against the <hi>Schock</hi> of <hi>Picolomeni,</hi> and encouraging his men that they might second him, the action was likely to be much more fierce and bitter, had his entreaties been of force enough to detaine those that gave backe; but his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches avayling nothing, and being still pursued by <hi>Picolomeni, Fichers</hi> being at last wounded with a Musquet, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the Enemie, hee was taken Prisoner, as were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Marquesse <hi>De la Force,</hi> and Count <hi>De Pas,</hi> the Foote remaining at the discretion of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who breaking their rankes did great execution upon them, tooke all their Baggage, tenne pieces of Cannon, slew sixe thousand Souldiers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Fort to <hi>Picolomenies</hi> great glory, whose actions had afterwards, as they well deserved, a great value put upon them.</p>
            <p>The King who was then at <hi>Abeville,</hi> not farre from <hi>Hesdin</hi> was much troubled at the newes of this defeate, yet not

appearing any wayes moved, but taking it as a mutuall blow of fortune, he commanded his Captaines to prepare to make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall assault upon <hi>Hesdin,</hi> in which he himselfe in person would assist. For since he could not get <hi>Theonuille,</hi> he was absolutely resolved to have <hi>Hesdin.</hi> But the besieged who had already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured seven assaults, and were reduced to a small number, would contend no longer, and not hoping in any succour (for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> was removed further off from his former quarters) they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on capitulation surrendred the Towne on the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Garrison marching out upon honourable Conditions.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Schamburg</hi> continued still to oppugn <hi>Salsa,</hi> towards which though men were sent from all parts of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and 2500. Foote raised in the State of <hi>Modena, Luka,</hi> and other places, holding of the Emperour to goe to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour thereof, were embarqued at <hi>Genua,</hi> yet the new levyes of the <hi>Spanyards</hi> taken from the commodiousnesse of their owne houses, not being able to buckle with the <hi>French</hi> who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to Warre, and experienced upon other occasions, and the Towne not being able longer to resist without reliefe, it was enforced to yeild, as it did about the latter end of <hi>Iune,</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> great griefe, who fore-seeing that if the <hi>French</hi> should likewise take <hi>Perpegnian,</hi> they would cause great feare in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of those parts, they used the best meanes they could to prepare for their defence. They therefore promised great rewards to whosoever would upon this occasion raise men, which the Kingdome of <hi>Spaine</hi> wanted more then any thing else; neither were they negligent in preparing to shelter themselves from the tempest which threatned them from the County of <hi>Rossiglione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>French</hi> had made a good amends by these two victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for their defeate at <hi>Theonuille,</hi> they were also much sollaced at the newes that Duke <hi>Weymar</hi> proceeding successefully in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondy,</hi> had likewise taken <hi>Salins,</hi> by which the passage being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged into the heart of that Province, they feared not, but that <hi>Weymar</hi> would in a short time adde it to their Crowne. But these ends built upon uncertaine futurity, shewed by the sequell how unstable mens thoughts are, and their designes deceitfull. For the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being againe come into the field after the route given to <hi>Ghetz,</hi> and keeping about <hi>Vertemberg</hi> with powerfull Forces, <hi>Weymar</hi> was taken from the designed enterprize of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondy,</hi> and appointed to march towards the <hi>Bavarians.</hi> Therefore rising from about <hi>Salins,</hi> hee sodainely fell into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and whilst having thrown a bridge over the <hi>Rhene</hi> at <hi>Newburg,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to goe with his army against <hi>Bavaria,</hi> struck with a sodain sicknesse, he dyed within three dayes to the unexpressible griefe of his Commanders, souldiers, and of all the <hi>Sweeds.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>Duke <hi>Weymar</hi> was of a gracious aspect, a brown complexion, a proportionable stature, very active, of a strong and wel dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed body, of the Auncient and Noble Family of <hi>Iohn Frederick</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who being overcome by <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55221:252"/>
his State taken from him. From his tender yeares being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto prompted by his naturall disposition, he applyed himselfe to the Warres; wherein as nothing is hard to him whose wit and spirit doth accompany the <hi>genius</hi> thereof, so he being all life, and full of ingenuity, became so capable of instruction, &amp; bold in the execution, as that he with honour past from one employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or place unto another, not for that his condition needed to take this way to bring him to greater employments, but that hee might by degrees come to the height of that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which above all things else is requisite for him who girts a sword about him under the command of Drum and Trumpet. He past his youth amongst the <hi>Protestant</hi> forces, and entered his mans estate in the King of <hi>Sweedes</hi> warres, where he wonn such credit as desired nothing to highten the splendor thereof, save the beames of that Kings worth, which reflecting upon merit, made the <hi>Disciples</hi> of his great Schoole, good Masters in other <hi>Academies,</hi> being imployed in the most principall charges of the chiefest armies, he so punctually observed orders, did with such courage performe what was injoyned him, did with such eagernesse mannage what he tooke in hand, as deservedly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast him that applause which brought him to the hight of praise, passing unoffended by backbyting or emulation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men hardly arrive unlesse sustained by worth, and guided by fortune; his affability, and sincerity intreating did worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good will, and obedience of his souldiers, as giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholy over to be disposed off by him, they strove who through their actions should shew themselves most affectionate to him. He dispised the haughtinesse of Pompe, and pride of gravity, as things misbecoming a Souldier, wherewith he was wont to say, ignorance doth fish for respect and veneration, not for obsequy and love; for they who are tedious in lending an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>coriate the Tongue. He therefore banisht Ceremonyes, hated flatterers, dispised proud men, and cared not for outsides. The purity of curtesy, perspecuity of thoughts, and sincerity of heart lodged under the freedome of familiarity; He had an esteem of every one, and honoured the privatest souldier, as much as he did the chiefest officer, saying there was nothing whereby to awaken a mans spirit but honour, and hopes to come thereby; for he that sees himselfe honoured, ought to doe honourably, that his actions may correspond with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; nor was there any more prejudiciall maxime, then in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatnesse, to be scornefull in behaviour, since thereby the actions, and hardnesse of the couragious are imbassed, and suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; when there was a negotiation of extraordinary suffering, he would never fare better then did his souldiers. In so much as if necessity inforced them to sleep covered over with Snowe, He though he had better conveniences would doe the like, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55221:253"/>
them alwayes his bretheren, and companions. There is no excuse for weakenesse, when the head gives example to them that follow. This is the Trumpet which awakens the soule of the Souldier, strengthens decaying forces, and comforts the disposition of the will. He was so desirous to purchase a good name by his worth and vertue, and to prosper in his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he never ceased thinking with what force to overcome, with what plots, to have the better of, and with what bravery to astonish his Enemyes, and purchase his desires. He exercised himselfe onely in the knowledge of scituations, in reveiwing sconces, in observing what his Army wanted, in indeavouring their satisfaction, in discerning his officers opinions, and in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sometimes to one place, sometimes to another, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respect to his paines or labour, and the spare houres he had from such exercises, he spent them all in advising what was best to be done in speculation, how he might beate his enemies, and in thinking how he might comfort his <hi>Militia,</hi> He shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe active upon all expediences, ready upon any agreement, in any resolution impatient, couragious in any action, He studied chiefely how to imitate the actions of the best Commanders, and in particular, those of his adored King of <hi>Swethland.</hi> All selfe-interest, all idle desires, all weake fancies were farre from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, from his generosity; he spake many languages well, he would patiently heare what every one would say, and was satisfied with good will where the power was wanting. He was never angry upon any bad information, he never beleived all that was told him, he never blamed any one, till he had well weighed the truth. He delighted not to punish, he loved to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, nor did he ever more willingly pardon, then when the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was greatest; to this purpose he would say that they who can commit great faults, can also doe acts greatly meritorious; by one of which a Prince receives more good then by punishing many errours, wherein the state is not concerned. When he could not give satisfaction by deeds, his words were sufficient. He hath by his speech only, so satisfied and contented many that have mutined for want of pay; as the greatest threateners, have oft times laid downe their pretences at his feete. In breife Duke <hi>Weymar</hi> was loved effectually, reverenced out of love, admired out of reverence, celebrated out of admiration, and adored for being famous in all his qualities, nothing of amisse was known in him, but his too eager forwardnesse, by which being oft times heated, he would loose all his patience, turning daring into au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity, and that into rashnesse. He dyed when he was not yet full six and thirty yeares old, and just in a time when fortune turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her face upon him, he had fastened her by the haire to his sword. He left the government of the Army and of <hi>Brisack</hi> to Count <hi>Nassaw,</hi> Colonell <hi>Erlach, Roso,</hi> and <hi>Ohem,</hi> his deserts to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Swethland.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sweedes</hi> kept all this while at <hi>Brandeis,</hi> and the Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55221:253"/>
about <hi>Prague,</hi> the one watching over the other, and <hi>Banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> did this to the end that whilest the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Armie was busied here, his other chief Captains might have opportunity to proceed on else-where, as more particularly Colonell <hi>Orans</hi> in <hi>Slesia,</hi> who being recruited by some accesse of men from <hi>Pomerania,</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to doe some good in that Province; For having routed Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>de Vich,</hi> and taken Count <hi>Pompey</hi> prisoner in <hi>Sagan,</hi> who was come thither after <hi>Viches</hi> defeate, and after he had behaved himselfe gallantly in divers encounters with the <hi>Sweedes,</hi> though farre inferiour to them in number; it seemed that the loss of these two prime Commanders, who till then had honourably defended that Province, threatned no small ruine to that side.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Sweedes</hi> having likewise taken the Citie of <hi>Perna,</hi> did at the same time oppugne the Castle, which being valiantly defended by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> their fortune seemed to be at a stand, and that they should penetrate no further into the State of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector, for the <hi>Saxons</hi> setting at unawares upon them in <hi>Perna,</hi> they did not only relieve the Castle, but forced them to forsake the Citie, and by flight to recover <hi>Laitmeritz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> being speedily advertised of the <hi>French-mens</hi> departure from <hi>Turin,</hi> and of their assailing <hi>Cuneo,</hi> and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by those that sided with him, to undertake the taking of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> he advised with <hi>Leganes</hi> of what was best to be done, and the resolution was to endeavour it. Parting therefore from <hi>Asti,</hi> they marched joyntly towards <hi>Moncallier,</hi> and the Prince being come thither with 2000. horse, 1000. Foote, scaling ladders, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, he on the 26. of <hi>Iuly</hi> at sixe of the clocke at night came before the walls, and by intelligence which it was thought he held with <hi>Don Maurice</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and with the Colonell of the Dutchess her guard: being come up to the greene Bastion behinde the Dukes Palace, his Souldiers without any gain-saying got upon the Rampeire, and applying a Petarre to the Castle gate on the other side, he luckily obtained his end; For the Palace being unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Souldiers, those few <hi>French</hi> who ran to keepe backe the men that entred, were forced themselves to give backe; at the newes hereof the Dutches getting into her Coach, retired sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Cittadell, accompanied by Colonell <hi>d' Aglie,</hi> by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents, <hi>Benci, Cauda,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lauder,</hi> by <hi>Monsieur Manta,</hi> Count <hi>Vald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperga,</hi> the Marquess <hi>Lolias,</hi> and other chief Officers of the Court, with Ladies, and the same <hi>Don Maurice,</hi> who upon some pretence not entering into the Cittadell returned to the Citie, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Prince his party. The newes of this accident, as it was of great importance, and had mighty consequences depending upon it, so were not the <hi>French</hi> Captaines a little troubled at it, who when they heard of it as they were before <hi>Cuneo,</hi> they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay raised their Siege from before that place, and marched towards the Cittadell, from whence taking the Dutchess out, and conveying her with a good Guard to <hi>Carmagneola,</hi> they turned the Cannon of the Cittadel upon the City, and playing frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

there-withal upon the houses and vexing the inhabitants with their <hi>Granadoes</hi> great was the mischiefe that was done, and the feares greater, that if the <hi>French</hi> should recover the Towne they would sack and fire it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore flocked thither opposing themselves against the Cittadell, with raised banks, Trenches and Palezadoes, and the <hi>French</hi> with no less fervour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to beate them backe and recover the Citie, so as the businesse grew so bitter and bloody, as they were forced to have a Truce to bury their dead, which was afterwards by the <hi>Nuntio's</hi> mediation agreed upon for fourscore dayes, without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kings Court with it, each side thinking they might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doe it, and reape advantage by it, by reason of the great slaughte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of both sides, as also for the want of moneyes, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury of provisions. This Truce was therefore celebrated with great reciprocall content.</p>
            <p>The Generalls visited each other, and after great Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and professions, what valuation ought to be put upon the safety of valiant Subjects, they retired to their quarters to make such provisions as should be thought needfull to prosecute the Warre, or else to finde meanes how to establish such a peace as might for the future make the <hi>Romanists</hi> enjoy the comfort which is known but by a few, to be what it is before it be lost.</p>
