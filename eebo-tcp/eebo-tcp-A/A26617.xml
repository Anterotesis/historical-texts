            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Profession of a Souldier is allowed to be lawful by the Word of God; and so Famous and Honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Men, that Emperours and Kings do account it a great honour to be of the Profession, and to have experience in it; and next under God, the Profession of a Souldier doth rule or over rule the greatest part
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62313:6"/>
of the World. He that chooseth the Profession of a Souldier, ought to know withal, Honour must be his greatest wages, and his Enemy his surest Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master.</p>
               <p>There are two things that cause men to be desirous of this Profession; the first is, Emulation of Honour; the next is, the hopes they have by Licence to do Evil. As the aims of the first are Virtuous, so will they do good service: the other by strict Discipline, may be brought to do good Service, and to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Souldiers; but if that Discipline be neglected, then they prove the ruine of an Army.</p>
               <p>Let a Souldiers Resolution be never so great, and his Courage invincible in the day of Battel, yet if he faint under the burthen of such tediousness as usually attendeth upon warlike designments, he is no way fit for enterprise: because the two chief parts of a Souldier are <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Sufferance;</hi> and there is as much Honour gained by suffering Wants patiently in the War, as by fighting Valiantly; and as great Atchievements effected by the one, as by the other. It is no virtue, but a weakness of the mind, not to be able to endure want a little while: and yet it is an easier matter to find men that will offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves willingly to Death, than such as will endure Labour with patience.</p>
               <p>The greatest virtue which is required in a Souldier is Obedience, as a thing wherein the force of all Discipline consisteth.</p>
               <p>A Souldier must be always ready to confront extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Danger, with extremity of Valour, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top fury with an higher resolution.</p>
               <p>A Souldier should always respect courses of Honour, and the Publick good, above his own safety: and ought to fear nothing but God and Dishonour. Let
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62313:6"/>
every Souldier arm his mind with hopes, and put on Courage: whatsoever disaster falleth, let not his heart sink. The passage of Providence lieth through many crooked ways. A despairing heart, is the true Prophet of approaching evil.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Some Observations upon War, which is the Profession of a Souldier.</head>
               <p>PEace, Fulness, Pride, and War, are the four Fellies, which being let into one another; make the Wheel, that the Times turn on; and after a long Scene of Peace, War ever entreth the Stage.</p>
               <p>The causes of all Wars may be reduced to six heads; Ambition, Avarice, Religion, Revenge, Providence, and Desence.</p>
               <p>War, the Profession of a Souldier, is that of all others, which as it conferreth most Honour upon a man who therein acquitteth himself well; so it draweth the greatest infamy upon him who demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself ill. For one fault committed can never be repaired, and one hour causeth the loss of that reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath been thirty years acquiring.</p>
               <p>In matter of War, there is such a medly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlacing of material circumstances with the body of the action, that commonly one business begetteth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No Science, or Faculty whatsoever in multitude of parts may any way be comparable to the Art
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62313:7"/>
Military; wherein every small, and unrespected cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance quite altereth the nature of the Action, and amongst the variable events of War, many unexpected occasions arise, which give present Victory to him that is ready to take it: and many strange chances so alter the course of things, that no foresight can discern what may happen.</p>
               <p>War beginneth when one party listeth, but it endeth when the adverse party pleaseth.</p>
               <p>War is in the same nature with Offences, <hi>Necesse est ut veniant,</hi> they must be, but they are mightily in fault that cause them.</p>
               <p>Yet in those Wars whose ends are to defend your own Possessions, or to recover them being lost, or where Necessity striketh up her hard Alarms, or wronged Religion beateth her zealous Marches, go on and prosper.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Some Observations of an Offensive VVar, and Conquering of Countries.</head>
               <p>AN Offensive War will keep you from Civil War at home, and make you feared of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and beloved of your Friends, and keepeth your Gentry, and Commons from laziness, and all sorts of Luxury. But here you must note, to entertain a Forein War, is not good to be observed, but by such Kingdoms and States that are able to go thorough with their Designs they undertake. Because
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62313:7"/>
as a Foreign War is necessary for Rich and Potent Kingdoms and States; so it is hurtful to Petty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States: for being too weak to gain by it, they will in the end, but lose their design, their Honours, and Monies, and impoverish themselves, and increase their Enemies. It is not for Kings and States to undertake a troublesome and dangerous War upon an humour, or any other slender motion: but diligently weighing the circumstances thereof, and measuring the peril and hazard with the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents, to inform their Judgments of the Action, and so try whether the Benefit would answer their Labour. They ought likewise to be well informed of the greatness and riches of the Countrey, the quality and strength of the People, their use of War, and the opportunity of their Havens. And he that maketh an Offensive War, must so proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that he be sure to keep what he getteth, and to enrich, not impoverish his own Countrey. For he that doth increase his Dominions, and yet groweth not in Strength, must needs go to wrack. Now those grow not strong who grow poor in the Wars, although they prove Victorious: because their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests do cost them more than they get by them. This errour many run into by not knowing how to limit their hopes; and so grounded on their own vast conceits, without weighing their strength, they are utterly ruined. For Conquests, not having Power answerable to their Greatness, invite new Conquerours to the ruine of the old.</p>
               <p>That Prince who putteth himself upon an Offensive War, ought to be Master of his Enemy in Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Purse, and Men; or at least in Shipping and Purse: or else he must see some Garboils in the State which he assaileth. And he ought to be called
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62313:8"/>
thither by a party; otherwise it would be a rash En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.</p>
               <p>If you make any attempt upon any Forein Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the first thing you ought to do, is to take some Sea. Town that hath a convenient Harbour, and that lieth nearest the greatest City in that Countrey, in which you make your War. This Town you ought to secure and harbour very well with good works: and take care that it be very well Victualled, before you advance further into the Countrey with your Army. So this Town will serve to keep your Provisions for your Magazines: and being well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of Victual, will serve upon occasion to make good your retreat. For having once gotten possession of a Sea. Town, and having well Fortified and Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the same, you have one foot on Land, and the other on Sea.</p>
               <p>Having fortified a place for your Magazine, and your Retreat, advance with your Army unto the chief City in the Countrey. By which means you will soon force your Enemy to Battel; and if you win the Battel, and follow your Victory close, you may gain the chief City of the Countrey, either by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, or Assault, if it be not Fortified; or before your Enemy be able to relieve it, you may be able to starve it. But in case you do not prevail to be Master of the chief City, either by Composition, or Assault; then ought you strongly to intrench two thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse in a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and so Fortifying one Quarter after another with your Army, until you have intrenched so many several Quarters, as you think may be sufficient to keep the City from Provisions. And then, if you think fit, you may run Lines from one Quarter to another. And having strongly Intrenched that part
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62313:8"/>
of your Army that is quartered about the City, draw the rest of your Army into a Body, and intrench them in some place near the Town, where you think it most convenient to meet with any Enemy, that may come to the relief of it. You ought likewise to use the best means you can for intelligence, and continually to send out Parties of Horse several ways, that when any Enemy approacheth near you, you may be in a readiness to fight with him. If you come to be Master of the Chief City of a Kingdom, or Country, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that Kingdom, or Country more then half won.</p>
               <p>The surest way to keep that Country you Conquer in Obedience to you, will be to oppress them as little as may be (especially at first) either in their Purses, Consciences, or Laws. He that obtaineth a Kingdom with the Rupture of his Faith, hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Glory of a Conquest, but lost the Honour of a Conquerour. But you ought to disarm them, and take Pledges of them for their Obedience, the which must be kept in your own Country. You ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to employ in your Garrisons all the Gun-Smiths, and all the Salt-petre-men that you find in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try you have Conquered; and to take into your hands all the Powder and Brimstone you find; and destroy all the Powder-Mills that are out of your own Garrisons.</p>
               <p>When it shall happen that you are to Conquer a Country that doth afford Covert, and Protection to an Enemy, who is more malicious than valorous, and through the fastness of the place refuseth to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, unless it be upon advantages; the War doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less is likely to prove tedious, and the Victory less Honourable. In such cases there is no other way, than so to harrass and waste the Country, that the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62313:9"/>
Enemy may be famished out of his Holds, and brought to subjection by scarcity, and necessity: which is a means so powerful as well to supplant the greatest strengths, as to meet with Subterfuges and Delays, that of it self it subdueth all opposition, and needeth no other help for atchieving of Victory.</p>
               <p>It is much better for a Prince to invade an Enemy in his own Country, than to attend him at home in his own Kingdom; if so be that he hath competent Forces to give him hopes of doing good upon his Enemy. For the seat of War is always miserable.</p>

               <p>THE best way to prevent any attempts of any Foreign Enemy, is to be able and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist their Designs; and the best way to do that, is to have a good Rich Publick Treasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, and your people continually well trained up in Martial Discipline.</p>
               <p>When you foresee that an Enemy is resolved to set upon your Country to conquer it, and if your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be so much Master of you at Sea, that you fear the shutting up of your Havens by his Shipping, then ought you to provide your Magazines extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily well with Ammunition, Arms, and Salt, and great store of Brimstone, Salt-petre, and Salt-petre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to have Powder-Mills in all your Chief Towns</p>
               <p>In the beginning of a Defensive War, if you meet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62313:9"/>
with a powerful Enemy, and foresee that the War is likely to last long, then it will be wisdom in you to entertain some Forein Nation: But you must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to entertain none of those Nations who serve in your Enemies Army, unless they be such as are of a contrary Religion to your Enemy; to the end that you may spare your own Nation as much as may be: Provided always you have mony to pay them punctually; otherwise they may prove dangerous to you. And I would wish you by no means to keep them longer than you have mony to pay them: for if you do, you will find they will prove more your Enemies than your Friends. Likewise you must be careful to entertain no more Strangers, than you are well able to Master; and that you Garrison them not in any of your Sea-Towns, or Forts, or where your Chief Magazines are. And in what Towns you do Garrison your Strangers in the Winter, where you place one Company of Strangers in a Garrison, you ought to place two of your own Nation. It is a very dangerous thing to entertain a Forein Friend to gain your own Country: but there is no danger in entertaining a Forein Friend to help to keep your Country, so long as you have mony to pay them.</p>
               <p>You may with good Fortresses, and a good Army so tye up your Enemy in hindring him from Victuals, and by intrenching always so near him, that you may now and then fall upon some of his Quarters, and so hinder him from making any Siege of importance. And when a Conquerour advanceth not forward, he recoileth. But here you must note, that such places as you fortifie are to be well fortified, well manned, and well provided of all necessaries, and that you do not fortifie any place, which will require many men for the Defence of it in a Siege.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62313:10"/>If you be assailed by a Power altogether dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to your Forces, and are in this case forced to leave some part of your Country to the Enemy, then you ought to burn all the Victual which you cannot contain wiehin your Fortresses, and also all the Towns and Villages which you cannot guard. For it is better to preserve your self in a ruined Country, than to keep it for your Enemy. It is a Maxim, That no publick good can be without some prejudice to some particular men: So a Prince cannot dis-entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle himself from a perilous Enterprise, if he will please every man: and the greatest and most usual faults which we commit in matters of State, and War, proceed from suffering our selves to be carried away with this complacency, whereof we repent when there is no remedy left.</p>
               <p>A Kingdom or State, though they have received many overthrows, should never cowardly yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to be Slaves to their Enemies, but endeavour to look Fortune again in the face, and to be ready to overcome or lose more gloriously, or get honourable terms of Agreement. Because by yielding they can hope for nothing but the saving of their lives, and it will be in their Enemies hands to deprive them of that at their pleasures: and Peace is more grievous to men in subjection, than the War is to them that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their liberties; and they are hopeful in their Arms, who have no other hope but in their Arms. A just Cause is good defence against a strong Enemy.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Some Observations for those that undertake a VVar.</head>
               <p>A Sovereign Prince is more capable to make great and ready Conquests than a Commonwealth, and especially if he goeth in person into the Field. For never any Prince hath founded a great Empire, but by making War in person: nor hath lost any, but when he made War by his Lieutenants.</p>
               <p>Those that undertake a War, ought to make their Levies according to the War which they undertake; carefully foreseeing that they undertake no Offensive War, but such as they be able to go through with their Purses and their Honours: And if their Purses will bear it, to make their Wars great and short. It is an excellent property of a good and wise Prince to use War, as he doth Physick, carefully, unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and seasonably; either to prevent approaching dangers, or to correct a present mischief, or to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a former loss. He that declineth Physick till he is accosted with the danger, or weakened with the Disease, is bold too long, and wise too late. That Peace is too precise, that limiteth the justness of a War to a Sword drawn, or a Blow given.</p>
               <p>The next thing they who undertake a War ought to observe, is Secresie and Expedition in their designs: It is a perilous weakness in a State to be slow of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in the time of War: such Affairs attend not time. Let the wise Statesman therefore abhor delays, and resolve rather what to do than what to say. Slow
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62313:11"/>
deliberations are symptoms either of faint Spirits, or weak Forces, or false Hearts.</p>
               <p>In War more than any other profession the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ought to be single. For though you have many Armies in the Field, yet ought you to appoint one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to have the absolute command over the rest of your Generals.</p>
               <p>And there ought to be a special care in making choice of an able General. For an able General will make choice of good Officers, and such as are fit for VVar: but a General that is not experienced in the Wars, if he meet with good Commanders, it is by hazard. This advantage also you will find by having an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and well reputed man to your General, that the Officers and Souldiers of your Army will fight with much the more resolution, and confidence of Victory; and your Enemy will fight with the less resolution and hopes of Victory. For good Officers will make good Souldiers, and good Souldiers are as necessary to a VVar as good store of Gold. And therefore those that undertake a VVar, must not always measure their Power by their Treasure, but they must put the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Souldiers in the balance with their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Before you undertake a VVar, cast an impartial eye upon the Cause. If it be just, prepare your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and let them all know they fight for God. This addeth fire to the Spirit of a Souldier, to be assured that he shall either prosper in a fair VVar, or perish in a just Cause.</p>
               <p>You must be most vigilant and careful to have all your Magazines doubly provided, that if any disaster befal your Armies, you may soon supply them again. He that would be in VVar victorious, must be in Peace laborious. You must likewise be very punctual
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62313:11"/>
in sending supplies of Mony, Men, and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries to your Army. For the want of any one supply many times coming too late proveth the loss of the whole design; and in no profession the loss of time proveth so dangerous as in Martial Affairs.</p>
               <p>You must not be apt to judge of your Generals Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to the Event, but according to Reason; and not to lay the fault of your Armies ill success upon your General, when it lieth in your selves, either for want of necessaries, or timely supplies, or by bridling the Authority of your General too much. Besides, if a General be never so wise, and diligent, he cannot foresee every thing that may break, and cross all that which he had purposed. For it is a Piece of Divine Power to direct a path free from the crookedness which might lead the straight way to happy ends: and it were as great a madness to believe that a man were able to give directions to meet with all chances, as to think no foresight can prevent any casualty.</p>
               <p>If you intend to have a well-commanded Army, you must pay them punctually, and then your General can with Justice punish them severely.</p>
               <p>You must foresee that your Frontier Towns be well Fortified, well Manned, and well Victualled before your Army taketh the Field.</p>
               <p>You ought not to neglect rewarding those, that do you eminent Service; for by it you bind them to be faithful to you, and you encourage them to do the like Service upon another occasion, and encourage others to be ambitious of the same honour. You must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be careful that the honour of such as have done brave Actions and great Services be not diminished nor blemished. Because the most generous Spirits (which will easily excuse all want of other recompence for their Services) will never endure this, to be robbed of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62313:12"/>
honour due to their brave actions, and will sooner sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach such a want of due honour, than any other thing whatsoever; whereupon very often great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs have followed.</p>
               <p>You must not be too confident in the Arm of Flesh, and in your Victories; give not too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to your Armies, and too little praise to God. Use all the lawful means you can for the executing of your designs, and by your Prayers recommend he success to God, and the good conduct of your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral The Senate of the Romans reserved nothing else to themselves, but a power to make new Wars, and to confirm Peace: every thing else they referred to the arbitrement, and power of the Consul. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that there were in the Senate men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well experienced in the Wars; yet forasmuch as they were not upon the place, and therefore igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of very many particulars, which were needful for them to know that will advise well, and by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Counsels they would have committed many errors: For this cause they suffered the Consul to do all of himself, and that the Glory thereof should be entirely his; the love of which they thought would provoke and encourage him to do well.</p>
               <p>It is a great vanity and indiscretion in a Prince, or State in matter of War to undertake many enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes at once.</p>
               <p>It is better for two weak Kingdoms rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with an Enemy to some loss, than seek for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by the Sword; lest while they two weaken themselves by mutual blows, a third decide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie to both their ruines. When the Frog and the Mouse could not take up the Quarrel, the Kite was Umpire.</p>
               <p>You ought to be careful you have no Officer in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62313:12"/>
chief that is covetous, or given to pillaging. For such men are good to no body, but themselves and the Enemy; and are most commonly easily corrupted with mony. Such men ought by no means to be made Governours of Towns.</p>
               <p>No Prince or State ought to doubt but that they may be able to make good Souldiers, when they want not men. For if they have many men, and want Souldiers, they should rather complain of their own Sloth, and small Wisdom, than of the peoples Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Some Observations, and Considerations to be observed, and thought on by a General, that taketh upon him the Command of an Army.</head>
               <p>HE that undertaketh the Command of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ought seriously to consider the hazards of this Charge, and the difficulties, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his own abilities well before he adventureth on it: Because if he groweth rich, he is traduced; if he fail, or prove unfortunate, he is calumniated, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized: And if the whole success answereth not their opinions who imploy him, they will repine, although the fault most often is caused by their own neglect, or wilfulness, or by curbing the Authority of their chief Commander too much. And people are always
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62313:13"/>
apt to judge of their Generals Actions rather by the event than reason. So that it is a very hard thing for a man to take the Command of an Army upon him, and to keep his reputation unto the end. Therefore no General ought to undertake any design timorously, or rashly; but such Actions as he foreseeth by his wisdom, and experience, that his Master, or Masters purse, or purses, and his own abilities be sufficient to go through with Victory and Honour.</p>
               <p>The first thing that a General ought to do, is to desire God to assist him in all his Councils and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to beseech him to give him and his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Courage in the day of Battel: For it is he who maketh our Enemies flee before us. It is he setteth up Kings, and Kingdoms, and pulleth them down at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>A General of an Army must make it his principal aim to begin well: and then not to omit any thing for the preserving of what he hath gotten. He ought to be provident in taking care for Mony, Men, Arms, Victuals, Ammunition, a good train of Artillery, with all things necessary belonging to it; Cloaths, Shoes, Stockings, and Shirts: He must foresee and provide that none of all these things fail him in the execution of his Designs. And he must be careful to make choice of knowing, and valiant Officers for his Army. For you may observe in all the Roman Wars, that they conquered more Nations by their expert knowledge in Martial Affairs, than they did either by their Number or Valour. It hath been the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all famous Generals to bring their Souldiers to perfection by exercise.</p>
               <p>A General ought carefully to observe these three things in his Martial Discipline, to recompence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Actions, to punish the bad, and constantly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62313:13"/>
to use the exact exercise of Military Discipline. He must never suffer his Souldiers in any place to be idle, especially when the Army is brought together in a Body: for if he employ them not in that which is good, they will busie themselves in that which is naught.</p>
               <p>It is the height of a provident Commander not only to keep his own designs undiscoverable to his Enemy, but likewise to be studious in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his. He that can best do the one, and nearest guess at the other, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the next step to a Conquerour: but he that failed in both, must either ascribe his Overthrow to his own folly, or his Victory to the hand of Fortune. He that is a Chief Commander ought to know that if he will be secure in War, he must be watchful and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant: and that expedition and secresie crowneth all warlike exploits with Success and Glory: and that the opportunity of time is the Mother of all worthy Exploits.</p>
               <p>In the course of War a General shall meet with some occasions, wherein he is not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with Men, but with Chances and Things, which are to be overcome with less difficulty, than an Enemy, and are more dangerous, as Hunger, Discontents, and Labour. Things well and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily atchieved do get the Commander great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will from the Souldier, and things ill carried as much hatred. Wherefore a General should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prefer courses of security before those of haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and trust Fortune no farther, than necessity constraineth him. <hi>Caesar</hi> thought it not best to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62313:14"/>
tempt the waywardness of Fortune, when by other means he might obtain his desires: and a wise General should always rather follow Reason than Fortune.</p>
               <p>War is not capable of a second Error; one fault being enough to ruine an Army: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a General ought to be careful even of possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, accounting always that which may happen, to be as certain as any thing which he doth most expect. A Generals Counsels should not pass ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation through his own judgment alone, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should they be communicated to more than is needful, neither are they to be hastned forwards with passion, but ought oft to be maturated with staid deliberation. Likewise he is to take special care that no humorous respect do hinder that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution which true judgment approveth. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falleth out that either particular profit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful pleasures, desire of revenge, or some other unseasonable affection doth so intangle them in their proceedings, as they never attain to the main drift of the action: and this is called <hi>Stumbling by the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A General must be careful not to measure the humour of his poor, needy, and undisciplined Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by the garb of his own ambitious thoughts; and so lay such projects of difficulty as were very unsuitable in the particularity of occurrences, to that which his Souldiers were fit to execute: Neither should he be so prodigal of his Souldiers Blood, as though men were made only to fill Ditches, and to be the woful executioners of his rashness.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62313:14"/>
Of all Victories a General should think that best, which is least stained with Blood.</p>
               <p>It is requisite in a General to mingle love with the severity of his Discipline. They that cannot be induced to serve for love, will never be forced to love for fear: Because love openeth the heart, fear shutteth it; that encourageth, this compelleth: And Victory meeteth encouragement, but flieth compulsion. If thou art called to the Dignity of a Commander, dignifie thy place by thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and that thou mayest be the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Commanding others, practise upon thy self. A Chief Commander ought to know that that Command is best, and most sure, when the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier rejoyceth in his Obedience.</p>
               <p>What Souldiers earn with the hazard of their lives, if not enjoyed, prophesieth an overthrow to the next Battel.</p>
               <p>A General shall rule much, if Reason rule him.</p>
               <p>A General ought to use his best endeavours, to buy good success with extraordinary labour. For Industry commandeth Fortune, saith <hi>Caesar.</hi> And there is no doubt but diligence, and laboursome industry by circumspect and heedful carriage sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail, either by hap or cunning, to make good that part, wherein the main point of the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth. And where the Lions skin will not serve his turn, there let him take part of the Foxes to piece it out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62313:15"/>It is a dangerous thing for a General to make himself chief in perswading a Prince, or State to any weighty and important resolution, so that the counsel thereof be wholly imputed to him, which belongs to many. For inasmuch as men judge of things by their events, of all the evils that rise thereupon, the blame will be wholly laid upon him as Author: and if good come of it, he is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it; but the reward cometh much short of the loss which is hazarded. The Sultan <hi>Selimus,</hi> termed the great Turk, having made preparation (as some report) for the Conquest of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> was encouraged by one of his Bashaws, who was then upon the Confines of <hi>Persia,</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take rather an Expedition against the <hi>Sophy:</hi> By whose counsel the Sultan was perswaded, and went to that enterprize with an exceeding great Army. But coming into a very vast Country, where a great part of it is desert, and very few Rivers, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there those difficulties which long since had ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined many Roman Armies, was so distressed, that he lost most of his Army by Famine and Plague. Wherefore (however in the War he was vanquisher) he caused the Bashaw, Author of that counsel, to be put to death.</p>

               <p>AN Army of thirty or forty thousand men Trained, well Disciplined, carefully Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and still recruited upon all occasions, may destroy an Army four times as great. Because great Armies for want of Victuals oftentimes destroy themselves.

               <p>Where your Service lieth in Campagnia, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of your Army ought to be two Footmen to one Horseman, besides your Dragooners.

But for your Body of Foot, when your Service shall chiefly consist in the Campagnia, then you ought to have as many Pikemen as Musqueteers amongst your Foot, besides your Dragooners. But where your Service lieth most in Sieges, there you ought to have in your Body of Foot besides your Dragoons two Musqueteers to one Pikeman: and to every eight hundred Horse you ought to have an hundred and fifty Dragooners. And always to an Army of twenty thousand, or thirty thousand men, you ought to have a thousand Pioners; whereof an hundred ought to have horses, as a necessary part of the Army upon a March, a retreat, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off Cannon in a Battel, and at Sieges. I do not mean that these Pioners shall be entertained to make the Souldiers lazy: For each Souldier ought to know what belongeth to his labour for his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pay, that is, to pass upon his Duty punctually, and willingly, namely to March, Watch, Fight, and intrench himself, and to be ready to endure with Obedience and Patience, Labour, Hunger, Cold, and Heat.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Some Observations concerning the Arming of an Army, and how each Souldier ought to be Armed.</head>
               <p>ONE of the greatest advantages that I know which can be taken in War by a Chief Commander, is to endeavour to have his Army better armed than his Enemies Army, both with Offensive Arms, and Defensive Arms. Arms are the security of your own Souldiers, the terror of the Enemy, and the assured ordinary means of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. And this is certain, that the most warlike Nations, and most Victorious, have always sought to get advantage of their Enemies by advantage of Arms. The end of Arms is either to assault, or defend; and hence are Arms divided into two kinds, Offensive and Defensive. Offensive Arms are to do execution upon your Enemy; and Defensive Arms raise the Spirits, stirre up desire to fight, make the Souldier bold, and chearful to perils. And whereas the Defensive Arms of Horse-men and Pike-men are much slighted by some in these times, I would have such to know, that Souldiers ought to go into the Field to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and not to be killed. And I would have our young Gallants to take notice, that men wear not Arms because they are afraid of danger, but because they would not fear it. And I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62313:17"/>
that one Army well armed with Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Arms, may very well expect without any great difficulty to win twenty Battels one after another of Armies equal in strength, equally conducted, and fighting upon equal advantage of ground, but not armed with Defensive Arms. So much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage do I suppose to be between Armies that are armed, and Armies that are not armed with Defensive Arms.</p>
               <p>I will now shew you how Horsemen, Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Dragooners ought to be armed with Offensive and Defensive Arms.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>An Horsemans Offensive Arms are these.</head>
                  <p>A Carbine, or a Musquet-barrel of the length of a Carbine-barrel, well stockt with a Snapance: the which I hold to be much better then a Carbine for Service. Also a case of Pistols, and a good stiff long Tuck, and a Belt.</p>

                  <p>An Head-piece with three small iron Bars to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Face, Back, and Breast; all three Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol-proof: a Gauntlet for his left hand, or a good long Buff Glove. A Girdle of double Buff about eight inches broad, which is to be worn under the skirts of his Doublet, and to be hooked unto
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62313:17"/>
his Doublet, and made so that it may be fastned together before. If you find Buff to be scarce and dear, you may make those Girdles of Buff before spoken of with Bull Hides, or good Oxes Hides, dressed like Buff.</p>

                  <head>The Furniture that belongeth to an Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Horse is as followeth.</head>
                  <p>He ought to have a very good Horse, and a good Pad-Saddle made, so that it may very well carry a Case of Pistols, three good Girts, a pair of good Stirrups, and Stirrup-leathers; with a Crupper, and a Fore-Pattern: also a good Bitt, Rains, and Head-stall, with a good leathern Halter.</p>
                  <p>I have omitted here to speak any thing of the Armour of a good Cuirassier, because there are not many Countries that do afford Horses fit for the Service of Cuirassiers: But where Horses are to be had fit for that Service, there a General ought to have two thousand of them in his Army.</p>

                  <head>The Offensive Arms of a Musqueteer are these.</head>
                  <p>A Musquet and Rest, and a good stiff Tuck not very long, a Belt, a pair of Bandaliers; but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62313:18"/>
you must be careful that the Charges be not made too big, which is a great and common fault now adays. Also every Musqueteer ought to have a Scourer to make clean his Musquet: For he must be very careful in keeping his Musquet clean, or else it will be very apt to break up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Service, by means of which neglect I have known many Souldiers spoiled.</p>

                  <head>The Defensive Arms of a Musqueteer is a good Courage.</head>
                  <p>But in case you have more Musqueteers than you have Pikes, so many Musqueteers as you have more than Pikemen in your Army ought to have Swine-feathers with heads of rests fastned to them. My reason for it is this, your Pikemen will be able with ease to shelter from the violence of the Horse so many Musqueteers as they are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and these Musqueteers which have the Swine-Feathers being imployed by themselves, will be able likewise to defend themselves from the Horse, with the help of their Swine-Feathers.</p>

               <p>The Marshal of the Field receiveth Orders from the General; the Major-General of the Horse, and the Major-General of the Foot receive their Orders from the Marshal of the Field; the Serjeant-Majors of the Brigades from their Serjeant-Major-General;

to be of an hundred and fifty in strength, besides Officers, and each Troop of Dragooners ought to have six Serjeants.</p>

               <p>IT cannot be denied but Warlike Discipline, and good Fortune were the raisers of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire.

For upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Practice is grounded the Frame of sound and perfect skill. <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaketh this of the Victory which the <hi>Thebans</hi> had against the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians;</hi> the <hi>Thebans</hi> till that day had no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Some Observations concerning a Train of Artillery, and him that Commandeth it.</head>
               <p>THE General of the Ordnance ought to be a man generally experienced in all parts of Martial Discipline, especially in all parts of the Mathematicks, and in Gunnery. It is a place of great Honour, and much Trouble, and requireth much experience, and a great deal of care, and foresight for executing the place well. The General of the Ordnance ought to choose an able man to be a Lieutenant of the Ordnance, and to take care that the chief Engineer be an able man, and also the inferiour Engineers. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Gunner ought to be a very able man, and the inferiour Gunners very good. The General of the Ordnance must likewise foresee that there be a skilful Fire-work-Master; and that he be not only
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62313:21"/>
skilful, but valiant, and able to put his skill in execution. Likewise there ought to be provided good Battery-Masters, and works Basis's. To setd own every particular thing, and the Officers that belong to a Train of Artillery, would require the labour of writing a Book by it self. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will but touch on some particular things, and places, and leave the rest to the care of the General of the Ordnance, to make choice of such Officers as a Train of Artillery requireth, and he will have need of; and to provide for every thing in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, according unto the designs that he shall take in hand.</p>
               <p>The General of the Ordnance ought to give special Order to his Master-Gunner, that such Guns as he maketh choice of for his Train, be diligently tried by him, whether they be true boared, or whether they have their full Metal: and that all the Field-Pieces that are made choice of for the Train be ten or twelve Foot long. The which you will find to be of great advantage in fighting a Battel with your Enemy, whose Field-pieces are not so long. All your Pieces of Battery ought to have Block-Carriages, besides their other Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and to each Piece of Battery two thick planks three inches thick, and sixteen or eighteen inches broad, and fourteen foot in length. The which planks may be easily carried upon your spare Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages: and these planks will be always ready at hand, and save planking of your Batteries. You ought to have the powder for your Cannon to be made up into Carthrages for all your Cannon; and this way you will find less dangerous, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62313:22"/>
much quicker for service, than the charging of them with Ladles. The Waggons that carry your Powder, ought to be planked with thin planks on the sides, and over at top. Then you may have Locks set on them, and keep them locked; by which means a Rogue will not be able easily to fire your Powder upon a March.</p>
               <p>It were very fit the Lieutenant of the Ordnance, the Commissary of the Victuals, and the Master of the Fireworks should have Companies of Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, or Snapances of an hundred and fifty apiece; the which Companies will serve to guard the Train upon a March, and at night in their Quarters, and free the Army from that Duty, and be very ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable upon divers other occasions. Cannon is a great clog to an Army upon a March, but an Army which hath none, can do no great Service: and therefore in these times the Artillery is an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part of an Army.</p>
               <p>It is very fit a General of the Ordnance should have belonging to his Train some certain number of Boats, or Punts with Carriages to carry them on, for to make a Bridge over unpassable Rivers.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Some Observations, and Preparations to be observed by a General in Field-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: also concerning Intelligences and Spies.</head>
               <p>AS soon as a General can get Provisions for his Horse, it will be most advantageous for him to have all things in a readiness to take the Field. For if he take the Field before his Enemy, he preventeth the Enemy of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. A General ought to be careful before he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Field with his Army, that he provide for the punctual supplying of his Army with Mony, Ammunition, Victuals, Arms, Men, Shoes, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Shirts: And seeing it is impossible for an Army upon a March to carry with them sufficient of all these necessaries; therefore a General ought carefully to foresee, as he advanceth any way with his Army, that his Magazines for his Army be always so near him, and so well stored with such things as he shall have occasion to use, that his designs fail not for want of any of the aforesaid things. And he must be careful that his Enemy be never able to cut off his Provisions at any time, or his Retreat.</p>
               <p>A General or Chief Commander ought to see that he doth not ruine his Army upon disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62313:23"/>
either by engaging them unadvisedly in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, or by assaulting Towns, and Breaches rashly, or by long Sieges, or long Winter Services, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good probability, and assurance in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men to prevail. And he must take care always to joyn Judgment with Valour in all his Actions.</p>
               <p>A General ought carefully to lay hold on such occasions as offer themselves to defeat his Enemy; and judiciously observe to know when to fight, and when not.</p>
               <p>A good Commander ought wholly to avoid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, which being but of small moment may only produce evil effects in his Army. For to begin a Skirmish, or a Combate, wherein the whole Forces are not imployed, and yet the whole fortune is there laid to stake, is a thing savouring too much of rashness: And yet I hold it fit that wise and experienced Commanders when they meet with a new Enemy that is of Reputation, before they come to joyn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Battel, should cause their Souldiers to make trial of them by some light Skirmishes; to the end, that beginning to know them, and to have to deal with them, they may be rid of that Terror which the Report and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of these men have put them in. And this part in a General is of exceeding great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for these small experiences made by the Souldiers will cause them to cast off that terror, which by means of the Enemies Reputation had possessed them. Thus <hi>Livy</hi> saith, that <hi>Valerius Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi> was sent by the <hi>Romans</hi> to make some small
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62313:23"/>
Skirmishes with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> that a new War, and a new Enemy might not affright them: But a good Commander must be very careful that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing arise, which upon any accident may take away the Courage, and Hearts of his Souldiers. Now that which may be of force to take away their Courage, is to begin with loss. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Commander should be very careful how he engageth any of his Troops in small Skirmishes; and that he send no parties out of his Army upon any occasion, without taking care that they be commanded by good Commanders: and that the Officers that Command such Parties have Order not to engage themselves with the Enemy, unless they have some certain hopes of Victory. Nor ought he to undertake to guard any passages, where he cannot bring his whole Army together. Nor should he keep any Towns, unless it be those, upon loss whereof his utter ruine followeth. And those that he guardeth, he should take such care both for their Defences, and also with his Army, that when-ever the Enemy hath any design to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail them, he may make use of all his Forces to the rescue of them.</p>
               <p>If you have any certain hopes of starving your Enemy, or putting him to a retreat for want of Provisions, your securest way then will be not to fight with him, especially if your Enemy be of equal strength with you, or stronger than you are.</p>
               <p>If a Commander in Chief discovereth his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Foot to be lodged in their night Quarters in a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62313:24"/>
Campagnia with their Carriages, it were good then to charge them in the night with so many Horse, as you shall think fit in several places; and leave part of your Horse and Dragoons to make good their retreat upon occasion. If it falleth so out that your Horse cannot totally rout your Enemies Foot, let them have Order to fire their Ammunition, and so retreat.</p>
               <p>It is very fit a General should often command his Horse and Dragoons to fall upon his Enemies outermost Horse-Quarters. The which is one of the readiest, easiest, and securest ways that I know of to break an Enemies Army.</p>
               <p>A General is not so much blamed for making trial of an ill-digested project, as he will be for the obstinate continuing in the same. Therefore the speediest leaving of any such enterprise doth excuse the rashness, which might be imputed to the beginning.</p>
               <p>Difficulties of extremity are never better cleared, than by adventurous and desperate undertaking. And hence groweth the difference between true Valour, and fool-hardy Rashness, being but one and the same thing, if they were not distinguished by the subject, wherein they are shewed. For to run headlong into strange adventures upon no just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, were to shew more levity, than discretion: and again, to use the like boldness in cases of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, deserveth the opinion of vertuous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
               <p>A General should always be careful so soon as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62313:24"/>
he cometh out of the Field to visit his Frontier Towns, and take with him some of his best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and some of his choice Engineers, and to see what Fortifications his Frontier Towns want, and to give order for the repairing of such wants: and likewise to take care that the Magazines be furnished with a years provision, and that he give especial Command to the Governours of his Frontier Towns to be careful by their vigilance and good itnelligence to prevent sudden surprises, and valiantly to defend their Towns, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to dispose of their provisions in case they should be besieged.</p>
               <p>Concerning Spies you must be always suspitious of them; because as it is a dangerous task for him that undertaketh, so it is also for him that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them: And that Spies may not agree to give false advice, they should be examined severally, that by the agreement or disagreement of their advices, you may judge whether they be good: and by the verification of those which speak true or false, you shall know who betrayeth you, or doth you true Service. But this is not all, to beware of your own Spies; you must also take heed of those of the Enemy, which you must pre-suppose you have in your Camp For this reason, besides the secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie which must be used in all enterprises, it is good to give a charge by publishing (in a still way) that you have a quite contrary design to that which you purpose to put in execution; that so these Spies may report it to the Enemy. But the most effectual means to be well served by these kind of men, is to be very liberal to them; for they are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62313:25"/>
faithful to those who give them most. A General must take care that he have continually Spies in the Enemies Army, to know when his Enemy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and what condition his Enemies Army is in; and he ought to have in every Frontier Town of his Enemy some correspondence with some Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dweller, or Souldier of the Garrison, that by them he may understand from time to time what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition his Enemies Garrisons are in. And if the Enemy draweth any Forces to an head at any of his Frontier Towns, let the aforesaid people give the Governour of your next Garrisons notice of it. You ought to know that Intelligence is the most powerful means to undertake brave Designs, and to avoid great Ruines: and it is the chiefest Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon which all Generals do ground their Actions.</p>
               <p>A General that Commandeth an Army, and seeth that for want of Mony he cannot keep them long together, is unwise if he ventureth not his Fortune before his Army falleth asunder: For by delaying he certainly loseth; whereas hazarding he might overcome. Another thing there is yet much to be accounted of, which is, that a man ought (even in his losing) seek to gain Glory by being overcome by force, than by any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.</p>
               <p>The principal Heads of War for Field-Service, are the Art of Marching, Incamping, Imbatteling, and to know the ways how to procure good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and providently and skilfully to get Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions fit for his Army, and his Designs, and not

               <p>It is necessary in War oftentimes to change Counsels according to the variety of the accidents.</p>
               <p>In execution of Designs of War, good judgment ought to ground them, and diligent expedition put them into Act on For the least fault or stay that a man commiteth may give leasure, and occasion for the Enemy to provide, that all the plots, and counsels how good soever shall serve to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> What strength Divisions of Horse ought to be from four thousand to ten thousand, when they are to March in an Army, and when they are to Fight a Battel; or if Foot be to Fight on the Flanks of each Division of Horse, or when they come to be Embattelled to Fight on the Flanks of an Army. That small Divisions both of Horse and Foot are much better than great Divisions for Service either in Campagnia, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Enclosures; because they are not so apt to fall into Disorder, and are much more ready to be commanded upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</head>
               <p>AN Army which is imbattelled in small Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of Horse and Foot, is not so easily routed as that Army which is imbattelled in great Divisions. And small Divisions are much more ready than great Divisions: for besides se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding one another, and wheeling upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, they will likewise out-front an Army which is imbattelled in great Divisions: The which is one of the greatest advantages that can be taken in the imbattelling of an Army. Also
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62313:26"/>
small Divisions of Horse and Foot are much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier for Service, where you cannot imbattel them according to the rules of Art, by the nature of the place, or within inclosures, or where the brevity of the time will not give you leave. To conclude, an Army that is imbattelled in small Divisions is much more troublesome for an Enemy to deal withal, than an Army that is imbattelled in great Divisions.</p>
               <p>It is most convenient, and ready to have your Divisions of Horse and Foot, to March at the same strength, or some ten or twelve men more in a Division, than you intend to fight them in a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: by this means your Army will be much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and sooner imbattelled upon all occasions. If you fight your Horse in a day of Battel on the Flanks of your Body of Foot (which is the usual way of placing the Horse:) and if you intend to Skirmish in the day of Battel with a small Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Foot on each flank of each Division of Horse (which I hold to be the best and strongest way of imbattelling your wings of Horse) provide always that your Musqueteers in each Division of Foot, that are to Skirmish on the flanks of each Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Horse in a Day of Battel, be so ordered that they may be sheltred by Pikes from the Force of the Enemies Horse. And in what order the two Divisions of Foot shall fight in a Day of Battel on the flanks of each Division of Horse, so as to have the Musqueteers sheltered by the Pikes from the force of the Enemies Horse, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated unto you in the following figures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62313:27"/>If your strength of Horse be four thousand, and if they be to fight on the flanks of a Body of Foot, and each division of Horse to have a division of Foot fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on each flank, then each Division of Horse ought to be forty in front, and three deep; and so the strength of each Division of Horse will be an hundred and twenty. If your strength of Horse be five thousand, then each Division of Horse ought to be an hundred and fifty strong, fifty in front, and three deep. If your strength of Horse be six thousand, or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, then ought you to have an hundred and eighty in a Division, sixty in front, and three deep. And of this strength (as is aforesaid) ought your Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Horse to be. If you intend to fight Foot on the flanks of each Division of Horse in a Battel, the Divisions of Foot that shall fight on each flank of each Division of Horse, shall be in strength twelve files of Pikes, and twelve files of Musqueteers, which in all make a Body, or a Division of an hundred forty four men. And on the flanks of each Division of Horse, when you come to imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel them to fight, you must place a Division of Foot of an hundred forty four men, half Pikes and half Musqueteers. The order how the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Horse and Foot shall march together when they come near an Enemy, and how they shall imbattel, and skirmish, shall be demonstrated in the following Figures. The Divisions of Foot before spoken of, will serve to fight on the flanks of any Division of Horse of what strength you please to have them.</p>
               <p>In the first place, for your better understanding of this new way of Discipline (the which I am
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62313:27"/>
well assured you will find very serviceable and advantageous against an Enemy, if you make use of it) I will demonstrate unto you in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Figure, in what order a Division of Horse, and two Divisions of Foot shall stand ready to march, to be imbattelled when occasion shall serve. The which order must be observed by all the rest of the Divisions. By this means you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how all the rest of the Divisions of Horse and Foot that are to fight on the flanks of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in a day of Battel may be ordered for a march, and to be in readiness to be imbattelled, when an Army cometh near the Enemy.</p>
               <p>These Figures following lettered with <hi>A B C D E F G,</hi> shew you the order of the Divisions of Horse and Foot (I mean those Divisions of Horse and Foot that are to be imbattelled together in a day of Battel on the flanks of the Body of Foot) to be ready to march when occasion shall serve, or to be imbattelled. And this order which shall be here set down for this one Division of Horse figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Letter <hi>A</hi> in the following Figure, and the two Divisions of Foot figured with the Letters <hi>B C D E F G,</hi> the same order ought to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved after the same manner for a march when you come near an Enemy. By this means your Army will be much the sooner imbattelled upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and always in a readiness to receive your Enemy: if so be your Divisions of Horse and Foot, when they march, be of the same strength as you desire to have them when they are imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled to fight, and that you march your Divisions of Horse and Foot by Brigades as you do intend to fight them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Figure before, figured with the letter <hi>A,</hi> standeth for a Division of Horse; the order that they are in, in rank and file, is their order. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures figured with <hi>B C D E F G,</hi> are small Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of Foot, the which shall be at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in this following observation: the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they stand at in rank and file, is their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>viz.</hi> three foot in file, and six in rank. The distance of ground between the Divisions of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queeteers <hi>D F</hi> and the Division of Horse <hi>A,</hi> is thirty paces, three feet to the pace. And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of ground of thirty paces between the two Divisions of Musqueeters <hi>D F,</hi> and the Division of Horse marked with the letter <hi>A</hi> ought to be when the Divisions of Horse and Foot are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battelled to fight. The distance of ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Division of Musqueteers, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of Pikes is twelve Footmen. Which are Pikes, and which are Musqueteers this following demonstration will declare unto you. The figure before, figured with the letter <hi>A,</hi> is a Division
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62313:28"/>
of Horse of threescore in front, and three deep; and in the strength of the Division is an hundred and eighty Horse. The figure with six files, and six ranks of small pricks figured with the letter <hi>C,</hi> is a Division of Musqueteers, in strength six and thirty, each small prick standing for a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteer. The figure figured with the Letter <hi>B</hi> with cross strokes, is a Division of Pikes of twelve files and six deep. The strength of the Division is seventy two Pikemen, and each stroke standing in way of a rank standeth for a rank of Pikes being twelve in rank; and each stroke standing in way of a file is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for a File six deep. The figure figured with the letter <hi>D</hi> is a Division of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Musqueteers of the same strength that the figure <hi>C</hi> is. The figures figured with the Letters <hi>E F G,</hi> are the same that <hi>B C D,</hi> and the little small strokes in the Front, Reer, and Flanks of the Divisions of Horse and Foot stand for Officers. When these two Divisions of Foot, and one of Horse are to march away by small sub-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, as the way will give leave; then the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand division of Foot figured with <hi>B C D</hi> is first to march away: next, the Division of Horse sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the Letter <hi>A,</hi> then the left-hand Division of Foot figured with the Letters <hi>E F G</hi> is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Division of Horse figured with the Letter <hi>A.</hi> You are to appoint to every Division of Horse two Divisions of Foot, like as you see in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer figure of <hi>A B C D E F G,</hi> if your Foot will hold out to do it. If you have not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as to do it, you ought not to fail to flank each Division of Horse in the Van-guard of your Army with two Divisions of Foot, as is set down in the former figure. And each Musqueteer of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62313:29"/>
those Divisions of Foot which are to be imbattel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the flanks of each Division of Horse ought to have, when they come to encounter with the Enemy, two pair of Bandaliers, or a pair of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliers, and a dozen of Charrages in each Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers Pocket. Likewise each Musqueteer ought to have twelve spare Botlets besides his Bandaliers furnished with Powder and Bullet: and each two Divisions of Foot ought to have a Powder-Bag full of Powder carried along with them. All the Divisions of Horse and Foot that are to be imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled together on the flanks of your Army in a day of Battel, for the Wings of your Battel being divided into Brigades, are to march after this order as is here set down for the marching of this one Division of Horse, and two of Foot when you are near an Enemy and marching towards him. This way of fighting Foot amongst Horse is much the stronger way of Imbattelling an Army in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then any other that I have either seen or read of: and hereafter in a fit place I shall shew sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for to prove it so to be.</p>
               <p>The following figure marked with the Letters <hi>HIKLMNO,</hi> shall shew you in what manner the Musqueteers in the two Divisions of Foot that are imbattelled on the flanks of each Division of Horse, as you see them in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing figure marked with the letters <hi>ABCDEFG,</hi> how, I say, the aforesaid Musqueteers shall be drawn into a fit Order to give fire on the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse or Foot upon any occasion.</p>
               <p>The words of Command that you are to give
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62313:29"/>
to the Musqueteers to bring them into the Order of the following Figures <hi>KLNO,</hi> from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the foregoing figures <hi>CDFG,</hi> are these words of Command which follow. Command the two first Ranks of the two Divisions of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers marked with the Letters <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> to march forwards till the two last ranks of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid two ranks of both the Divisions be twelve foot beyond the front of the Pikes, then command them to stand; then command the two ranks of Musqueteers that belong to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>C,</hi> to turn to their left hands, and the two ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>D,</hi> to turn to their right hands: then command these four ranks of Musqueteers, the which are now files, to march forwards till they meet. Then command those Musqueteers which before did turn to their right hands, to turn to their left hands, and those Musqueteers which did turn to their left hands, to turn to their right hands, and file even with the Pikes. Then command the two last ranks of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers of the two Divisions of Musqueteers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the letters <hi>CD,</hi> to turn to their right hands about, and march forward, till the two reer ranks of both the Divisions be twelve feet beyond the reer rank of Pikes in the Division of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>B.</hi> Then command the four ranks of Musqueteers to stand, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two ranks of Musqueteers that belong to the Division of Musqueteers marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>C,</hi> to turn to their right hands, and the two ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>D,</hi> to turn to their left hands. Then command the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62313:30"/>
four ranks of Musqueteers, which are now files, to march forwards, and meet in the reer of the Pikes. Then command those Musqueteers which did before turn to their right hands, to turn to their right hands again, and those Musqueteers which did turn to their left hands, to turn to their left hands again, and file even with the Pikes. Then command the two middlemost ranks of Musqueteers, which are left of both the Divisions of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D</hi> to march forward, and front even with the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers in the front of the Pikes. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Division of Horse marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>H</hi> to close their ranks and files to their close Order: and the Division of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>B,</hi> and the two ranks of Musqueteers, which are now in the reer of the Pikes, to close their ranks and files to their close order.</p>
               <p>The same words of Command and Order must be observed by the two Divisions of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>GF,</hi> as is here set down, and observed by the two Divisions of Musqueteers <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> And these words of Command which are here set down, will bring the former figure marked with the letters <hi>ABCDEFG,</hi> into the form and order of this following figure mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the letters <hi>HIKLMNOPQRS.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>By the words of Command which are before set down, the Musqueteers in the former figure marked with the letters <hi>ABCDEFG</hi> are brought into this order and form, as you see them in the figure marked with the letters <hi>HIKLMNOPQRS.</hi> Now what order this figure marked with the foregoing letters is in, I will here declare unto you.</p>
               <p>The Division of Horse marked with the letter <hi>H</hi> is threescore in front, and three deep, who are now at their close order in rank and file, the which is a foot and half in file, and six in rank. Likewise the two Divisions of Pikes marked with the letters <hi>I</hi> and <hi>O</hi> on the flanks, and the four ranks of Musqueteers in the reer of the Pikes marked with the letters <hi>L</hi> and <hi>Q</hi> are at their close order in rank and file, the which is one foot and an half in file, and three in rank. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the three ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>MKNRPS</hi> are at their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in rank and file; the which is three foot in file, and six in rank. These twelve ranks of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62313:31"/>
Musqueteers, which are in the front stand ready to advance with the rest of the Horse and Foot against an Enemy, and to be commanded to make ready, and give fire on the Enemies Horse or Foot, as occasion shall serve, as you see them in the figures marked with the letters <hi>M K N R P S.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When these twelve ranks of Musqueteers which are in the front, are commanded to give fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemy, you must command them to do it in this manner: Command the twelve ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>M K N R P S</hi> to make ready: being ready, command them to present, the which you must command them to do after this manner. Let the first six ranks of Musqueteers before spoken of present, kneeling upon their right knees; then let the six last ranks of the former twelve ranks of Musqueteers move up close to the first six ranks of Musqueteers which are presenting and kneeling on their right knees. Then command all the Musqueteers in the six last ranks to step forward with their right legs within the in-side of their Leaders right legs, and step forward with their left legs close up to their Leaders left legs without-side of their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers left legs, presenting their Musquet over their Leaders heads in the first ranks. The twelve ranks of Musqueteers marked with the Letters <hi>M K N R P S</hi> being thus presented as is here set down, command them to give fire together; and when they have given fire, command them to advance easily with the rest of the Foot and Horse, and make ready again, and give fire after
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62313:31"/>
the same manner again, as is before spoken of, and so often as you please. The four ranks of Musqueteers, which are in the reer of the two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of Pikes marked with the letters <hi>L</hi> and <hi>Q</hi> will serve, if any of your Musqueteers in the front shall be hurt or slain.</p>
               <p>Now I have shewed you how the Musqueteers in the Divisions of Foot, which are to fight on the flanks of each Division of Horse in a day of Battel, are to give fire on the Enemies Horse. I will now shew you in the next figure marked with the figures of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12, how the Musqueteers shall be sheltered by the Pikes from the Enemies Horse, when they shall charge the Divisions of Foot, which are on the flanks of each Division of Horse. But first I will set down the way how you shall bring the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers in the former figure marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>M N R S</hi> to the order as you shall see them in this following figure marked with the figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. You must command the two ranks of Musqueteers, six in front, and two deep on the right hand Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Foot marked with the letter <hi>M,</hi> to turn to their left hands, and command an Officer to lead them down on the right hand flank of the Division of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>I,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one foot and an half distance from the right hand file of the aforesaid Division of Pikes, until he bring the two men that were the left hand men of the two ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>M,</hi> even with the bringers up of the right hand file of the Division of Pikes marked
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62313:32"/>
with the Letter <hi>I.</hi> Then command them to turn to their right hands about, and close their ranks and files to their close order. After that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the two ranks of Musqueteers six in front, and two deep on the left hand of the aforesaid Division of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>N,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I say, those two ranks of Musqueteers to turn to their right hands, and command an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to lead them down on the left hand, on the left hand flank of the Division of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>I,</hi> keeping one foot and an half di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the left hand file of the Division of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>I,</hi> until he bringeth the two men that were the right hand men of the two ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>N</hi> even with the bringers up of the left hand file of the Division of Pikes marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>I.</hi> Then command the two files of Musqueteers (the which were before ranks) which you have drawn down on the left hand flank of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>I,</hi> to turn to their right hands about: then command them to close their ranks and files to their close order. The same order must be observed with the four ranks of Musqueteers, six in front and two deep, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the letters <hi>R</hi> and <hi>S</hi> on the right and left hand of the left hand Division of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>O,</hi> as is here before set down for the four ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>M</hi> and <hi>N.</hi> Then command the four ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>K</hi> and <hi>P</hi> to close their ranks and files to their close order. And these words of Command before set down will bring the former figure marked with the letters
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62313:32"/>
                  <hi>I K L M N O P Q R S</hi> to the order of this figure marked with the figures of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>By these words of Command before set down, you see the Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>M N R S P K</hi> in the figure before this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer figure, are now brought into this order, as you see them in this figure before marked with the figures of 5 6 11 12 9 3 under shelter of the Pikes: The Musqueteers and Pikes being at their close order standing in a readiness to receive a charge from Horse, and the Pikes to shelter the Musqueteers every way upon occasion from the force of the Horse. The figure marked with the figure 1, is a Division of Horse, threescore in front and three deep, being at their close order. The way how the Musqueteers shall be sheltred by the Pikes from Horse, I will here declare unto you: Command the two right hand files, and the two left hand files of the Division of Pikes marked with the figure 2 (the which Division of Pikes is twelve files of Pikes, and six deep) to charge to their right, and left hands: the two
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62313:33"/>
right hand files to the right hand, and the two left hand files of Pikes to the left hand over the shoulders of the Musqueteers on the right and left hand marked with the figures 5 and 6: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding these four files of Musqueteers marked with the aforesaid two figures to turn to their right and left hands. When the two right hand files, and the two left hand files of Pikes of the figure marked with the figure 2, are commanded to charge to the right and left hands, then command the other eight files of Pikes of the figure 2, which have not as yet charged their Pikes, I say, command the three first ranks of those eight files to charge their Pikes to the front over the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Musqueteers marked with the figure 3. Then command the three last ranks of Pikes of the eight files of Pikes to charge to the reer over the shoulders of the two ranks of Musqueteers marked with the figure 4. And these two ranks of Musqueteers in the reer marked with the figure 4 must observe to turn to their right hands about, when the Pikes are commanded to charge to the reer.</p>
               <p>The same Order and words of Command, the which are here set down for the right hand Division of Foot, marked with the figures 2 3 4 5 6 7 must be observed by the Officers of the left hand Division of Foot, marked with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures 7 8 9 10 11 12. The Musqueteers which are placed without-side of the Pikes marked with the figures 3 4 5 6 9 10 11 12 must stand ready with their Matches, Cocks, and Pans guarded, and ready to give fire either by one
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62313:33"/>
rank at a time, or two ranks, as the Officers shall see occasion to command them, which must be done after this manner: If you command only the outermost ranks to give fire, then must you command them to present kneeling on their right knees, and command them to level so low, that they shoot at the Horse legs, and by that means they will shoot clear under the tops of your Pikes being charged. If you please to command two ranks of Musqueteers to give fire at one time, the Musqueteers being ready to present command your Pikemen to port their Pikes: then command all your Musqueteers to present, the first rank of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers kneeling on their right knees, the second rank of Musqueteers must move up close to the first rank of Musqueteers, every Musqueteer in the second rank stepping forward with his right leg within the inside of their Leaders right legs, and step forwards with their left legs close up by their Leaders left legs without-side of their Leaders left legs, and so present their Musquets over their Leaders heads. After the Musqueteers in the first rank have thus presented, command them to give fire; then may you, if occasion serve, command your Pikemen to charge their Pikes again, and your Musqueteers to make ready again.</p>
               <p>But here some may object, that if any one of these two Divisions of Foot marked with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 should be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Horse several ways at once, then the four corners of the Division of Foot will be ill defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by reason that the two outermost files of Pikes to the right and left hand are charging to their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62313:34"/>
right and left hands; so by this means they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the four corners of the Division of Foot will be left naked for want of Pikes to defend them. To prevent this objection, the Captains, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and Serjeants ought to be placed on the four corners of a Division of Foot with the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, as you see them in this foregoing figure, marked with the figure 7. For you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that each little long stroke at the corners of the Division of Foot standeth for an Officer. Now all the Captains that command the Foot on the flanks of each Division of Horse in a day of Battel ought to have Pikes, and the Lieutenants and Serjeants ought to have Partizans and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts of eleven foot in length.</p>
               <p>In this Service against the Horse, are two chief things that the Commanders of the Foot who command any Foot amongst the Horse in a day of Battel ought to give their Souldiers a strict charge to observe: the first is, that the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers when they are to give fire should always take aim at the Horses legs. The second observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that your Pikemen charge their Pikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Horses, and not against the Horsemen, when the Foot are charged by Horse, and that your Pikemen charge not their Pikes, until the Enemies Horses are come within forty paces of your Foot.</p>
               <p>If you fight Foot among your Horse on the flank of your Army, as you see them placed in these two figures before marked with the letters <hi>HIKLMNOPQRS,</hi> and the figures
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62313:34"/>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. Then you must observe when your Enemies Horse come to charge your Horse, or the Foot on the flanks of your Division of Horse, that your Divisions of Horse move not from the two Divisions of Foot on their flanks (unless your Enemies Horse be put to the retreat) but to keep an even front, with the two Divisions of Foot on their flanks, and receive their Enemies Charge, keeping the aforesaid order. But in case your Enemies Horse rout any one of the Divisions of Foot on the flanks of any one Division of Horse, then the Commander of the Division of Horse, that is to march between two Divisions of Foot, must be in a readiness to Charge the Enemies Horse that hath routed his Foot, either with part of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Horse, or the whole, as he seeth occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or as he may with convenience.</p>
               <p>That your intention of fighting Foot amongst the Horse may not be discovered by your Enemy, who hath not been used to the like Discipline; or at least that he may not know the way and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that you intend to fight your Foot in, let your Divisions of Foot, which are to fight on the flanks of your Horse in a day of Battel, as you see them in the two former figures: let, I say, the two Divisions of Foot which belong to each Division of Horse, march in the reer of the Divisions of Horse, as you see them in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going figure, till they come within Musquet-shot of their Enemies Horse: then draw up the two Divisions of Foot, the one on the one flank of a Division of Horse, and the other on the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62313:35"/>
other flank of the same Division of Horse in the same order as you see them in this foregoing figure.</p>

               <p>IF your strength of Horse be three thousand, and if they be to fight on the flanks of a Body of Foot in a day of Battel without Foot to fight amongst them, then each Division of Horse ought to be thirty in front, three deep, and ninety in a Division.

thousand, or ten thousand, then ought each Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Horse to be an hundred in front, and three deep, and three hundred in a Division.</p>
               <p>Your Divisions of Horse from ninety to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty (if you have no Foot to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst your Horse) ought to charge their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse after this manner. Each Division of Horse from ninety to an hundred and eighty in strength ought to be sub-divided into three sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions, as is here set down, and shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto you by this following figure, marked with the letters <hi>A B C.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The three sub-divisions of Horse marked with the letters <hi>A B C</hi> are a Division of Horse of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, sub-divided into three equal sub-divisions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirty in a Division, ten in front, and three deep. The distance of ground between the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>division marked with the letter <hi>A,</hi> and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>division marked with the letter <hi>B,</hi> is twenty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, three feet to the pace. The like distance of ground is between the sub-divisions of Horse mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the letters <hi>B</hi> and <hi>C:</hi> the little strokes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62313:36"/>
that stand in the fronts, flanks, and reer of the three sub-divisions, stand for Officers.</p>
               <p>Now when the Van-guard of your Horse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth within fifty paces of the Enemies Horse, let the two sub divisions of Horse marked with the letters <hi>A</hi> and <hi>C</hi> advance towards their Enemies Division of Horse upon an easie trot: and the Officers of the two Divisions of Horse must be careful that they Charge all together the Division of the Enemies Horse which they meet with. And when the two sub-divisions on the right and left hand marked with the letters <hi>A</hi> and <hi>C</hi> do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards their Enemy to charge them, then let the middle sub-division of Horse marked with the letter <hi>B</hi> follow after easily upon a walking pace. And when the Officer in chief that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the middle sub-division of Horse marked with the Letter <hi>D,</hi> seeth the other two sub-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Horses marked with the letters <hi>A</hi> and <hi>C</hi> to be mingled with the Enemy; then let him command his sub-division of Horse to advance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a round trot, and charge his Enemy. The same order must be observed by all the Divisions of Horses that are but ninety in strength, when they come to charge an Enemy. And the Divisions of Horse from ninety to an hundred and eighty in strength must observe the same order in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Enemy, as is here set down in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Horse of ninety, marked with the letters <hi>A B C,</hi> if no Divisions of Foot be to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Horse.</p>
               <p>If you be eight thousand, nine thousand, or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62313:36"/>
ten thousand strong in Horse, then each Division of Horse, when you come to fight in Battel, ought to be three hundred in strength: and each Division of Horse ought to be sub-divided into five equal sub-divisions, as you see them in this following figure marked with the letters <hi>D E F G H.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>In these five sub-divisions of Horse marked with the letters <hi>D E F G H,</hi> there are sixty Horses in each sub-division, twenty in front, and three deep. So that the five sub-divisions marked with the letters <hi>D E F G H</hi> are a Division of Horse of three hundred in strength, sub-divided into five equal parts, and being at their close order in rank and file: And the little small strokes that you see in the flank, reer, and front, stand for Officers. The distance of ground that is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the sub-divisions marked with the letters <hi>D</hi> and <hi>E</hi> is twenty paces, three feet to the pace. And the distance of ground between the sub-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of Horse marked with the letters <hi>E</hi> and <hi>F</hi> is twenty paces. The same distance of ground is between the sub-divisions of Horse marked with the letters <hi>F</hi> and <hi>G,</hi> and <hi>G</hi> and <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62313:37"/>If you intend to have your Divisions of Horse to be three hundred in strength, my opinion is, that each Division of Horse ought to be sub-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into five equal parts, as you see them in this figure marked with the letters <hi>D E F G H.</hi> For these reasons a Division of Horse for three hundred in strength being divided into five equal parts, as you see them in this foregoing figure, will take up much more ground in front, than a Division of Horse that is but three hundred in strength, and not sub-divided. Now it is one of the chiefest advantages that can be taken in a day of Battel, by your Divisions of Horse to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front your Enemies Divisions of Horse.</p>
               <p>Besides, a Division of Horse of three hundred in strength being sub-divided, as is before set down, will be better commanded, and not so subject to fall into a disorder upon any occasion, as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Horse of three hundred in strength, all in a body.</p>
               <p>Moreover, you may charge an Enemy three several ways with a Division of Horse of three hundred in strength, being sub-divided as you see them in this foregoing figure; whereas you can charge an Enemy but one way with a Division of Horse of three hundred in strength, being all in one body.</p>
               <p>The first of the three ways to charge your Enemy with a Division of Horse of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in strength, and sub-divided, is in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; when a Division of Horse thus sub-divided
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62313:37"/>
into five equal parts cometh within forty paces of your Enemies Division of Horse which they are to charge; then let the two sub-divisions of Horse marked with the letters <hi>D</hi> and <hi>H</hi> advance, and charge their Enemies Division of Horse on the flanks; and then let the other three sub-divisions of Horse marked with the letters <hi>E F G</hi> advance, and charge their Enemy in the front of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision at the same time.</p>
               <p>The second way is this, when you come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forty paces of your Enemies Division of Horse, then command the three sub-divisions of Horse marked with the letters <hi>D <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> H,</hi> to advance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a trot, and charge their Enemy: then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the other two sub-divisions marked with the letters <hi>E</hi> and <hi>G</hi> to follow upon an easie pace, until they see that the three sub-divisions marked with the letters <hi>D F H</hi> be mingled with their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Then let the two sub-divisions marked with the letters <hi>E</hi> and <hi>G</hi> have order to advance upon a good round trot, and charge their Enemy.</p>
               <p>The third way of charging your Enemy, is, to command the five sub-divisions of Horse marked the letters <hi>D E F G H</hi> to charge the Enemy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an even front. And I account either of these three ways better to charge a Division of the Enemies Horse to rout them, than to charge a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Enemies Horse with a Division of three hundred Horse in one Body together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being sub-divided.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> By the following Figures are declared what Strength each Division of Foot ought to be to Fight a Battel, and Encounter with Foot: and the order that must be observed for doing the same; and how they shall easily, and readily be in order to defend themselves against the charge of any Horse.</head>
               <p>FOR Field-Service you must observe to have as many Pikes as Musqueteers amongst your Foot; and each Division of Foot ought to be two hundred eighty eight in strength, half Pikemen, and half Musqueteers; and you must rank your men but six deep: so that in the Division of two hundred eighty eight men, there will be four and twenty files of Pikes, and four and twenty files of Musqueteers, six deep. The order that they must be drawn into, to be in readiness to fight with Foot, and to defend themselves against Horse, shall be declared unto you by the following figures.</p>
               <p>But in the first place I will shew you the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that these four and twenty files of Pikes, and four and twenty files of Musqueteers must be drawn into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The first order that the aforesaid
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62313:38"/>
two hundred eighty eight men must be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is, as you shall see them in this following fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, marked with the figures 1 2 3; and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that they are at in rank and file is their Order.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The figure marked with the figure 1 is a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Pikes of four and twenty files, six deep. The six ranks of small pricks marked with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure 2 are a Division of Musqueteers consisting of twelve files, six deep: And the like are six ranks of pricks on the left hand of the Division of Pikes figured with the figure 3.</p>
               <p>Now the way that you must observe to bring these four and twenty files of Pikes, and four and twenty files of Musqueteers into the order, as you see them in the following figure marked with the letters <hi>A B C,</hi> is by these words of Command.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62313:39"/>
Command the three first ranks of Musqueteers of the two Divisions of Musqueteers marked with the figures 2 and 3 to march forward, till the last ranks of Musqueteers of both the Divisions of Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers have marched twelve feet beyond the first ranks of Pikes. Then command them to stand, and cause the three ranks of Musqueteers at the left hand to turn to their right hands, and the three ranks of Musqueteers on the right hand to turn to their left hands. Then command them to march forward, and joyn together before the Division marked with the letter <hi>A.</hi> Then command the Musqueteers, which before you commanded to turn to their left hands, now to turn to their right hands; and those Musqueteers that you comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before to turn to their right hands, command them to turn to their left hands. Then file the Musqueteers that you have brought before the front of the Pikes, even with the files of Pikes. Then command the other six ranks of Musqueteers on the right and left hand of the Division of Pikes to advance forwards, and front with the Musqueteers, which are in the front of the Pikes, leaving eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot distance between the Divisions of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers, marked with the letters <hi>C</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> and <hi>B</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> as you see them in this following figure, marked with the letters <hi>A B C D;</hi> and the distance that they are at in rank and file is their Order.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The figure marked with the letter <hi>A</hi> is a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Pikes consisting of four and twenty files, six deep. The three ranks of small pricks marked with the letter <hi>B</hi> are four and twenty files of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers, three deep. The three ranks of small pricks marked with the letter <hi>C,</hi> are twelve files of Musqueteers, three deep: the like are the three ranks of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>D.</hi> And the Musqueteers standing in this order as you see them in this foregoing figure, marked with the letters <hi>B C D</hi> are now in a readiness to give fire on an Enemy. Now the way that the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers must observe in firing on their Enemy is thus: Command both your Pikemen and Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers to shoulder their Arms, and march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the same order as you see them in the foregoing figure, marked with the letters <hi>A B C D,</hi> commanding the three Divisions of Musqueteers, marked with the letters <hi>B C D</hi> to make ready; and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62313:40"/>
when the Musqueteers are all ready, command the two first ranks of Musqueteers in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said three Divisions of Musqueteers to present. The three first ranks of the three Divisions of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>C B D</hi> must present kneeling upon their right knees. The second ranks of the aforesaid Divisions of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers must march up close to the three first ranks of Musqueteers which are presenting on their right knees; every Musqueteer in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond rank stepping forwards with their right legs within the in side of their Leaders right legs, and then step forwards with their left legs close up to their Leaders left legs, without-side of their legs, and present their Musquets over their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers heads in their first ranks. And after the two first ranks of Musqueteers of the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>C B D</hi> have thus presented, command them to give fire together And when these Musqueteers before spoken of have fired, let the three first ranks of the three Divisions of Musqueteers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the letters <hi>C B D</hi> remain kneeling on their right knees. Then command the second ranks of the three Divisions of Musqueteers to kneel upon their right knees, as close to their Leaders right knees as they can. Then command the last ranks of the three Divisions of Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers marked with the letters <hi>C B D</hi> to march up to their Leaders, stepping with their right legs within side of their Leaders right knees, and step forwards with their left legs without side their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers left legs, and present their Musquets over their Leaders heads, and then command them to give
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62313:40"/>
fire. After the last rank of the three Divisions of Musqueteers marked with the letters <hi>C B D</hi> have fired, command the two first ranks of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers of the aforesaid three Divisions of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers which are kneeling, to stand up; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding your Division of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>A,</hi> and the three Divisions of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers marked with the letters <hi>C B D</hi> to march on easily, and make ready again, and when they are ready, let them give fire in the same order as they did before. This order of marching and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fire must be observed by all the other Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Foot, that are to fight in the Body of an Army.</p>
               <p>Or if you approve not of the way of Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers firing, as is here set down, you may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divide them after the old manner, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to give fire.</p>
               <p>The order that this Division of foot marked with the letters <hi>A B C D</hi> must observe to defend themselves, against Horse is after this manner, as you shall see them placed in the next figure, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the way to bring the three Divisions of Musqueteers, and one of Pikes marked with the letters <hi>A B C D</hi> to the order of the figure following, marked with the figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is done after this manner.</p>
               <p>You must command the last rank of Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, of the Division of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>B,</hi> to turn to their right hands; then
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62313:41"/>
command an Officer to draw them away on one side of the right hand file of the Pikes, and draw them in between the third and fourth ranks of Pikes marked with the letter <hi>A.</hi> Then command your Pikemen to advance their Pikes, and close their files, and ranks to their close order. Then command the Division of Pikes to advance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, till they come within three feet of the last rank of Musqueteers which are in the front of the Pikes. Then command the two last ranks of the Division of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>C,</hi> to turn to their left hands. Then command the two last ranks of the Divisions of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>D</hi> to turn to their right hands. Then command two Officers to lead these four files of Musqueteers (which were before four ranks) into the reer of the Pikes marked with the letter <hi>A;</hi> the which four files are there to meet and joyn together in the reer of the Pikes. Then command those Musqueteers which did before turn to their left hands, to turn to their right hands; and those Musqueteers which before turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their right hands, to turn to their left hands. Then command the first rank of Musqueteers, which is only left of the Division of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>C,</hi> to turn to their left hands. Then command an Officer to lead them down close on the out-side of the right hand file of the Pikes; and when the Officer hath brought the Leader of the file of Musqueteers right against the bringer up of the right hand file of Pikes, command the file of Musqueteers to stand. Then command the half file of that file of Musqueteers to double his front to the left hand. Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62313:41"/>
those two files of Musqueteers to turn to their right hands about. Then command the first rank which is left of the Division of Musqueteers marked with the letter <hi>D,</hi> to turn to their right hands, commanding an Officer to lead them down close on the out-side of the left hand file of the Pikes: and when the Officer hath brought the Leader of the file of Musqueteers right against the bringer up of the left hand file of the Pikes, command the file of Musqueteers to stand. Then command the half file of that file of Musqueteers to double his front to the right hand. Then command those two files of Musqueteers to turn to their right hands about. Then command the Musqueteers which have not as yet closed their ranks and files, to close their ranks and files to their close order, and file and rank even with the Pikes.</p>
               <p>This which is here set down is the readiest, and easiest way to bring the former figure mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the letters <hi>A B C D</hi> unto the order of this figure following, marked with the figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

               <p>The figure marked with the figure 1, is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Pikes, consisting of four and twenty files, and three deep. The figure marked with the figure 2, is a Division of Pikes of the like number that the figure 1 is. The two ranks of small pricks in the front of the Pikes, figured with the figure 3, are two ranks of Musqueteers, having four and twenty in a rank. The two ranks of small pricks in the reer of the Pikes marked with the figure 4, are two ranks of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers, having four and twenty in a rank. The two files of pricks on the right hand of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Pikes, marked with the figure 5, are two files of Musqueteers, six deep: and the like are the two files of pricks on the left hand of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Pikes, marked with the figure 6. The little strokes at the corner of the Division of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62313:42"/>
Foot, marked with the figure 7, stand for Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. And the rank of small pricks between the two Divisions of Pikes marked with the figures 1 and 2, are one rank of Musqueteers consisting of four and twenty Musqueteers in number.</p>
               <p>You see in this figure marked with the figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, the Musqueteers standing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shelter of the Pikes, the Pikes and the Musqueteers being all at their close order, and in a readiness to receive a charge from Horse; and the Pikes sheltering the Musqueteers every way upon occasion from the force of the Horse.</p>
               <p>Now the way how these Musqueteers and Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men shall defend themselves against Horse, I will here declare unto you. If you perceive your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse to divide themselves into four parts to charge any one Division of Foot which is placed in this manner as you see them in this foregoing figure: then command the two right hand files of Pikes, and the two left hand files of Pikes of the six ranks of Pikes marked with the figures 1 and 2, to charge to their right and left hands over the shoulders of the Musqueteers on the right and left hand, marked with the figures 5 and 6. Command also the four files of Musqueteers, marked with the aforesaid two figures, to turn to their right and left hands. When the two right hand files of Pikes are commanded to charge to their right and left hands, then command the other twenty files of Pikes in the first three ranks of Pikes, marked with the figure 1, to Charge to the front over the shoulders of the Musqueteers, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62313:43"/>
with the figure 3. Then command the twenty files of Pikes marked with the figure 2 to Charge to the reer over the shoulders of the two ranks of Musqueteers in the reer marked with the figure 4. And the aforesaid Musqueteers must observe to turn to their right hands about, when the Pikes are commanded to charge to the reer.</p>
               <p>The Musqueteers which are placed without-side of the Pikes, marked with the figures 3 4 5 and 6, must stand ready with their Matches, Cock, and Pans guarded, and to be ready to give fire either by one rank at a time, or two ranks, as the Officers shall see occasion to command them; the which must be done after this manner. If you command only the outermost ranks of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers to give fire, then must you command them to present kneeling on their right knees, and command them to level so low with their Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, that they may shoot at the horses legs; by that means they will shoot clear under the tops of your Pikes being charged. If you please to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand two ranks of Musqueteers to give fire at one time, then as soon as the Musqueteers are ready to present, command your Pikemen to port their Pikes: then command all the Musqueteers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out-side of the Pikes to present, where the first ranks of Musqueteers are to kneel on their right knees; then the second tanks of Musqueteers must move up close to the first ranks of Musqueteers, every Musqueteer in the second ranks stepping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with their right legs within the in-side of their Leaders right legs; then they must step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with their left legs close up by their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62313:43"/>
left legs, without-side of their Leaders legs, and present their Musquets over their Leaders heads in the first rank. When the Musqueteers have thus presented, command them to give fire. And if Horse charge a Division of Foot which stand in the same order that this Division of Horse doth, marked with the figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, You must command your Pikemen to charge again, and be careful to place the Captains, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, and Serjeants of the Division on the four corners of the Division, as you see them in the foregoing figure marked with the figure 7.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Some Observations concerning the March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Army.</head>
               <p>You must be careful before you march with your Army into the Field, to see your Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers well Cloathed, well Armed, and well Disciplined; and that you be stored with Shooes and Stockings for the March, and also with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, Bread, and Mony. If you be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of this, you will soon bring your Army to ruine. You must also have a great care of those Souldiers which fall sick, or are hurt, upon a March; for this alone will not only encourage Souldiers to undergo any danger, or labour, but
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62313:44"/>
by it you will win their affections so, that they will never forsake you.</p>
               <p>You ought to know the nature of the Country, the quality of the ways, the compendiousness of turning, the nature of Hills, and the course of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, through which you are to march. And the best way to know these things is by good Guides, and good Maps: For he that leadeth an Army by an unknown and undiscovered way, and marching blindfold upon uncertain adventures, is subject to many casualties, and disadvantages: Let every Commander therefore perswade himself that good Discoverers are as the eye of an Army, and serve for lights in the darkness of ignorance, to direct the resolutions of good providence, and to make the path of safety so manifest, that he need not stumble upon casualties: For that which a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral should chiefly observe upon a March, is first <hi>Safety,</hi> and next <hi>Convenience.</hi> If you March into a Country which is hard to enter, and which hath but few passages, whereby to enter into it, you must force one; and before you go farther, you must there fortifie, as well to assure your way for your necessaries, as for your retreat. For a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral must be careful never to March into any such place, where his Enemy may be able to cut off his Provisions, or his Retreat.</p>
               <p>It is most convenient and ready to have your Divisions of Horse and Foot to march at the same strength, or some ten or twelve men more in a Division, than you intend to fight them; by which means your Army will be much more ready upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62313:44"/>
any occasion to be imbattelled: And your Officers and Souldiers being used to march with their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions in the same strength and order as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to fight them, will not be so apt to be in a disorder, as that Army that doth not use to march with their Divisions of Horse and Foot at the same strength as they intend to fight them.</p>
               <p>Your Regiments of Horse and Foot ought to be divided into Brigades, your Foot into three Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades, and your Horse into six Brigades, if you be twelve Regiments of Horse strong, or above. It is most necessary to use your Brigades, and your Divisions of Horse and Foot to march in Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia when time and ground will give leave; for otherwise you will not be able to march three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces in the view of an Enemy with your Brigades imbattelled, but your Divisions of Horse and Foot will be apt to lose their distances, and by consequence will be most apt to fall into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
               <p>You must be careful to be furnished at the least at every quarter with three Guides: If you be to march in the night, you ought to have six.</p>
               <p>Before you set forwards, your Guides must be agreed upon the way which they will take: There must also be a Captain of the Guides, a man of spirit, and vigilance, and one that may take care to get Guides from place to place. You must be careful to carry with you the Maps of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, through which you are to march.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:62313:45"/>The best way to keep your men from straggling upon a march, when they pretend to go out of their ranks and files to drink, or to ease themselves, is this; let them have command to leave their Pikes or Musquets with their Camerades; and the Lieutenant and Serjeant ought to see this order observed.</p>
               <p>You ought upon a march to send out some parties of Horse or Foot, according as the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Country, and the strength of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my requireth, in the Van-guard and flanks of your Army, to discover and search for Ambushments, and parties of the Enemy, which will be always apt to attend upon an Army for booties.</p>
               <p>When you come to march with your Army through any Woody Country, then you ought to have loose Wings of Musqueteers to march on the flanks of your Army, some Musquet-shot off from the Body of your Foot, to keep small, or great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from firing on your main Body. And in such places you ought to have a special care that your Baggage be well guarded on the flanks; and that your Scout-Master and Spies do bring you intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence daily.</p>
               <p>It is most necessary when you march, to make an halt once in a day for the ease of your Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and relief and ease of your Carriage-Horses, in some convenient place where is both Horse-meat and water.</p>
               <p>It is very fit you give orders to your Pioners
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62313:45"/>
to make you three ways on each side of your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage way, that is, six ways besides your Carriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or as many as conveniently the ground and places through which you are to march with your Army will give way. So by this means the one half of your Army may march on one side of your Carriages, and the other half on the other side of your Carriages. By marching in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your train will be the shorter, and a less guard will serve to guard the reer of your Waggons, by reason the main body of your Army will be so near the reer of your Waggons. And also your Army will march much the nearer together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you will the sooner draw them into order to fight upon any occasion. Likewise you will be able to march safer and farther in a day, than you can when your Army marcheth but in one or two ways.</p>
               <p>If it fall out so that you must be constrained to march with your Army and Baggage in one High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or over one Bridge, the Conductor that hath the Conducting of the Van-guard of your Train, ought to know upon such an occasion what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment his Train of Artillery is to follow; and that he have a special care not to march into any narrow passage before those Troops he is to follow.</p>
               <p>If you have any occasion to send out any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to provide Provisions for your Army against night, you ought to give order unto those Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to keep their Souldiers from stragling; for such oversights do many times bring great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venncies
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62313:46"/>
to an Army. Therefore Officers ought not at any time to suffer their Souldiers to straggle, nor slacken the severity of Military Discipline, though they believe themselves far from an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and in great security. For Souldiers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly least secure when they think themselves most secure. Security is commonly the fore-runner of misery.</p>
               <p>In marching with an Army to fight with your Enemy, you ought to carry with you as much Bread, Cheese, or Cattel and Salt as you may conveniently; for it is impossible that Souldiers should find Bread to be bought every where: And if it be possible to be done with safety, lie with your Army between your Enemy and his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, being better furnished with Provisions than your Enemy: For lying near your Enemy with safety, and without fighting, will in the end sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discourage your Enemies Souldiers by their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, or force them to fight upon disadvantages, or at last put them to a retreat: And then the Victory is more then half won, if any of these things happen unto your Enemy.</p>
               <p>An Army may be divided into four parts, namely, the Cavalry, the Infantry, the Artillery, and the Victuals.</p>
               <p>If you March with Cannon, and suffer an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to approach too near you without intrenching, it is impossible for you to avoid fighting or losing your Cannon. Therefore a General ought to know how to make use of it at his advantage, and avoid
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62313:46"/>
the inconveniences of it by his foresight, either by intrenching, or retreating in time, if he hath no mind to hazard a Battel.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that bringeth so much disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to an Army upon the March as the Baggage: And therefore it is highly necessary to reduce it to the smallest proportion that may be: and the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-Master-General ought to make a review of it every morning when the Army marcheth, for otherwise it will daily increase.</p>
               <p>Your Marshal-General ought not to suffer many Women, or Boys to March with an Army, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Sickness and Famine get into the Army.</p>
               <p>If your Army be of any great strength, then may you march with it in two parts, each part about two or three miles distant from the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you have no Enemy near you that is able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front you. And if you can march in this order with safety, you will march much the farther in a day, and your Souldiers will be much better provided for at night.</p>
               <p>If you are to march with an Army into a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where you think the Inhabitants will flie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, then ought you to carry Hand-mills, and Baking-pans along with you, that each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany upon occasion may be able to grind their own Corn, and provide themselves Bread.</p>
               <p>It is very fit and necessary, if you have any occasion to pass over any Rivers that are not ford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62313:47"/>
in your march, to carry with you Boats or Punts to make a Bridge of.</p>
               <p>It is most necessary likewise to carry with you Caltrops into the Field, the which are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient at times to be thrown in places, as either into Fords or narrow passages, where Horses are to pass to spoil them: and they are of especial use in a night upon a Retreat, to be thrown into narrow passages, or by day into dirty or watry passages. Those Caltrops that are made for Fords, must be made somewhat more weighty than those that are made for other passages, that the water may not be able to carry them away.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Some Observations for the Quartering of an Army at Night upon a March, and for the setting out of their Guards to secure their Quarters.</head>
               <p>YOU ought to give a strict charge to the Quarter-Master-General of the Foot, to have a special care (if it be possible) to Quarter your Infantry upon a march, and your Train of Artillery in places that are naturally, or casually well fortified, as with inclosures, or in places compassed with Rivers, or Moors; and where there may be Provisions for your Carriage-Horses, or where Provisions may conveniently be brought in by the Country-people for them. This way of Quartering your Army must be carefully observed, if any Enemy of strength be near you that may be able to do you any affront upon any of your Quarters. If any Enemy of strength be near you, you ought to Quarter your Army as near together as possibly you can; but by all means if it be possible, avoid Quartering your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry in the Campagnia.</p>
               <p>The time of lodging an Army is a dangerous time to be assaulted in, because the Army is then tired, and every man (desirous to be lodged) hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the quarter in disorder, which is a thing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62313:48"/>
hard to avoid: And therefore the General and the Officers ought to have a special care to avoid this danger. The which I conceive to be done best this way. Those Horse and Dragoons that you send before for a Guard with the Quarter-Master-General, and his attendants for the providing of Quarters, as soon as those Troops shall come to the place where the Army shall quarter, they ought to send out small Parties, and Scouts several ways to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and to search for ambushments; and the remainder of the Horse and Dragoons ought to keep guards in some convenient places about the Quarters till night: And such Foot Souldiers as you send before to preserve the Foot Quarters from being pillaged, ought to be two out of every Company, a Pikeman, and a Musqueteer; and a Serjeant out of each Regiment to command them: and two Lieutenants and a Captain out of the three Brigades of Foot, to Command all the men that are appointed to preserve the Foot Quarters from being pillaged by their Camerades. These Souldiers and Officers ought to have their Orders over night for the same, that they may be in a readiness in the morning to march with the Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as a guard for them: for the aforesaid Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers may most conveniently do these two services under one.</p>
               <p>The Carriages that belong to the Horse Officers (especially the Carriages for such Officers as shall be lodged in Out-Quarters with the Foot Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) the Marshal of the Field, the General of the Artillery, the Treasurer of the Army, the Commissary of the Victuals, the Quarter-Master-General,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62313:48"/>
the Secretary of the Council of War, the Provost-General; all these ought to be lodged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the General Quarter.</p>
               <p>The Marshal of the Field, the Major-Generals of the Horse and Foot, and the Majors of the Brigades both of Horse and Foot, ought to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Quarters to view the most convenient places for Guards for the security of their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Serjeant Major of the Regiments both of Horse and Foot that are assured to have Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watches at night, ought to go somewhat before their Regiments to know of the Major of the Brigade where the places are that the Companies of their Regiments should guard that night, with their Orders for the same. Then the Serjeant-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors of these Regiments, that are to have the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watches for the night, knowing what Guards the Companies of the Regiments should have that night, and having received all their Orders for the same, ought to meet their Regiments before they come to the Quarters, that they may conduct the Companies of their Regiments that are to watch at night, the nearest way to their Guards; seeing it is a great trouble for Companies that are tired, to remove from their Regiments to their Guards, having laid down their Arms, and setled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for rest.</p>
               <p>After the Marshal of the Field, or the Major-General of the Foot, or both, have had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care of securing the Quarters of the Infantry from all danger of any sudden surprises, by placing good Guards in convenient places; then if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62313:49"/>
be quartered all together, the General or the Marshal of the Field, or the Serjeant-Major-General of the Infantry, one of them ought to go every night one round or two: besides, there ought to be appointed a Colonel to go the Grand Round every night, and he ought not to fail to go two Rounds. And in my opinion it is fitter for all Grand Rounds, or any other Rounds, to give the Word, than to receive it.</p>
               <p>But if it falleth out so, that you Quarter your Brigades of Foot one from another, then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General of the Foot must trust to the care and judgment of the Colonels and Majors of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades for the setting out of their Guards, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rounds, unless it be that Brigade with which he lodgeth himself. The Major-General ought always in such a case to give order to the Colonels of the Brigades, that they appoint an Officer of the Field for the Grand Round, and that he fail not to go two Rounds at the least: There must be likewise appointed a Captain of the watch to every Regiment that lieth within the Quarters, to see that the Corporals and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at each Colours keep good Watch; and that the Souldiers of each Company of his Regiment within the quarter keep good order, and that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers within his Quarters make no fires in any places, where they may endanger the firing of the Quarters.</p>
               <p>I will now say something concerning the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the Horse, which you ought always to Quarter without-side of the Foot. The Horse-Quarters ought to be as near together as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62313:49"/>
you may lay them, that upon all occasions they may be able to assist one the other upon any sudden falling on their Quarters in the night. And that you may Quarter your Horse the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er together, you may by sending out parties of Horse before, cause the Country people to bring in Provisions both for your Horse-men, and their Horses into the chief Villages or Towns where you are to Quarter your Horse; the which the Country people will most willingly do, rather than to be troubled with the Quartering of any Horsemen; and by this means your Troops will lodge much the safer.</p>
               <p>It is one of the hardest things that I do know that belongs to Horse-Service, for a Commander of Horse judiciously to order his Horse Guards for the securing of his Quarters at night. And the best way for doing the same, as I conceive, is this, you ought to lodge in your outermost Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Horse which lie next your Enemy. And before you draw your Horse into their Quarters, you ought to set out your Guards, and send out of your Guards some small parties several ways; and when those that you have sent out are return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you ought to send out more, to discover any parties of your Enemies, and to search for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushments. Your Dragooners that are Quartered in your out-Quarters of Horse, ought to guard the High-ways that come into your Quarters. And against such guards of the Dragoons as you keep upon the High-ways, you ought to Barricado your High-ways up with something or other that may not easily be removed; and let the Pioners make
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62313:50"/>
you another way for the relief of your Guards from your quarters. And therefore I hold it most convenient to have an hundred Pioners to be horsed, which always should be lodged in the outermost Horse-quarters next the Enemy, for the stopping up of some passages, and for the making of others that may be unknown to the Enemy: Likewise upon the ways which are made by the Pioners you ought to have a Guard of Dragoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and all your Dragooners ought to have Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feathers, the which the Dragooners ought to stick up without side of the Avenues; and in the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues that the Pioners have made for the relief of the Out guards of Horse.</p>
               <p>One Guard is not sufficient to give the Alarm at that distance, whereby you may have leisure to put your self in order to fight: wherefore you ought always to have half your Horsemen to watch on horse-back one half of the night, and the other the other half of the night: and when the one half of your Horsemen watcheth, the other half of your Horsemen must be saddled, and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Horsemen be in their cloaths. Your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost Horse-quarters (which lie safer than your outermost Horse-quarters) when the one half of your Horsemen watcheth, the other half may be unsaddled; but your Officers and Horsemen must not lie out of their Cloaths. And the Officers in each quarter ought to have order upon any alarm, that as soon as they are drawn in Arms they should make all the haste they can to assist their Camerades that are assaulted in their quarters; and that an Officer in Chief in each quarter go two or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62313:50"/>
three Rounds in a night. And this order of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be observed in your Horse-quarters, if you lie within twenty miles of any Garrison of your Enemy that is able to affront any of your quarters.</p>
               <p>The General of an Army ought always upon a March to give out two words at night, the one for a Watch-word, and the other for a Field-word. The Officers ought to receive both, but the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers only the Field-word; the which ought not to be given to the Souldiers, unless there be an Alarm.</p>
               <p>Towns and Villages that lie in a Champaign Country are most fit for Horse-quarters: the Towns and Villages that lie in an inclosed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are most fit for Foot-quarters.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Some certain Observations to be kept in the fighting of Battels, and some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the Imbattelling of an Army.</head>
               <p>WE may observe two especial ends which the great Commanders of the World have ever striven to atchieve, Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Over mastering their Enemies. The latter by cunning, and wisely carrying of a matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come to trial by blows: the former by forceable means, and fighting a Battel: the one proceeding from Wisdom, and the better faculties of the soul; the other depending upon the strength and abilities of the body. The latter end is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be embraced, as the safest course in these uncertain and casual events. For that which resteth upon corporal strength, and maketh execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the way to a conclusion, is full of hazard, and little certainty. And yet of all the actions of War, the most glorious and most important is to know how to give Battel: For the art of imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling an Army hath always been esteemed the chiefest point of skill in a General (for skill and practice do more towards the Victory than multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) seeing the gaining of one or two Battels ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, or subverteth whole Empires, Kingdoms, or Countrys: And therefore a General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62313:51"/>
ought to know all the advantages which may be taken in a day of Battel; and how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare against disadvantages which may happen. Concerning both which I will here give you my opinion.</p>
               <p>Advantages bring hope of Victory, and hope conceiveth such spirits as usually follow when the thing which is hoped for is effected; whereby the courage becometh hardy, and resolute in Victory; and where the Souldiers fear no overthrow, they are more than half Conquerours. So on the other side, disadvantages and danger breed fear, and fear so checketh valour, and controuleth the spirits, that Vertue and Honour give place to distrust, and yield up their interest to such directors as can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford nothing but diffidence and irresolutions.</p>
               <p>It is most necessary for a General in the first place to approve his Cause, and settle an opinion of right in the minds of his Officers and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: the which can be no way better done, than by the Chaplains of an Army. Also a General ought to speak to the Colonels of his Army to encourage their Officers with a desire to fight with the Enemy; and all the Officers to do the like to their Souldiers. And the better to raise the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers spirits, let their Officers tell them that their General doth promise them, if they will fight courageously with their Enemy, and do get the day, that they shall have, besides the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of the Field, twelve-pence apiece to drink, to refresh their spirits when the business is done. The which I am confident will make the common
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62313:52"/>
men fight better, than the best Oration in the world.</p>
               <p>It is very fit a General should use his best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to understand the strength of his Enemies Horse and Foot, and how they are armed both with Offensive and Defensive Arms, and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Pikes they have to their Musqueteers. Also he must endeavour to know by name and place the Chief Officers of his Enemies Army, and their abilities in Martial Affairs; by the which means he may guess where the Chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do command in a day of Battel: So he may easily know how to place his Army best for his own advantage. This if carefully observed will be of very great use.</p>
               <p>You ought to know that novelties, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected adventures are very successful in Battels, and in all Martial designs.</p>
               <p>A General must be careful never to hazard a Battel with his Enemy, when he findeth him imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled in a ground of advantage, although he do out-number him much with men: The safest way then will be to fight with him by Famine: For although a Generals Fortune should be generally subject to his will, yet by his wisdom he should rather follow Reason than Fortune in such cases.</p>
               <p>A General ought to be careful when an Enemy approacheth near him, to send out some two or three knowing Officers with a good strong party of Horse and Dragooners to make good the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62313:52"/>
retreat upon occasion) whereby to discover the Enemies strength, and order of his March: and that they take notice of what advantages may be taken of the ground which lieth between them. And the party that is sent ought to have order, if it be possible to take some stragglers, that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may the better understand the strength, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Enemies Army.</p>
               <p>If you intend to give Battel, you must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to these principal things that follow: You must never suffer your self to be forced to fight against your will; and never to fight your Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers when their spirits are either dismayed, or cast down. If you resolve to fight with your Enemy, then you ought to choose a place for the Battel fit for the quality, and number of your Souldiers. For if you fear to be inclosed by a great number, you ought to shelter your flanks, or at least one of them, by the nature of the place, as by a River, Wood, or some other thing equivalent: If you be weak in your Cavalry, you must avoid the Plains, or fight with Foot amongst your Horse, as is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the three next Battels: If you be strong in Horse, you must avoid strait passages, or inclosed places.</p>
               <p>You ought to know that directions are the life of Action, and the sinews and strength of Martial Discipline; and therefore you must give punctual orders to your Marshal of the Field, and your Major-Generals, and Colonels of the Brigades both of Horse and Foot before they begin to fight: And your Orders ought to be written, if you have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62313:53"/>
time: for after the Battel is once begun, is is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for a General to give Orders, more than in that part where he is present at the same time.</p>
               <p>That you may know how to place your Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Horse and Foot at their true distances, you ought to allow unto every Horseman in the Front of the Divisions of the Van-guard, and Battel six foot of ground in breadth; and to every Foot Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in the Divisions in the Van-guard, and Battel you ought to allow five Foot. Also you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that between every two Divisions of Horse and Foot in the Van-guard of your Army to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an hundred paces of ground in breadth, three feet to the pace: besides what you allow for the Division in the Battel, which is for the reserve. You ought likewise to allow between the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of your Horse-Troops an hundred paces; and between the Van-guard of your Foot an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty paces, three feet to the pace. This order must be observed both in placing the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Horse and Foot, and the Van-guards, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and Reer-guard of your Army; that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Troops being put to recoil, may not fall upon those which should come up to relieve them, nor the Battel upon the Reer.</p>
               <p>You must always be careful to place the best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments either of Horse or Foot on the Wings of your Army.</p>
               <p>The Officers that lead the Divisions in the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of a Battel ought to have special care to see that the Divisions both of Horse and Foot keep
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62313:53"/>
their distances; but especially the Officers that lead the Divisions in the Van-guard of your Army on the flanks of your Horse or Foot, they must be extraordinarily careful that they close not with their Divisions in upon the main Body. I know no one thing that Officers care is more required a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, in fighting a Battel, than to see that such Divisions as they Command keep their Distances: For let a man consider how hard a thing it is for an Army that is imbattelled in a Campagnia to march a mile together without losing their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And questionless it is much harder for an Army to march a mile together in the face of an Enemy, and the Van-guard of the Army conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually skirmishing to keep their distances: And unless the Officers of an Army are punctual in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving their Orders of keeping their distances in marching, it is impossible but some part of your Army, if not the whole, will be in a confusion before the Battel be half fought.</p>
               <p>It is seldom or never seen that two Armies that are of any equal strength, and that use one kind of Discipline, being imbattelled one against the other, but the one Army out-fronteth the other upon one of the Wings, and the other Army out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronteth the other upon the contrary Wing, when both Armies come to encounter. Therefore you ought to give punctual Orders, before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel beginneth, to those Chief Commanders that Command on the outermost flanks of the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards of the Horse, that in case either of the Wings of Horse doth out-front his Enemies Wing of Horse, they should advance easily, keeping
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62313:54"/>
their order with that Wing of Horse which they Command (as soon as their Cannon begin to play, and not before) and charge that Wing of Horse which they do out-front. Command also those Divisions of Horse that out-flank your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse on the flanks, when they come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a near distance of your Enemies Troops, to wheel with their Divisions so, that they may be able to charge the Wing of their Enemies Horse on the flank, at the same time when the rest of the Horse chargeth them in the Front. And in case you do out-front your Enemies Army on both flanks, either by the advantage of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your men, or by the well-ordering of them, then both your Wings of Horse must observe the aforesaid order.</p>
               <p>Here you must note, that if you fight Foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your Horse, your Foot must advance with your Horse, and your Horse by no means to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance before your Foot, until your Enemies Horse be put to flight.</p>
               <p>But if it falleth out so (as most commonly it doth) that the one Army be out-flanked upon one Wing, and the same Army doth out flank the other Army on the other Wing: if it fortune so, that you be out-flanked in one of your Wings of Horse, then ought the General to give an especial order to the Officers, that that Wing of Horse which is out-flanked do not advance from the main Body of the Foot, but keep an even front with the Foot, until their Enemies Horse come up close to them to charge them. And in the mean
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62313:54"/>
time so soon as the Officers of either of your Wings of Horse discover that they shall be out-flanked, they ought to have order to draw up on the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most flank of that wing of Horse that is out-flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the Reer-Guard of Horse of the same wing of Horse with all the expedition that may be. For I am confident it is far less dangerous to want a Reer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard in a wing of Horse, than to be out-flanked by his Enemies Horse. Likewise those Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that do perceive they shall be out-flanked by the Enemies Horse, ought to have order that if any of their Divisions of Horse (which doth most of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fall out, when they are out-flanked by the Enemies wing of Horse) do front against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Foot, and not against their Horse, that then they shall draw all those Divisions of Horse on the outermost flanks of the same wing of Horse.</p>
               <p>But in the imbattelling of two Armies, if it prove so that your Armies are equally fronted (the which seldom or never doth happen) then if you have one wing of Horse that are more confident in their Valour and Resolution, than you are of the other, let that wing of Horse charge first (for as many hands make light work, so the best hands make surest work:) and the other wing of Horse keep in even front with the main body of Foot, until the Enemies Horse come up to charge them.</p>
               <p>You ought to use your best judgment, and skill to charge your Enemy first in that place where you are surest to overcome him: for so favourable are mens judgments to that which is already hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62313:55"/>
that the sequel of every action dependeth for the most part upon the beginning.</p>
               <p>If it fortune so, that either of your wings of Horse do put to flight either of your Enemies wings of Horse, then ought the Chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that wing of Horse to have order upon the flight of his Enemies wing of Horse, to send but three Divisions of Horse after them; the which three Divisions of Horse ought to have their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before-hand for the same, and their Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons what to do. One of the three Divisions of Horse that is appointed to follow the routed wing of the Enemies Horse, should be commanded to be sub-divided into small sub-divisions when they are to follow the execution, about fifteen Horsemen in a Division; and the other two Divisions of Horse ought to follow after in order; and keeping their men together without being sub-divided, that they may make good the Retreat of the other Division of Horse, which is upon the execution of those Horse of the Enemy which are fled: And all the three Divisions of Horse ought to have order not to follow the Enemy above a mile, and then to return to the Army again, with all the expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they may. And all your other Horse that have put the Enemies wing of Horse to flight, ought to charge the Enemies Foot with as much speed as they can.</p>
               <p>Having spoken of some advantages that may be taken by the Horse on the flanks of an Army in a day of Battel (the which are the chiefest advantages in winning of a Battel) and how they are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62313:55"/>
against disadvantages that may happen: I will now speak something concerning some advantages, and some disadvantages that may happen in Foot Service in a day of Battel.</p>
               <p>And first of the advantages that may be taken by Foot in a day of Battel; the greatest advantage that can be made use of, is by ordering the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers so, that they may be able readily to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish with Foot, and to be suddenly put in order upon any occasion to be sheltered by the Pikes from the Enemies Horse. Each Division of Foot that fight in the Body of your Army (if you intend to use this kind of Discipline which is set down in this Book) ought to be in strength two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty eight men, half Pikes, and half Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers. And each Division of Foot that is to fight amongst your Horse, ought to be an hundred forty four men in strength, half Pikes and half Musqueteers. The way how to order these Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Foot in a day of Battel is shewn you in these three following Battels. By this way of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering your Foot, the success of a Battel will not wholly rely upon the success of the Horse, as it doth now adays, as we do order our Infantry.</p>
               <p>Your Foot being ordered this way as is before spoken of, the success of a Battel will lie more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the success of the Foot, then upon the Horse. And I account them (being thus ordered as is here set down, and as you shall see them in these three following Battels) a more firm body to trust to for Victory, than the Horse. The Horse like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by fighting of Foot among them become a firmer
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62313:56"/>
Body, than by fighting Horse alone. And such as shall make trial of this way of imbattelling their Troops, shall find it very advantageous unto them in fighting a Battel, and no hinderance at all, but a great furtherance to the Horse-Service.</p>
               <p>If your Field-pieces be of ten or twelve foot in length, and having their full metal, and if you meet with an Enemy whose Field-pieces are not so long, you will find that you have by it a great advantage of your Enemy. The advantage is this, when you come with your Army and Artillery within shot of your Enemies Body of Foot, your Artillery being placed in the Van-guard of your Army, command your Army to stand, and your Cannoneers to play with your Artillery upon the Enemy. If your Enemies Field-pieces be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than are usually carried into the Field, you will be able to shoot upon your Enemies Body of Foot, a quarter of a mile before your Enemies Artillery will be able to shoot at your Body of Foot with any certainty. The which will prove a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to those that shall make use of it, to be able to out-shoot your Enemy a quarter of a mile with your Artillery; and your Enemy to recover that disadvantage must be constrained to march a quarter of a mile in Battalia with his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can bring his Artillery to shoot to any purpose at your Army; the which will prove (if you have good Cannoneers) a great dis-heartening, if not a total overthrow to your Enemy.</p>
               <p>All the Musqueteers that march in the Van-guard of an Army in a day of Battel ought to have two
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62313:56"/>
pair of Bandaliers furnished with Powder and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; and in case you have no Bandaliers, let there be provided for each Musqueteer in the Van-guard of the Army twelve Carthrages, which they ought to carry in their right-hand pockets, and twelve Bullets apiece in their pockets besides: and each company to carry with them, for the re-furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Musqueteers upon occasion, a Powder-bag full of Powder. Thus ought the Musqueteers in the Van-guard of an Army to be furnished: All the rest of the Musqueteers ought to have their Bandaliers furnished with Powder, and Bullet; and each Musqueteer ought to have twelve Bullets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece in their Pockets; and each company must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them a Powder-bag full of Powder.</p>
               <p>It is very fit likewise that you have in each Company six good Fouling-pieces, of such a length as a Souldier may well be able to take aim, and to shoot off at ease; twelve of them being placed in a day of Battel, when you bring a Division of Foot to skirmish with an Enemy on the flanks of a Division of Foot; six Fowling-pieces on the one flank of a Division of Foot, and six on the other flank, as you shall see them placed in these three Battels following. Those Souldiers that carry the Fowling-pieces, ought to have command when they come within distance of Shot of that Division of the Enemy that they are to encounter with, that they shoot not at any, but at the Officers of that Division.</p>
               <p>Likewise you ought to have on the flanks of each Division of Pikes, a Souldier with Hand-Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62313:57"/>
that if you bring your men to push of Pike, they are to fire the Granadoes, and to throw them in amongst the Enemies Pikemen; which will prove a great advantage, if they be boldly and well thrown.</p>
               <p>Unto every Division of Foot in the Battail of your Army you ought to have two Divisions of Horse, of forty in a Division, ten in front, and four deep on each flank of each Division of Foot in the Battail of your Army, as you shall see them in these three following Battels. These Divisions of Horse will be always in a readiness to charge the Enemies Foot at all times when the General shall think fit.</p>
               <p>If you out-flank your Enemies Foot with your Foot, either on the one flank, or both the flanks, let so many of your Divisions of Foot as do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flank your Enemies Foot, be drawn up on the Enemies flank, and give fire on them: And the Officers in Chief that Command on the flanks of the Van-guard of the Foot, ought to have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Orders for the same, in case any such thing should happen: and likewise they are to have a special Order for the keeping of their true distances in their advance towards an Enemy.</p>
               <p>If you perceive you have more Pikemen in your Army than your Enemy, or if your Pikemen be better armed with Defensive Arms, or with longer Pikes, and that you have no advantage of him in your Artillery, nor the Enemy in the ground upon which you are to advance; then make what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62313:57"/>
hast you can, (continually skirmishing with your Enemy with the Van-guard of your Foot) to bring your men to push of Pike with your Enemy. When you have done that, you must give order to the Officers in Chief that Command the Battel of your Army, that they be careful to advance so with the Battel to front with the Van-guard of the Enemy, some little while before your men come to push of Pike, that at that time you may bring as many men to fight as you can.</p>
               <p>The disadvantages that may happen to the Foot in a day of Battel are these. The greatest is to be beaten by the Horse, either on the one flank, or both flanks: and therefore the Foot Officers ought to imbattel their Foot so, that they may be able to shelter their Musqueteers by their Pikes from the charge of any Horse. The way how it may be done is shewed plainly in the three next Battels. Another disadvantage is to be out-flanked by your Enemies Foot; to prevent which, your Chief Officers that command on the flanks of the Foot ought to have Order, that as soon as they perceive they are or shall be out-flanked upon one, or both the flanks, they should draw up the Reer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of their Foot unto one, or both flanks of the Van-guard of their Foot, as they shall see cause. Another disadvantage that the Foot may have is to be out-shot by the Enemies Artillery: In case it falleth out so, then, when you once come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in shot of your Enemies Artillery, your Horse ought to have order to advance as orderly, and speedily as they may, until they come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62313:58"/>
with the Enemies Horse. If you fight with Foot amongst your Horse, your Horse and your Foot must advance together. Likewise you must advance with your Foot and Artillery as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and speedily as may be, until you come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in shot of your Enemy with your Artillery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shooting either with your Cannon or Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</p>
               <p>If you understand that your Enemy hath more Pikemen in his Army than you have, or his Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men better armed with Defensive Arms, or their Pikes to be longer than yours; then ought you to avoid, as much as you can, the bringing of your Souldiers to push of Pike.</p>
               <p>In case the Musqueteers in the Van guard of your Foot do come to want Powder, or your Divisions of Foot in the Van-guard of your Army have lost so many men, that they need relief from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves in the Battel; then let the Officers in the Van-guard of the Foot have special command not to retreat with the Van-guard of Foot by no means, but to advance skirmishing easily towards the Enemy, until their reserves be marched by them. Then let their Officers Command them to stand, and see that their Bandaliers be furnished with Powder, and Bullet, and set them in order with as much expedition as may be; and then let them march up within an hundred and fifty paces of the Reer-guard of Foot, and to be in a readiness to second them upon any occasion.</p>
               <p>A General ought to give particular Orders to all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62313:58"/>
the Officers in Chief of his Army before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel begins, in writing, if he have time, that the Officers in Chief may know how to Command their Souldiers to make use of all the advantages, that he conceiveth may happen unto them in a day of Battel: that upon any neglect of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers for not making use of any such opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the excuse of not having Order for the same may be taken away. Likewise it should be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Orders how they ought to prevent any disadvantages that a General conceiveth may befal them. The which will not only prevent excuses, but according to the old saying, <hi>He that is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned is fore-armed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Set upon your Enemy when he is affrighted and distracted; for there is nothing then to be expected of your Enemy but despair and confusion.</p>
               <p>A General must be careful to give a very strict Order to his Officers, and Souldiers, that not a man of them offer to Pillage before the Field be clear of the Enemy; and that such Officers as do suffer their Souldiers to Pillage before the Field be clear of the Enemy, shall suffer for the same as the Souldiers for Pillaging.</p>
               <p>Before the Battel begins, you ought to give out a Field-word both to your Officers and Souldiers; and besides your word, that your Souldiers and Officers may the better be able to know one the other, being mixt with the Enemy: they ought to wear something or other about them to be known from the Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62313:59"/>After the winning of a Battel, a General should follow his Victory with all the expedition that he may, either by keeping his Enemy from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering an head again, or presently falling upon some Countries or Towns, where he thinks he may do his Enemy the most hurt: For the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after a Victory, if well prosecuted, are better than the Victory it self: because when people are in suspence, and great fear, and confusion, as it happeneth in sudden things, it is a singular time to obtain Victories, or some honourable composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The fruit of Victory consisteth in the well using of it, which whosoever doth not, incurreth an infamy so much the greater, than not to know how to overcome, by how much it is a greater fault to be deceived by the things that are in a mans power, than by those that depend upon fortune.</p>
               <p>Likewise a General is to take care for recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Army upon all occasions, but especially after a Battel.</p>
               <p>Although those things which are here before set down seem easie to understand, and very easie to practise; yet are they so often neglected by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in Chief, either in neglecting to make use of advantages, or not giving out punctual Orders before a Battel for the aforesaid things, or through the neglect of such as should put their directions in execution, that one or more of the aforesaid neglects are always the loss of Battels. And the loss of two or three Battels proveth the loss of Countries and Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:62313:59"/>He that desireth either that a City defend it self obstinately, or that an Army in the Field fight it out resolutely, must try his Wits to make an impression in the breasts of them that are to fight, that such a necessity lieth upon them. And it much helpeth an Army towards the winning of a Battel, to make them confident that in any case they cannot doubt of Victory. The things that give them this confidence, are, that they be well armed, and well ordered. For when Valour is accompanied with good Order, and good Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, it makes good use of the fury in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and at such times, that no difficulty abateth it, nor ever quaileth the courage: Because those good orders re-inforce the Spirit, and the Fury, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still maintained by the hope of overcoming, which never faileth while good Orders and good Discipline hold firm.</p>
               <p>You ought not to despise, and think too mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of your Enemy; for that will not only beget negligence in your own Army, but care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in your Enemies Army. And it is most sure, the valour of a few may surmount the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of many: and if you be broken by your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that you despise, you double your own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace by your rash and indiscreet arrogance.</p>
               <p>But to speak of chances, and to touch some particularities, thereby to shew evidently the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mans wit, and power, and the casualty of warlike attempts: let a man consider by how many accidents the mightiest Armies are many times dispersed, and dissipated, and the greatest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62313:60"/>
overthrown. As sometimes by the death of one man; sometimes by the dissention of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or Souldiers; sometimes by tempests, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable weather: sometimes again by Plagues, or Diseases in the Camp: otherwhiles by sudden Fears that fall upon the Souldiers without cause; sometimes (as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> noteth) by a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either not well understood, or ill executed, by a little temerity of disorder, by some vain word or speech of the meanest Souldier: and lastly (saith he) by infinite changes which happen at unawares, unpossible to be foreseen and prevented by the wit or counsel of any man. Which sheweth that no humane wit is able of it self sufficiently to govern an Army, and that God reserveth to himself the success of Battels, and disposeth of Victories at his pleasure.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> Some certain Observations concerning the Retreat of an Army.</head>
               <p>TO know how to make an honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, is one of the principal points of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Art, and worthiest the knowledge of a General, to be able upon occasion to make a safe and sure Retreat: For those that can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else can easily put themselves into a War, but to return home again in safety is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the honour of a Leader.</p>
               <p>When a General intendeth to retreat with his Army, he must be careful that (if it be possible) his Retreat be not through any places, but such as his Pioners may be able to make him, where three or four may march in breast, besides the way for the Carriages: For there is no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er danger of receiving a Defeat than when a Retreat is made at a narrow passage. But if you be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make a Retreat through a narrow passage, there is no better way to prevent danger, than to raise some Works near this passage in the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous places you can find. If you retreat in the night with your Army, and have pass'd any narrow passage with your Troops, it were very good for you to give command that some Caltraps be thrown into those narrow passages to spoil your Enemies Horse, if they follow your Troops;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62313:61"/>
and if you retreat in the day-time with your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the aforesaid Caltraps will be very useful to be thrown into dirty and watry passages.</p>
               <p>A Retreat in view of the Enemy is the most dangerous action that can be undertaken by any Commander. And therefore it is held in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of most Commanders better to retreat in the night, than in the day: because it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to pursue an Army in the night; and if he that retreateth be careful to lay his ambushes well, he may sooner do a mischief to his Enemy than his Enemy to him.</p>
               <p>Likewise it is better to retreat with part of an Army, than with the whole; and it is best to march as far at first as possibly you may, to the end you might have some advantage of space before the Enemy that followeth you: for so the Enemy durst not follow you with small Troops, and with great Forces they will never be able to reach you; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the scarcity and want of Victuals that they will find by following you, will much discourage them</p>
               <p>Some Commanders now adays, whose skill reacheth not so far as to know the <hi>ABC</hi> in the Art Military, that is to say, the use of their Arms, they think it a blemish to their Honours to make a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Retreat in the night. But this is that that I will say of such Gallants, <hi>Presumption</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> are two bad Counsellors in War.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Some Observations concerning the stopping of an Army upon Passages either over Rivers, or difficult and mountainous places.</head>
               <p>IN the first place I will speak something of stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the passage of an Army upon a River, if your Army be to pass a River that is not pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but upon two or three places, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Bridge: I conceive this to be the best way. Upon the chiefest passage over the River there you ought to attend your Enemy with all your Forces, if you may find there sufficient provisions for your Army to subsist. And upon the other two Fords, or passable places, if they may be commanded each of them by one Sconce, I think it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent then for you to give order for the raising of two Sconces, and to see them well furnished with Cannon, Men, Ammunition, and Victuals. But here you must note, if your Enemy do bring with him Punts, or Boats for to make a Bridge, or if he be able to procure Boats out of the Country for the aforesaid purpose, then I conceive the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Sconces is a needless labour: Therefore then the best way will be to march with your whole Army on the one side of the River, as your Enemy marcheth on the other (if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in your March be able to afford you Provisions
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62313:62"/>
for your Army) and so to fight with your Enemy as he passeth the River; or after your Enemy hath possessed the River, if you think you have Forces sufficient to encounter him.</p>
               <p>I hold it a most dangerous, and un-Souldier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like action for any Commander to divide his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the keeping of passages against an Army, whether it be upon a River, or any other strait and difficult passages: for you ought not to put all your Fortune in danger, and not all your Forces: To do so is a manifest folly. He is never thought a good Gamester that would hazard his whole rest upon less than the strength of his whole Game. My reasons for it are these: If your Enemy forceth one of those passages that you endeavour to keep, or find out some other passage that is not guarded, you will find much trouble and pains before you can draw your Forces together. And very likely the Enemy may prevent you from doing it, either by forcing you to fight before your Forces are come to you, or by keeping you from joyning your Forces together again. And when it cometh to pass that your Forces must leave the passage which they are to guard, or lose it by some occasion, there is a fear and terror stricken into the hearts of the people and Souldiers which trusted in that place; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to make experience of their valour, you lose, or are in danger to lose your Enterprise. Thus it came to pass at the coming of the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> in the year one thousand five hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, in the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the First, King of <hi>France,</hi> where it manifestly appeared to what pass it came to hold difficult places ill to be kept, and to stop
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62313:62"/>
passages, as you may see in <hi>Guicciard. lib.</hi> 12. For the reasons aforesaid the <hi>Romans</hi> never held nor guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the passages against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but rather would that their Armies should fight in open places where they might overcome him than to send them to the Mountains to be consumed with cold, or other discommodities of those places.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> Some certain Observations touching the profitableness of Intrenching, and some Directions for the same.</head>
               <p>THE Intrenchment incloseth your Army as a walled City, from whence you may march privately with such designs, leaving your Baggage in safety. The Intrenchment hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Enemy from constraining you to fight, unless when you please. The Intrenchment cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth you to take strong Cities in the face of a more puissant Army than your own. Briefly, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment is less subject to Infection, than the Villages are. In effect, an Army Intrenched and hutted, will rather subsist three months in Health in a Camp (in the Summer-time) than a fortnight in the best Villages. One of the most necessary parts of War is to know how well to incamp, and intrench.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:62313:63"/>When you come to besiege a Town before which you intend to intrench your Army, you ought to place your line of Circumvolation so near the Town, that you may be able to quarter your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my within it safely from your Enemies Shot; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing an hundred and fifty foot for an Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place between the Breast work and the front of the Quarters. The Trench without your Breast-work must be twelve foot in breadth, and six foot in depth, and three foot in breadth at the bottom. And the Earth that cometh out of the Trench will raise you a Breast-work, or Rampier of twelve foot in breadth at the bottom, six foot in height, and three foot in breadth at the top, with one foot bank. Upon your line of Circumvolation at the distance of every two hundred paces, you ought to have a Spur upon your line to flank it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Quarters of every Regiment upon your line of Circumvolation you must leave a small Avenue, that one single man and no more may be able to pass through at a time. You must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have in your line of Circumvolation four great Avenues for Carriages to pass through: and upon the great Avenues you must set up Turn-pikes, and without every Turn-pike there must be an Half-Moon. Here note, your Army must be divided into as many Quarters as you intend to have approaches against the Town. And you must raise some Batteries close within the line of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolation, there where you think the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous places may be for the same, for the annoying of any Enemy that may come to trouble you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:62313:63"/>If you suppose your Enemy may come so strong as to attempt the forcing of your Quarters, then ought the Trench of your line of Circumvolation to be in breadth sixteen foot, and in depth eight, and in breadth at bottom six foot. You ought likewise to have some Out-works, both Half-Moons, and Horn-works, within Musquet-shot of your Rampier or Breast-work. And if there be any Hills somewhat above Musquet-shot off from your line of Circumvolation, that may be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to your Enemy for the planting of his Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to play upon your Breast-work, or any part of your Quarters, you ought upon such an Hill to raise a Sconce. Thus you ought to observe and do, if you intend to fortifie your Leaguer strongly for to prevent a powerful Army from forcing your Quarters.</p>
               <p>If you have a desire upon any occasion to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench your Army in the Field for their better safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, your best way then will be to draw your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into as little a compass of ground as you may with convenience. For the less compass your Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier is, the easier it will be to defend: And if you have any occasion to send out any part, or parts of your Army upon any design, those which are left, the less compass of ground they have to desend, the better they will be able to do it.</p>
               <p>The Sod or Turf which you are to face your Intrenchment withal, if you are likely to have any Winter-Siege, or any long Siege, must be four or five inches long, or thereabouts, and in length four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fifteen inches diminished inwards.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Some certain Observations about the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Towns and strong Places.</head>
               <p>THere are seven ways to win Castles, strong Holds, and fortified Towns. First, by Treachery. Secondly, by Surprise, as by Petarring the Ports, and by Assaults. Thirdly, by Approaches, Batteries, and Assaults. Fourthly, by Approaches, Mining, Batteries, and Assaults. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Intrenching, Approaches, Mining, Battery, and Assaults. Sixthly, by Composition. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Starving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> esteemed no place strong, where his Ass loaden with Gold might enter. For the attempting, or taking of Towns by Surprise is very commendable in Officers, and sometimes very successful where the Officers have good Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and carry their business secretly, carefully, orderly, and valiantly. And there is no adventure for surprising a place more safe in War, than that which is farthest from suspicion of being underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and by such sudden designs one may gain that in one hour, the which may not be gotten any other way under a years service of an Army, or two.</p>
               <p>In the besieging of all Towns a Commander must be careful that his Enemy be not able to cut off
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62313:64"/>
his Victual, or his Retreat; and that he besiege no Town but such as he is able to cut off all relief from the Besieged. A Commander in Chief ought likewise to be careful how he adventureth upon Winter-Sieges, and long Winter-Services, or long Sieges at any time, unless the consequence of the place requireth it, and that he be sure to take it in the end. Long Sieges ruine Armies, empty the Purse, and most commonly it falleth out so, that it hindreth Armies from better imployments; and after a long Siege, though things fall out according to a Commanders desire, he will have little reason to brag of his Victory, when he vieweth his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, his Time, and his Army. The malice of a great Army is broken, and the force of it spent in a great Siege. <hi>Hannibal</hi> entring into <hi>Italy</hi> with his Army to make War upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> would not be drawn to besiege any of their Towns: all his War was to weaken them in Force and Reputation, knowing that when he was absolute Master of the Field, it would not be long e're the walled Cities would open their Gates, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any Engineer or Battery.</p>
               <p>If a General besiegeth any Town in which his intelligence, or his opinion hath deceived him so much, that he hath little hope of taking it, the speedy leaving off any such Enterprise doth excuse the rashness which might be imputed to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and a Chief Commander is not so much blamed for making trial of an ill-digested project, as he is for the obstinate continuing in the same: and if he refuseth to be led by reason in such a case, as being the best means to guide him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62313:65"/>
ends, he is commonly constrained by the commanding warrant of necessity to undergo the same thing upon harder conditions.</p>
               <p>It is most difficult to accomplish the design of a Siege, especially of any In land Town, so long as you have a good Army incamped near you, or likely to attend you speedily, the which Army will be able to cut off your Victuals, or constrain you to fight, unless you have two Bodies of Armies, that so with the one you may hold your Enemy in play, and with the other you may actuate without impeachment: or, unless you be Master at Sea of your Enemy, and then you may besiege any Sea Town of your Enemy with one Army, without any hazard at all, if you can have time to intrench your self strongly, before your Enemy be able to inforce you to fight.</p>
               <p>The surest, safest, and speediest way of taking any Town, if it requireth above three weeks Siege, and if your Enemy be able to bring any force to put relief into it, or to force you to fight, is, by intrenching your self before them. And when you are intrenched before a Town, where your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hopes in making you to quit it do consist in nothing else, but in cutting off your Victuals, you ought to have that foresight to bring with you, or cause to be brought into your Leaguer out of the Country so much Victuals as you judge to be necessary to serve your turn for the taking of the Town. This way you may take a Town with one Army, though your Enemy speedily attendeth you with another Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:62313:65"/>If you make a Siege with a small Army, with an intent to starve a strong Garrison, you must fortifie your Quarters one after another with the whole body of your Army; and then if you think fit you may run lines from one quarter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>Every Commander knoweth that mans flesh is the best Fortification that belongs to a Town; and where a Town is well manned, the best way of taking it is by Starving; and when a Town is weakly manned, the best way of taking it is by Battery and Assaults, or by Approaches, Mining, Battery, and Assaults.</p>
               <p>One thing more I could advise a Commander in Chief to be careful of, and that is, not to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault any Town, or Place without great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of obtaining that which he desireth; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to assault a Town, but when he may assault it at divers places at once. There is nothing so suddenly ruineth Armies as Assaults when they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry. For a General is certain to have his best men killed and spoiled upon such designs, and the rest so much discouraged, that it would prove ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous unto an Army if they should sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after it fight.</p>
               <p>Mines, where you may come to make them, are much better than Batteries for the taking of Towns or Castles: because they always prove much more dangerous, and terrible to an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by means of their sudden, and unexpected operations: and all sudden and unexpected actions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62313:66"/>
are very successful in all Martial Affairs. A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander cannot take any place of strength with any certainty or safety, without the use both of Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Mines.</p>
               <p>A Chief Commander when he marcheth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege a Town, ought to carry with him as much Mony, Ammunition, Victuals, and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, as is possible to be carried for the Siege: and those necessaries that he cannot carry with him, he must be careful to furnish himself withal with as much expedition as may be, for fear his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may find out some way that he doth not think of to prevent him of his necessaries, or at least cause them to be brought to him with much danger and trouble.</p>
               <p>The first thing you are to do when you are marching towards a Town to besiege it, is to send the most of your Horse and Dragooners, and with them likewise near as many Musqueteers as you send Horse, about three or four days before the body of your Army; that you may thereby keep all supplies from coming to the Town: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand your Horsemen to take up the Musqueteers now and then behind them upon the March, that they may be able to make the more expedition. You ought also to send along with the Horse your Quarter-Master General, and some two or three of your chief Engineers, that they may, by that time your Army cometh up, have pricked out the line of Circumvolation, and the Quarters for your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and to view how many approaches you may conveniently make towards the Town: For so
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62313:66"/>
many approaches as you make, so many quarters ought you to divide your Army into. After your Engineers, and Quarter Master-General have prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the line of Circumvolation, and the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then so soon as your Army cometh to the quarters, draw them into their Quarters, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to Hut with all the expedition they can. Likewise the line of Circumvolation ought to be divided into as many parts as there are quarters, according to the strength of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in each quarter. Then the Quarter-Masters of the Regiments of Foot ought to divide the ground equally amongst their Regiments; and each Quarter-Master of a Regiment is to measure out to each Company of his Regiment their ground: and the Officers are presently to set the Souldiers their work, for the raising of the line of Circumvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And the Souldiers ought to know when occasion requireth them to intrench themselves, that it doth as properly belong to their Duty to intrench themselves, as to stand Centry, or to carry their Arms.</p>
               <p>As soon as the earth is out of the Ditch for the raising of your Rampier, then may you begin your approaches. And you must always be careful to break ground at the first, as near the Town as possibly you may with convenience: And that you may break ground the nearer, and your men be the more bold, set your Pioners and some others to work as you come to your Quarters, for the making of great store of Cannon-Baskets, which may serve you in good stead for this use: At the beginning of every night set them up before those
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62313:67"/>
which are to break ground; and on each hand of those Cannon-Baskets which you set up before the Souldiers that are to break ground, you ought to set some Cannon-Baskets for the safeguard of the Guards. Your approaches ought always to be well flanked with Redoubts and Batteries.</p>
               <p>If a General come before a Town, where is but a weak Garrison, and many Out-works to the Town more than the Garrison is well able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, it will be good then for a General to attempt taking of some of the Out-works; and if he take any, he ought to begin his approaches from thence.</p>
               <p>The best time to assault the Out-works will be in the night.</p>
               <p>Through all dry Motes you are to approach the Rampier of a Town by Galleries under ground, under the dry Mote of the Town. And through all wet Motes you are to approach to the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier of a Town by Galleries above ground. But in running your Gallery under a dry Mote you must have a care that it be not discovered to the Enemy by carrying the earth out of your Gallery. The next thing you must have a care of, is, that you do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your self rightly, before you begin your Gallery, of what depth the Mote is, that you may begin to make your Gallery so far back, as to be sure to run your Gallery under the bottom of your Enemies Mote. For if your Enemy once discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against what part of the Wall you are running your Gallery, it is ten to one but your Enemy may
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62313:67"/>
prevent you, either by hindering you from advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing your Gallery to the Rampier, or by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing your Mines.</p>
               <p>When you have advanced your Galleries to the Rampier, let those that are appointed to assault the Breaches, and the Ports, have Souldiers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to throw Hand-granadoes, and to fall on with them: and give order to those that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to assault the Breaches, and scale the Walls, that as soon as they are gotten within the Wall, or Rampier of the Town with a reasonable number of men, they march unto that Port that is next them, and open it to let in the Foot, and Horse that do there attend. And for this purpose there ought to be some Souldiers appointed to carry fit Instruments for the breaking open the Gates of a Town.</p>
               <p>When a Port is opened, let the Officers have order presently to repair to the Market place with their Souldiers for clearing of the Enemy from that place. And you ought to command the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers that no man offer to pillage upon pain of death, until all the Enemy within the Town that carry Arms be either killed or disarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Besides the word you give to your Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to know one the other by, you should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to wear something about them that they may know one the other from the Enemy.</p>
               <p>If your Officers when they assault a Town do find the Town to be cut off by the Enemy by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing any works within the Rampier, or Wall of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62313:68"/>
the Town, then a Chief Commander should give Orders to the Officers appointed for the Assault, that in case they find any such thing, then they should do their best to plant themselves with their Souldiers on the top of the Rampier only; which must be done by help of the Engineers Work-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, and Pioners, who must be appointed to be in a readiness with Saccots in their hands, when they shall be called upon to fortifie any place that the Souldiers may possess themselves of, if occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. The like order must be observed in assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Out-works, as is here set down in this last observation concerning the assaulting of a Town.</p>
               <p>You ought likewise to have in a readiness Ovens to heat Cannon-Bullets red-hot upon all such Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries whereby you can conveniently come to shoot them into the Town. Likewise your Mortar-pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces must be so conveniently placed, that you may shoot Mortar-granadoes into the Town, and wait a little to see the effect of your Fire-Bullets, and Granadoes.</p>
               <p>Here note, that you must not shoot any Fire-Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, nor Mortar-Granadoes into the Town, until one, half hour before you begin to assault: For if you do use the Fire-Bullets, and Mortar-Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does before the aforesaid time, you will teach your Enemy to find out a way to prevent you for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any mischief with them at your Assault: And likewise your Enemy being used to them, the fear of the danger of them will by use be taken away,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62313:68"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               <p>One thing more I think fit to add to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. There are two ways for blocking up of an Haven, or a River. The first is, You must make of Iron a thing in form of a Frisrutter; the beams through which the cross-bars go must be twelve foot in length, and the cross-bars that go through the beam must be of that length, that when one of these iron Frisrutters is set down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Haven, or River, the cross-bars of the iron Frisrutter must be of that length as to reach upon an High-water within six foot of the top of the water. This is one of the best inventions that I know for the blocking up of an Haven, or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. There is no way that I know to remove these Frisrutters out of an Haven or River, which is blockt up with them, and having so many of these Frisrutters made in a readiness before-hand as will block up an Haven or River upon which you have a design, and having all other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in a readiness for the letting of those Frisrut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters down into the Haven, or River, you may
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62313:69"/>
block up an Haven or River in four and twenty hours time.</p>
               <p>There is another way of blocking up an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or River, by throwing great Stones into them, and leaving small passages for the water to pass through. By this Invention the King of <hi>France</hi> won <hi>Rochel.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Some Directions for the Removing of an Army that is Intrenched before a Town.</head>
               <p>IF an Enemy be intrenched before a Town, it most often proveth hard to remove him, if he hath men enough to defend his line of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolation, and keep his Approaches. The most usual ways to remove an Enemy which is intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before a Town, are these four. The first is, to attempt the cutting off your Enemies Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from him. The second is, if your Enemy hath by over-sight left some Hills near the Town without his line of Circumvolation unfortified: and if the Hills be so, that Ordnance being plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, they will command the ground between them and the Town; then you may by possessing your self of these Hills force your way

to the Town either by a forceable Assault under the shelter of your Cannon, or by Approaches: Or if any Hills lie so that you may command the ground close within your Enemies line of Circumvolation, planting Ordnance on them, that your men may under succour of your Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be able to force your Enemies line of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolation; then you may beat him off his line of Circumvolation, and so force his Quarter. The third way is to march into some of your Enemies Countries. The fourth and last way is to besiege some of his Chief Towns, that you have certain intelligence do want either Men, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, or Ammunition.</p>

               <p>If a Garrison lieth so, that it cannot easily be relieved with Ammunition, then the Governour ought to have a Powder-mill in his Town; and in his Magazine good store of Brimstone, and one that is skilful in making of Powder, and another that hath skill in making Match: and he must be careful to sow at a fit time of the year a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent quantity of Hemp-seed for the making of Match. If the Corn-Mills about a Town lie so, that the Enemy may be able to spoil, and destroy them, then the Governour ought to see his Town furnished with Hand-mills. He must also have a special care that his Walls be out of danger of sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; the Gates of his Town not subject to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarred. Now the best way to prevent petarring the Ports, is to have Draw-bridges, and Half-moons, without the Ports, and Port-cullices at the Ports, and Turn-pikes upon the High-ways right against your Half-moons. The ways for the Rounds ought to be easie, and convenient; the Sentinels well set: the Guards very exact; and the Companies that are to watch should always draw Lots for their Guards.</p>
               <p>And if you suspect any Officers, or Souldiers for betraying your Town (as in Civil Wars Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are apt to do, or when they are ill paid) then must you order your Guards after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Let your Companies that watch draw Lots, for their Guards upon the Parrado place every night: when they have drawn Lots for their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62313:70"/>
Guards, let those Companies whose Lot falleth to watch at the Ports be ordered after this manner. That Company whose Lot falleth to watch at a Port, let the one half of that Company watch at the Port that is appointed them by Lot, and the other half at one of the Half-moons at one of the other Ports next adjoyning. And all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies that are to watch at the Ports are to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the like manner.</p>
               <p>Now here you must note, that if a Governour will have his Town secured from sudden Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he must have always without the Ports of his Town Half-moons, and Turn-pikes upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways right against the Half-moons, and Port-cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices at his Ports. The Gentlemen that are to watch at each Port-cullis ought to be four, which must be drawn, and relieved from the Main-guard. These Gentlemen ought to be lock'd up in the place where the Port-cullices stand, until they be relieved: and the Captain of the Main-guard ought always to keep the Key. All the other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies appointed for the Watch, are to watch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto their Lots.</p>
               <p>All means must be used to hinder Intelligences, and Treacheries; the Guards doubled always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Market-days, and Fair-days: and upon any Alarm those Souldiers that have not the Guard ought to repair with their Arms speedily to their Colours; and from thence the Companies are to make all the haste possible to attain to the place that is appointed them to defend upon any Alarm. Thus much every Company that hath not the Watch
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62313:71"/>
ought to know, and have order for the same before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
               <p>If you mistrust the fidelity of the Towns-men, you ought to keep a good Main-guard upon the Market-place, and small Guards at all the cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streets, and then make it death for any Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to come out of his house upon any Alarm. And if the Towns-men have any meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at any time without the Governours consent, they ought to be imprisoned. The like must be observed if they are found out of their Houses af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nine of the Clock at night. Likewise if you mistrust the fidelity of the Towns-men, it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that there be a Work raised against the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier of the Town, the which must face the Town, and command part of it, and one of the Ports. In this work you ought to build places for to keep your Magazine in. And at the entrance of this Work without the Port of the aforesaid Work, there ought to be a Draw-bridge and a Port cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis; and the Draw-bridge ought never to be down, or let down but at relief time. The Ports of your Town ought to be shut at Sun-setting, and to be opened a little after Sun-rising. Before you open your Ports in a morning, you ought to send out small Parties to search all the suspicious places about the Town for Ambushes. After these parties are returned, finding no danger, you may open your Ports, and set out your Day-Guards for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your Cattel: and then the Towns-men may drive forth their Cattel. You ought likewise to have a Trumpeter to watch continually on the highest Steeple in your Town, to give you notice
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62313:71"/>
of the approach of any Enemy by day, or of any Alarm, or Fire by night.</p>
               <p>A Governour of a Town should be careful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have parties abroad, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter secure his own Quarters, and trouble the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And especial care must be taken for getting constant intelligence from the next Frontier Towns of his Enemy.</p>
               <p>A Governour of a Town ought to see that he have as many Out-works raised about his Town as is necessary, and not more; and that all his Out-works be commanded by the Rampier of the Town.</p>
               <p>If the consequence of the Town requireth it, and if a Governour may by raising a Sconce or two secure his Town, and the relief of it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it were very fit to do it. But he must have a care that the Sconces which he raiseth for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Town be raised in such convenient places, that an Enemy when he cometh to Besiege the Town, may not be able to plant himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sconces and the Town.</p>
               <p>In the fortifying of a Town if the Governour lay many Elms, or Oak-Trees, in the Bulwarks which he raiseth about the Town, he will find it a good prevention to hinder the Enemy from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Bulwarks: and likewise it doth strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Bulwarks very much against Batteries.</p>
               <p>If a Governour of a Town hath certain intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62313:72"/>
that he shall be besieged, and findeth that he hath not Horse meat sufficient for the Horse that are in the Garrison answerable to the rest of his Provisions in the Town; and in case he hath not time to provide more, then the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ought to send away so many of his Horse as he hath not meat sufficient for to hold out with the rest of his Provisions, or such as he supposeth he shall not have occasion to use, unto one of the next Towns that belong to his Party.</p>
               <p>Likewise if a Governour of a Town find that he hath more Out-works than his Souldiers are well able to defend, it will be safest for him then to slight those Out-works that he thinketh he shall have less occasion to use.</p>
               <p>A Governour must be careful of using his best endeavours and skill valiantly to defend his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. For next mans flesh, Out-works are the best strength that belongeth to a Town. And upon all occasions he must be careful to cut off the Out-works of the Town; and the Town, as often as the Enemy shall inforce him to it.</p>
               <p>The greatest part of the Cannon of the Town ought to be planted against the Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; and the Governour ought to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that they play upon his Enemies approaches as often as his Ammunition will give leave.</p>
               <p>A Governour should be careful to sally no oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with strong parties than necessity requireth, or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62313:72"/>
the advantages that the Enemy by his carelesness, or boldness shall give him occasion.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of every night you ought to make sallies with small parties upon the Enemies Workmen that do then approach, and break ground, and now and then to sally with a strong Party.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of the night you ought to make some fires so near the Enemies approaches as you can conveniently, that you may be able to see by the light of the fire where your Enemies break ground, that so you may the better hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them by shooting at them with the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
               <p>For which occasion your Town ought to be the better provided of Wood, and Pitch-Barrels. And there must be care taken to lay some Souldiers with Fowling-pieces or Fire-locks, behind little small Breast works not far from the fires, to spoil those that may come to put out the fires.</p>
               <p>If a Governour of a Town be sure he hath more Powder than is answerable to the rest of his Provisions (the which he ought always to have) then may a Governour undermine his Enemies <hi>Corps de Guards,</hi> when they are advanced very near unto his Out-works. And always when he spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Mine, he ought to sally strong on his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Trenches, and to command those Officers, if it be possible, to nail the Enemies Ordnances; and for that purpose some Souldiers ought to be appointed to carry fit instruments with them. And
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62313:73"/>
whensoever you sally strong on your Enemy, you must likewise have in a readiness some Spademen to slight such of the Enemies works as your Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers shall possess themselves of Also you must have a care to appoint many Souldiers for the throwing in of Hand-Granadoes into your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <hi>Corps de Guards;</hi> the which will be a special means to help your Souldiers for the beating your Enemy out of their <hi>Corps de Guards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If your Town be fortified with a dry Mote, and if your Town be well manned, it is much stronger then a wet Mote: And as soon as you see upon what parts of the Town your Enemy doth make his approaches, then dig a Trench in the bottom of your dry Mote, so far as you see your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies approaches are in breadth against your Town, about eight or ten foot in breadth, and so deep, until you come either to Water or Rock. But if you are fain to dig deep before you find either, then make a Gallery under ground under the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of your dry Mote, so far as your Enemies approaches go. For which purpose your Town ought to be furnished with good store of Timber. And if you observe the aforesaid directions, it will be impossible for your Enemy to run his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries to the Rampier of the Town without being discovered: and then you may easily prevent him from doing you any hurt, either by his Galleries, or his Mines.</p>
               <p>If your Town be fortified with a wet Mote, then the best and strongest Fortifications that belong to a wet Mote is a false bray of some twenty
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62313:73"/>
foot in breadth; and when you perceive where your Enemy will make over his Gallery to your Rampier, then must you plant two of the best pieces of Cannon that you have in your false Bray just against the mouth of your Enemies Galleries; the which two pieces must be sunk so deep, that they may play almost level with the water: By this means you will be able to do your Enemy the more mischief, and secure your Ordnance the better from your Enemy. For the more security of your Ordnance and Cannoneers from your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Batteries, you ought to raise the Traverses close to your Cannons cross your false Bray.</p>
               <p>In desending the Out-works of a Town that is fortified with a wet Mote, there must be a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al care, and resolution shewed: For the Out works being once lost, you can Sally no more on your Enemy.</p>
               <p>I will conclude with this advice to all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that are to defend a besieged Town, that they have a special care of these three things. The first is, that from the beginning to the end of a Siege, their care be such, that their Garrisons spend no more Victuals daily, than necessity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. The second thing is, that they do not vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waste their Men, Ammunition, and firing, but that they do so order the expence of these things, that they may be able to hold out with their Victuals: For many Governours do either cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, or ignorantly make a waste of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said things, that they may give over Towns the sooner to their Enemy, and that, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62313:74"/>
with honour enough; whereas their own cowardliness hath brought them to want necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the defence of their Towns, more than the pressing Service of their Enemies. But if such Governours had their deserts, they ought to die for such carelesness and cowardliness.</p>
               <p>The third and last thing is, that they carefully defend their Out-works, and their Town with all the Skill, Judgment, and Valour that they and their Garrisons can afford; and that they so order their Sallies, and the cutting off their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works and Towns, that their Garrisons and Towns may be able to hold out so long as the Provisions of the Town shall last.</p>
               <p>One thing more I think fit to adde in this place, a way to break a Bome, or a Bridge that shall be made over a River for hindering Provisions from coming to the Town that is besieged. Take a great Ship, and let it be made with Mason-work within in the manner of a Vaulted Cave, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hatches lay Mill-stones, and other Stones of great weight, and within lay many Barrels of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Vault. By means of the danger you will hardly get any man to conduct it; therefore you must tye a great Beam at the end of the Ship to make it keep a straight course in the midst of the Stream; and when you have a fair wind, lay your Train and set it going.</p>
               <p>If the Corn you keep in store for your Garrison be now and then dusted, it will keep good in a Garner seven years; but if your Corn by chance
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62313:74"/>
grow musty, then make Bisket of it; for then it will make as good Bisket as the best Corn in the world.</p>

               <p>A Conquerour ought to know that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Victory is the seed of a new War. If thou hast made a Conquest with thy Sword, think not to maintain it with thy Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter; neither conceive that new Favours can can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel old injuries. No Conquerour sitteth secure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his new-gotten Throne, so long as they subsist in power that were dispossessed of their Possessions by his Conquest.</p>
               <p>If thou hast Conquered a Land, whose Laws and Language differ not from thine, change not their Laws and Taxes; and so the two Kingdoms will in a short time incorporate, and make one Body. But if the Laws and Language differ, it is difficult to maintain thy Conquest; which that thou mayest the more easily do, observe three things: First, to live there in person (or rather send Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) Secondly, to assist the weak Inhabitants, and weaken the mighty. Thirdly, to admit no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Foreigner to reside there. Remember <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. of <hi>France,</hi> how suddenly he took <hi>Millan,</hi> and how soon he lost it.</p>
               <p>Here you must note, if you Conquer a Free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to assure your Conquest you must do these two
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62313:76"/>
things; First, to take away the desire of Revolting from those whom you have Conquered. To do this, you must not take away (at least during the life of those who have lived so) their hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their Liberties by their good Obedience, either to them or their Children: And therefore you must always begin by a fair way, and establish a condition for them whom you have conquered, which may be sure both for their Life, their Wives, and their Goods.</p>
               <p>There is another means, whereof the Antients made a profitable use, and is now wholly left, the which I have spoken of before, and do marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously approve of, which is to establish Colonies, and to transport the people from one Country to another. The conquered people will have much the better of it by their change; for they shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy such liberties as the people do amongst whom they live; whereas in their own Country they will be kept so much under, that they can hope for nothing but their lives. And the Conquerour by this means will be much the more assured of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people in Obedience.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> Some Directions for the Preventing of Civil Wars.</head>
               <p>A Kingdom, or State, in preventing Civil War ought to observe these four principal things. The first is, that a Kingdom or State ought to have Fortresses, but good ones, and few in number, and none within the heart of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And you ought not to perpetuate any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither to Families, nor yet for life.</p>
               <p>The second thing is (if it be possible to be done without the endangering of a Kingdom or State) that there be but one Religion in a Kingdom or State.</p>
               <p>The third is; that Kingdom or State that will live secure from Civil Wars must be provident to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass a rich publick Treasure; that when a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or State come to be over-populous, they may be able to imploy their people in Plantations, or in a Foreign War. But the principal and able remedy against Civil War is to entertain a Foreign War. This chaseth away idleness, setteth all on work; and particularly this giveth satisfaction to ambitious and stirring spirits; it banisheth Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, maketh your people Warlike, and maintaineth you in such reputation amongst your Neighbours, that you are the Arbitrator of all their Differences. But this Maxim is not good to be observed except by such Kingdoms, and States that are able to go
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62313:77"/>
through with the designs they undertake. For as I find it necessary to Rich and Potent Kingdoms and States; so I find it hurtful to petty Kingdoms and States; because being too weak to gain by it, they will in the end but lose their Honours, and Moneys, and impoverish themselves, and increase their Enemies.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last thing is, whereas the poorer and meaner people, that have no interest in the Common-weal, but the use of breath, these are always dangerous to the peace of a Kingdom, and having nothing to lose, willingly embrace all means of Innovation, in hope of gaining something by other mens ruine: there are these three means left for a State to ease it self of this sort of people, either to imploy them abroad in Plantations, or in a War, or to interess them in the quiet of the Common-weal by learning them such Trades and Occupations as may give them a taste of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of peace, and the benefit of a Civil life.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> Some Observations shewing how necessary it is for <hi>England,</hi> or any other State, or Kingdom, providently to prepare a Rich Publick Treasure before-hand, either for the Defence of themselves, or offending their Enemies. And how necessary it is to Train up their people to Martial Affairs.</head>
               <p>LET us first consider what danger a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Prince, or State is in, that is not so provident to provide a Rich Publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure before-hand, either for a Defensive War, or an Offensive War: For in the Wars you must up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions, have your hands in your Purses: and having not a Rich Publick Treasure before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, no Kingdom, or State, is able to make an Offensive War, to gain Countries, or Honour, unless they be drawn into a Country by a Party. Nor is such a Kingdom or State well able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it self in a Defensive War. For if an Enemy landeth in a Country, the obedience which at other times is willingly given to Princes, or States, is greatly weakned at such times, and all necessary means to maintain a War, is hardly drawn from the Subject; and the common people will be easily drawn to change Masters, when their oppression shall be more frequent from their Friends, than
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62313:78"/>
their Enemies: and such great oppressions at such a time upon the Commons (which of necessity there must be, when a Rich Treasure is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently provided before-hand) will prove very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to any Kingdom or State in a Defensive War. Therefore that Kingdom or State that will live securely from an Enemy, must have a special care to provide a Rich Publick Treasure before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand against unusual, and extraordinary casualties, which are not to be removed but by speedy and effectual Remedies. And no expedition can be made to avoid the dangers and ruine of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or State, either in an Offensive, or a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive War, without a Rich Publick Treasure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided before-hand. And it is an easie thing for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of a Kingdom or State to raise a Rich Publick Treasure out of the extravagant Expences of the people, without giving any discontent at all; as having an Excise upon all the Beer, Ale, and Wine that is sold in all Ale-houses, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns in a Kingdom or State, and likewise upon all the Tobacco that is brought into a Kingdom or State, and upon all kinds of Laces, Cards, and Dice.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude, and speak something how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it is for a Kingdom, or State to train up their people to the use of Arms. Such Kingdoms where the men are trained up in Academies of vertuous actuality, do always keep their Honours at an high price, affording at all times men of absolute and compleat carriage, both for designment and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. I account a Rich Publick Treasure provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently provided before hand, and a people well
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62313:78"/>
trained in Martial Affairs, to be two of the only Pillars (next under God) that will preserve a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or State from ruine and danger.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> That Reading, and Discourse are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to make a Souldier perfect in the Art Military, how great soever his knowledge may be, which long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and much practice of Arms hath gained.</head>
               <p>MEN have two ways to come by Wisdom, either by their own harms, or other mens miscasualties: And wise men are wont to say (not by chance, nor without reason) that he who will see what shall be, let him consider what hath been: For all things in the world at all times have their very counterpane with the times of old.</p>
               <p>But here I would have a prudent Souldier note, that it is a matter very dangerous to follow wholly the examples of another, if a man in general or in particular have not the same Reason, the same Wit, and the same Fortune. For albeit humane actions seem to be so joyned and coupled together, that that which now is present and hath been, ought to be again: yet notwithstanding the accidents which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62313:79"/>
are so different, and diverse, that no man whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be (except very prudent) can always go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himself in matters present by the example of that which is past.</p>
               <p>I take the Office of a Chief Commander to be a subject capable of the greatest wisdom that may be apprehended by natural means, being to manage a multitude of disagreeing minds, as a fit instrument to execute a design of much consequence, and great expectation, and to qualifie both their apprehensions and affections according to the accidents which rise in the course of his directions; besides the true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he ought to have of such circumstances as are most important to a fortunate end; wherein our providence can not have enough either from learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or experience, to prevent disadvantages, or to take hold of opportunities. And therefore that Souldier that is only trained up in the School of Practice, and taught his Rudiments under a few years experience, which serveth to interpret no other Author but it self, nor can prove his Maxims but by his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; my opinion is, his meer practical knowledge cannot make him a perfect Souldier, nor fit to be a General.</p>
               <p>Experience joyned with Reading and Discourse, do feast the mind with much variety, and choice of matter, or entertain it with novelties incident to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, and use of Arms. And therefore it is not only Experience, and Practice which maketh a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier worthy of his name; but the knowledge of the manifold accidents which rise from the variety of humane actions is best, and most speedily learned
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62313:79"/>
by reading History: For upon the variety of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that you shall meet withal in History, you me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the effects of other mens adventures, that their harms may be your warnings, and their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py proceedings your fortunate directions in the Art Military. These examples which are taken from History, are but a plain kind of principles, on which the mind worketh to her best advantage, and useth reason with such dexterity, that of inequalities she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth an equality, and of dissimilitudes most sweet resemblances; and so she worketh her own perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Discourse, and in time groweth so absolute in knowledge, that her sufficiency needeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directions.</p>
               <p>It is most requisite likewise for a Commander to look into the diversity of orders for imbattelling, and to weigh the nature thereof, that he may with knowledge apply them to the quality of any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
