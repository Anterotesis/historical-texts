            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> one sayth, <hi>The one is not to erre, the other is to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from the power of error.</hi> Times wombe bringeth forth many truths, though truth be not a debter to Time, because Time putteth new robes on old Truth; But truth is <hi>Gods</hi> debter, and oweth her being to him only. It is a great evil under the Sun, and the <hi>sicknesse</hi> of mans vanity, that the name of holy men should be a web to make garments of for new opinions, but the errors of holy men have no whitenesse, nor holinesse from men. And it is a wrong that mens praise should be truths pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and mens gaine, truths losse. Yet I shall heartily desire that men herein observe the art of deep providence, for the <hi>Creator</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth darknes to bring forth her birth of light, and <hi>God</hi> doth so over-aw, with a wise super-dominion, mens errors, that contrary
<pb facs="tcp:49702:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to natures way, from collision of opinions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth truth; and disputes, as stricken flint, cast fire for light, <hi>God</hi> raising out of the dust and ashes of errors a new living truth. What mistakes, errors, or heresies have been anent <hi>Church government,</hi> that vigilant and never slumbering wisdome of Providence, hath thence made to appeare the sound doctrine of <hi>Gods</hi> Kingdome. So here <hi>Satan</hi> shapeth, and <hi>God</hi> seweth, and maketh the garment. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is but dregs, by the artifice of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing Providence, from whence are distilled strong and cordiall waters. And what <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> hath conceived for a Hierarchy and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ceremonies, hath put <hi>Christ</hi> in his two witnesses in <hi>Brittaine</hi> to advocate for the truth and native simplicity of his own Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But I heartily desire not to appeare as an adversary to the holy, reverend, and learned Brethren who are sufferers for the truth, for there be wide marches betwixt striving, and disputing. <hi>Why should we strive? for we be Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> the Sonnes of one father, the borne Citizens of one mother <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> To dispute is not to contend. We strive as we are carnall, we dispute as we are men, we war <hi>from our</hi>

               <hi>lusts</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">James 4. 1.</note> we dispute from diversity of star-light, and day-light. Weaknesse is not wickednesse, a roving of wit must not be deemed a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of will, a broken inginne may part with a dead child, and yet be a Mother of many healthy children. And while our reverend and deare Brethren, fleeing the coast of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylons</hi> wicked borders, aym to shore upon truth, wind may deceive good Sailors, naturall land-motions (as when heavy bodies move downward, toward their own (clay Countrey) are upon a straight line. But Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of sailing are not by right lines, but rather by Sea-circles. We often argue and dispute, as we saile. Where grace and weight of Scripture make motion, we walke, in a right line, toward <hi>God.</hi> But where opinion, a messenger only sent to spie the Land of lies, and truth, usurpeth to conduct us, what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell then we goe about truth, rather then lodge with Truth. And <hi>Christ</hi> his Kingdome, Scepter, Glory, <hi>Babylons</hi> fall, be the materiall object of opinions, on both sides; And yet the word of <hi>God</hi> hath a right lith, that cannot suffer division. In <hi>Gods</hi> matters there be not, as in Grammar, the positive and comparative

degrees, there are not here, truth, and more true, and most true. Truth is in an indivisible line, which hath no latitude, and cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of spleeting. And therefore we may make use of the Philosophers word, <hi>amicus Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas.</hi> Though <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> bee our beloved friends, yet the truth is a dearer friend: The Sonnes of <hi>Babylon</hi> make out-cries of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and diversity of Religions amongst us, but every opinion is not a new Religion.</p>

The instituted <hi>Church</hi> of the New Testament is an organicall body of diverse members, of eyes, eares, feete, hands, of Elders governing, and a people governed. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
               <p>But a company of believers, meeting for publick edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by common consent, are not formally such a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for they are a body not Organicall, but all of one and the same nature, all believers and saints by calling, and are not a body of Officers governing, and people gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for they are, as they are a visible <hi>Church,</hi> a single uncompounded body, wanting Officers, and are as yet to choose their Officers: <hi>and all thus combined are not Officers,</hi> Rom. 10. 14.

The major of our proposition is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our brethren, who cite, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. To prove a single Congregation to be the onely visible Church instituted in the <hi>New Testament.</hi> Nothing can be said against this, but a <hi>Church</hi> of Governours and People governed is an instituted visible Church; but there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted visible Church before there be Governours, but such an instituted Church we cannot read of in <hi>Gods</hi> Word, which doth and may exercise Church acts of government without any Officers at all.</p>

If this be a good reason that such a company should be the only instituted Church in the New Testament having power of all the Ordinances, because they may appoint Officers, who have such a power; then any ten believers, who have never sworne the Church-Covenant, meeting in private to exhort one another is also the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted <hi>Church</hi> ministeriall, in the New Testament, for they have power to make such Officers, and may invest themselves in right, to all the Ordinances of <hi>Christ,</hi> by our brothers Doctrine, 3.

               <p>The <hi>Author</hi> sayth, this company of believers and <hi>Church</hi> which wanteth Officers, and (as we have heard) is compleat without them, is the corporation to which <hi>Christ</hi> hath given the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven; which deserveth our brotherly censure: for wee then aske a Scripture for the Lords giving of the keys to Pastors and Elders; if the keys be given to <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16. as a professing believer, by what Word of <hi>God</hi> are they given to <hi>Peter,</hi> as to an Apostle and Pastor, it would seem the Pastors have not the keys <hi>jure Divino;</hi> for by this argument our Divines prove the Bishop not to bee an Office of power and jurisdiction above a <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> because the keys were not given to <hi>Peter</hi> as to the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> but as to a Pastor of the <hi>Church,</hi> and indeed this would conclude that Pastors are not Officers

of authority and power of jurisdiction, <hi>jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hence the question is, if it can be concluded that the keyes of of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16. Mat. 18. <hi>were given to</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>as he represented all professing believers, or if they were given for the good of professing believers, but to</hi> Peter <hi>as carrying the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Apostles, Pastors, and Church-guides?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Distinction, <hi>There is one question of the power of the keyes, and to whom they are committed, and another of the exercise of them, and toucheth the government of the Church, if it be popular and democraticall or not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Dist. <hi>It is not inconvenient, but necessary that Christ should give to his Church, gifts, Pastors and Teachers, of the which gifts the</hi> Church <hi>is not capable, as a subject as if the Church might exercise the Pastor and Doctors place: and yet the</hi> Church <hi>is capable of these gifts, as the object, and end, because the fruit and effect of these gifts redoundeth to the good of the Church, see</hi>

               <p>1. <hi>Concl.

Our brethren prove the keys, to be a part of the liberty of the redeemed ones, but counterfeit professors are not redeemed ones, nor have they that liberty purchased to them in <hi>Christ.</hi> 4 It shall follow, that our brethren widely mistake a supposed difference which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, betwixt the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian Church,</hi> to wit, that to make men members of the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> externall holinesse, as to be borne <hi>Jewes,</hi> was sufficient, and to be circumcised, and not a bastard, not descended within three or foure Generations of a <hi>Moabite,</hi> or <hi>Ammonite,</hi> but that the visible <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> after <hi>Christ</hi> must be the bride of <hi>Christ,</hi> and by true Faith united to him. Whereas the members of a Christian visible <hi>Church</hi> are and may be hypocrites, though not known to be such, as were the members of the <hi>Iewish Church.</hi> Also <hi>Mat.</hi> 18 18, 19. <hi>Christ</hi> changeth the persons, <hi>v.</hi> 17. after he hath spoken of the <hi>Church v.</hi> 17. he sheweth <hi>v.</hi> 18. of what <hi>Church</hi> he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and directeth his speech to these <hi>to whom he spake</hi> v. 1. <hi>to the Disciples who were Pastors, verily I say unto you, What soever yee shall bind on Earth, shall be hond in Heaven,</hi> and therefore none can make an argument from, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. to wit thus, to as many are the keys promised, as are builded on the Rock, but all the faithfull are builded on the Rock, <hi>Ergo</hi> to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are the keys promised. 1. The proposition is not in the Text either expressely, or by consequent. 2. The proposition is false, for the Catholick invisible <hi>Church</hi> is builded on the rock, but by our Brethrens confession the keys are not given to the Catholick invisible Church, but only to such a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of professing believers, as make a Parishionall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 4. That <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh to <hi>Peter</hi> as to one representing the Apostles, and not as to one representing all believers, is cleare. 1. Because by the confession of our <hi>Brethren bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and loosing are denyed to many that make</hi> Peters <hi>confession, thou art</hi> Jesus <hi>the Son of the living God,</hi> as to believing Women and children; and many out of <hi>Church. state.</hi> 2. If believers as giving <hi>Peters</hi> confession, and <hi>as builded upon the rock, Christ,</hi>

               <p>But I answer, the place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. is controverted, and we doubt not, but of that same nature, with the power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. But for private forgiving, it is not the <hi>Church-forgiving</hi> here meant, because 1.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Two things are here said, 1. That all, even the whole <hi>Church,</hi> must meete for administration of the Ordinances of <hi>God,</hi> that so all and every one of the <hi>Church</hi> may be actors and Judges in dispensing of censures, this we take to be popular governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. That there is a necessity of personall presence of all and every one of the <hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Hence</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Quest. 3. <hi>Whether or no the multitude of Believers, and the whole people are to be judges, so, as private Christians out of Office are to exercise judiciall acts of the keys?</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>For the more easie clearing of the Question, let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
               <p>1. Dist. <hi>There is a dominion of Government Lordly and Kingly, and this is in</hi> Christ <hi>only in relation to his</hi> Church <hi>and in civill judges, and is no wayes in</hi> Church-<hi>guides, who are not Lords over the Lords inheritance; there is a government Ministeriall, of service, under</hi> Christ, <hi>and this is due to</hi> Church-guides.</p>
               <p>2. Dist. <hi>Regall power, being a civill power founded in the Law of nature</hi> (<hi>for the</hi> Ants <hi>have a King</hi>) <hi>may well be in the people ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and subjectively, as in the fountaine, nature teaching every communitie to govern themselves, and to hold off injuries, if not by themselves, yet by a King, or some selected Rulers; but power of</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49702:23"/>
                  <hi>Church-government being supernaturall, and the acts of Church-government, and of the casting such as offend out of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, being supernaturall, neither of them can be originally in the multitude of professing beleevers, but must be communicated by Christ to some certaine professing beleevers, and these are Officers. Therefore to put power and acts of government in all professors, is a naturall way drawne from civill incorporations. Christ is not ruled by our Lawes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Dist. <hi>The government of Christs Kingdome is the most free and willing government on earth; yet it is a government properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for there be in it authoritative commandements, and Ecclefia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke coaction, upon the danger of soule penalties; in regard of the former, all the people by consent and voluntary agreement have hand in election of Officers, inflicting of censures, because it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all: but in regard of the latter, the whole people are not over the whole people; they are not all Kings reigning in Christs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over Kings, but are divided into governours and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and therefore the rulers Ecclesiasticke onely, by power of office, are in Christs roome, over the Church, to command, sentence, judge, and judicially to censure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Distinct. <hi>The Officiall power of governing superaddeth to the simple acts of popular consenting, the officiall authoritative and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active power of Christs Sceptor in discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That distinction in the sense holden by our brethren</hi>

                  <hi>that the state of the Church is popular, and the government Aristocraticall in the hands of the Eldership, is no wayes to he holden; nor doe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risian</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Our brethren in the answer to the questions sent to them from <hi>England,</hi> explaine their minde thus: 1. <hi>We acknowledge a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, whose worke it is to teach and rule, and whom the people ought</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Quest 15.</note> 
                  <hi>to obey, and we condemne a meere popular government, such as our writers condemne in Morellius.</hi> They adde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Government meerly Aristocraticall, where all authority is in the hands of the Eldership, excluding the people from intermedling by way of power, we conceive to be without warrant and injurious to the people, infringing their liberties in chusing Officers, admitting mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, censuring offenders, even Ministers,</hi> Col. 4. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49702:24"/>
To which doctrine we oppose these conclusions:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Concl.</hi> Our brethren hold a meere popular government, with <hi>Morellius.</hi> 1. Because nothing is left peculiar in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Officers which all the people have not. 2. Because a greater power of <hi>Church-</hi>Jurisdiction, as I shall prove, is given to the people then to the guides; for, cursing by Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all the Officers, and blessing of them by pardoning their faults, and admitting of Members and laying on of hands, is the greatest power that can be given to people. But this and many other acts of jurisdiction the people have by our brethrens Doctrine. 3. The people is no more obedient to the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in teaching, then <hi>Indians and Infidels,</hi> who are hearers of the word, and are under an obligation to obey the word; and under the very same obligation of an Evangelicke offer made to all: <hi>The people</hi> (say they) <hi>are under the obligation of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Pastorall teaching, under the paine of Church censures, but so are not Indians, who may be onely hearers, but are in no Church-membership.</hi> I answer, Obligation to <hi>Church censures</hi> from the Pastors, as Pastors, lyeth not on the people, by our brethrens doctrine. 1. Because Pastors, as Pastors, are not the Church builded on the rocke, nor the Spouse of Christ, nor any part thereof; nor any part of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> to the which <hi>Christ</hi> hath given the Keys: for the visible <hi>Church</hi> is a compleate Church <hi>in esse, &amp; in operari,</hi> in their being and <hi>Church actions</hi> of a visible <hi>Church</hi> without all Pastors of any Officers, as they teach. 2. Because Pastors are onely parts of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> as believers, and so have the power of the Keyes as believers; and this the believers have, which the Pastors have not; and so seeing the Pastors as Pastors have not the Keyes, nor can they use the Keyes, or excommunicate as parts or members of the visible <hi>Church;</hi> because, as Pastors, they are neither parts nor members of the Church, but adjuncts, and meere accidents of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore the people are under no obligation of obedience to <hi>Pastors,</hi> as <hi>Pastors</hi> under paine of Ecclesiasticke cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, more then Indians or Infidels, who are their hearers.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Concl.</hi> Christ hath given no warrant at all of actuall <hi>Church government,</hi> to all the whole visible <hi>Church.</hi> 1. so the places that I cited before <note n="a" place="margin">

dignity given to Officers, because of their government, are given onely to Officers, and never to the people; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the people have no power of government; the consequence is sure, those who are priviledged of <hi>Christ</hi> to governe, ordinarily should be, and duely are Governours. But the stile of <hi>Gods</hi> is given to Church-guides, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 33, 36. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 21. which title for governing is given to Judges, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 82. 6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6.

               <p>I answer, we urge not a <hi>Church assembly</hi> of Elders only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the people from hearing yea and in an orderly way, from speaking, reasoning and disputing even in our Generall assembly, but for judiciall concluding, we find not that given to any, but to the Church-guides, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. 2 It is not a good argument, the people sate with the Rulers and rescued innocent <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> He writeth to all the faithfull, and so to women; the woman is not to usurpe authority over the man, 1 Cor. 14. 34. 1 Tim. 2. 11, 12. but to voyce judicially in Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an act of Apostolick authority.</p>
               <p>Manuscript.</p>
               <p>Ib. <hi>The whole</hi> Church <hi>is to be gathered together and to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,</hi> Ergo <hi>not the</hi> Bishop <hi>and</hi> Elders <hi>alone,</hi> 3. Pauls <hi>spirit was to be with them and</hi> Christs <hi>authority,</hi> 4. <hi>the whole</hi> Church, 2 Cor. 2. <hi>did forgive him,</hi> 5. <hi>nothing is in the Text that attributeth any power to the presbytery apart, or singularly above the rest, but as the reproofe is directed to all, for not mourning, so is the Commandement of casting out directed to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is cleare that if some were gathered together in the power of <hi>Christ</hi> and the spirit of <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, in the authority that he received over the Corinthians, for edification, 2. Cor. 10. 8. and <hi>Pauls</hi> Rod, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 21. then as many as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened <hi>Church-ways,</hi> and mourned not for the same, did not cast out and authoritatively forgive; seeing women and believing children did convene with the whole <hi>Church,</hi> and were not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the sinne; and yet women and believing children can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be capable of pastorall authority over the <hi>Church,</hi> which was given for edification. 2. <hi>The power of the</hi> Lord Jesus, <hi>that is,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:49702:31"/>
                  <hi>the keys of the Kingdom of</hi> God were committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> as to a Pastor, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. and power to bind and retaine, to loose and pardon sinnes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 20, 21, 22. Which power is given to these who are sent as Ambassadors as the Father sent <hi>Christ, v.</hi> 21. which power cannot be given to puffed up women, 3. Except this be said, the Text must beare that there was not a Presbytery of Prophets, Governors and Teachers there of all, who had a more eminent act in excommunicating and <hi>Church pardoning,</hi> then the women who mourned not, for by what reason our brethren would have the act of excommunicating an act of the whole Church convened, including all to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, women and children, by that same reason we may appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it to these only, who are capable of <hi>Pauls</hi> pastorall spirit, and authority, according <hi>as attributes are appropriated (by good logick) to their own subjects,</hi> else that cannot be expounded 1 Cor. 14. 31. <hi>For ye may all prophecy one by one.</hi> What? may all that the Apostle writeth unto, 1 Cor. 1. 2. prophecy one by one? even the whole Church, <hi>even all sanctified in</hi> Christ Jesus? <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be Saints,</hi> and all that in every place call upon the <hi>Lord Iesus?</hi> I thinke our brethren will not say so: so when <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Esteem highly of these that are over you</hi> if that command be directed to the whole <hi>Church</hi> of the Thessalonians which is in <hi>God</hi> our Father, as the Epistle is directed to them all, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 1. then doth <hi>Paul</hi> command the Elders in <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica</hi> to esteem highly of themselves, for their own workes sake: if exhortations be not restricted according to the nature of the subject in hand we shall mock the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and make it ridiculous to all.</p>
               <p>Ainsworth sayth, <hi>The putting away of leaven was commanded to all</hi> Israel. Ergo, <hi>the putting away of the incestuous person is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to them all in</hi> Corinth <hi>without exception, and the putting away of the</hi> Leper <hi>was commanded to all</hi> Israel.</p>
               <p>I answer. 1. Proportions are weake probations, 1. every single woman, 2. privately in her own house, 3. without <hi>Churches</hi> consent and authority was to put away Leaven; but it is a poore inference, therefore every woman in Corinth he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>magnifieth the judging of the Saints, taking occasion from thence to stretch their judicature, in some cases, even to the deciding of civill causes, rather then that they should fly suddenly to Law one against another, before</hi> Infidels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That upon this <hi>Church judging,</hi> he taketh occasion to magnifiy the judging of the Saints, I see not, for he passeth to a new subject in reprehending their pleadng, before heathen Judges. 2. Though that cohesion of the Chapters were granted, yet doth he not magnifie the Judging, of all the multitude, the Saints of men and women shall judge the world by assenting to <hi>Gods</hi> Judging, but all the Saints, even women, are not <hi>Church-Iudges.</hi> Also he extendeth Judging of civill causes to the most eminent Seniors amongst them <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Is there not a wise-man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you? no, not one who shal be able to judge betwixt his brethren?</hi> and therefore he layeth a ground, that far lesse can all the rest of men and women be Judges Ecclesiastick to binde and loose validly in Earth and Heaven, but onely the wiser and selected Elders.</p>
               <p>I may adde what Master Robinson <hi>sayth, that our argument from confession, may be objected to the Apostles no lesse then to</hi> Separatists, Acts 1. 23. <hi>They presented two; that is, the multitude which were about an hundred and twenty men and women, and</hi> Act 6. 5. <hi>And the while multitude presented seven</hi> Deacons <hi>to the twelue</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>and the twelve</hi> Apostles <hi>called the multitude, and so spake to them and v.</hi> 6. <hi>prayed and laid hands on the</hi> Deacons. <hi>Now when the multitude</hi> Acts 1. <hi>presented</hi> Joseph and Matthias, <hi>it behoved them to speak; spake they joyntly, or all at once? this were confusion, contrary to,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 14. <hi>did the women speak? they must not meddle in</hi> Church-maters, v. 34. <hi>did children speak? It is impossible; so</hi> Acts 6. <hi>did all the twelve</hi> Apostles <hi>speak at once? and pray (vocally) at once? did the whole multitude speak when they presented the seven</hi> Deacons? <hi>that is confusion; by these and the like, women and children are utterly excluded from the</hi> Church, <hi>as no parts of</hi>

                  </gap>. 14. 23. <hi>the whole</hi> Church <hi>commeth together in one, to exercise themselves in praying and prophecying, but children could not send messengers nor pray, nor prophecy, and women might not speak in the</hi> Church, <hi>and therefore women and children must be excluded from being parts of the</hi> Church; <hi>if one be excluded, why not another? and so till we come to the chiefe of the Congreation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is much for us every way; therefore the 120, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. and the multitude, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. did present the two elect Apostles, and the seven Deacons by some select persons, and when these select persons spake, the Church spake, and when one Apostle prayed the whole twelve prayed; <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is a representative <hi>Church</hi> which performeth <hi>Church</hi> actions in the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> and you will have a representative <hi>Church</hi> in the New Testament to be a point (as you say <note n="a" place="margin">Inf. pag. 163</note>) of Judaisme; yet here you are forced to acknowledge it, 2. By all good reason when <hi>Christ, Mat.</hi> 18. sayth if he refuse to heare the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, the speaking and commanding <hi>Church,</hi> let him be as a heathen, he must speak of a representative <hi>Church;</hi> for a collective body of all believers even women and children cannot command, nor soeak in the <hi>Church,</hi> and it were confusion that women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should bind and loose on Earth as <hi>Christ</hi> doth in Heaven, and when <hi>Paul</hi> sayth that the convened <hi>Church,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. should cast out the incestuous person, he meaneth not that they should all Judge him by the power and authority of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall spirit of <hi>Paul;</hi> therefore your doctrine is false, that as many are Judges in the Judiciall acts of excommunication, <hi>as did not mourn for the sin, as were Saints by calling, and to whom</hi> Paul <hi>writeth,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. <hi>and as met together for the publick worship, for it is as great confusion for women and children who are true parts of the</hi> Church <hi>to be Iudges,</hi> cloathed with <hi>Christs</hi> authority, and <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministeriall spirit, as for women to speak, or for twelve Apostles to pray all at once vocally in the <hi>Church;</hi> and the whole <hi>Church</hi> is said, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 22. to send messengers, and Canons to <hi>Antioch</hi> to be observed, and yet that whole Church are but, in the act of governing and decerning, and judiciall passing of these acts, only Apostles and Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Act</hi> 16. 4: <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 5. (<hi>Ergo</hi>) it followeth not that we exclude women and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49702:33"/>
children from being parts of the <hi>Church,</hi> or that all are excluded except Elders; all are parts of the mysticall, and redeemed <hi>Church;</hi> officers are only the ministeriall <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. Christ speaketh only of a ministeriall <hi>Church</hi> in the judiciall act of excommunication; though if you speak of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the acts of it, we doe not exclude the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. nor 1 Cor. 5. from a popular consenting to the sentence, and a popular execution of the sentence of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and therefore though the whole <hi>Church</hi> convene, yet the whole Church conveneth not with <hi>Pauls</hi> ministeriall spirit to excommunicate judicially; either must our brethren here acknowledge a <hi>Synocdoche,</hi> as well as we, yea and a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and select Church in the judiciall act of excommunication, else they must say, that women and children, <hi>Ex officio,</hi> by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall spirit doe Judge and so speake in the Church, for he who Judgeth <hi>Ex officio,</hi> in the Church, may and must speake and excommunicate in the Church <hi>Ex officio:</hi> but more of this hereafter.</p>

                  <hi>Occam</hi> say well, with that same certainty by which we believe <hi>Gods</hi> Word. 2. A question of fact is taken for a question, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereof is a matter of fact, but the attribute is a matter of Law, as (if <hi>Christ</hi> in saying he was the Son of <hi>God</hi> did blasphem) if the <hi>Lords</hi> Priests in giving <hi>David</hi> shew-bread, did commit Treason against King <hi>Saul</hi>) there is some question there made <hi>circa factum,</hi> about the fact, but it is formally a question of Law. For these questions may be cleared by <hi>Gods</hi> Word, and the ignorance of any questions which may be cleared by Gods Word, is vincible, and culpable, for the Law sayth <note n="a" place="margin">Reg. juris Culpabilis est ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia rerum quas scire tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note> 
                  <hi>The ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of these things which we are obliged to know is culpable,</hi> and excuseth not.

They performe other specifick acts of a visible <hi>Church,</hi> then to meete ordinarily, to partake joyntly, and at once, of the same ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 3. If this be a good reason that they cannot be a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Church,</hi> because they meete not all ordinarily to heare the some word, and to partake of the same Ordinances, then a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and visible and ordinary union joyntly in the same worship, is the specifick essence of a visible Church; but then there was no visible Nationall <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> for it was impossible that they could all meete in one materiall house, to partake of the same worship. 4.

This is not essentiall to a nationall <hi>Church,</hi> that they should ordinarily all joyntly meet for the same wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but that they be united in one ministeriall government, and meet in their chiefe members, and therefore our Brethren use an argument, <hi>à specie ad gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As the Apostles had one publicke care of all the <hi>Churches,</hi> and accordingly kept visible fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, as they had occasion to preach, write to them, pray, and praise <hi>God</hi> for them, so this care as Apostolick I grant is gone and dead with the Apostles; but the pastorall and <hi>Church-care,</hi> and consequently acts of externall fellowship are not dead with the Apostles, but are left in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> for what <hi>Church-communion</hi> of visible fellowship members of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation keepe one with another, that same by due proportion, ought nationall <hi>Churches</hi> to keepe amongst themselves. 3.

               <p>It is constantly denied by our brethren, that the Church of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was a congregationall <hi>Church,</hi> and of that frame and institution with the Christian <hi>Church:</hi> but that it was peculiar and meerely <hi>in laicall</hi> to be a nationall <hi>Church;</hi> yet let me have liberty to offer a necessary distinction here. 1. a nationall <hi>Church</hi>

But a Nationall <hi>Church</hi> is taken in another sense now, for a people to whom the Lord hath revealed his statutes and his testimonies, <hi>Whereas he hath not d alt so with every Nation,</hi> Psal. 147. 19, 20. which <hi>Church</hi> is also made up of many Congregations and Synagogues, having one worship and government that doth morally concerne them all. Thus the Iewish <hi>Church</hi> was once Nationall, and that for a time; God chose them of his free grace, to be a people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, Deut. 7. 7. and Deut. 32. 8. <hi>When the most high divided to the Nations their inheritance. Iacob was the lot of his inheritance,</hi> Amos 3. 2. <hi>You onely have I chosen of all the families of the earth.</hi> But the Jewish <hi>Church</hi> was in this sence but Nationall for a time; <hi>Now hath God</hi> (Act. 11. v. 18.) <hi>also granted to the Gentiles repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life,</hi> and called the Gentiles, and made them a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church, Hos. 1. 11. 1 Pet. 2. 10, 11. Esay 54. 1, 2, 3. that is, he hath revealed his testimonies to <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>He hath not done so to every Nation.</hi> So if a false Teacher should goe through <hi>Israel</hi> and call himselfe <hi>the power of God,</hi> as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did. All the Congreations and Synagogues in <hi>Israel</hi> might joyne together to condemne him; if there were such a thing as an Arke in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if it were taken captive as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates kept the Gospell in bonds, it were a morall dutie to all the Congregations, to convene in their principall Rulers and Pastors to bring againe the Arke of <hi>God,</hi> and by the power of Discipline to set it free; and if the whole Land were involved in a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall apostacie, they are to meet in their principall members, and this is morall to <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to <hi>Israel</hi> by Ordinances of the Church to renew a Covenant with God, that his wrath may

               <p>Nay, I affirme, that the Jewes had their Congregationall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as we have. For that is a Congregationall Church which meeteth, <gap reason="foreign">

And if this Ruler had beene any save a Moderator, if he had beene an unlawfull Officer, Christ would not have acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, nor would <hi>Paul,</hi> at the desire of the Rulers of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue have preached, as he doth, Acts 13. 15, 16. 2. Also, if there was teaching cisputing, concerning the Law in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, there behooved to be some ordering of these acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; for onely approved Prophets were licensed to preach in their Synagogues, to say nothing that there was beating in the Synagogues, and therefore there behoved to be Church disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Hence that word of delivering up to the Synagogue. Luke 21. 12. 3. There was the censure of excommunication, and casting out of the Synagogue, and a cutting off from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Hence that act of casting out of the Synagogue any who should confesse Jesus. John 12. 42. which they executed on the blind man, John 9. 34. It is true, our brethren deny that there was any excommunication in the Church of the Jewes, and they alledge, that the cutting off from the people of God, was a taking away of the life by the Magistrates Sword; or, (as some other say) Gods immediate hand of judgement upon them. But 1. to be cut off from the congregation, or from the people of God, is never called simply <hi>off-cutting,</hi> and expounded to be destroying, as it is Genes. 9. 11. but expressed by dying the death: for who will conceive that the Sword of the Magistrate was to cut off the male child that is not circumcised, who is said to be cut off from the people of God, Gen. 17. 14. or to cut off by death the parents? I grant the phrase signifieth bodily death. Exod. 31. 14. and for this God sought to kill <hi>Moses.</hi> But Divines say it was excommunication, and never Ruler in <hi>Israel</hi> executed this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: not <hi>Moses,</hi> nor any Judge that ever we read tooke away the life of an infant for the omission of a ceremony.

These which have the same Faith, and the same externall profession of Faith, these have the same frame and essentiall constitution, but they and we be such <hi>Churches;</hi> for we have the same cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, Jer. 31. 31. Jer. 32. 39 40. <hi>Heb</hi> 8. 8, 9 10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that same faith, differing only in accidents: their faith did looke to <hi>Christ</hi> to be incarnate, and our faith to that same ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>God</hi> now manifested in the flesh. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. They were saved by faith, as we are, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42, 43. <hi>Acts.</hi> 11. 16, 17, 18. and consequently, what visible profession of faith doth constitute the one visible <hi>Church,</hi> doth constitute the other. I know, <hi>Papists, Arminians, Socinians</hi> doe make the Doctrine, and Seales of the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Christian Church</hi> much different, but against the truth of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The onely answer that can be made to this, must be, <hi>that though the</hi> Church <hi>of the</hi> Jewes <hi>wanted not congregations, as our</hi> Christian Churches <hi>have, yet were they a nationall</hi> Church <hi>of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other essentiall, visible frame, then are the</hi> Christian Churches, <hi>because they had positive, typicall, and ceremoniall and carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements that they should have one high Priest for the whole nationall</hi> Church, <hi>the</hi> Christian Churches <hi>have not for that, one visible Monarch and Pope; they had an Altar, Sacrifices, and divers pollutions ceremoniall, which made persons uncapable of the</hi> Passover; <hi>but we have no such legall uncleannesse, which can make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the Seales of the New Testament: and therefore it was not lawfull to separate from the</hi> Jewish Church, <hi>in which did sit a typicall High</hi> Priest, <hi>where were Sacrifices, that did adumbrate the Sacrifice of our great High</hi> Priest, &amp; <hi>c. not withstanding of scandalous persons in that</hi> Church; <hi>because there was but one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> Church, <hi>out of which was to come the Redeemer</hi> Christ, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

If the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> was a visible <hi>Church</hi> in its essentiall constitution different from our visible <hi>Churches,</hi> because they were under the Religions tie of so me carnall, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, and typicall mandats and Ordinances, that we are not under, then doe I inferre, that the Tribe of <hi>Levy</hi> was not one visible <hi>Church,</hi> in the essentiall frame, with the rest of the Tribes, which is absurd, for that Tribe conteyning the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> was under the obligatory tie of many typicall Commandements proper and peculiar to them only, as to <hi>offer Sacrifices, to wash themselves,</hi> when they were to officiate, to weare <hi>linnen Ephods, to beare the Arke of the Covenant,</hi> now it was sinne for any that were not of the Sonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Tribe to performe these duties; yet, I hope, they made but one nationall <hi>Church</hi> with the rest of the Tribes. Secondly, I infer, that the Christian <hi>Church</hi> that now is, cannot be of that same essentiall frame with the Apostolick <hi>Churches,</hi> because the Apostolick <hi>Church,</hi> so long as the Jewish ceremonies were indifferent, (<hi>in statu</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49702:46"/>
of the same <hi>Church,</hi> that then there be divers memberships of different essentiall frames in one and the same <hi>Church,</hi> which to me is monstrous; for then, because a command is given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> to offer his sonne <hi>Isaak</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and no such command is given to <hi>Sarah,</hi> in that case <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> shall not bee members of one and the same visible <hi>Church.</hi> But the truth is, different positive commandments of ceremoniall and typicall ordinances put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49702:47"/>
Judges before; but in so doing they changed not the frame of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor the worship of <hi>God,</hi> for they kept the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the whole Morall, Ceremoniall, and Judiciall Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and their profession therein; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they did nothing which can formally destroy the being of a visible <hi>Church,</hi> but they did much change the face of the state and civill policie, in that they refused <hi>God to reigne over them,</hi> and so his care in raising up Judges and Saviours out of any Tribe, and brought the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to a Monarchy, where the Crowne by divine right was annexed to the tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Fourthly, it was possible that the State should remaine entire, if they had a lawfull <hi>King sitting upon Davids throne,</hi> and were ruled according to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Law: but if they should remaine without a Priest and a Law, and follow after <hi>Baal,</hi> and change and alter Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as the ten Tribes did, and the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> in the end did, they should so marre and hurt the being and integrity of a visible <hi>Church,</hi> as the Lord should say, <hi>She is not my wife,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hosea 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>neither am I her husband;</hi> and yet they might remaine in that case a free Monarchie, and have a State and policy in some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter frame; though I grant, <hi>de facto,</hi> these two Twins, State and Church, civill Policy and Religion, did die and live, were sicke and diseased, vigorous and healthy together; yet doth this More, that State and Church are different. And further, if that Nation had made welcome, and with humble obedience belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in, and received the Messiah, and reformed all, according as <hi>Christ</hi> taught them, they should have beene a glorious <hi>Church,</hi> and the beloved Spouse of <hi>Christ;</hi> but their receiving and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the Messiah should not presently have cured their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled state, seeing now <hi>the Scepter was departed from Iudah,</hi> and a stranger and heathen was their King; nor was it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that that Saviour, <hi>whose Kingdome is not of this world, John</hi> 18. 36. and came to bestow a spirituall redemption, and not to reestablish a flourishing earthly Monarchy, and came to loose the works of the <hi>Devill, Heb.</hi> 2: 14. and not to spoile <hi>Cesar</hi> of an earthly Crowne, should also make the <hi>Jews</hi> a flourishing State, and a free and vigorous Monarchy againe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is most cleare that State and Church are two divers things, if the one may bee restored, and not the other. Fifthly, the King, as the King
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49702:48"/>
was the head of the Common-wealth, and might not meddle with the Priests office, or performe any Ecclesiasticall acts, and therefore was <hi>Uzzah</hi> smitten of the Lord with leprosie, because he would burne incense, which belonged to the <hi>Priests</hi> onely. And the <hi>Priest</hi> in offering sacrifices for his owne sinnes, and the sinnes of the people did represent the <hi>Church,</hi> not the State. And <hi>the things of the Lord;</hi> to wit, <hi>Church-matters,</hi> and <hi>the matters of the King,</hi> which were civill matters of State, are clearly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 11. which evidenceth to us, that the <hi>Church</hi> and State in <hi>Israel</hi> were two incorporations formally distinguished. And I see not, but those who doe confound them, may also say, That the Christian State and the Christian <hi>Church</hi> be all one State, and that the government of the one must be the government of the other; which were a confusion of the two Kingdoms. It is true, God hath not prescribed judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials to the Christian State, as he did to the Jewish State, because shadows are now gone, when the <hi>body Christ is come;</hi> but <hi>Gods</hi> determination of what is morally lawfull in civill Laws, is as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to us as to them; and the Jewish judicials did no more make the Jewish State the Jewish <hi>Church,</hi> then it made <hi>Aaron</hi> to be <hi>Moses.</hi> and the <hi>Priest</hi> to be the <hi>King</hi> and civill Judge: yea, and by as good reason <hi>Moses</hi> as a Judge should be a prophet, and <hi>Aaron</hi> as a Prophet should be a Judge; and <hi>Aaron</hi> as a Priest might put a malefactor to death, and <hi>Moses</hi> as a Judge should proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Nor doe I judge that because there was but one visible <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> and therefore it was not lawfull to separate therefrom, and because under the New Testament there be many visible <hi>Churches,</hi> and many Mount <hi>Sions,</hi> therefore this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance doth make separation from a true <hi>Church,</hi> lawfull to us, which was unlawfull to the people of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> For separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lawfull, is, <hi>to not partake of other mens sins, not to converse bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly with knowen</hi> flagitious Men, <hi>not to touch any uncleane thing, not to have communion with Infidels, Idols, Belial, &amp;c.</hi> Now this is a morall duty obliging <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of perpetuall equity; and to adhere to, and worship <hi>God</hi> aright, in a true <hi>Church</hi> is also a morall branch of the second commande, and a seeking of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his presence and face in his owne Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49702:49"/>
and what was simply morall, and perpetually lawfull, the contrary thereof cannot be made lawfull, by reason of the multitude of Congregations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The most that these arguments of our Brethren doe prove, is but that it is lawfull to goe, and dwell in a Congregation where <hi>Christ</hi> is worshiped in all his Ordinances, rather then to remaine in that Congregation, where he is not worshipped in all his Ordinances; and where the <hi>Church</hi> censures are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which to us is no separation from the visible <hi>Church,</hi> but a removall from one part of the visible <hi>Church</hi> to another, as he separateth not out of the house, who removeth from the Gallery, to remaine and lie and eate in the Chamber of the same House, because the Gallery is cold and smoaky, and the Chamber not so, for he hath not made a vow never to set his foote in the Gallery. But to our Brethren to separate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from a Congregation, is to be dismembred from the only visible <hi>Church</hi> on Earth, for to them there is not any visible <hi>Church</hi> on Earth, except a congregation. And our Brethrens mind in al these arguments, is to prove, that not only it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to stand in the Parish assemblies of Old <hi>England,</hi> because of Popish ceremonies (and we teach separation from these ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to be lawfull, but not from the Churches) but also that it is necessary, to adjoyne to independent Congregations, as to the onely true visible Churches on Earth, and to none others, except we would sinne against the second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I conceive is proved by not one of these arguments. And to them all I answer, by a deniall of the connex propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. As this, <hi>These who must doe all which</hi> Christ <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and seek</hi> Christ <hi>in all his necessary Ordinances, though supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors will not doe their duties, these must separate from true visible</hi> Churches, <hi>where all</hi> Christs <hi>Ordinances are not, and joyne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Congregations, as to the only true visible</hi> Churches <hi>on Earth.</hi> This proposition I deny. 5. If our Brethrens argument hold sure that we are to separate from a <hi>Church,</hi> in which we want some Ordinances of <hi>Christ,</hi> through the Officers negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, because (say they <note n="a" place="margin">Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed, answer to quest. 11. pag. 33.</note>) <hi>The Spouse of</hi> Christ <hi>will not rest, seeking Her beloved untill she finde him, in the fullest manner,</hi> Cant. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7. &amp; 3. 1, 2. then the Spouse <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 7. &amp; 3. 1, 2. is separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49702:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from one Church to another, which the Text will not beare. 2. I would have our reverend Brethren to see and consider, if this argument doth not prove (if it be nervose and concludent) that one is to separate from a Congregation, where are all the Ordinances of Christ, as in New <hi>England</hi> now they are, so being, hee goe from a lesse powerfull and lesse spirituall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, to another Congregation, where incomparably there is a more powerfull and more spirituall Ministery, for in so doing the separater should onely <hi>not rest</hi> as the Spouse doth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. &amp; 3. <hi>seeking his beloved untill he find Him, in the fullest manner.</hi> For he is to be found in a <hi>fuller manner,</hi> under a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministery, and in a lesse full manner under a lesse power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministery. But this separation I thinke our Brethren would not allow, being contrary to our Brethrens Church-Oath which tieth the professor to that congregation, whereof he is a sworne member to remaine there. 6. The designe and scope of our reverent Brethrens argument, is that professors ought to separat from Churches where presbyteriall government is, because in these <hi>Churches,</hi> Professors, as they conceive, doe not <hi>injoy all the Ordinances of God.</hi> Because they injoy not the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of a <hi>Church</hi> consisting of onely visible Saints, and they injoy not the free use of the censure of excommunication in such a manner as in their owne <hi>Churches,</hi> and because in them the Seales are often administred by those Pastors who are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of another Congregation then their owne, and for other causes also, which we thinke is not sound doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But we thinke it no small prejudice</hi> (say our Brethren) <hi>to the liberty given to a congregation, in these words,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>Tell the</hi> Church, <hi>if he heare not the</hi> Church, &amp;c. <hi>That the power of excommunication should be taken from them, and given to a Presbyterian, or nationall</hi> Church, <hi>and so your</hi> Churches <hi>wante some ordinances of</hi> Christ.</p>

                  <p>2. Distinct. <hi>There is a covenant of baptisme, made by all, and a covenant vertuall and implicite renewed, when we are to receive the Lords Supper, but an explicite positive professed Church covenant, by oa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Distinct. <hi>An explicite vocall Covenant whereby we bind our selves to the first three Articles in a tacite way, by entring in a new relation to such a Pastor, and to such a Flocke, we deny not, as if the thing were unlawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we may sweare to performe Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, observing all things requisite in a lawfull oath.</hi> 2. <hi>But that such a covenant is required by divine institution, as the essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:49702:56"/>
                     <hi>forme of a Church and Church-membership, as though without this none were entered members of the visible Churches of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, nor can now be entered in Church-state, nor can have right unto the seales of the covenant, we utterly deny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Distinct. <hi>We grant a covenant in Baptisme which is the seale of our entry unto the visible Church.</hi> 2. <hi>That it is requisit that such Heretickes, Papists, Infidels, as be received as members of our visible Church, (from which Papists have fallen, having received bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme from us) doe openly professe subjection to God, and his Church, in all the Ordinances of God. And that Infidels give a confession of their faith, before they be baptized.</hi> 3. <hi>Nor deny we that at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Pastor, the Pastor and people tie themselves, by recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of oathes, to each other, the one to fulfill faithfully the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery that he hath received of the Lord; the other to submit to his ministery in the Lord, but these reciprocall oathes, make neither of them members of a visible Church, for they were that before these oathes were taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Distinct.</hi> Any professor removing from one congregation to another, and so comming under a new relation to such a <hi>Church,</hi> or such a Ministery, is in a tacite and vertuall covenant to discharge himselfe in all the duties of a member of that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but this is nothing for a Church-covenant; for when six are converted in the congregation whereof I am a member, or an excommunicated person heartily and unfainely repenteth, there ariseth a new relation betwixt those converts and the Church of God; and a tie and obligation of duties to those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons greater then was before, as being now members of one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall and invisible body. Yet cur brethren cannot say, there is requisite, that the <hi>Church</hi> renew their <hi>Church-covenant</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards such, seeing the use of the Covenant renewed is to restore a fallen <hi>Church,</hi> or to make a <hi>non-Church</hi> to be a <hi>Church;</hi> and if those six be converted by my knowledge, there resulteth thence an obligation of a vertuall and tacite covenant betwixt them and me; but there is no need of an explicite and vocall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to tie us to duties that we are now obliged to in a stricter manner then we were before; for when one is taken to be a steward in a great family, there may be a sort of Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that servant and the Lord of the house, and there resulteth
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49702:56"/>
from his office and charge a tie and obligation, not onely to the head of the family, but also to the children and fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the house; but there is no need of an expresse, vocall, and professed covenant betwixt the new steward and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and servants; yea and strangers also, to whom he owes some acts of steward-duties, though there doe result a vertuall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Farre lesse is there a necessity of an expresse and vocall covenant before that steward can have claime to the keyes, or be received in office. So when one entereth into covenant with <hi>God,</hi> and by faith layeth hold on the covenant, there resulteth from that act of taking the <hi>Lord</hi> to be his <hi>God,</hi> a <hi>covenant-obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> to doe duty to all men, as the covenant of <hi>God</hi> doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him; yea, and to doe workes of mercy to his beast (<hi>for a good man will have mercy on the life of his beast</hi>) and he is obliged to a duty by that covenant with <hi>God</hi> to his children, which are not yet borne, to servants who are not yet his servants, but shall hereafter be his servants, to these who are not yet converted to <hi>Christ,</hi> now it is true a vertuall and tacite covenant, resulteth toward all these, even toward the beast, the children not yet borne, &amp;c. when the person first by faith entereth in covenant with <hi>God;</hi> but none, master of common sense and judgement will say there is required a vocall and explicite, and professed cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, betwixt such an one entered in covenant with <hi>God,</hi> and his beast, and his children not yet borne, or that the foresaid tacite and vertuall covenant, which doth but result from the man his covenanting with <hi>God</hi> is either the cause, or essence, or formall reason, whereby he is made a formall contracter and covenanter with <hi>God.</hi> So, though when I enter a member of such a congregation, there ariseth thence an obligation of duty, or a tacite covenant, tying me in duties to all members present, or which shall be members of that congregation, though they should come from <hi>India;</hi> yet in reason it cannot be said, that there is required an expresse vocall covenant betwixt me and all, who shall be fellow-members of this congregation; and farre lesse that such a covenant doth make me a member of that congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea because I am already a member of that congregation; thence ariseth a tacite covenant toward such and such duties and persons.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49702:57"/>
6. I understand not how our brethren doe keepe Christian and religious communion, with many professours of approved piety, and that in private conference, praying together, and publiquely praising together, and yet deny to have any <hi>Church-communion</hi> with such approved professors, in partaking with them the seales of the covenant, and censures of the <hi>Church,</hi> I doubt how they can comfort the feeble minded, and not also warne and rebuke them, which are called acts of <hi>Church-c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Then the question is not, if there be a tacit and vertuall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant when persons become members of such a visible congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. 2. Nor doe we question whether such a <hi>Church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> may be lawfully sworne. We thinke it may, though to sweare the last article not to remove from such a congregation without their consent, I thinke not lawfull, nor is my habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in such a place a matter of <hi>Church-discipline.</hi> 3. But the <note place="margin">The state of the question concerning the Church cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> question is, if such a Church-covenant, by Divine or Apostolick warrant, not onely be lawfull, but the necessary and Apostolick meane, yea and the essentiall forme of a visible Church; so as without it persons are not members of one visible Church, and want all right and title to a Church-membership, to the seales of grace, and censures of the Church. Our brethren affirme, we deny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> The former considerations being cleare, we hold that such a <hi>Church-covenant</hi> is a conceit destitute of all authority of Gods Word, <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Testament,</hi> and therefore to be rejected as a way of mens devising,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Argum.</hi> All will-worship laying a band on the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where God hath layed none, is damnable; but to tye the oath of God to one particular duty rather then another, so as you cannot, without such an oath, enter into such a state, nor have title and right to the seales of grace and Gods Ordinances, is will-worship, and that by vertue of a divine Law, and is a binding of the Conscience where God hath not bound it.</p>

5. <hi>Argu.</hi> This <hi>Church-covenant</hi> is either all one with the Covenant of grace, or it is a Covenant divers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace; but neither wayes can it be the essentiall forme of a visible <hi>Church; Ergo,</hi>

No doubt an excommunicated person, whose <hi>spirit is saved in the day of Christ,</hi> may be in the Covenant of grace, and yet cut off from the visible <hi>Church</hi> for enormous scandals; but this is no ground to make your <hi>Church-covenant</hi> different from the Covenant of grace. A beleever in the Covenant of grace may not doe a duty to father, brother, or master; but it is a weak consequence, that therefore there is a Covenant-oath betwixt brother and brother, sonne and father, servant and master, which is commanded by a divine Law of perpetuall equity under both old and new Testament, as you make this Covenant of the Church to be, which persons must sweare, ere they can come under these relations of brother, son, and servant. The Covenant of grace, and the whole Evangell, teach us to confesse <hi>Christ</hi> before men, and to walke before God, and be perfect, and so that we <hi>should joyn our selves to the true visible Churh.</hi> But none can in right reason conclude, that it is a divine Law that necessitateth me to sweare another Covenant then the Covenant of grace, in relation to those particular duties, or to sweare over againe

the Covenant of grace, in relation to the duties that I owe to the visible <hi>Church,</hi> else I am not a member thereof. And that same Covenant in relation to my father, brother, and master, else I cannot be a sonne, brother, or servant; this were to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Covenants according to the multitude of duties that I am obliged unto, and that by a divine commandment.

I thinke there is no necessity of an expresse covenant of marriage betwixt this new <hi>Church,</hi> and all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sister <hi>Churches,</hi> as there is a solemne marriage oath betwixt the Husband and the Wife, and a <hi>solemne covenant</hi> betwixt the supreame Magistrate and the <hi>King</hi> and his Subjects, when the <hi>King</hi> is crowned; all we say is this, if for new relations <hi>God</hi> laid a bond and compelling tie of conscience, and that of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall equity, whereby we are entered in every new relative state, beside the bond that Law and Gospell lay on us, to doe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to all men both in <hi>Church</hi> and Common-wealth, then when a person is converted unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and another made a Lawyer, and another a Pastour, another a Physitian, another a Magistrat, another a learned Philosopher and President of an Academy, another a skilled Schoolemaster, and so come under new rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many and diverse in the <hi>Church</hi> and State, I should not be obliged to love, honour, and reverence them all by vertue of the

fifth Commandement; but I behoved by vertue of a particular Covenant (I know not how to name it) to come under some new relative marriage toward all these, else I could not performe duties of love and reverence to them; and though there be a convenant tacite betwixt a new member of a congregation, and <hi>A. B.</hi> the Pastor, and they come under a new relation, covenant waies (which I grant) is not the point in question, but this new covenant is that which by necessity of a divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of perpetuall equity, maketh the now adjoyner a member of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> and giveth him right and claime to the seales of the covenant, so as without this covenant he is without, and not to be judged by the Church, but left to the judgement of God, as 1 Cor. 5. 12, 13. one who is without.

How it is possible a <hi>Church</hi> shall be gathered amongst Infidells? this way Infidells cannot convert Infidells, and Pastors as Pastors cannot now be sent, by our Brethrens Doctrine, for Pastors are not Pastors but in relation to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation, therefore Pastors as Pastors cannot be sent to Indians. 3.

Prop. 3.</note> saith, <hi>that the</hi> Lord <hi>received</hi> Abraham <hi>and his children into the</hi> Church, <hi>by a covenant,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>Then when they violated the covenant, he renewed this covenant,</hi> Exod. 19. 1. 5. <hi>whence they were called the</hi> Church <hi>in the VVildernesse, Acts</hi> 7. 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. is not a <hi>Church-covenant</hi> such as you dreame off. 1. That covenant is the covenant of grace, made with all the people of the Jewes, yea, with children of eight dayes old, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>I will establish my covenant betwixt me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a</hi> God, <hi>to thee, and to thy seed.</hi> Your covenant is not made with infants, for to you infants are not members of the <hi>Church</hi> visible, none are in your <hi>Church-covenant,</hi> but believers, <hi>of whose sound conversion you are satisfied in conscience:</hi> 2. This is the everlasting covenant made with <hi>Job, Melchisedech</hi> and many Believers; not in <hi>Church-state,</hi> as you grant, your <hi>Church-covenant</hi> made with a visible Church, is no everlasting covenant. 3. Infants can make no confession ere they be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a visible <hi>Church.</hi> 4. If by this covenant <hi>Abrahams</hi> house was made a visible <hi>Church</hi> and all his children circumcised, then every family in the New Testament professing the Faith and covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and baptised as <hi>Abrahams</hi> children were circumcised, are the visible <hi>Church,</hi> and the place

Deut. 29. 18. <hi>the neglect whereof in the matter of Achan, brought sinne on all the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Josh. 7. <hi>yea it tieth us to duties to children not yet borne, who shall after become members of the Church, when Iehojadah made a covenant betwixt the King and the people; it was but a branch of the Lords covenant, obliging the King to rule in the Lord, and the people to obey in God.</hi>

It is true when we enter into covenant with <hi>God,</hi> we sweare duties to all to whom we are obliged, but then we are made members of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> before we sweare this <hi>Church-covenant;</hi> and this is, as if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> were made a living man before he have a reasonable soule, and as if <hi>Abraham</hi> were <hi>Israel</hi> his father, before <hi>Israel</hi> be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> his sonne, for if <hi>Abraham</hi> be <hi>in-Churched</hi> when he did sweare the covenant of grace, (as the <hi>Authour</hi> granteth) then he must be a member of a visible <hi>Church,</hi> while as yet there is not a visible Church; to which <hi>Abraham</hi> is tied; I deny not but <hi>Israel</hi> may sweare obedience to all <hi>Gods</hi> covenant, and all duties therein, and that he may sweare also in particular, to performe all duties to <hi>Abraham</hi> his father, in another oath, but that he cannot enter in the state of relation of sonneship to his father, while he sweare that oath in particular, is a dreame which hardly can be conceived.</p>

The act of election includeth a tacite promise of subjection to the Minister, who is elected, and the pastors acceptation of the <hi>Church-Office</hi> includeth a <hi>tacite</hi> promise to feede that flock, but this is no <hi>Church-covenant,</hi> which I prove by one argument unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

Ergo, Baptisme is not the other Sacrament of the New Testament so neither is this a good consequence, (<hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Discribeth the</hi> Bishop, <hi>and over skippeth the ruling</hi> Elder, <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the</hi> Deacon; Ergo, <hi>the ruling</hi> Elder <hi>is not an Ordinance of God</hi>) for while hee describeth the Bishop, he teacheth what an one, both the Doctor, and ruling Elder should be, by cleare analogy, and it had beene superfluous for the Holy Ghost to say more, then he doth. And by this wee may answer to what is tenthly objected, <hi>The ruling</hi> Elder <hi>is omitted in</hi> Christs <hi>roll, Eph.</hi> 4. 11. Ergo, <hi>there is no such officer.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49702:93"/>
and a motive and cause; divers Ordinances of God have both these. As the occasion of writing the Epistle to <hi>Philamon,</hi> was the flight of <hi>Onesmus</hi> a fugitive servant from his master, and his willing minde to returne to him againe, and upon that occasion <hi>Paul</hi> did write to <hi>Philamon;</hi> but that will not prove that the Epistle to <hi>Philemon</hi> is but a prudentiall Letter, and obliging for a time, because the motive and cause why the holy Ghost would have it written, was, that it should be a part of Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, obliging to the second comming of Christ. The like I say of the Epistle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> written upon occasion of seducing Teachers, who had bewitched the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and made them beleeve, <hi>they must be circumcised and keepe the Law,</hi> if they would be justified in <hi>Christ:</hi> Yet hence is not proved, that the Epistle to the <hi>Galathians</hi> is but a prudentiall Letter, and not of divine and perpetuall institution; for the cause and motive of writing was, that it might be a part of the Canon of faith. So also the Covenant of Grace and the Gospell was made upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by reason that the first Covenant could not save us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 2. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21, 22. is therefore (I pray you) the Covenant of grace but a temporary and a prudentiall peece?

I might alleage infinite Ordinances in Scripture, the like to this. Yea, most of all the Ordinances of God are occasioned from our spirituall necessities; are they therefore but humane and prudentiall Statutes, that are onely to endure for a time? I thinke, no.</p>

The fewnesse of poore; or no poore at all, cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Joh. 12. 8. <hi>for the poore you have alwaies with you.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the afflictions of the <hi>Churches,</hi> the object of the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons <hi>giving and shewing mercy,</hi> as it is Rom. 12. 8. cannot be wanting, as that the Churches fabricke be kept in good frame, the poore, the captives of Christian Churches, the sicke, the wounded, the stranger, the distracted be relieved, yea and the poor Saints of other Churches, 1 Cor. 16. be supported. 3. Not onely because of the impossibility that Pastors cannot give both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>praying and the Word,</hi> and to the <hi>serving of Tables;</hi> but by reason of the wisdome of Christ in a positive Law, the Pastor cannot be the Deacon <hi>ex officie</hi> in any case. For 1. Christ hath made them distinct Offices, upon good grounds, Act. 6. 4.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49702:95"/>
2. The Apostle hath set downe divers qualifications, for the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 1. and for the <hi>Deacon,</hi> V. 12, 13. And 3. the Pastor who is to give the whole man to the preaching of the Gospell, cannot entangle himselfe with Tables, 1 Tim. 4. 15. 2 Tim. 2. 3, 4, 5. if we should say nothing, that if there were need of Officers to take care of the poore, when there was such grace and love amongst the Saints and Apostles able and willing to acquit themselves toward the poore, and when all things were common Act. 2. 44, 45, 46, 47. Act. 4. 31. 32, 33, 34. far more now is the Office needfull, when the love of many is waxen cold.</p>

because <hi>v.</hi> 8. all are to provide for these of their owne house, and to maintaine them in their indigence, else they be, in that, worse then Infidell children, who by natures love, doe provide for their poore parents. 3.

Therefore the Preachers wages is so wages that its debt, not almes: but a Widow of sixty yeeres being weake and infirme, cannot acquit her selfe, in such a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full office as doth merit poore wages, and therefore the reward of her labour was both wages and an almes.</p>
                     <p>Againe, that this Widow had some charge or service in the Church, (I meane not any Ministeriall office, for she was not ordained as the Deacon, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. with imposition of hands) I prove from the Text. 1. Because this Widdow was not to be chosen to the number or Colledge of Widowes, except shee had beene 60. Yeares, this is a positive qualification of a positive service, as if it were an office; for else what more reason in 60. Yeares then in 61. or 62. or in 58. or 59. if shee was a meere eleemosynary and an indigent woman? or can godlinesse permit
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49702:100"/>
us to thinke that <hi>Paul</hi> would exclude a Widow of 50. or 54. or 56 Yeeres, from the Colledge of Widowes, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate and poore? nor, 2. Would <hi>Paul</hi> rebuke the Widow taken into the society of these Widowes, because shee married an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, except she had entered to this service, and had vowed chastity, nor is marrying the second time which is lawfull, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 1. 2. <hi>a waxing wanton against</hi> Christ <hi>and a casting off of the first faith; as the marrying of these widowes is called. v.</hi> 11. 12. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Widow, had some charge and service, in the Church. 3.

By this there is, 1. no necessity of a publick Ministery, for the conversion of Soules to Christ, nor is a Ministery and Pastors, and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers given by Jesus Christ, with intention, <hi>to open the eyes of the blind, and to convert soules to God.</hi> All the ordinary wayes of conversion of Soules, is by the preaching of men out of office, and destitute of all calling of the Church to preach, which is a wonder. 3. The Fathers begetting, by order of nature, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the children; the pastors are Fathers, the seede before the plant or birth; the word preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. is the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall seed of the new birth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. The Ministery and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary use thereof, is given to the pastors as to Christs Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. 20.

                  <p>But I answer; he not onely may be, but is a pastor to these that are but potentially members to the invisible Church, though unconverted, except you say, a man hath no relation as a pastor to the flock, to all and every one of a thousand soules, which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49702:102"/>
are his flock, except they bee all truly converted, and members of the invisible Church, which if you say, I can refute it easily as an Anabaptisticall falsehood; for if they all professe the truth, and chuse him for their pastor, hee is their pastor, but they are a saved flock potentially, though actually a visible flock ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving actuall relation to him, as to their pastor.</p>
                  <p>But. 2. <hi>That a good minister know all his flock by name,</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, and is spoken of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. in relation to the whole Catholick Church, as is expounded <hi>v.</hi> 14. yet will it not follow, he is not a pastor nor not a good pastor, who knoweth not all his flock at all times. 3. A man is indeed not properly a pastor, and a Church officer to Indians, who neither are called nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the truth, if he preach to them, though he have not relation to such, as to a Christian flock, yet he hath a relation of a pastor to them in that case.</p>
                  <p>Yea I desire our brethren to satisfie me in this even according to their grounds. A number of Christians is a <hi>Church mysticall,</hi> but they are not a <hi>Church ministeriall,</hi> while they be conjoyned <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-wayes,</hi> and use the keyes in such acts of Church union: Ergo, They are not a Church ministeriall before they bee a Church governing: which is all wee say; for then they should be a body seeing and hearing, before they be a body seeing and hearing.</p>

by a positive and authoritative separation, to erect a new Church without pastors, or in an ordinary way; though as Christians they may separate from <hi>Rome,</hi> negatively and touch no uncleane things. 3.

Secondly, a man is called a man excluding his soule, (if your soule were in my soules stead.) Therefore a man is a thing living, and a reasonable man without his soule: what vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is here! Fifthly, if the Church-Covenant be the essentiall forme of the Church, it is as accider tall to the well being of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as Officers are; for they are the light of the world, the salt of the earth, which is more necessary then a <hi>Church-Covenant.</hi>

                     <hi>prophesying, and other ordinances? were not all they converts, who desired to be admitted to their fellowship? Had they not use of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication? The Apostles came but occasionally to the Churches, where they appointed Elders, Acts</hi> 14. 25. <hi>Why did Paul leave Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus at Crete, save onely that men of gifts might be trained up in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> All here said is conjecturall, he cannot give us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Church exercising Church-power, and destitute of Officers, onely he saith, <hi>Can we conceive that in the Apostles ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence there was no Church meetings for edification?</hi> But were there no Elders and Officers in the Apostolike Church, but onely A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles? I thinke there have beene Pastors, and when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles first left the planted Churches, can we conceive that they left new converted flockes without Pastors? and if without Officers they met for prophecying, can wee conceive that they wanted the Seales of the Covenant? certainly, Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Officers are no rules for us to follow. Secondly, of conversion by private persons, I purpose to speake hereafter; if they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, it is not ordinary, nor a rule to us. Thirdly, at <hi>Crete</hi> there have beene Preachers, but of government without them I see nothing; since Elders <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> are limitted in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accusation: against Elders, and are forbidden to lay hands suddenly on any man; I see not how the people without Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did this. It is good, that this Church that they give us, is all builded upon conjectures, and an unwritten Church is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written tradition. If the Apostles appointed Elders in the Church for this end, to governe; wee gather the contrary of your collections. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was no government in the Churches before there were governours, for the end could not be existing in Gods wisdome without the meanes; that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should goe about the walls before the City bee walled, and discipline erected, I cannot conceive: without Officers, the ordinary disciplinators, the City of God can be no governing City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is</hi> (saith he) <hi>strange where multitudes are converted; and that where neither Apostles nor Officers were present, that there were no Churches here; it is grosse to say. That in the Apostles times nothing was begun but by them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:49702:105"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There was conversion of multitudes to the Lord; <hi>Ergo,</hi> there was a Church-Covenant in stating them all in Church-State; you cannot say it your selves. Secondly, it is not grosse, but Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike, that all new Acts of government should take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Apostles, as the chusing of <hi>Matthias, Acts</hi> 1. the ordaining of Deacons, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. the preaching to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. had their beginning from the Apostles, who foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and planted Churches.</p>

                     <p>3. <hi>Quest. Whether or not ordination of Elders may be by the Church of beleevers wanting all Elders or Officers.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Here these particulars must be discussed; first, <hi>from whence is ordination of Elders from Elders or from the people. Secondly, if ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by the people be all that is requisite in a lawfull calling. Thirdly, the argument from the calling of our reformers must be discussed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first, observe the following considerations:</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>A succession in the Church is necessary ordinarily; extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, and in cases of necessity it may be wanting. Secondly, we deny the popish succession to be a note of the Church, nor doe we in any sort contend for it.</hi> First, because a right succession must be a successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to truth of Doctrine, not personall or totall to the chaire and naked office.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence our first conclusion.</hi> In cases of necessity, election by the people onely may stand for ordination, where there be no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors at all. This is proved before by us; <note n="i" place="margin">Ut supra;</note> first, because God is not necessarily tied to succession of Pastors. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where men are gifted for the worke of the ministery, and there be no Pastors to be had, the giving of the holy Ghost is a signe of a calling of God, who is not wanting to his owne gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious intention, though ordinary meanes faile.

                  <p>2. <hi>Conclus.</hi> Thence may well be deduced that they are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastors, and need not a calling revealed, who, in cases of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary necessity, are onely chosen by the people, and not ordained by Pastors; and that Pastors ordained by Pastors, as such, are Pastors of the same nature; as <hi>Matthias</hi> called by the Church, and <hi>Paul</hi> immediately called from Heaven, had one and the same office by nature.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Conclus,</hi> The established and setled order of calling of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, is by succession of Pastors to Pastors, and Elders by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Neglect not the gift which was given to thee by proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cie, with the laying on of the hands of the Elders.</hi> Secondly, the practice of the Apostles is our safe rule, because at all ordination of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers the Apostles and Pastors were actors and ordainers, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2. 3. <hi>Acts.</hi> 14. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. and this <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Robinson</hi> granteth, because the charge of all the Churches did lie on the Apostles. As also before the Law, the people did not ordaine the Priest hood, but God ordained the first borne by succession to be <hi>teachers</hi> and <hi>priests;</hi>

This reason is weak, because a succession of Elders and Pastors, such as we require, is no more popish then a succession of visible beleevers; and visible Churches ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pastors, is popish: but our brethren maintaine a succession of beleevers and visible prosessors since the Apostles daye. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we deny the necessity of a succession perpetuall, which papists hold. Thirdly, we maintaine onely a succession to the true and Apostolike Doctrine: papists hold a visible <hi>Cathedrall</hi> succession to the chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> and titular office of <hi>Peter.</hi>

                     <hi>that because the Church of believers neither make the Office nor authority of Pastors, that both are immediately from Christ, and that therefore the beleevers may not lay hands upon the Officers; nor doth it follow, because they receive ordination from the Church, that therefore they should execute their Office in the Churches name; or that they should be more or lesse diligent at the Churches appointment, or that the Church of beleevers have a Lordly power over them, or that the Elders must receive their commission from the Church, as an Ambassadour doth from the Prince who sent him, or that the Church in the defect of Officers may performe all duties proper to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as to administer the Sacraments.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I know none of ours who use such an Argument, that because <hi>a Pasters or Elders Office is from Christ, that therefore the Church cannot ordaine him.</hi> For it should prove that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie cannot ordaine him a Pastor, because his Office is from
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49702:109"/>
Christ and not from the Presbyterie. It would prove also, that because the Office of a Judge is from God, that the free States of a Kingdome could not ordaine one to be their King; or that the King could not depute Judges under him, because the Office of a King and Judge is from God, and not from men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Elders have their Ordination to that heavenly Charge from the people, as from the first principall and onely subject of all ministeriall power, I see not how it doth not follow, that Elders are the servants of the <hi>Church</hi> in that respect; and that though it doth not follow, that they come out in the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> but in the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose Ambassadours they are, yet it proveth well that they are inferiour to the Church of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. For 1. though the power of the Keys given to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in relation to Christ be ministeriall, yet in relation to the Officers whom the Church sendeth, it is more then ministeriail, at lest it is very Lordlike. For as much of this ministeriall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is committed to the Church of possibly twenty or forty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as to the Mistresse, Lady, Spouse, and independent Queen, and highest dispencer of all ministeriall power; and the Elders, though Ambassadours of Christ, are but meere accidents or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the Church, necessary <hi>ad benè esse</hi> onely, and lyable to <hi>exauthoration</hi> at the Churches pleasure; yea, every way the Officers in jurisdiction are inferiour to the Church of beleevers, by your grounds, and not <hi>over the people of the Lord.</hi> For if the Church of believers, as they are such, be the most supreame go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Church, then the Officers, as Officers, have no power of government at all, but onely so farre as they are beleevers; now if they be not believers (as it falleth out very often) then have they no power of the Keyes at all, and what they doe, they doe it meerely as the Churches servants, to whom the Keyes are not given marriage-waies, or by right of redemption in Christs blood: yea, Officers as they are such, are neither the Spouse, not redeemed Church, yea nor any part, or members of the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church. 2. The Church of believers are the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>od, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers meanes leading to the end, and ordained to gather the Saints; if therefore, as the end, they shall authoritatively send Officers, they should call and ordaine Officers as the States of a Kingdome, with more then a power ministeriall; Yea with a

Kingly power, for all authority should be both formally and eminently in them, as all Regall or Aristocraticall power is in the States of a Kingdom, as in the fountaine.</p>
                  <p>But neither doe we bring this argument to prove a simple Dominion of the Church of believers over the Officers, or a power of regulating, limiting, and ordering the Ambassage of Officers, as King and State lay bands upon their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours; but we bring it to prove that this doctrine degradeth the Officers from all power of government above the believers, and putteth them in a state of ministeriall authority under these, above whom Jesus Christ hath placed them, contrary to <note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 1. 10.

I see not by our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns doctrine that Officers as Officers have any right title or

warrant to the Keyes, or to any use of them, seeing they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to believers as believers, and as Christs body and Spouse. 2. The place Matth. 28. 19. is against you; for you say, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall preaching and administration of the Seales are given onely to such as are Preachers by office. Now the converting of infidels and other unbelievers, to make them fit materials of a visible Church, is not (as you say) the charge proper to Pastors as Pastors, and by vertue of their Pastorall charge, as baptizing; by this place is their proper charge, because Pastors as Pastors convert none at all, nor can they as Pastors exercise any pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acts toward the un-converted; the un-converted by your way are under no Pastorall charge, but converted by Prophets, not in Office; Pastors as Pastors exercise all pastorall acts toward these onely who are members of a visible Church, as toward these onely who <hi>have professed by oath subjection to their ministery, ad are partakers of the precious faith, and are the sonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Lord God Almighty.</hi> So you teach.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> If the <hi>Reverend Authour</hi> had framed an Argument here, it should have been thus: Those who have received immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God a Commission of the same power, and to the same effect, by the Text Math. 18. 18. Which the Apostles of our Lord received by the Text, Joh. 20. 23. These may doe what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did in ordaining of Elders, seeing they are the successors of the Apostles, where there be no Elders.</p>
                  <p>But the Church of believers received the same Commission, Matth. 18. 18. which the Apostle did Joh. 20. 23. and where Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are wanting in the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of believers is their successors. <hi>Erge. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the assumption is false; for if the Church receive the same Commission Math. 28. The Apostles received Joh. 20. and you must adde Math. 28. 19. for the same Commission is given to the Apostles, Math. 28. 19. which is given Joh. 20. 23. But the Disciples received Commission, Ioh. 20. and Math. 28. of Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall binding and loosing, and preaching, by vertue of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and to administer the Sacraments in their owne persons, as you grant: therefore the Church of believers received com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from Christ (where Presbyters are not) to preach by vertue of an Office, and administer the Sacraments in their owne persons. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church of believers may, where there is no Presbytery, preach by verue of an Office, and administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. You will happily say, there is no such necessity of baptizing as of ordination of Ministers, and baptizing is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable, because we read not that any in the Apostolique Church baptized, but Pastors. I answer, there is, in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary necessity where there are no Presbyters at all, as little neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of ordination if there be Presbyters in other Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ordaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And since you never read that any in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique Church ordained Pastors, but Pastors onely; why, but we may have recourse to a Presbytery of other Congregations for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, as well as for baptizing; for it is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the question, to say that baptizing is proper to Pastors, but ordination is not so. yea but ordination by precept &amp; practice
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49702:111"/>
is never given but to Pastors, and Elders in consociation 1 Tin. 4 14 1 Tim. 5. 22. 2 Tim. 1. 6. 2 Tim. 2. 2, 3. Tit. 1. 5. Act. 6. 6. Act. 13. 3 Act. 14 23. 2. There is good reason why Pastors should be succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Apostles in the act of ordaining Pastors; &amp; you grant, where Pastors and Elders are, they succeed to the Apostles in the acts of ordination; but that all believers men and women should be the Apostles successours to ordaine Pastors, is a rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne case of Divinity, for 1 Cor. 12. 29. <hi>Are all Apostles? are all Prophets?</hi> Yea, not long agoe you said that Act. 1. an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty, amongst whom there were women, had all hand in the ordination of <hi>Matthias</hi> to be an Apostle; so that beleevers by you are made the Apostles successours; and more, yea even co-ordainers, and joynt-layers on of hands with the Apostles. Yea, if believers received immediately this same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from Christ, Math. 18. which the Apostles received Ioh. 20. Believers are to ordaine Pastors no lesse, when the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery and Elders are present, then when they are absent; yea, and rather then the Apostles, because the <hi>Church</hi> of beleevers their patent passed the Seales first, even before the Lords resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. 3. It is good you grant that ordination and election are different, we will make use of it hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Authour</hi> addeth, <hi>We willingly also acknowledge, where God</hi>

                     <hi>hath furnished a Church with a Presbytery, to them it appertaineth by imposition of hands to ordaine Elders and Deacons chosen by the Church; but if the Church want a Presbytery, they want a Warrant to repaire to other Churches to receive imposition of hands to their Elders.</hi> 1. <hi>Because ordination is a worke of Church power, now as Church hath power over another, so no Presbytery hath power over another Church then their owne; All the Apostles received alike power, Ioh.</hi> 20. 23. 2 <hi>The power of the keyes is a liberty purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Christs blood, Math.</hi> 28. 8.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> We desire a warrant from <hi>Gods Word, where Elders, where they are present, are to ordaine Elders by imposition of hands,</hi> and not believers; for ordination is a worke of the Church; Officers are not the Church, nor are they parts or members of the Church, but onely accidents; the Church hath its full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49702:111"/>
the power and use of the Keyes given to them by Math. 18. though there be not a Pastor or Officer among them; and if Christ before his resurrection gave the Keyes to beleevers as to his Spouse, living body, and such as have <hi>Peters</hi> faith Math. 16. Resolve us, we beseech you brethren, in this, how Christ can give the Keyes after his resurrection, Ioh. 20. 23. to the Apostles as Pastors, and as no believers, not his Spouse, not his body; for Officers, as Officers, are not the redeemed of God, nor Christs Spouse. If you say that Christ, Ioh. 20. gave the Keyes to his Disciples as beleevers, then he gave the power of baptizing after his resurrection also, by the parallel place Math. 28. 19. to the Apostles as to beleevers. Hence 1. Christ hath never given the Keyes to Officers as Officers. 2. The place Ioh. 20. is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Keyes given to the Church, Math. 16. and Math. 18. and all believers are sent and called to be Pastors, as the Father sent <hi>Christ,</hi> and as <hi>Christ</hi> sent his Apostles, as our Lord speaketh, John 20. 21. This I thinke all good men will abhorre, though M. <hi>Smith</hi> saith these words, and that power Iohn 20. 21. was given to <hi>Cleo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There is no warrant of the Word to make good, that Christ gave the Keyes to Officers as Officers, by your way, but onely to Officers as to beleevers; and therefore believers ought rather to ordaine Pastors then the Officers, though there be Officers to ordaine. 3. That Pastors of other Congregations may not ordaine Pastors to Congregations, who have no Pastors of their owne. as they may baptize infants to them also, we see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Yea, and Church power is not a thing that cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to another Church by your Doctrine, for ye grant members of one Congregation may receive the Lords Supper in another Congregation, except you deny all communion of sister Churches, for it is a worke of Church power to give the Lords Supper to any, then if you give that Sacrament to members of another Congregation; consider if the liberty purchased by Christs Blood be not communicable to other Churches.</p>

But they speake of Election to a charge as of marriage, which is not well understood, for by marriage a man is both made a Husband, and a Husband to this Wife onely: by election a Pastor is not made a Pastor, by ordination he is made a Pastor of the Church Universall, though hee be not made an Universall Pastor. 3.

If, as our Brethren say, the peoples after acceptance may supply the want of Election at first, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> after consent to <hi>Leah</hi> made her his Wife, yet all the pastorall acts of Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and censures going before the after consent shall be <hi>null,</hi> because he wanteth that which most principally and essentially is required in a calling.

The people are not infallible in their choise, and may refuse a man for a pastor, whom <hi>God</hi> hath called to be a pastor; election maketh not one a pastor, <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> then he shall be no pastor whom <hi>God</hi> hath made a Pastor, because people out of ignorance or prejudice consent not to his Ministery.

                  <p>1. <hi>Distinct.</hi> That is. 1.

For they had usurped no power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and Teaching all Churches: though, I professe, I see no inconvenience to say that <hi>Luther</hi> was extraordinarily called by <hi>God,</hi> to goe to many Churches, to others then to <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> where hee had one particular charge, yea even through <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> through the <hi>Helvetian</hi> and Westerne Churches, which yet doth not make them essentially Apostles, because. 1. They were not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of Christs Death, and Resurrection, which as a new Doctrine to the World, as Apostles, they behoved to preach, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 22. They only revealed the old truth borne downe by an universall Apostacy. 2. Because they were not immediately called, nor gifted with diverse Tongues. And the like I may say of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi> for men in an extraordinary apostacy to goe somewhat farther then to that which a particular Church calleth them to, is not formally apostolick, yet lawfull.</p>

I answer, this is to flee to the invisible Church; but the Professors of these visible Churches as Professors and in Church-state might fall away from the Church profession. If they say, they cannot fall from the sincerity of a true profession; now yet they are aside, and flee from the visible Professors, and Churches visibility agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church as visible; to the Churches sincerity and invisible grace of constancy proper to the invisible Church, and by this meaning, none are the true visible Church, nor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, but only such as have profession, and withall sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of profession; so Hypocrites, though never so fairely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched, have no power of the Keyes, of censures of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, of admitting of Church members, of Baptizing, &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Church</hi> with whom the covenant is made, and to whom the promises of the covenant are made, is the Spouse of Christ, his mysticall body, the <hi>Sons and Daughters of the</hi> Lord God <hi>Almighty, a royall priest-hood, a chosen generation, Kings and Priests to</hi> God: but this is the invisible <hi>Church</hi> of elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, not the visible <hi>Church</hi> of visible professors. Therefore the invisible, and not the visible <hi>Church,</hi> is the first subject of all the priviledges of Christians, and all the promises of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. The proposition is not doubted. I prove the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The visible Church as it is such, is a company of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the truth, and connot be, as it is such, the Spouse of Christ and his Body. 1.

Our Brethrens argument is strong to prove, that the <hi>Church</hi> of Elders are not the true Church spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Word; For, say they, the true Church is a flock that <hi>Christ hath Redeemed with his Blood, Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>The Temple of the living God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. But the Church of Elders is not a flock of redeemed ones, and Temples of the holy Spirit, but in so far as they believe, and are elected to glory, and not as a flock of Elders, are they redeemed: so they say, true Elders, as Elders,

are not a part of the true Church, nor the Church to whom Christ gave the keyes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. But the Church making <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> confession. So say wee, the <hi>Church</hi> of visible professors, as they are such, are not the redeemed of Christ, and Temples of the holy Spirit, but in so far as they are Believers and the elect of God. For if our Brethren say, the Church, as it is a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of visible Professors, is also essentially the Church of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed ones, then only the Church of visible Professors, and all the Church of visible Professors are redeemed of God, but this is absurd and false. <hi>Quod convenit</hi>

But our Brethren do not (I hope) thinke that Gods intentions, are castles in the Aire, <hi>and new Ilands beyond the Moone,</hi> as if his intentions could be frustrated, and he could misse the white of the scope he shooteth at; for certainly these to whom the covenant, and promises thereof belong as to the prime and first subject, these are his covenanted people; now the orthodox and reformed <hi>Church</hi> holdeth, that the covenant and promises are preached to the whole visible <hi>Church,</hi> but for the elects sake, and that howsoever externally, the covenant of grace and promises be promulgated to every one, and all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the lists of the visible <hi>Church;</hi> yet they belong in <hi>Gods</hi> Intention and gratious purpose only to the Elect of <hi>God,</hi> and his reseemed ones, to that invisible Body, Spouse, Sister, whereof Christ alone is Lord, Head, Husband, and Brother, and the first begotten amongst many Brethren. Hence let me reason thus. The <hi>Church</hi> whose gathering together, <hi>and whose unity of Faith, knowledge of the Son of God, and growth of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the stature of the fulnes of Christ,</hi> the Lord intendeth by giving to them for that end, <hi>some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Pastors and Teachers, Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. must be the <hi>Church</hi> to which all the promises of the covenant and priviledges do belong. But the Lord intendeth the gathering together, the unity of Faith, the knowledge of the Son of God and growth of the measure of the stature of Christ only of the invisible Elected and Redeemed <hi>Church,</hi> not of the visible professing or conses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Church,</hi> nor doth the Lord send Pastors and Teachers up-on a purpose and intention of gathering the visible <hi>Church,</hi> and visible <hi>Israel,</hi> except you flie to the Tents of <hi>Arminians.</hi> I conceive these arguments cannot be answered. If any say, that Christ in giving Prophets, Pastors and Teachers to his Church intendeth to save the true visible <hi>Church</hi> of the chosen and redeemed, in so far as they are chosen and redeemed, now they who answer thus, come to our hand and forsake the Doctrine of their visible Church, and say with us, that the Ministery

and the keys are given only upon a purpose on Gods part to save the invisible <hi>Church,</hi> and that all these promises of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the styles of <hi>Christs</hi> Spouse, Sister, Faire one, are not proper to the visible <hi>Church,</hi> nor any ground or argument to prove that the keys, the power of excommunication, ordaining of officers are given to the visible <hi>Church,</hi> as to the prime and principall subject.</p>

We againe do teach, that the scandalously wicked are to be cast out of the <hi>Church</hi> by excommunication, and these of approved piety are undoubtedly members of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> so these of the middle sort are to be acknowledged members of the <hi>Church,</hi> though the <hi>Church</hi> have not a positive certainty of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity, that they are regenerated, so they be knowen. 1 To be Baptized. 2. That they be free of grosse scandals. 3. And professe that they be willing hearers of the Doctrine of the Gospell. Such a profession, as giveth evidences to the positive certainty of the judgement of charity, of sound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, is not required to make and constitute a true visible <hi>Church.</hi>

                  <p>1. <hi>Argu.

Now Christ would have blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ill discerning in admitting such to be the materialls of a visible <hi>Church,</hi> as hee reproveth their other faults in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither could Christ reprove these <hi>Churches,</hi> for not exercising the <hi>Church-censures</hi> against liers, <hi>false Apostles,</hi> fleshly <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> followers of <hi>Balaams</hi> wicked Doctrine, <hi>Jezebed</hi> and other ill doers and seducers, if these had not been <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,</hi> as our Brethren teach, how can we conceive, that Christ would call these <hi>Churches,</hi> who were false in the matter, or give his presence and communion by walking among the <hi>golden candlestickes,</hi> and holding <hi>the starres,</hi> the Ministery, <hi>in his right hand?</hi> And if every one of these Churches were approved to the consciences one of another, that they positively knew they were all of them, <hi>a royall Priest-Hood, an holy Generation, all taught of God, all sonnes and daughters of the</hi> Lord God <hi>Almighty,</hi> how are there such grosse scandals put upon them by Jesus Christ?</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Argu. Paul</hi> clearely teacheth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> convened had the power of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> amongst them, and was a betrothed Bryde espoused in a Church cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, even all of the visible Church as one chaste Virgin to God, as our Brethren prove from the, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1, 2, 3. Who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit and the Gospell, their minds being knit thereunto, in the simplicity of <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> now if the matter of this betrothed Church was such, as our Brethren say, then Christs Power, and Presence and Spirit, were in these as the <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and these were betrothed to <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and had received the Spirit and were Saints by calling, were justified, washen, sanctified, who were <hi>incestuous, Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, Drunkards, Railers, carnall, Schismaticks, going to the Law one with another before Infidells, partakers of the Table of</hi> Christ <hi>and of divells,</hi> deniers of the Resurrection, to whom the Word was the <hi>savour of Death,</hi> and the Gospell as it is to these, <hi>whom the God of this world, Satan, hath blinded.</hi> What can be more repugnant to the truth and to the Gospell of Christ? It cannot
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49702:129"/>
be answered, that these in <hi>Corinth</hi> who were hypocrites and walked so contrary to the Gospell were not members of the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> For only the truly converted were such. I answer. 1. Then <hi>Paul</hi> writeth not to the visible Church and to all whom he doth rebuke, the contrary whereof is cleare. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. 2. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17 18 19, 30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and in many other places.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then the visible <hi>church</hi> was not betrothed to <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>a chaste Virgin:</hi> contrary to this our Brethren alleadged, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1 2, 3. 3. Not only is conversion professedly true in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity, but also in the judgement of verity, essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to a visible <hi>church</hi> as you teach; and so none can be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the visible <hi>church,</hi> but he who is a member of the invisible Church, which is Anabaptisme. 4. Three thousand in one day were added to the visible <hi>church,</hi> who could not (as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) <hi>all be approved to the conscience one of another,</hi> as true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Since amongst them were <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and the time was short. 5. If we are to beare one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ, and if grace may be beside many and great sinnes, as we see in <hi>Asa,</hi> in <hi>Salomon</hi> who remained the children of <hi>God,</hi> under many out breakings, if the children of <hi>God</hi> may be the children of <hi>God,</hi> and yet some of them habitually proud, passionate, some of them worldly minded, some talkative and imprudently rash in zeale, some lustfull, some slothfull, some ambiticus, yea and if <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his profession, though false, was esteemed sufficient, for to give him baptisme, the Seale of the covenant, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 9. Then it is not required that all the members of the visible <hi>church</hi> be such as positively wee know (so farre as humane knowledge can reach) that they are converted, yea if this were true, then spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commandements would be given, that as we are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and try our selves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And to try officers before they be admitted, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 22. and to try the spirits of Prophets and their Doctrine, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1. and, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 13. So would God in his Word give a charge, that we try, examine and judge carefully one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that every man labour to be satisfied in conscience

anent the regeneration one of another. But such commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we reade not of. 6. If many be brought and called into the visible <hi>church,</hi> of purpose both on Gods revealed intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his Word to convert them, and on the <hi>churches</hi> part that they may be converted; Then doth not the <hi>church</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fist of these who are professedly converted, but the former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The proposition is sure, these whom God purposeth to convert by making them <hi>Church-members,</hi> they are not Church-members because they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready converted. I prove the assumption, because. 1. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrine, to wit, that none are under a pastors care till they be first converted, maketh to the eversion of the publick Ministery, and gratifieth <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> as before I observed, because Faith commeth not by hearing of sent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, as Gods ordinance is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. but by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we aske a warrant from the Testament of <hi>Christ,</hi> that now since the Apostles are not in the Earth, private men not sent to preach, should be ordinary <hi>Fishers of men,</hi> and gatherers of <hi>Christs church</hi> and Kingdome. 2. That Christ hath provided no Pastors nor Teachers to watch over the Elect, yet remaining in the Kingdome of darknesse, and that <hi>Christ ascending on high,</hi> as a victorious King hath not given Pastors and Teachers by office to bring in his redeemed flock, which he hath bought with his blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. 3.

But the promisccous multitude of professors are not conceived to be such, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sanctified in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> are such. Or thus, If Christ be the head of the visible Church, then only such are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted members of the visible Church, as are conceived to be members of Christ the head, and not the promiscuous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of good and bad. But the former is true; <hi>Ergo,</hi> so is the latter. 1. If Christ be the head of the visible <hi>Church</hi> as visible, it would seeme onely these who are conceived Members of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> should bee admitted Members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible body. True and in this meaning let the Major passe; but if Christ <hi>be the head of the visible church</hi> not as it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but as it is a body of believers and invisible, then we see no reason to yeeld the connexion: Because <hi>Christ</hi> is the Head of True Believers, therefore none should be admitted members of the <hi>Church,</hi> but such as we conceive are Believers, because they are to be admitted to the visible <hi>Church,</hi> who are willing to joyne themselves are baptized and doe professe <hi>Christ</hi> to be their Head, though we cannot conceive whether they be sound believers or not; for a profession is sufficient to make them members of the visible body, though indeed to be sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49702:131"/>
in regard of the influence of common graces for the Ministery; government, and use of the keys: but because of such a degree of <hi>Christs</hi> Head-ship, it followeth only that these are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted members under Christ the Head, whom we conceive to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t members of the <hi>Church,</hi> as it is a Ministeriall and a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning society, and for this there is not required an union with <hi>Christ,</hi> as head, according to the influence of the life of <hi>Christ,</hi> but only an union with Christ, as head, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of common gifts, for the governing a Ministeriall Church; in which respect, Christ may be called the Head of <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor, and of some other hypocriticall Professors; and also though the promiscuous multitude, that is a multitude of prophane <hi>Atheists</hi> and scandalous mockers, be not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, nor are to be acknowledged as his members, but to be Excommunicated, yet the promiscuous multitude of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, whereof there be Reprobate and Elect, good and bad, are to be received and acknowledged as members of Christs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible body, wherof he is Head in the latter sense. 2. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proceedeth upon the false ground before observed and discovered, that Christ is Head of the Church and the Spouse, redeemer and Saviour of the visible Church, as it is visible, which is the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine of universall grace. 3. If these who are conceived to be members of Christ the Head and sound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are to be admitted, why doe you professe that Brethren of approved piety, and so conceived to be Believers by you, and consequently members of Christ the Head, cannot be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your <hi>Church,</hi> except they sweare to your <hi>Church</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which you cannot make good from Gods Word. Now to refuse communion to these who are knowen to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Christs</hi> body, and to separate from them is all one, and therefore in this you separate your selves from Christs Body.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The argument must be thus. <hi>These only we are to admit members of the visible</hi> Church, <hi>who in the judgement of charity are conceived to be such as were the members of the visible</hi> Church <hi>of Corinth and Ephesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But only such as are the habitation of God by his Spirit, and the sons and daughters of the living God, not only in profession, but in some measure of truth and sincerity, were the members of the visible</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Corinth <hi>and</hi> Ephesus:</p>
                  <p>Ergo, <hi>such onely are we to admit to be members of the visible</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p>Now this argument concludeth not what is in question; <hi>Ergo,</hi> only these are to be admitted members of the visible Church, whom we conceive to be the Spouse of Christ, and truely rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. Now if our conception be erroneous (as it cannot be infallible) then we may admit these who are not regenerated, to the <hi>Church-membership,</hi> if we conceive them to be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and so our Brethren say falsely, that <hi>the admitted</hi> must be <hi>Saints and faithfull, not only in profession, but in some measure of sincerity und truth,</hi> for these are members of the invisible Church who are truly and in a measure of sincerity regenerated, if our conception be not erroneous: yet it is by accident, that they are admitted <hi>de facto,</hi> who are not Saints in truth, for the <hi>Church</hi> may be deceived, and receive in for members of the Head <hi>Christ,</hi> hypocrites and such as are not the <hi>Habitation of God by his Spirit,</hi> but of Satan; as is cleare in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> admitted by the <hi>Apostles</hi> to <hi>Church-fellowship, Acts</hi> 5. 1. 2. and in <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. admitted to the <hi>Church</hi> and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the <hi>Apostolick</hi> Church, who was <hi>yet in the Gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But. 1. The assumption is false, for the Apostle admitted to be members of the <hi>Church</hi> visible of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> not only Saints by true profession, but also carnall men, deniers of the Resurrection, partakers of the Tables of Divells, and in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49702:132"/>
                     <hi>Ephesus</hi> false Apostles and Liers, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 3. But <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of <hi>Corinth</hi> according to the best part: for the Epistle and Doctrine of the covenant is written and preached for the Elects sake and for Believers; neither is the covenant of grace made with the Reprobate and Unbelievers, nor doe the promises of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, indeed, and in Gods Intention belong to the visible <hi>Church,</hi> though the Word be preached to carnall men for their conviction. 3 This proposition is false (<hi>these onely we are to admit to the visihle</hi> Church, <hi>whom we conceive to be Saints, and are in the judgement of charity perswaded they are such</hi>) for the Apostles admit all Professors, even three thousand at one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in one day, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and they could not be perswaded in the judgement of charity, that they were all Saints. 4. This argument sayth, that all the visible <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was <hi>a Spouse betrothed to</hi> Christ, <hi>and Saints by calling,</hi> which the Word of God sayth not. For were all the carnall in <hi>Corinth</hi> betrothed as one chaste Virgin to Christ? were these who called themselves Apostles in <hi>Ephesus</hi> and tryed by Church censures to be Liers, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 2, 3. betrothed to Christ as a chaste Virgin? were all the visible Church the <hi>sinnes and daughters of the</hi> Lord God <hi>Almighty? and that not only in profession but in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sincerity and truth?</hi> It is true, the stiles given to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> are too high to be given to hypocrites, but these stiles are not given to that Church precisely, as visible and as a professing Church, as you suppose, but as an visible and true Church of Believers: for a Church of Believers and a Church of Professors of beliefe are very different. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> writeth to a visible Church, but he doth not speake alwayes of them as a visible Church, but as of an invisible, when he calleth them <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Saints by calling, &amp;c. he wrote the Epistles to the incestuous man, whom he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to cast out of the Church.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Gods acts of speciall and gratious providence, are not rules of duties to us; <hi>God</hi> addeth to the <hi>Church</hi> as it is invisible and <hi>Christs</hi> Body, it followeth not therefore we are to adde to the Church visible as visible. <hi>Gods</hi> adding is invisible by giving Faith and saving grace to some to professe sincerely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we see not Faith nor sincerity, therefore <hi>Gods adding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> be a rule to our adding. <hi>God</hi> doth adde a person falling into an open scandall to the <hi>Church</hi> invisible, having given him true Faith, but the <hi>Church</hi> is not to adde him, but to cut him off, if he be obstinate to the <hi>Church,</hi> and refuse him, and so this proveth nothing, nor is the place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. by any, except your selves, expounded of a receiving into a <hi>Church-communion,</hi> as is elsewhere declared. 2. Where there is no shew of saving worke of conversion; there you thinke the Stewards want <hi>God</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before to receive, but then except <hi>God</hi> be seene to goe before to regenerate, the <hi>Church</hi> Stewards cannot follow to adds such to the <hi>Church;</hi> but since that same power that casteth out of the <hi>Church</hi> holdeth out of the <hi>Church,</hi> if any after they be received, shall be found to be not added of <hi>God,</hi> because they be not regenerated, yet we are not to cast any out for <hi>non-regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> even knowen, except it breake out into scandals, and then the person is not cast out for <hi>non-regeneration,</hi> for though he were knowen to be regenerated, yet for scandals the <hi>Church</hi> is obliged to cast him out, because the scandall leaveneth the whole Church, and. 2. <hi>The casting out is a meane to save the spirit in the day of the</hi> Lord. But I prove, none are to be cast out for <hi>non-regeneration,</hi> where there be no outbreakings into scandalls. 1. Because, <hi>de occultis Ecclesia non judicat, non-Regeneration</hi> where it is not backed with publick scandalls is a hidden thing, that the <hi>Church</hi> can neither judge nor censure. 2. None are to be cast out but for such a scandall, that if the party deny, should be proved by two witnesses, as Christs Law provideth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 16. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. 3. Onely publick scandalls which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend many, are to be censured by the Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. that others may feare. But <hi>non-regeneration</hi> breaking out into
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49702:133"/>
no scandalls, can neither be proved by witnesses, if the party deny, nor is it a seene thing which giveth publick scandalls, and therefore is not the object of Church censures. For it is evident though the Stewards see some not regenerated, and so not added by the Lord to the Church they are to adde these same and cannot cast them out. And yet <hi>God</hi> goeth before them in adding them to the visible <hi>Church,</hi> when they professe the truth. 3. <hi>God</hi> addeth such as should be saved to the visible <hi>Church</hi> by baptisme, because the adjoyning to a visible <hi>Church</hi> is a way to salvation, but it followeth not that all whom <hi>God</hi> addeth to the visible <hi>Church</hi> are saved ones, for then the visible <hi>Church</hi> should consist only of believers, which only <hi>Anabaptists</hi> teach. 4. Whereas he sayth, <hi>The Stewards should be faithfull, and should not adde except God adde,</hi> it seemeth to infer that either all the people are Stewards, and so Officers contrary to <hi>Gods Word, Eph.</hi> 4. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29. or that onely officers admit <hi>Church-members,</hi> which is against our Brethrens Doctrine, for they teach, that the whole multitude of believers are only to adde and cast out.</p>

We desire a warrant from the Word, that the Temple was a Type of a visible Congregation, and that all must be as really holy before they enter into a visible congregation, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be Typically holy, who entered into the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The Temple is a Type of Christs Body, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. and of the Church of the New Testament invisible, which must consist of sanctified ones, but how it is a Type of the visible Church we see not.

are these <hi>who are built on the Doctrine of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and grow up into an holy Temple in</hi> Christ, <hi>and are the habitation of God through his Spirit.</hi> This cannot agree to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, the members whereof may be (as our Brethren teach from <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.) <hi>Hypocrites who fall from their first love.</hi> Yea also the laying on of stones on the bulding is not the act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching, or of union to a <hi>Church,</hi> as it must be, if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison prove the poynt, but the joyning of the stones to the building is the union of these stones by Faith to Christ, the chiefe corner stone, as is expounded, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>To whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as to a living stone, v.</hi> 5. <hi>yee also as liveing stones are built, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, and <hi>Peter</hi> doth not build this comfortable Doctrine all upon the comforts of a <hi>Church-state</hi> in a single congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for many of these to whom he writ, were dispersed and persecuted through <hi>Pontus, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia, &amp;c.</hi> And might have, and had an Union with Christ by Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Church Union in a Parish. 2. Though in this Type were signified a morall obligation, that all before they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched in a visible Congregation, should be converted, how is it proved that the <hi>Church</hi> should receive none to a visible Congregation till they bee converted? for these are farre different. All should be converted, but there is no new Law commanding the Church to receive none into her fellowship, but the converted. 3. The hewers of stones or builders of the Temple, must Typifie Pastors in Office, dressing stones for the spirituall building, our Brethren make them to Typifie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians out of Office, and deny that any Pastors as Pastors doe fit and prepare stones to bee layd on the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall building. Also none layd stones on that Temple save onely builders by Office, but by our Brethrens Doctrine, onely Pastors doe not convert Soules. There were no Stones at all in the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but choice and well squared stones, are no members of the visible Church but the chosen of God?</p>

of the visible Church, that he be converted. It is sufficient that he be a professor of the Faith. And it is a poore compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison to say, that <hi>prophannesse cannot be put in the description of a visible Church,</hi> for in the essence of a visible Church as visible, we neither include <hi>Holinesse</hi> nor <hi>Propanenesse,</hi> but only a visible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany professing the Faith of Christ and called by the Ministery of the Word, whether they be Believers or Unbelievers it is all one, neither of the two belongeth to the essence of a visible <hi>church:</hi> a visible <hi>Church</hi> is saved in the number of fourty, all being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or in 40. being all unconverted, so they be externally called by the Ministery of the Gospell and prosesse the same. And it is as foolish to make holinesse the essence of a child, as to make it of a visible Church, and as vaine to make chastity the essence of a married Wife; for this is not our philosophy, but a conceit of Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> falsely imputed to us.</p>

Ruiz Molina, Laessius, Lod. Meratius Hiero. Fasolus and their Disciples,</hi> the Arminians, labour to prove that God cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate the will of man to the positive acts that are in sin: For then he should be the author and cause of sin which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49702:140"/>
he forbiddeth us to do, and he would not do himselfe, say they, that which he forbiddeth us. Which is but in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall a weake answer, for it followeth not hence, that he is the author of the malice, because he praedeterminates the will to the positive act of sinning. For though God in his working Providence permit wicked men to be in the <hi>Church</hi> (as you cannot deny his providence here) yet doth it not follow, that he soweth wicked men in the <hi>Church.</hi> Nor doe we say, that it is the Lords appoving and revealed will that hypocrites should joyne with his friends at the marriage supper of the Gospell, they wanting their wedding garment. It is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites sin that they joyne themselves to the Church, they being heart Enemies to the truth. And in this respect God soweth them not in the <hi>Church.</hi> But the question is if the Church and Pastors sin in receiving such into the bosome of the Church, because they see not, in conscience, that they are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: That we deny, yea the servants bid all come whom they finde. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 9. and that by the commandement of <hi>God.</hi> And in this respect <hi>God</hi> doth not plant his visible Church a noble Vine, and a Field sowen with good seed, yea it is his revealed Will that the Church and the Servants of God invite all to come to Wisdomes banquet, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 2. 3. and so all the called externally are not the <hi>choise Vines.</hi> This you are to prove, that the visible Church in all its members, or essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as it is a visible Church is a <hi>choise Vine, and an holy seed.</hi> Nor is it the Pastors negligence that Tares grow in the Lords Field (though it be Satans malice) yea the Pastors here are to invite all to come in, and to call externally all to come to Christ. That they who are invited give not obedience is their own wickednesse, but neither the Churches, nor the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors sinne.</p>

The Ministery in its substance is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, though it be from the <hi>Antichrist.</hi> For Prelates giving of a ministery is not to be measured by the particular intention of the Ordainers, but by the Nature of Gods Ordinances, and the generall meaning of all the Catbolick Church.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But I answer, 1. We read not in the New Testament, where Christ, or his Apostles bid break off Christian fellowship with any but there is excommunication signified. If these words <gap reason="foreign">

For <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>peccatum tuum est, quic quid tibi non displicet, every sin in another is thine, against which thou shewest not thy dislike.</hi> 2. The Law of nature doth inforce, that <hi>Lev,</hi> 19. 17. we should generally rebuk our brethren, and so shew our dislike for any sinne.</p>

                     </gap>nence from communion with him, else it doth not shame him. For every showen dislike or not-communion with another in his sinne, is not that which will put publick shame on him, that he may repent, as is intimated here. 2. Christ biddeth not accompt him <hi>a Publican,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is a note of similitude. <hi>Simile qua simile non est idem.</hi> Every thing like is not the same. So that he may well be <hi>accompted as an Heathen,</hi> not being altogether <hi>an Heathen,</hi> and yet a Brother, whose salvation and gaining you must intend. Nor is it altogether against the comparison of Christ, and that gentle waiting on perverse idolaters and excommunicate persons to admonish them as Brethren. Seing it becommeth us to be <hi>mercifull as our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father is,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 24, 25. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. <hi>And we must forgive our offending Brethren seventy seven times, Mat.</hi> 18. 22. And therefore though he were twice excommunicated, he is to be dealt with as a Brother. And an Idolatrous brother is no worse then a Samaritan neighbour or friend. 2. If Excommunication be a medicine of the Church toward a sick sonne, the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is salvation, <hi>that the spirit may be saved in the Lords Day,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>that he may learne not to blaspheme,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1. 12. <hi>That be may be gained, Mat.</hi> 18. 15. Ergo, he is not altogether cut off from the Church, for delivering to Satan is medicinall, not vindictive, as the great Excommunication is which is called <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> which we cannot use, but against such, as have sinned the sin against the Holy Ghrist, and is hardly discerned, and I would think, such an one as <hi>Julian the Apostate</hi> should be debarred from the communion of the word preached. But these who are ordinarily excommunicated for contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and particular faults, and not for universall Apostacy, are not altogether excluded from all brotherhood of the <hi>Church.</hi> 3. If the excommunicate person be excluded from all priviledges of <hi>Church-fellowship,</hi> then also is he excluded from hearing the word as a sick patient under Church-medicine, for it is a pastorall, and so to our Brethren a <hi>Church-act,</hi> that the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard <hi>strengthen the diseased, heale that which is sick, bind up that which is broken, bring againe that which is driven away, seeke that which is lost, Ezec.</hi> 34. 4.

But this latter none can say but <hi>Novatians. Ergo,</hi> neither can the former be said. The major is undeniable, whosoever can, and may commit sins deserving excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are to be excommunicated, as Christ saith, Matth. 18. 17. 18. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. Now if the converted cannot fall into grievous sins against the <hi>Church,</hi> such as contumacy; neither can they fall into grievous sins against God, 2. By this doctrine no professors are to be excommunicated at all, for all within the visible Church are either converted or non-converted; the converted are not to be excommunicated, saith <hi>Robinson,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the true members of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of Christs body; now the non-converted far lesse can be excommunicated, because those cannot be cast out who are not within, as our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren teach. For they are the false matter of the Church, and no part of it, yea (and as our Authour saith,) <hi>have no measure of sincerity and truth;</hi> and therefore cannot be members of the <hi>Church.</hi> Now the <hi>Church</hi> (say our brethren) <hi>cannot judge those which are without,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. 3 This opinion is just the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> that the true members of the visible Church are onely regenerate persons, and they onely have the essence of the true membership, which is false; they are within

The <hi>Nicolaitans, Iezabel,</hi> the <hi>false Apostles,</hi> the spreaders of <hi>Balaams doctrine,</hi> Revel. 2. and those who offend in <hi>Christs Kingdome</hi> are all necessarily either not to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated at all, or necessarily they are all unconverted, by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binsons</hi> doctrine, or all converted, by Mr. <hi>Coachmans</hi> way. And the Church then shall not bind and loose in Heaven, but <hi>clave errante,</hi> except they be all known certainly to be converted who are excommunicated, or certainly knowne not to be converted. But this were ridiculous; the object of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by Christ is one which <hi>refuseth to heare the Church,</hi> whether he be converted, or not converted. 5. All our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines standing for the cerainty of the perseverance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, answer <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> alledging for the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy of the Saints, the example of the regenerated who may be excommunicated, that excommunication doth never evince that the person excommunicated is out of the state of grace, but onely that he hath fallen into a scandalous externall fact, which deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that he should <hi>be delivered to Satan,</hi> and that one may be a member of the visible Church and converted to <hi>God,</hi> who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. Lastly, <hi>Robinsons</hi> arguments doe bewray great Ignorance in the doctrine of the true Church; to wit, that first it should follow, that if the <hi>Church excommunicate a converted person, it should destroy its own essence;</hi> for conversion is the essence of the invisible Church, not of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> and is not destroyed by excommunication. But the beleever is edified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, for he is delivered to Satan <hi>for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord;</hi> but that he is cut off from the visible Church is no more inconvenient, then to cut off a rotten apostume of excrescent carnosity of the body, which hurteth the physicall integrity of the body, but doth not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any part of the essence, so as it should not thereafter be a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving body. His mixt argument hath a cry, but no force; <hi>It should follow that the member of Christs body</hi> (saith he) should be <hi>delivered to Satan;</hi> which is not inconvenient, for this is the Ordinance of Christ <hi>to save the mens spirit, and to teach him not to blasph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That same word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, believed, and outwardly professed is a signe of the visible Church. For where Gods pastors and shepheards are, there be flocks of redeemed ones, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 12, 13, 14. 3 The Word simply preached and professed in a setled way of a fixed ministery is a note of a ministeriall <hi>Church;</hi> this is cleare from Gods intention, for he sendeth it of purpose to save his own, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. For a man lighteth not a Candle in his house for nothing. So this word preached, as it is Gods Word, is not properly the forme and essence of the Church, but as believed and received, it is the forme of the Church invisible. 2. But to professe this word savingly, <hi>est signum Ecclesiae, non not A, it is a signe, that doth not infallibly notifie to us that such is for this time an invisible</hi> Church <hi>of redeemed ones:</hi> for I have not infallible certainty what one man, or what determinate number of men by name are true believers, profession may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile me, as also the invisible <hi>Church</hi> (as such) is believed, and not knowen infallibly by any note or externall marke that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth into the senses. Neither is the preaching of the Word a note or infallible marke of the Church ministeriall to all, or in relation to Infidels; for the Word preached <hi>actu primo &amp; ex naturâ suâ, essentially and of its own nature,</hi> is more knowen and more sensible then the <hi>Church:</hi> because the preached word is a Doctrine expounding what the true Church is, and we do not expound <hi>ignotum per ignotius, vel per aequè ignotum.</hi> Darknesse cannot let us see darknesse, or colours; only light doth reveale things. But the word preached in relation to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers cannot be an infallible note of the Church, for to a blind man the morning as not a sensible marke that the sun is rising; nor is smoake to a dead man, a sensible marke of fire, because he hath no senses to discerne either. So to the infidell though the word as a sound, or in a literall evidence

be clearer then the Church, and in a confused knowledge he knoweth the one better than the other; yet is the true word, in respect of certaine knowledge and spirituall evidence, as darke to him as the <hi>Church:</hi> for he hath not Eares to heare, nor eyes to see any of the things of God, either the word preached, or the Church; and therefore the word is both by nature and to us, &amp; <hi>naturâ &amp; nobis,</hi> in respect of distinct knowledge, more knowen, but not simply as the word, <hi>actu primo,</hi> but <hi>actu se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo,</hi> as it both striketh upon outward and inward senses and as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The settled professed preaching of the Word is a note of the visible <hi>Church</hi> Ministeriall, and that there either is, or in Gods own time shall be some invisible Church of sanctified ones there. 1.

There is a power of discipline, and there is a care thereof.

For in this the Apostles must stand in the person and roome of a single
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49702:153"/>
society of believers united by a Church covenant in one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishonall Church, if our brethrens grounds stand good; so as a Parishionall <hi>Church</hi> must be the onely successors of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but this no Word of God can warrant. Nor is the Eldership of a single Congregation that which the <hi>Apostles</hi> here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; except you say to this Eldership, as to the first subject, is this message of sending, as the Father sent Christ, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to this Eldership within one Congregation is the power Ministeriall of pardoning and retaining sinnes given; For I aske, from whence, or from whose hands do the Eldership of a Congregation receive the keys? from <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> say they, but this is no answer, the Ministery according to its institution is no doubt onely from the head of the body the <hi>Church,</hi> from <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> But I aske now of an ordinary Church-calling; and I demand from whose hands under Jesus Christ have this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Eldership received Ministeriall power: they cannot say from themselves, for they doe not make themselves Ministers: they will not say from a Colledge of Presbyters of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, for they are flatly against all such presbyteries, and that which they say indeed, the Eldership of a congregation hath their Ministeriall power from the people. Well then, the Apostles when they received the keys they did represent the people: but what people? not the people of a classicall presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, of a Province, of a Nation, of the whole redeemed Church, but of one single congregation; how shall this be made out of the Text, or out of one Word of <hi>God,</hi> I see not. 2. Christ ascending on high, and <hi>giving some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers,</hi> 12. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints,</hi> (not of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> far lesse of one single Congregation onely) <hi>for the worke of the Ministery</hi> (in generall) <hi>for the edifying of the Body of</hi> Christ (not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall body onely) 12. <hi>Till we all meet in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto a perfit man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of</hi> Christ. Consider I pray you, that Christs intention in giving a Ministery is not for a congregation of forty, or sixty, or a hundred, as if hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to impawn all power in that Congregationall body; but hee intended the edifying of his body Catholick, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49702:153"/>the <hi>comming of all to the unity of the Faith.</hi> A Congregation of sixty cannot be <hi>all Saints,</hi> and this power is clearely given to that body, which the Lord is <hi>to make a perfit man, according to the measure of the fulnesse of the stature of</hi> Christ, this is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall man, and the Catholick body of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> Call it a Congregation and you wrest the Scripture, and vilifie the noble and large end for the which Christ hath given a ministery: as aske to what end, and to what first and principall subject hath the Lord given reason and a faculty of discoursing, is it to <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. as to the first subject, and for them as for their good? no, no, it is for and to the race of mankind. The case is is just so here, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>God hath placed some in the</hi> Church, <hi>first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, &amp;c.</hi> Is the meaning thus? <hi>God</hi> hath placed in the body of a single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation Apostles? Where do you read that? I believe <hi>Apostles</hi> have the Catholick visible <hi>Church</hi> for their Parish; and is it a Congregationall body, wherein <hi>God</hi> placed such variety of members, as <hi>Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, Workes of miracles, gifts of Healing, Helps, Governments, &amp;c? So</hi> Rom. 12. 5. <hi>So we being many are one body in</hi> Christ, <hi>and every one members of another.</hi> Hence hee reckoneth out divers offices in this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

                     <hi>The true catholick</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Christ <hi>is the Mother of all reformed Daughters,</hi> and that argument that our Brethren useth to prove a particular Church to be visible, because of externall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (not in one House, for that is accidentall to visibility, one congregation may meet in three caves of the Earth, in time of persecution, and yet remaine one congregation) holdeth good in this catholick <hi>church</hi> made up of so many organs, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is formed. 1. Begetting by the Ministery of the word, daughter-Churches to <hi>God,</hi> as they say a congregation doth, nor is it enough to say <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is not one by externall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and order of Discipline, because they cannot meet together to exercise Discipline, but shee is one invisibly, because shee hath <hi>one Faith, one Lord, one Baptisme, one Spirit, one Hope of glory.</hi> For the Text sayth, they have one and the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Teeth, Eyes, Haire, Temples, Locks; they are one <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and compact City, one Army terrible by the Sword of of discipline. 2. We do not say, to make them one visible <hi>church,</hi> that they must have one visible actuall government, in externall order: for when of a congregation of 60. their be 30 absent through sicknesse and the busines of a lawfull calling, they are one Church visible, though in one metting you cannot see them all with one cast of your Eye; and when the <hi>church of Ierusalem</hi> exceeding in number ten thousand, did meet in part. <hi>from House to House,</hi> that is in sundry Houses; yet <hi>continuing in the same doctrine of the Apostles, and in fellowship and in breaking of bread, and in prayer,</hi> Acts 2. 46. 32. our brethren will say, they are one <hi>church.</hi> And therefore the power of Discipline, and the exercise of the Word, Seales, and Discipline in parts, is sufficient to make one visible catholick Church. 4. To that Church hath <hi>Christ</hi> given, as to the first <hi>church,</hi> the ordinances and ministery,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49702:154"/>
which he principally intendeth to perfit, to gather, and to bring to the unity of faith in a perfit body by these ordinances and that Ministery; because the wisdome of Christ hath not given his Ministery, and Ordinances to the catholick Church, intending principally to save them, except he give them a power in that Ministery to the first subject, which being put forth in acts may compasse that end. But Jesus Christ princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intends, to perfit to gather, to bring to the unity of faith in a perfit body, by these ordinances and Ministery, the whole catholick visible <hi>church,</hi> and secondarily only this or this particular congregation. Ergo, <hi>Christ</hi> hath given to the whole catholick Church, as to the first Church, the ordinances and Ministery, and so in this Mioistery catholick, hee ha h given the Keys to this catholick Church visible as to the first Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I prove it thus, when ever Chrst giveth gifts to a whole, he giveth it to the whole, by order of nature, before he give it to the parts of that whole, as is cleare by induction. He gives Christ a gift to the whole <hi>Church,</hi> by order of nature, first to the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. Then to this or this believer of the World. So he giveth redemption and grace by order of nature first to his <hi>Church</hi> in generall, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Christ</hi> dieth first for his <hi>Church,</hi> not this or that single company, or particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, first <hi>for His sheep,</hi> that is, the whole flock, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 11. then for this or this company, or this of this straying sheep; He came to seeke and save, first <hi>the lost, Luk.</hi> 19. 10. then this or this lost man. He died first to gather together in one, not one man onely, yee not the nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely, but to gather together in one, all the Children of <hi>God,</hi> which were scattered abroad, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. 25. and he is a propitiatiou by order of nature. First, <hi>for the sinnes of the whole World,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1. and then secondarily, for our sinnes, so hath hee given the gifts of <hi>Apostles, Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> first to, and for Saints, in common and in generall, and not for this and that Saint, or for this company of Saints at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Now that particular Congregations are parts of the great visible <hi>Church;</hi> I prove, and first that they are parts visible of a Presbytery, or a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of Congregations, within the locall bounds of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49702:155"/>
I make good thus. Those who have one common ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary object of externall government in Church-affairs, those are a whole visible community gifted with power from <hi>Christ</hi> to rule in that common and necessary object of government, and this and this portion of this whole community must be parts of that whole. But those Congregations within the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bounds of the circuit of a Presbytery have one common necessary object of externall government, in Church affaires; <hi>Ergo,</hi> those Congregations in such a circuit must be parts of this whole. The major I take from our Brethren, who therefore make a particular Congreation to be one in respect of ordinary meeting, to partake of word, seales, and to transect matters of jurisdiction, amongst themselves, but this agreeth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny congregations within one circuit, for they meet occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one with another in hearing the word and receiving the seales; and for the assumption I prove it thus, all those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations have these particulars of externall government in Church affaires, which they cannot transact within their owne Congregations, but doe <hi>ex aequo</hi> belong to them all. As 1. That they doe not give offence one to another; that one Church doe not hold the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> to the effence and scandall of other Churches. 2. That one Congregation make not Acts and Canons against the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and against the Acts of another Congregation agreeable to the Word of <hi>God.</hi> 3. That one <hi>Church</hi> admonish, rebuke, comfort, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke another to love and to good works,</hi> in such and such poynts; now though a Congregation make acts and constitutions for governing this, or that member of the community; yet they doe not, nor cannot make acts that oblige the community and the Church as the Church; the Church as the Church being a part is to be regulated by the whole, and if there be things that <hi>ex aequo</hi> concerne all, and doe not concerne one particular Church more then another, one particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation cannot governe in these. And by the like reason parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Churches</hi> and classicall Presbyteries, and Provinciall and Nationall <hi>Churches,</hi> are parts of the whole Catholick vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Because <hi>Christ</hi> hath not given the power of Ministery and

                  <p n="7">7.

And when he is excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his sins bound, as in Heaven, so on Earth, that is, not only in that Tract of ground, where a handfull of a little Congregation independent (as they say) of 10 or 20 or an 100 doth ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily feed, but in all the visible World where <hi>God</hi> hath a <hi>Church.</hi> and all both within the little Congregation where hee is, and without, are to repute him <hi>as an Heathen and a Publican.</hi> It is true some of our Brethren say, he is excommunicated onely out of that Congregation whereof hee is a member <hi>antecedentèr,</hi> because Christ hath given the power of excommunication onely 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4.

Even as the left hand doth cut off a finger of the right hand, which otherwayes should infect the whole body. Now it is not the left hand onely that cutteth off the contagious and infectious finger, but the whole man, deliberate reason and the will consenteth it should be done for the preservation of the whole man; the left hand is a meere instrument, and the losse of the finger is the losse of the whole body, and the finger is cut off the right hand not <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentèr,</hi> and onely off the right hand by that power intrinsecall onely in the right hand, but intrinsecall in the whole body; it is true the contagion should creepe through, and infect the right hand, and right arme first, and therefore incision is made upon the right hand. So if the Eldership of a Congregation deliver to <hi>Satan,</hi> it is not done by that power that is intrinseally onely in that Congregation, but by the power intrinsecall in the whole universall <hi>Church,</hi> who shall keepe communion with him that Eldership cuts him off as the instrument, or hand of the <hi>Church catholick,</hi> and the incision (as it were) is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in that meeting (I will not say of the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that is to be proved) because the contagion shall come first upon these with whom the delinquent is to keepe the nearest fellowship, and that Excommunication be performed in a meeting I grant, and the place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. saith so much, and a meeting of the Church. But that that is a meeting of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with favour of the learned, cannot be proved co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; though I thinke excommunication when it is actually performed, it should be done before the Congregation, but that is for the edification and nearest and most immediate practice of that Congregation, for the contagion is nearest to them, but the reason why the presence of the Congregation whereof the Delinquent is a member is requisit, is not because this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49702:156"/>
hath the sole intrinsecall power in her selfe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee onely doth formally and <hi>antecedentèr</hi> Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and the rest of the Churches <hi>consequenter,</hi> and by vertue of a communion: for the sister Churches are to debarre this excomunicate person from their communion with Christ in the Seales of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that by an intrinsecall authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and Church power, where as if he were not excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, they should have received him to a Communion with them in the Seales, and that by an intrinsecall authoritative and Church power, for one man cannot receive another to the Seales of the <hi>Covenant</hi> with him; because no one man hath a Church authority. If therefore the <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> is consociated by an intrinsecall <hi>Church-power</hi> should have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, if he had not been excommunicated, it is evident that hee was a member not onely of the Congregation out of which he is excommunicated, but also of the whole consociated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. 2, The man sins are bound on Earth <hi>antecedentèr,</hi> to all the consociated <hi>Churches.</hi> He is now equally uncapable of Church-fellowship in all the consociated <hi>Churches,</hi> as in that Congregation whereof he is a member. All without and within that Congregation are to hold him for no visible Saint; not to eate or drinke with him, he is now to all the visible Churches, in regard of visible communion, no member of that body whereof <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is head, no part of that <hi>City,</hi> of that building whereof <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Lord</hi> and chief corner-stone. And he is to the sister Churches in their authoritative &amp; Church-estimation (to speake so) and in relation to their power of Jurisdiction, in the very same case a member of <hi>Satan,</hi> that hee is in relation to the authoritative power of Jurisdiction of that Congregation whereof he was a neerest member; just as the finger cut off is alike separated from the body, yea the whole body as from the hand; and it is a wonder to me that <hi>Christ</hi> giveth an intrinsecall power to a Congregation of twenty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to cut off a member, for the preservation of that little company of the Lords Flock, and that he hath denied that intrinserall power to the whole, which is no lesse in danger to be infected, seeing <hi>Christ</hi> principally intendeth in the giving of a Ministery to the whole Church, especially the gathering
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49702:157"/>
of the whole body; <hi>To the full and perfit stature of the age of</hi> Christ, <hi>in the unity of Faith, Eph.</hi> 4. 11. yet he intendeth the salvation &amp; preservation of the whole from infection more then the salvation of a part of this whole Body. That is, as it you would say, the <hi>God</hi> of Nature hath given an intrinsecall power to five hundred in a <hi>City</hi> to set guides over themselves and to rule themselves by wholesome Lawes, but hee hath denied that power to the whole <hi>City</hi> consisting of ten thousand; and he hath given to the right hand an intrinsecall power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that a finger in the right hand infected with a Gangrene, be cut off, but he hath denied this intrinsecall power to the whole man. I beseech you doth the <hi>God</hi> of Nature in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this power to the right Arme, intend the preservation of the right Arme onely, and its wellbeing, and not rather the preservation of the whole body? so doth not <hi>Christ</hi> intend that the whole consociated <hi>Churches</hi> shall be preserved from infection, and not that particular Congregation onely? Then if Christs meanes be congruously fitted for his owne end, he must have given an intrinsecall power to many consociated <hi>Churches</hi> to cast out a contagious lumpe; other wayes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated <hi>Churches</hi> are to exercise the punishment of avoyding the Excommunicated person <hi>as an Heathen,</hi> which floweth from a power which is no wayes in them; what conscience is here? 2. What if the Congregation cast the man out, <hi>clave errante,</hi> and undeservedly? shall they, <hi>consequentèr,</hi> as sister Churches, in a brutish fraternity execute a sentence of a power intrinserall in another Church, and not any of them, or their guides have any power to discerne, whether the censure be justly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly infflicted? This our Brethren condemne in their owne Congregation: for because the reputing the ejected man an <hi>Heathen,</hi> is a matter of practise, that concerneth the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every one of the Congregation, therefore must all the Congregation give their powers and consent; yea do more then consent (say some) even exercise jurisdiction, or a power not different from it.

                     <p>First, It is an hard way of arguing, to reason from the power to the severall exercises and diverse acts of the power. Our Brethren hold that all power of the Keys, and all power Ministeriall of preaching, administrating the Seales, is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in <hi>caetu sidelium, in a</hi> Church <hi>of Believers:</hi> but they cannot say that therefore the acts of Preaching, administrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sacraments and all acts of jurisdiction can be exercised by the Believers, because they are the first subject.</p>

So though the Nationall <hi>Churches</hi> be locally distant one from another, yet their power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising duties, and so their power of Jurisdiction, in an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and communion of men of sundry Nations is cleare to mee, <hi>Esai.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>many Nations shall flow unto the Mountaine of the Lords House, Zach.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>Ten men shall take hold out of all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of the Nations, they even shall take hold of the skirt of him</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, there is a great difference betwixt the power given <hi>ad esse simplictèr,</hi> to the being of a Church, and the power given <hi>ad benè esse tantùm,</hi> onely to the well-being. 2. Great difference also there is betwixt ordinary power to be exercised constantly, and ordinarily, because of neerer consociation of the <hi>Churches,</hi> in those things that concerne that <hi>Church</hi> in particular: suppose a presbyteriall or Congregationall <hi>Church,</hi> and a power to be exercised, but more rarely, not ordinarily, because of the lesse communion visible, and great locall distance of Churches, as it falleth out in the whole visible <hi>Church.</hi> Now from this.</p>
                     <p>First, The ordinary power of Jurisdiction because of neerest vicinity, and contiguity of members is given by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49702:159"/>
one Congregation in an Isle. 1. Because that <hi>Church</hi> is a <hi>Church</hi> properly so called, though it be not a perfit and complete <hi>Church.</hi> I say it is a <hi>Church</hi> properly so called, Because. 1. It is a little City, and a little Kingdome of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> having within it selfe power of the Word and Sacraments: and that is a <hi>Church</hi> and hath the essence of a <hi>Church</hi> to which agree the essentiall notes of a visible <hi>Church.</hi> Now preaching of the Word and Administration of the Sacraments are essentiall notes of a visible <hi>Church.</hi> But I say it is not a compleate and perfit Church in the latitude of visibility, (for <hi>Churches,</hi> are lesse or more visible, according as they have lesse or more visible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) for visible communion constituteth a visible <hi>Church.</hi> Now a Congregation in a remote <hi>Island</hi> hath a lesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion visible with other visible Churches, then conscciat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed visible Churches have. 2. It is not compleate and perfit in its operations, because in case of doubts of conscience touching government and practice, and dogmaticall poynts, it wants the joynt authority, and power of Jurisdiction need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the well-being of a <hi>Church,</hi> which it should have, if it were consociated with many other Congregations: so as wee say an hand with five fingers is a compleate hand, but it is not a compleat organicall body, but a part of the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall body of a man; so is a Congregation a <hi>Church</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of the being and essence of a <hi>Church;</hi> yet is it incompleate, because it is a part or member of a Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Church,</hi> and not being consociated wanteth that which belongeth to the well being of a compleat visible <hi>Church.</hi> For visibility of a Church must have a latitude, because it is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or adjunct of an organicall politick body, which is <hi>totum integrale.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, the ordinary power of ordinary Jurisdiction in a more perfit way, because of ordinary and perfiter consocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is given to the Presbyteriall <hi>Church,</hi> as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subject in the constant and ordinary exercise of Discipline, because contignity being the foundation of visible externall government, the Presbyteriell <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem, Ephesus Corinth, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> is a perfit compleat consocia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:49702:159"/>
or deprivation of Pastors, of excommunication in a constant and ordinary way doth belong. For this is a principle of <hi>Church-policy.</hi> Every politick body of <hi>Christ</hi> hath power of Church government within it selfe. But a Presbyteriall <hi>church</hi> is such. 2. This is a received maxime also. <hi>Quod tangit omnes. ab omnibus, suo more, tractari debet. VVhat concerneth all, should be agitated by all, according to their degrees of concernment,</hi> but excom nunication of a person, in a consociated <hi>Church,</hi> concerneth all the consociated <hi>Churches</hi> in a Presbytery; all are scandalized, all may be, and are in danger to be leavened with the infectious lumpe. And here it is to be observed, that as preaching of the Word is an essentiall note of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> and agreeing to the visible <hi>Church,</hi> as necessary <hi>ad esse simpliciter,</hi> to the very being of a visible <hi>Church.</hi> For if the word as Preached and some way promulgated be not in such a society, we cannot call it a visible <hi>Church;</hi> so Discipline is a note of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> and necessary <hi>ad bene esse,</hi> and it cannot be a Ministeriall Church in a good condition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising acts of edification, if the wall of Discipline be broken downe: and meeting in one place for Word and Sacraments is but accidentall for a Ministeriall <hi>Church.</hi> If the Word be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Sacraments administrated in sundry Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though not in a <hi>Presbyteriall Church</hi> all convened in all its members in one place, yet hath the <hi>Presbyteriall Church</hi> the essentiall note of a visible <hi>Church.</hi> Because there is a difference betwixt carrying the colours in an Army <hi>tali modo,</hi> as all the Army at once may see the colours, and the carrying of the colours. Yet the colours are a note visible of such an Army: so there is a difference betwixt preaching the Word, <hi>simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and preaching the Word, <hi>tali modo;</hi> in such a way in one materiall house onely. And therefore it is necessary that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which concerneth many Churches consociated, be in its exercise <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> larger then preaching of the Word in its exercise, <hi>hic &amp; nunc:</hi> which cannot be done, but to a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which conveneth <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Thirdly, an extraordinary, and remote power of Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is but rarely and in extraordinary cases to be put forth in acts, is given to the Catholick visible Presbytery of the whole <hi>Catholick visible Church.</hi> Because the Oommunion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and visible is lesse, where the locall distance of visible Churches is more: and therefore because oecumenicall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, being necessary for the Catholick visible <hi>Church, neque ad esse simpliciter, neque ad b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Fourthly, hence it doth not follow, that because the catholick representative visible <hi>Church</hi> is the first subject of the power of the Keys, that the power of Excommunication is derived from the visible <hi>Church</hi> to a Presbyteriall <hi>Church,</hi> or that a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall <hi>Church</hi> cannot excommunicate without consulting with, or fetching authority from the <hi>Catholick visible Church:</hi> Because the <hi>Catholick visible Church</hi> is a great integrall body of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and he is the head of this body; because though the power of seeing by order of nature be first in the whole

And therefore it followeth not that they are not compleat Bodies, and entire Churches for all ordinarie and constant Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and the reason is cleare, because Synods or Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Churches above a Presbytery to me are not ordinary; not constant Courts, but extraordinary, and <hi>prore nata</hi> occasionall, having their rise from some occurrence of providence, as is most cleare, by Scripture.

But if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of the Talent, every one is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion his paines to gaine more Talents to his Lord, and if the relation of a Pastor adde no degrees of gifts to His Talent, as wee may suppose, I thinke his onerousnesse in labouring was as great before hee was a Pastor as after: but I speake not this, to say that in a constituted Church there is no calling required other then giftes.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49702:179"/>
when these ten thousand should rise up and with the Sword devoure one another, and one society independent should wrong another, the onely remedy should be to complaine to <hi>God,</hi> and renounce civill communion with such Societies; that is, <hi>traffique not with them,</hi> (doe not take or give, borrow or lend, buy or sell with them) but it is unlawfull to use any coercive power of naturall, or civill reparation to compell them to doe duty, or execute mercy and Judgement one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another: now seeing grace destroyeth not nature, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be a policy independent which doth contradict this maxime of naturall policy, acknowledged by all, in all policies, civill, naturall, supernaturall, God intending the conservation of societies both in Church and State hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all Societies, and Multitudes to Lawes of externall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy: but so it is, a Multitude of little Congregations is a Multitude; and a Society.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49702:181"/>
hath hee a pastorall power to preach to all the World, in in an occasionall way, both by Word and Writ, yet doth not this power being but the halfe of his Ministeriall power, denominate him a Pastor to all the World, as the Apostles were; and the same way hath hee power to administrate the Sacraments, and this way may our Brethren see that power of order to be a Minister or Pastor is given by the Presbytery, so as if the man were deprived <hi>clave non errante,</hi> hee now hath lost his pastorall relation to both the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and that Congregation, whereof hee is a Pastor. So as hee is now a private man, in relation not onely to that Congregation whereof hee was a Pastor, but also in relation to the <hi>whole visible Church;</hi> now no particular Congregation hath power to denude him of this relation, that he had to the <hi>whole catholick Church.</hi> But a Pastor of a flock is a Pastor in respect of power of Jurisdiction, not over all the World, to excommunicate in every Presbytery, with the Presbytery, hee is onely capable by vertue of his power of order, to exercise power of Jurisdiction, where hee shall come, upon suposall of a call, if hee be chosen a Pastor there, or be called to be a Commissioner in the higher, or highest Courts of the <hi>Church catholick,</hi> but other wayes he hath no power of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but in that Court whereof he is a member; that is, in the Eldership of a Congregation, and in the Classicall Presbytery: for hee is so a member of a Congregation, as he is also a member of the Classical Presbytery, and therefore though he be not a Pastor one way in this Classicall Court, I meane in respect of power of order, yet is hee a Pastor, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

When one societie and Synod maketh the Lawes, and another must execute them and punish the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traveners, the single Congregation that punisheth, is more subjected by a truely prelaticall bondage, then if the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers had onely the power of punishing the contraveners, at they onely have the power of making the Lawes.

Synodicall decrees exclude not Gods word, though they bee not formally Scripture; for in some part of the Epistle the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles may well speak of themselves as distinguished from Elders and as Apostles, and yet the assembly is an ordinary Synod and not an Apostolick meeting, for if wee should argue thus, the whole Church, men and women, <hi>v.</hi> 22. sent messengers to <hi>Antioch,</hi> as the Church, and not as Apostles, our brethren would thinke it a weake consequence to inferre, <hi>Ergo,</hi> this was nothing but a Congregational, not an Apostolical meeting.

(3) yet divers of the Apostles, as <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> see not the resolution fully that they aimed at, but determine the question imperfectly, and so, as if <hi>Iames</hi> had beene absent, or if hee had seene no more in resolving the question, then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> said, which was onely <hi>that the Law of Moses was not to bee kept by either Iew or Gentile, upon the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of salvation, but that both Jewes and Gentiles are saved by the grace of Jesus Christ;</hi> if <hi>James</hi> (I say) had seene no more then this, the consciences of both sides had not beene satisfied, and the question not resolved, but the Jewes should have gone on in a totall abstinence from all ceremonies, which because of the indifference of the ceremonies, was then dangerously scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and spirituall homicide, and the Gentiles should free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have <hi>eaten blood, meates offered to idols, and things strangled,</hi> which also was scandalous in a high measure to the weake Jewes, and so the matter should have beene worse after this Synod, and the controversie hotter, the fire bolder, and the scandall more dangerous then it was before the Synod, which I cannot beleeve that the Apostles as Apostles could have done; So wee know <hi>Nathan</hi> to have spoken as a man, and not as a Prophet, when being consulted with by <hi>David</hi> anent the building of the Temple, and purposing and intending ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to resolve the question, yet resolved it amisse and quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of God; now what the penmen of holy Scripture intended to write as Scripture, that they fully wrote and no more, and what they wrote not, that they intended not to write, but leave it to others of the penmen of the holy Ghost, because the immediatly inspiring holy Ghost consulted with and intending to resolve such a canonick truth, cannot misse in his blessed intention. And also the <hi>Elders at Jerusalem</hi> were consulted with to resolve the question as well as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as is cleare <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. Now if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antiech</hi> had beene minded to referre the resolution to the Apostles as infallibles Apostle, they would never have referred it to the Elders, whom they knew could erre as well as themselves, nor would the Elders have joyned as fellow-disputers with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles as Apostles, as they expresly doe, <hi>v.</hi> 6. for that is as you would say, some countrey men of ordinary spirit destitute of

all propheticall light concurred with <hi>Esaiah</hi> to see <hi>the visions of God;</hi> And it is as if <hi>David</hi> as king counsell at God, <hi>whether the men of Keilah would deliver him up to Saul,</hi> had consulted with God and with <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and some foure or five Elders of <hi>Keilah</hi> voyd of all propheticall spirit, whether the men of <hi>Keilah should deliver him up to Saul,</hi> or no: for these <hi>Elders of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> and other brethren were as voyd of an <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick spirit</hi> as the Elders of <hi>Keilah</hi> were of a Propheticall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

was satisfactiou in part given to both siddes. The question was, whether or no are beleevers now to keepe the Law and the ceremonies of <hi>Moses his Law?</hi> It was answered by the Synod, by a distinction which favoured, in part, both sides, 1. There is no necessitie that the beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> who are saved by grace as well as the <hi>Jewes</hi> bee troubled to keepe all the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and this satisfied the <hi>Apostles</hi> who taught that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were now made one people with the Jewes, and both are freed in conscience from <hi>Moses his yoake,</hi> the other part of the distinction it was this, yet there bee some ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall commandements, as not <hi>to eate things offered to Idols, blood, and things strangled,</hi> (for <hi>fornication</hi> is of another nature, and abstinence therefrom is of perpetuall necessitie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5.) these must bee avoided, for scandals sake, by all the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but especially by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> lest the <hi>weake Jewes,</hi> who take these to be divine commandements yet in force, take offence, and this was satisfactorie to the obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and wee heare no more of their disputing, and there is an end of the controversie by the blessed labours of a lawfull Synod. 3.

and therefore I see no ground, because some representative worship was tied to Jerusalem, to give Jerusalem a <hi>Church-supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,</hi> 2. because one Congregation doth pray for another that is under pestilence and diseases, and praises God for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from these evills which also is a sort of representative worship (every Church and person partaking of a Christian priesthood to offer up prayers and praises one for another) it will not (as I conceive) prove that one Congregation hath <hi>Church-supremacie,</hi> and power of jurisdiction over another. Because 1. all <hi>Israel</hi> was alike circumcised; 2. all alike the called <hi>people of God,</hi> in covenant with God; 3. all had claime to the <hi>Altar, Sacrifices, Temple, Arke, &amp;c.</hi> 4.

An universall and oecumenick councell of all the visible Churches on earth, is an act of the visible Church which supposeth all the visible Churches on earth to bee in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perfection of soundnesse of faith, of concord and unitie, that some one Congregation or classicall presbytery of Elders according to Gods heart may bee in, which morall perfection perhaps is not <hi>de facto</hi> attainable, (though it bee not physically impossible) in this life, except wee suppose the heavenly dayes of Christs visible reigne on earth a thousand yeares, when yet there shall bee no Temple nor externall ministery, of which state I cannot now dispute, and therefore I conceive these six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred yeares there never was an integrall and perfect oecumenick councell of all the Churches on earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if wee should dispute of the juridicall power of such a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick assembly whether it may impose an oecumenick and Catholick oath on a nationall <hi>Church</hi> against their will, and excommunicate a nationall <hi>Church,</hi> is but a needlesse and a <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Hee speaketh of such a <hi>Church</hi> as taketh in all <hi>baptized into one spirit,</hi> but this is the whole visible Church, not one single Congregation onely. 3.

                  <p>To which I answer. 1.

The externall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a visible <hi>Church</hi> maketh it a visible Christian <hi>Church,</hi> but this <hi>Church</hi> professeth faith in Christ alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come in the flesh and the Sacraments of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, baptisme, and the Sacramentall breaking of bread, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 41, 42. wee desire to know how saving faith in a multitude constituteh an invisible <hi>Church,</hi> and the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and blamelesse profession of that same saving faith doth not contitute a visible <hi>Church</hi> also? and how this is not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian visible <hi>Church</hi> not differing in essence and nature from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Churches</hi> that now are, to which the essentiall note of a visible <hi>Church</hi> agreeth, to wit the preaching or profession of the sound faith: if it bee called an Apostolick and so an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Christian <hi>Church</hi> because the <hi>Apostles</hi> doth governe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:49702:225"/>
that it cannot bee a rule to us to draw the mould of our <hi>Churches</hi> according to it, for if the Apostles make it a patterne of an ordinary Christian <hi>Church</hi> in Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to say it was extraordinary in the government, except you shew that that government was different from the rule that now is in government, is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> to begge what is in question, for these same keyes both of knowledge and jurisdiction that by your grant, were given to the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. were given to the Apostles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16, 17, 18. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 21. If you say it is extraordinary, because as yet they <hi>had not Deacons, for the Apostles did as yet serve tables, where as afterward Act.</hi> 6. <hi>that was given to the Deacons by office, and so they had not Elders, nor Doctors, nor Pastors as we now ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e, but the Apostles were both Pastors, Ruling Elders, Doctors, and Deacons, and they were the onely governing Eldership, and this was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary that they had no Eldership, and so they were for that same cause no presbyteriall Church, whence it followeth that you cannot make this Church which had no presbytery, a patterne of a presbyteriall Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I answer, this will not take off the argument, if wee shall prove that after they were more then could meet in one Congregation, and so after they were so numerous that they were moe Congregations then one, they had one common government, and 1. wee say though the <hi>Apostles</hi> had power to governe all the Churches of the world, and so many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, yet if they did rule many Congregations as Elders, and not as <hi>Apostles,</hi> wee prove our point. Now we say where baptisme and the Lords Supper was, there behoved to bee some government, else the Apostles admitted promiscuously to baptisme and the Lords Supper any the most scandalous and prophane, which wee cannot thinke of the <hi>Apostles:</hi> it is true say you, <hi>they admitted not all, but according to the rule of right go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but this right government was extraordinary, in that it was not in a setled Eldership of a Congregation, which was oblieged to reside and personally to watch over that determinate flock, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flock, but it was in the hands of the Apostles, who might goe through all the world to preach the Gospell, and were not tied to any particular flock: and so from this neither can you draw your classicall</hi>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:49702:225"/>
                     <hi>Eldership, nor wee our Congregationall Eldership.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I answer, yet the question is begged, for though it bee unlawfull for a setled Eldership not to reside where their charge is, yet the question is now of a government in the hands of those who are oblieged to reside and give personall attendance to the flock, and the government in the hands of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who were not oblieged to personall attendance over this and this particular flock, which they did governe; were governments so different in nature, as the one is a patterne to us, not the other, and the one followeth rules different in nature and spirit from the other; for though it were granted that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did governe many Congregations as <hi>Apostles,</hi> not as Elders, yet there was no extraordinary reason why these many Congregations should bee called one <hi>Church,</hi> and the beleevers added to them, said <hi>to bee added to the Church,</hi> as it is said, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 47. <hi>And the Lord added to the Church daily such as should bee saved,</hi> except this <hi>Church</hi> bee one entire body gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ruled according to Christs Lawes. 2. There bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Descons chosen to this <hi>Church, Act.</hi> 6. and Deacons are officers of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Philippi</hi> which our brethren calleth <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. a Congregationall <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Pnebe</hi> was a <hi>Deaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisse</hi> (say they) <hi>of the Church of Cenchrea, Rom.</hi> 16. 1. and if they had <hi>Deacons,</hi> they could not want <hi>Elders,</hi> who are as necessary. 3. This <hi>Church</hi> could not bee so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary as that it cannot bee a patterne to us of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant government of Churches by Elders, which wee call <hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> seeing it is brought as a patterne of the <hi>Churches</hi> government by the voices of the people, which is called by Divines, in some respect, <hi>democraticall,</hi> and this place is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by our brethren, and by all Protestant Divines against <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> to prove that the people have some hand in government, to wit, in election of officers, and so the words are cleare, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>And this saying pleased the whole multitude, and they choosed Steven, &amp;c.</hi> so this multitude did not make one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall <hi>Church,</hi> but it was a company of the <hi>multiplied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, both of Grecians and Hebrews,</hi> as is clearely related to these spoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6.

Why should the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment bee extraordinary, because the <hi>Apostles</hi> did governe it, in respect they were extraordinary officers, and should not the government bee by the Apostles; and exercised by them as a common ordinary presbytery, seeing this <hi>Church</hi> in its goods, was governed by seven ordinary and constant <hi>Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:49702:227"/>
to bee a politick act of divers <hi>Churches, Hebrewes</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> choosing their owne ordinary officers in relation to which they made one governed <hi>Church,</hi> under one common government, which is not congregationall; because not of one Congregation, but of moe Congregations conveened in their principall members (for they could not all meet in one, as wee have proved) <hi>Ergo,</hi> it must bee presbyteriall. And that this government is one to mee is evident, because these seven Deacons were officers in ordinary to them all. 3. Wee see not how wee need to prove that the severall Congregations were severall formed, fixed and organicall bodies; 1. Because it shall bee hard to our brethren to prove a <hi>Parishionall Church</hi> in its locall circuit in the Apostolick <hi>Church,</hi> and when <hi>Churches</hi> were moulded and framed first in locall circuits of parishes, I will not undertake to determine. 2. Ten Congregations in a great Citie, though not moulded locally and formally in ten little distinct Churches organicall, yet if sixteene or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Elders in common feede them all, with Word, Seales and common government, they differ not in nature from ten for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and fixed Congregations, and the government is as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Aristocraticall,</hi> and <hi>presbyteriall,</hi> as if every one of them had their owne fixed Eldership out of these sixteene Elders, for fixing of this or this Elder to this or this Congregation is but accidentall to the nature of an organicall <hi>Church;</hi> if ten little Cities have ten magistrates who ruleth them all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, they are ten perfect politicall incorporations and socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, no lesse then if to every one of these ten were a fixed magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, to this or this citie; Because the <hi>King</hi> and State might accuse them all for any misgovernment or act of unjustice done by the whole ten conveened in one judicature to judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; for what unjustice is done by the major part is to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the whole colledge, in so farre as the whole colledge hath hand in it. 2. The formall acts of a politicall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation not fixed are one and the same in nature and essence with the formall Church-acts of a fixed Congregation; For 1. the Word and Sacraments are one and the same: 2. their acts of government, in rebuking, accusing, and joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to deliver to <hi>Satan</hi> an incestuous man are one and the

The Eldership of <hi>Ephesus</hi> I dare not call the Eldership of one Congregation, farre lesse of one fixed Congregation, and they are all commanded to feed the flocke over which the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> had set them, and no other
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:49702:228"/>
                     <hi>Church</hi> that is most true. But how doe our brethren inferre a fixed Congregation at <hi>Ephesus</hi> from thence? farre lesse I think can they in ferre that the formall <hi>Church-acts</hi> of a fixed, and a not fixed Congregation are different in nature; and therefore, if we can show that in the Apostolick <hi>Churches</hi> they had many Congregations though not fixed, under one common Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which did feed them in common with Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Discipline, as is clearely proved, then have wee a patterne of a <hi>Presbyteriall Church.</hi> 3. The Elders of Ephesus and these Elders, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. had all of them a burden of the soules <hi>amongst them, and over which the holy Ghost had set them,</hi> and they had not a burden and charge in particular of others as watching in particular for the soules of others: but how fixed Congregations are hence inferred I see not, for I may have with other six Pastors, a Pastorall burden and charge to watch for three Congregations, according to my talent and strength, though I bee not a fixed pastor to all the three collectively, or to any fixed one distributively, so as all the omissions of my six fellow-labourors shall bee laid to my charge, in the Court of the Judge and Lord of all, if I do what I am able: which I demonstrate thus. 1. That morall obligation of conscience which did obliege the Apostles as Pastors of the Christian world which was to bee converted, is not temporary but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and morall and did obliege the Apostles as Christians. Therefore this morall, obligation did lie upon the Apostles <hi>to feed the Catholick fiocke of the whole Christian world over which the holy Ghost had set them,</hi> just as the Elders of <hi>Ephesus, Act.</hi> 20. 28. are commanded to feed the <hi>whole flock of God</hi> which is at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> now I aske if every single Apostle is to make a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>God</hi> for the soules of all the Christian world? 2. If <hi>Peter</hi> must bee answerable to God, because <hi>Paul</hi> by negligence should incurre the woe of not preaching the Gospell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16? (3.) If upon this morall ground of an obligation lying on the Apostles to feed the Catholick flock of the whole world, amongst which they were, for the most part, by speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>preach to all nations, Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>to every creature, Mark.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 15. If (I say) the Apostles bee tied to <hi>plant Churches</hi> in such determinate quarters and fixed king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:49702:228"/>
of the habitable world, and if the dividing of the world into twelve severall parts, and large parishes to the twelve <hi>Apostles,</hi> bee <hi>juris divini,</hi> of divine institution? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this can hardly bee proved by Gods Word. 2. Where there bee six Elders in a Congregation supposed to bee inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, every one of the six are oblieged in their place to feed the whole flocke, over which the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> hath set them, and that by the commandement of <hi>God, Act.</hi> 20. 28. 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. as our brethren teach, but I hope by these places no humane logick would inferre, nor could our brethrèn collect, that, 1. every one of these six should, by divine institution, bee set over each of them the sixt determinate and sixt part of that Congregation. 2. That every one of the sixt were not to give a reckoning for the whole Congregation, and did not watch for the whole Congregation according to his Talent. 3. That one might not be accused, even one <hi>Archippus</hi> possibly at <hi>Colosse, Col.</hi> 4. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for his owne particular neglect to the whole flock, though others were also joyned with <hi>Archippus</hi> who fulfilled their part of their ministery, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5. yea &amp; we justly aske if all the Elders of <hi>Thyatira</hi> were guiltie of remisse discipline against the <hi>false Prophetesse Jezabell,</hi> and if all the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Sardis</hi> did become sleepie, and secure, and <hi>had a name that they were living, and yet were dead,</hi> though the Eldership under the name of the <hi>Angel of the Church,</hi> bee indefinitely rebuked, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>c.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. 4. yea it is like to mee that seeing the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the one for <hi>love, service, faith, patience, Revel.</hi> 2. 19. and the other, that <hi>c.</hi> 3. 4 <hi>they had a few names that had not defiled their garments,</hi> that onely those who were guiltie, were rebuked, I beleeve, and therefore this is to bee proved that <hi>Elders are not rebuked, but for their remisse watching over an unfixed Congregation,</hi> the places to me, doe not prove it.</p>

There is no ground to say that Apostles after this disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion erected an ordinary Eldership in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was an extraordinary, because the Apostles was present with them, and you read of no Elders while after the dispersion, because 1. you read not of the institution of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Elders in the Church of Jerusalem after the dispersion, more then before, and so you are here upon conjectures. 2.

If they did here act as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, any one Apostle might have ordained the Deacons in an ordinary way, as here; but that wee cannot conceive, for then one and the same action should have beene ordinary, and not ordinary, for one man cannot bee a Church or a societie to doe the ordinary Acts of an ordinary societie, for it should bee extraordinary to one to act that which is the formall Act of many as many, and should involve a contradiction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were an Act which cannot bee performed by many, as when one <hi>Paster</hi> speaketh for many, for a whole Church; but that is ordinary and necessary, because a multitude as a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude cannot speake, without confusion in a continuated dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, for that all the people say one word <hi>(Amen)</hi> is not a multitude as a multitude using one continuated speech.</p>

That the <hi>Church</hi> be so in the <hi>Island</hi> its alone, may possibly be extraordinary, but that in such a case they have the Word preached and entire power of Discipline whole and entire within themselves to excommunicate scandalous persons is not extraordinay, when there be no consociated <hi>Churches,</hi> whom excommunication concerneth, that are in danger to be scandalized, for it floweth connaturally from a <hi>Church</hi> to which agreeth the essence of a <hi>Church,</hi> to exercise Jurisdiction over all its owne members, if there be no more consociated with that <hi>Church,</hi> that is by accident and an extraordinary exigence of <hi>Gods</hi> providence. As a master of a Family is to do his duty to educate his children in the feare of <hi>God;</hi> but if <hi>God</hi> take all his children from him by death, he doth not transgresse the ordinary rule of educating his children in the feare of <hi>God,</hi> when hee hath none. This argument supposeth that a Congregation hath no power of excommunication at all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compleat or incompleat, as the Mid-wife hath no power to Baptize at all either compleat or incompleat: neither doth a Congregation transgresse any rule of Christ at all when it exerciseth entire power of censures within it selfe, whereas there be no consociated Churches to share with it in that power. A Congregation is capable of entire Jurisdiction, because it is a <hi>Church;</hi> But a woman in no case is capable of administrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baptisme, or the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> except shee were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily

Yea Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> will have the whole convening as one independent congregation Act. 6. 2, 3, 4. and the many myriades or thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of beleeving <hi>Jewes,</hi> Act. 21. 21, 22, 23. to meet as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Certainly the Apostles practice must be our rule, and then five hundred or a thousand being so farre beneath ten or eight thousand, may wel seem a number for fewnesse not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent; and what shall we then thinke of seven onely, or ten? Now let it be considered, if <hi>Rome</hi> being granted to be one <hi>Church,</hi> and in which to me there was a congregation and <hi>Church</hi> in the very family of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> Rom. 16. v. 5. and whose faith was spread through all the world, Rom. 1. 8. so as famous writers say the halfe of the City beleeved, if they be but one single congregation meeting all in one place? ard to me it is cleare, there was a single congregation in the very house of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> Act. 18. 1, 2, 3 4. v. 26 27, 28. and that <hi>Paul</hi> preached when he was there daily, beside his dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Synagogue; when he was at <hi>Rome</hi> there was a <hi>Church</hi>

                     <p>That is, (if I conceive it right) The people voyd of all Officers have a vertuall power to conferre a Ministery on their Officers though they have not this power in themselves. I could in some sense yield that Believers not Angells, are capable of the Ministeriall power to exercise it formally, but that Believers doe, or can, by any way of causative influence, make <hi>Church-</hi>Officers, I see not: they may design a man qualified to bean Officer to the Office, and that is all.

                     <p n="1">1. Both <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> were so bent to backsliding, that wee read not that ever the people made any reall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Religion, <hi>Josiah, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Asa</hi> did it for them. But what an argument is this: <hi>Iudah did never, for the most of the Land, seeke the Lord God of their Fathers with all their heart;</hi> Ergo, <hi>the seeking of the Lord God with all the heart is an unwritten tradition?</hi>
                     </p>

No, I thinke if they remove the <hi>high places</hi> by the Hands of their Subjects, or command their Subjects to remove them, they doe full well. But I see not this consequence. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Princes onely are obliged to remove the high places, it followeth not.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If it be the Princes part to command his Subjects this duty of Reformation and removall of the <hi>high places,</hi> then they may performe their duty without the Prince.</p>

<pb n="485" facs="tcp:49702:252"/>
that a King warrant the lawfull Vow of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, then the Lawfull Vow of one Man, seeing it is a lawfull profession of CHRIST before Men commanded in the third Commandement. And to the observance of that <hi>Law of God,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> and Conscience <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> doe oblige us, there is no addition of a Kingly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by necessity of a Divine Law required to make it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, no more then if all the Kingdome at such a solemne day of humiliation, should all in every severall <hi>Church</hi> sweare to Reformation of life.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> positively did reforme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the <hi>Church</hi> without and contrary to the mind of civill authority, nor is it enough to say <hi>the Apostles were Apostles, but wee are not Apostles, for</hi> upon this morall ground, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 29. <hi>Wee ought rather to obey GOD than man,)</hi> they reformed contrary to the Magistrates mind.

I desire the Malignant Divines to receive these

answers for Justifying the zeale of both Kingdomes in their Reformation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

If they meane the latter, they bee very like the Pharisees, who when they durst not question the Doctrine and Miracles of <hi>Christ,</hi> they onely questioned the manner of doing. <hi>And sayd by what authority doest thou these?</hi> But because they are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the <hi>Papists side,</hi> and fight under their banner; It is most evident it galleth their stomacks, that Popery, Atmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisine, and Socinianisme are cryed downe; else the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing a good worke, and such a necessary worke as Reformation, would not have offended them so highly, as to move them to kill the people of <hi>GOD;</hi> an error in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of a good worke is very veniall to <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Let them give to us, since they argue from a practice, a warrant of any such practice, where a whole Land went on in a <hi>Negative Reformation</hi> without the Prince <hi>Ergo,</hi> Negative precepts, by this logick, shall lay no divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on us, except it bee the Kings will to forbid that which <hi>GOD</hi> forbiddeth, then suppose Episcopacy and the Ceremonies were the <hi>Idoll</hi> of the <hi>Masse</hi> establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a standing Law, it should bee unlawfull for the Kingdomes to forbeare and abstaine from Idolatry, except the Kings Law forbid Idolatry. What were this else but to say, we are obliged to obey <hi>Christs</hi> will, but not except with a Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Kings</hi> will?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This is an argument Negative, from one particular in Scripture, and therefore not concludent. For it is

                           </gap>den in this Commandement,</hi> Ergo, <hi>neither Purgatorie, nor Idolatry is forbidden in Gods Word.</hi> So let the adversaries give me a practise in the <hi>Word of God,</hi> where a Brother kept this order of <hi>Christs three Steps, Mat.</hi> 18.</p>
                     <p>First, to reprove an offender alone.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, before two or three witnesses.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in case of obstinacy, <hi>to tell the Church;</hi> and to these adde, that the man was by the <hi>Church</hi> to be reputed <hi>as an heathen and a Publican.</hi> And I hope, because such a practise we doe not read, yet it followeth not that it is unlawfull. So where read you a Man <hi>forgiving his Brother seventy seven times:</hi> Ergo, it is unlawfull to <hi>forgive him seventy and seven times?</hi> Where read you that <hi>Christ and His Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in the New Testament raised Warre and Armies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to defend or offend, but I hope Anabaptists have not hence ground to inferre, <hi>then must all Warres be unlawfull to Christians,</hi> for wee can produce warrantable precepts, where we want practise.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>where it is said, Kings onely are rebuked for not removing high places, and Kings onely are commended, because they are removed, therefore none should reforme but Kings.</hi> This followeth no wayes, but onely <hi>Kings by Royall authority should reforme;</hi> but it followeth not; Ergo, <hi>the people without the King are not obliged to reforme themselves in their manner,</hi> for I am sure, that the people should all universally resolve and agree, never to <hi>sacrifice in the high places</hi> and accordingly to practise: And to sacrifice <hi>onely in the place which the Lord had chosen to place His Name there, at GODS expresse Law commanded,</hi> Deuteronomy 13. 23. Deuteronomy 12. 14. 18. Deuteronomy 16. 2. 7. 11. 15. Deut. 31. 11. had beene a removall of <hi>the high places</hi> and a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:49702:254"/>
Reformation, though the King should have, by a standing Law, commanded <hi>that they should sacrifice in the high places,</hi> for the people are rebuked, because 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 11. <hi>They burnt Incense in all the high places,</hi> 2 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 33. 17. <hi>Hosea</hi> 4. 13. and, a <hi>Chronicles</hi> 20. 33. the reason why the <hi>high places were not taken away, is: For as yet the people had not prepared their Hearts unto the GOD of their Fathers.</hi> If then not Sacrificing <hi>in the high places</hi> was the peoples duty, they were to remove <hi>the high places,</hi> in their place; and so farre to reforme without the KING, yea suppose the KING command the contrary, the people ought <hi>to obey GOD,</hi> and the Parliament may by <hi>GODS Law</hi> abolish <hi>Episcopacy, popish Ceremonics,</hi> and the popish Service though the KING consent not, upon this ground that those <hi>he the high places of</hi> England, for the which the Wrath of the <hi>Lord</hi> is kindled against the Land.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the adversaries may read, 2 <hi>Chronicles</hi> 15. 9. That the <hi>Strangers out of Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themselves together to <hi>Asa</hi> without the consent of their KING, and <hi>did enter in a Covenant to seek the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixtly, the Pastors of the Land are obliged to preach all necessary truth, without the KING, and accordingly are to practise what they preach; now Reformation is a most necessary truth, they are then to reforme themselves and Religion without the KING: for the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> not <hi>the</hi> KINGS <hi>will</hi> is the Pastors rule in preaching, and hee is to <hi>separate the pretious from the vile, that hee may be as Gods Mouth,</hi> Jeremy 15. 19. and Ezekiel 2. 7. <hi>Thou shalt speake my words unto them,</hi> that was the Doctrine of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, not the KINGS words, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>But, thou sonne of man, heare what I say to thee;</hi> yea Pastors are to preach against Kings and their sinnes, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 1. 2. 3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. 10, 11, 12.</p>

To the first I say; There is not a place in all the <hi>Word of God</hi> where the people conferre ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Pastors of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> Therefore our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren flee to the <hi>Old Testament</hi> to prove it from the <hi>Levites</hi> who received imposition of hands from the <hi>children of Israel;</hi> but our brethren hold, that the calling of the <hi>Levites</hi> and of the Pastors of the <hi>New Testament</hi> are different, as the Officers and <hi>Churches</hi> of the Jewish and Christian <hi>Church</hi> are different. 2. Our brethren grant <hi>pag.</hi> 49. That it wanteth all example in the <hi>New Testament</hi> that the people <hi>lay on hands.</hi> 3. These who layd on hands on the <hi>Levite,</hi> Num. 8. were Elders and (our brethren say,) It is like they were, but. 1. <hi>They did it not as Elders.</hi> 2. <hi>But as representing the people, not as Elders civill, for that belonged to</hi> Aaron <hi>and his sonnes,</hi> Levit. 8. <hi>else it will follow that where the</hi> Church <note place="margin">Page 46.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> These who layd on hands, did it as a worke pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Elders, because the Elders were a part of <hi>the first borne,</hi> who by Office were Elders, and in whose stead the <hi>Levites</hi> were assumed, <hi>Num.</hi> 3. 40. 41. else the <hi>Church of Israel</hi> being a constituted <hi>Church</hi> before this time, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officers, which is against all truth. 2. We grant the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi> layd not on hands, but they who layd on hands did it as Ecclesiasticall Elders. And the reasons against this conclude not. 1. The first reason concludeth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these who layd on hands were the first borne, who by Office were <hi>Church men.</hi> 2. The other two reasons prove nothing, for because these who layd on hands, did lay on hands as representing the whole Congregation, alas it doth no wayes conclude that they layd not on <hi>hands as it is a works peculiar to them as Elders, for the Priest</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered sacrifice first for his owne sinnes, and then for the peoples, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. and so did represent the people. But, I hope, it followeth not that therefore the Priest did not sacrifice as a Priest, and by vertue of a peculiar Office, but onely as a principall member of the Congregation. 3. What if there be no Elders in a single Congregation, as our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren suppose there were no Elders in Office <hi>in Israel to lay hands on the Levites?</hi> it will not follow therefore, the people are to lay on hands, except there were no Elders in all the Land or <hi>Nationall Church</hi> to lay on hands. And though I thinke imposition of hands not so essentiall perhaps as a Minister can be no Minister without it, yet I thinke not so of Ordination (for these to mee are as different as the authoritative calling of a Minster, and a rite annexed to that calling) because none can be a Minister in a constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     <p>I answer, it is true: but so many Pastors send a Pastor to bee a Pastor to a Congregation, though that Congregation never chuse him, as possibly they bee for the most part Popish, or unwilling, yet both Cases are extraordinary and the Church not constituted and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</p>

And my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is; because the peoples naming of such a man to bee their pastor doth stand with his never being their pastor; hee being unwilling to be their pastor, and the presbytery thinking it unfit hee be the pastor of such a people. 2.

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Election of the people goeth before ordination in the relation of <hi>Luke,</hi> true; <hi>Ergo,</hi> election is <hi>prior</hi> by order of nature, it followeth not. But <hi>Acts</hi> 1. Ordination of <hi>Matthias</hi> (God casting the lot upon him, <hi>vers.</hi> 25.) is <hi>prior</hi> to the peoples electing of him, for the peoples appoynting of two, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. cannot be their election; for they were to elect one, but I submit to the learneder my thoughts in this. As also my tearming <hi>Paphnutius</hi> neither Bishop nor Elder at the <hi>Councell of Nice,</hi> which I did not as denying him to bee a Bishop, but because hee was called to that Councell of Nice where as before hee had beene deprived, but was restored by <hi>Constantine,</hi> though in the estimation of these who contended for the single life of Priests, whose corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Paphnutius</hi> opposed, hee was in an Ecclesiasticall sense neither Bishop nor Presbyter but deprived from both. But let the righteous rebuke mee, and it shall be as Oyle to my Head. 3. It cannot bee that election of the people is the whole calling of a man to the Ministerie, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation onely a supplement and an consummatory rite, or a benedictory signe which may bee spared. 1. Because by the imposition of the bands of the Presbytery, <hi>Timothy</hi> was made a Minister, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preach to the <hi>Gentiles, Acts</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons ordained, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. and this is enjoyned with the right manner of acting it to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 5. 22. 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 2. 2. as a Ministeriall act. 2. A Ministeriall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing standeth in an authoritative sending, <hi>Romans</hi> 10. 15. and I see not well how the people themselves doe send a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to themselves.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Mather sayth, that because they are all taught of God,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>We hold all who professe faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> to be members of the visible <hi>Church,</hi> though they bee not members of a visible Congregation, and that the seales of the Covenant should not be denyed to them. And for more full clearing of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let these considerations be observed.</p>
                  <p>First, Dist. <hi>All beleevers, as beleevers,</hi> in foro Dei, <hi>before God have right to the seales of the Covenant, these to whom the Covenant and body of the Charter belongeth, to these the seale belongeth, but</hi> in foro Ecclesiastico, <hi>and in an orderly Church-way, the seales are not to be conferred by the Church upon persons because they beleeve, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they professe their beleeving: therefore the Apostles never baptized Pagans, but upon profession of their faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Second Dist. <hi>Faith in Christ truely giveth right to the seales of the Covenant, and in Gods intention and decree, called</hi> voluntas bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placiti, <hi>they belong onely to the invisible Church, but the orderly way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>f the Churches giving the seales, is, because such a society is a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or visible Church, and orderly giving of the seales according to Gods approving will, called,</hi> voluntas signi &amp; revelata, <hi>belongeth to the visible Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Third Dist. <hi>The Church may orderly and lawfully give the seales of the Covenant to those to whom the Covenant and promises of grace</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:49702:260"/>
                     <hi>doth not belong in Gods decree of election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourth Dist. <hi>The Church may lawfully adde to the Church visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, such as God addeth not to the Church invisible, as they may adde</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>and the Church may lawfully cast out of the visible Church, such as Christ hath not cast out of the invisible Church, as the Church may excommunicate regenerate persons for scandalous sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fift Dist. <hi>Then the regenerate excommunicated have right to the seales of the Covenant, as they have to the Covenant, and yet the Church doth lawfully debarre them,</hi> hic &amp; nunc, <hi>in such a scandalous case, from the seales of the Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee hold that those who are not members of a particular Congregation, may lawfully be admitted to the seales of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>First, Because those to whom the promises are made, and professe the Covenant, these should be baptized. But men of approved piety are such, though they be not members of a particular Parish. The proposition is <hi>Peters</hi> argument, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Those who are not Members of a particular Church may be visible professors, and so members of a visible <hi>Church, Ergo,</hi> the seales of the Covenant belongeth to them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The contrary opinion hath no warrant in Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Apostles</hi> required no more of those whom they baptized, but profession of beleefe, as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47. <hi>Can any forbid water that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost,</hi> as well as we? <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. <hi>If thou beleevest with all thy heart, thou mayest he baptized:</hi> no more is sought of the Jaylor, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31. 34.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Authour saith: To admit to the Seales of the Covenant, is</hi>

                        <hi>not an act of Christian liberty, that every Christian may dispense to whom he pleaseth, but an act of Church power given to the Ministers, to dispense to those over whom the Holy Ghost hath made them overseers; but we have no Ministeriall power over those of another Congregation, and who are not members of a particular Congregation.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> First, To dispense the Seales to whom we please, as if mens pleasure were a rule, were licentiousnesse, not <hi>Christian</hi> Liberty. There may be a communion of benefits, where there is no communion of punishment: <hi>Beneficia sunt amplianda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is false that Pastors have no Ministeriall power
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49702:260"/>
over those who are not of their Congregation; for if so, all communion of Churches should fall, for Letters of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from other Churches, whereof they are Members, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make Pastors of New England to have a Ministeriall power over those of another Congregation, as set over them, by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as they are set over their owne Parish, to whom they be onely Pastors, having Ministeriall power, by a <hi>Church</hi> Covenant, and the peoples Ordination, as our Brethren teach.</p>

Now if we should censure any such for drunkennesse, or other scandals,</hi> who are not of our Congregation, <hi>it should be</hi> a non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bente potestatem, <hi>an act done by those who have no power.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> proposition by your owne Doctrine, is clearely false, for you say your <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>First, to you <hi>they are without,</hi> how then <hi>can you judge them?</hi> as you say.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You have by the holy Ghost no ministeriall power over them, as over your owne flocke, as you <hi>expone, Act.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You looke aside at excommunication, for those of other Churches consociated in a classe, we doe lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate and censure; for excommunication is not a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of a person from one single Parishionall <hi>Church</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as you imagine, but a cutting off of a person from all the <hi>visible Churches consociated:</hi> first, because he is delivered to <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>his sin is bound in heaven,</hi> in relation to all the faster Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and is so to be esteemed, and not in reference to the one single Congregation, whereof he is a member. Secondly, all are to be humbled and mourne for his fall, and to consent he be cut off, and not one single Congregation onely. Thirdly, all consociated Churches shall be leavened, by keeping Church-fellowship with such a lumpe. Fourthly, all are to repute him as a Heathen, and a Publican. Fifthly, all are to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him as a Brother,</hi> 2 <hi>Thessalon.</hi> 3. 15. Sixthly, all are to forgive him, and receive him in Church-communion, if he

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Seales of the Covenant are principally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the invisible Church, as the Covenant it selfe in Gods decree of election is especially made with the elect, and such as shall never fall away, as is cleare, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 37. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>Esay</hi> 54 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. 10. and the invisible Church as such, as a number of beleevers have onely right before God to both Covenant and seales, yea and consequently are onely Christs body and Spouse, and redeemed Saints, and so onely have all the power of the keyes, and the ministeriall power of dispensing the Seales, and by our brethrens doctrine, the visible Church not as visible, but as the true body, Spouse, and Bride of Christ, &amp; so as the invisible company of the redeemed ones have the Seales, and Covenant, and so all Ministeriall power of Christ is given unto them. 2. It is true the orderly and Ecclesiasticke way of dispensing the Seales, is that they bee dispensed onely to the visible Church, but this visible <hi>Church</hi> is not one parish, but all professing the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> though they be not joyned in one visible parish by one <hi>Church oath,</hi> as the Author meaneth: for the Saints in Scripture, as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> did professe and visibly evidence their faith, and so that they were capable of the Seales by desiring to be saved, and saying, What shall we doe to be saved, by <hi>trembling at the Word of God,</hi> by asking the meaning of the Word of God, which expressions are in many not in-churched to particular Congregations, not did the Apostles aske if they were members of one parish before they baptized them, but if they beleeved in Christ. 3.

                     <hi>Job,</hi> his friends, <hi>Melchisedeck, Lot,</hi> and others the like were circumcised, we need not dispute, but that they were not circumcised, because they were not in a <hi>visible Church</hi> estate with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is a question and uncertaine, and therefore not sure to be a foundation of new opinions <hi>in Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but though it were granted, it followeth not, because none were circumeised but <hi>Abrahams seed,</hi> and all, and onely <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed were circumcised, therefore none are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed but those who are members of one particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Alas this is a weak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The proportion betwixt Israel and a parishionall Church is questioned, the Author beggeth what is in question, for it is evident that in Gods Word there is a visible Church of many Congregations, associated in many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible acts of government. 3.

I affirme that the Constitution in matter and forme was one with the Christian visible Church. 1.

That God required not morall preparation in them for ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Passeover, as he doth in us, before wee eate the Lords Supper, I conceive to bee an untruth. 1.

                     <p>Other arguments that I find in Papers from New England are these: First, <hi>There is not a Church</hi> (say they) <hi>under the New Testament, but a Congregationall Church, so it will follow, that as City priviledges belong onely to the Citizens and their children, so bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Lords Supper, being Church priviledges, belong onely to the Members of particular Churches, and their seed; and that seeing</hi> sigillum sequitur donum, <hi>to apply them to any other, is to abuse them. As the scale of an Incorporation is abused, when it is added to confirme a gift to one who is not a Free man of that Incorporation, he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable thereof.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> First, The case is not here, as in earthly Cities, a man who is a free Citizen in one burrough is not for that a free Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of all the Burroughes and Cities on earth; nor is he who is civilly excommunicated and cast out of his <hi>City priviledges</hi> in one City, cast out of his City priviledges in all other Cities, whereof he is a free member: and the reason is, there is not one common owner, and Lord of all the Cities on earth, who can give, or take away, in a Law-way, <hi>City priviledges;</hi> but the case is farre otherwayes in the priviledges of visible Churches, for he who is a member of one visible Congregation, is by his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and sincere profession, and his professed standing in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, a Member of all visible Congregations on
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49702:265"/>
earth, as he is baptized in all Congregations on earth; and if he be excommunicated out of a single Congregation, he is excommunicated out of all, and loseth right to the Scale of the Lords Supper, in all visible Congregations, as his sinnes are bound in heaven to all also, for that one common head and Saviour, who giveth him right to the Seales of Christs body and blood in one, giveth him right to these Seales in all. For we worthily communicate with Christ in his body and blood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But this forme of reasoning utterly abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Communion of Churches, nor can a member of one Noble <hi>Church</hi> be capable of the Seales of grace in another visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Church,</hi> because he is not a Member of that visible <hi>Church,</hi> no more then one is capable of the Priviledges of <hi>Paris,</hi> who is onely a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> and not a Citizen of <hi>Paris.</hi> If it be said, one who is a member of a visible Church, may receive the Seales in another Congregation, if he be recommended by Letters, as a sound Professor, to that other Congregation.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49702:266"/>
and to speake accurately, a visible profession of faith doth not give a man right to the seales of grace, but onely it doth noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and d clare to the Church, that the man hath right to the seales because he beleeveth, and that the Church may lawfully give to him the seales, and that profession is a condition requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the right receivers of the seales in an Ecclesiasticall way; but faith giveth the right to these seales, and because the faith of the beleever goeth with the beleever, when he goeth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther visible congregation then his owne, that faith giveth him right to the seales in all places, and in all Congregations: for faith giveth right to receive Christ Sacramentally, not in one Congregation onely, but in all, and a visible profession doth, as a condition notifie this faith, and Church-right in all Congregations. <hi>Ergo, the man hath right in all Congregations, as he hath right in a parishionall Church.</hi> But our Brethren reply, <hi>Peter might baptize Cornelius, though he was no member of a visible Congregation, because the Apostles being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. Peter</hi> his argument to Baptize is not from a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason, that endureth for a while, but from a morall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of perpetuall equitie and necessitie, till Christs second comming. <hi>He that beleeveth and hath received the holy Ghost</hi> is to be baptized. But many out of Church-state, and who are not members of a particular Congregation, have received the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and doe beleeve, being Christians of approved pietie; we are to adde no restrictions, or exceptions where God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth none. <hi>Non est distinguendum, ubi lex non distinguit.</hi> They that beleeve should receive the seales, but not except they be in-Churched and members of a particular Congregation. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is Gods Word, but the restriction or exception is not Gods Word. 2. The Apostles, though they were universall Pastors of the world, yet teach us by word and practise, who are to be admitted to the seales, even to the supper, those <hi>who do try and examine themselves,</hi> and that to the end of the world.</p>

                  <p>This opinion of our Prethren, is against the care of <hi>Christ,</hi> who hath left no <hi>Pastorall</hi> care on earth by this way, now since the <hi>Apostles</hi> dyed, to spread the Gospell to those Nations who have not heard of the name of Christ; but a Pastorall care for the Churches, is not proper to Apostles onely, but onely such a Pastorall care by speciall direction from Christ immediately

not to <hi>Bithynia;</hi> now because this particular direction for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is wanting in the Church, it is certaine that a man is yet a Pastor in office in relation to as many as Gods hand of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence shall send him unto, though he be chosen by a people to feed ordinarily one determinate flocke, and though he be not an extraordinary and immediatly inspired planter of <hi>Churches,</hi> or the first planter, as were the Apostles, yet is he a Pastor in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to all. And if this be not said, 1. It were simply unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Pastors now to plant <hi>Churches,</hi> and spread the Gospell to those nations, who have not heard it, because all Pastors now are ordinary, and none are immediatly inspired Apostles: but it is certaine what the Apostles did, by an extraordinary gift, as such immediatly called pastors, it is unlawfull for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Pastors to attempt to doe, as to attempt to speake with tongues, and to plant Churches by speaking with tongues and confirming it with miracles, is unlawfull. Papists, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, Suarez, Acosta,</hi> ascribe this to the Pope and his Apostles. Our Divines answer that the Apostles that way have no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors; But what the Apostles did by an ordinary pastorall gift, as to preach the word, administrate the Sacraments, to erect and plant Churches by ordinary gifts, where the Pastors can speake to the <hi>Churches</hi> by an ordinary gift in their owne language, they are oblieged both within and without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to preach as Pastors, because where God giveth gifts pastorall to pastors, he commandeth them to exercise these gifts, else <hi>they digge their Lords talent in the earth:</hi> but God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to Pastors pastorall gifts to preach to others then their owne Congregation, and to administrate the seales to them also, and to plant Churches. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is presumed that the Church doth give authoritie and an externall ministeriall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the exercise of these gifts. 2. It is an unwarrantable point of Divinitie that the <hi>Apostles</hi> and the <hi>Pastors</hi> succeeding to them doe differ essentially in this, that Apostles might preach as Pastors to more Congregations then one, and might plant Churches, but pastors succeeding to them may not as Pastors preach to more Congregations then their owne, and may not plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>
                     <p>Nor is that comparison to be regarded much; <hi>A Magistrate or an Alderman of a Citie may not lawfully exercise his office of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie in another Citie whereof he is not a Maior, and therefore a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor cannot preach, ex officio, as a Pastor in another Congregation, whereof he is not a Pastor, nor can he exercise discipline in another Congregation then his owne, seeing another Congregation hath not by voluntary agreement, oath or paction submitted themselves to his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, nor chosen him for their Pastor.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>For I answer, the comparison halteth and doth not prove the point, for by one and the same act the citie hath chosen such a man both for to be a Magistrate, and to be their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and have given him thereby authority over themselves onely, so he cannot exercise the office of a Magistrate over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citie who hath not chosen him to be their Maior or ruler. But the flocke doth not both call such a man, in one and the same act to be a pastor, and to be their pastor, but hee is made by the laying on of the hands of the Elders, a Pastor, and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor in relation to all to whom God in his providence shall send him to speake, the Congregation by election doth give him no authority pastorall, but onely appropriate his pastorall authoritie to themselves in particular; and when they refuse him againe and cast him off, they take not pastorall authoritie from him, for they cannot take away that which they cannot give; he remaineth a Pastor though they cast him off, as a Colledge of Physitians do promote a man to be a Doctor of Physicke to cure diseases, a towne calleth him to be their Physitian, he may yet exercise acts of his calling, and <hi>ex officio,</hi> as a Doctor, upon other cities and inhabitants of the countrey; and when the city who choosed him for their physitian doth cast him off, they take not from him the office of doctorship which the Colledge of Physitians conferred upon him, for they cannot take from him that which they cannot give to him. Yea if any of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flocke shall come and heare the word, the Pastor offereth all in one pastorall sacrifice to God in prayer, though there be many of another Congregation in the Church hearing; yea strangers beleevers communicate with him at the same Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet is he not their Pastor. If a Pastor of a Congregation
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49702:273"/>
die or be sicke, shall the children of beleevers, yea shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Pagans being desirous to be baptized be defrauded of the comfort of Baptisme, and of the Lords Supper, for no fault in them, but onely because their Pastor is dead, may not the Congregation by their desires and requests appropriate the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Pastors of another Congregation in some particular acts to their necessitie? yea is not their receiving of his ministry in that act (when their Pastor is dead) a calling warranting him to officiate, <hi>hie &amp; nunc?</hi> even as the desires and choise of his owne flocke electing him to be their constant Pastor, gave him a calling to be their Pastor constantly, and in all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary acts of his calling? yea and it is sure as the holy Ghost set him over his owne floeke in ordinary, because they choosed him to be their Pastor, so that same holy Ghost set him over this other Congregation, in this act, to preach and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the sacraments to them, in this exigence of the death of their Pastor; for God who ruleth officers and disposeth of them in his house, disposeth of particular Acts of his owne officers, and he is sent as a pastor from God to speake to the stanger <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and to worke his heart to the love of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that as a Pastor no lesse then to his owne flocke, except we destroy communion of gifts, and of Pastorall gifts, <hi>Paul</hi> by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> was made the <hi>Apostle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles, Peter</hi> of the Jewes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 8. yet <hi>Peter</hi> as an <hi>Apostle</hi> preached to, and baptized the uncircumcised <hi>Gentiles, Act.</hi> 10. 11. and <hi>Paul</hi> exercised his office of an Apostle upon the Jewes also, both by preaching and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, as the history of the <hi>Acts,</hi> chap. 16. chap. 17. and other places may cleare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. so that the contrary doctrine is a new conceite, not of God, and against the pastorall care of bringing in soules to Christ.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Baptisme is not that whereby we are entred into Christs mysticall and invisible body as such, for it is presupposed we be members of Christs body, and our sinnes pardoned already, before baptisme come to bee a seale of sinnes pardoned, but baptisme is a seale of our entry in Christs visible body, as swearing to the Colours is that which entreth a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to be a member of such an Army, whereas before his oath, he was onely a heart friend to the army and cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Baptisme as it is such is a seale, and a seale as a seale addeth no new lands or goods to the man to whom the Charter and seale is given, but only doth legally confirme him in the right of such lands given to the man by the Prince or State, yet this hindereth not but baptisme is a reall, legall seale, legally confirming the man in his actuall and visible profession of Christ, remission of sinnes, regeneration, so as though before baptisme he was a member of Christs body, yet quoad nos, he is not a member of Christs body visible, untill he be made such by baptisme.</hi>

                     <hi>Smalcius,</hi> who teach that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be nothing but externall rites and declarative signes, scadowing out Christ, and the benefits of his death to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they find a morall objective working in the Word of God, but a substantiall and Physicall working betwixt us and Christs bodie (they say) is ridiculous, but they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that this is an insufficient enumeration, the seale of a Kings Charter hath besides a morall action on the mind, by bringing to the mind such lands given to such a man, and so the seales, worketh upon the witnesses, or any who readeth the Charter as well as upon the owner of the Charter: I say beside this the seale hath some reall action, I grant not in it, but about it, and beside it; for it sealeth that such lands are really and in effect given by the Prince and State, the action is about the seale, not in or from the seale: When a Generall of an Army delivereth the keyes of a Castle to a Keeper thereof, he saith <hi>[I deliver the house to you]</hi> when he delivereth the Keyes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Physically, and not the stones, walls or timber of the house, by a Physicall action or Physicall touch, <hi>contactu Physico,</hi> yet in delivering the keyes, he doth really deliver to him the Castle, but in a legall and morall way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> may see here that there is neither an action by way of naked representation and teaching, for the Sacrament is a teaching signe to the beholders who receive it not, nor is it a Physicall action, as if Christs Physicall body in a Physicall way were given; yet it is an action reall, and morall: so the Sacraments are signes exhibitive and not naked signes. Our brethren doe side with <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> who so often teach that <hi>Sacraments make nothing to be what they were not, but onely declare things to be what they are.</hi> It is true, the formall effect of a Sacrament is to seale and confirme; to seale and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme is but a legall strengthning of a right, and not the adding of any new thing. Yet in this the Sacrament differeth from a seale. 1. That to a civill seale there is not required the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and faith of the owner of the Charter, to make the seale effectuall; for whether the Lord of the lands beleeve that his seale doth confirme him in the lands, or not, the seale of it selfe by the Law of the Prince &amp; State maketh good his right to the lands: but Sacraments doe not worke <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as civill seales doe worke, even as Physicke worketh upon the body,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49702:275"/>
without the faith of the mind, though the man bee sleeping. Hence the third consideration of a Sacrament as an instrument, Faith, in and through the Sacrament being wakened and stirred up layeth hold upon Christ his death and benefits, and for this cause there is a reall exhibition of the thing signified, and the Sacrament is an exhibitive seale.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Sacrament in the use is considered as wee use it in obedience to God, who saith in the Lords Supper, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> and in this it differeth from a civill seale al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. The Prince doth not conferre a seale to confirme a man in his land upon condition, that he will make use of it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes it shall be to him as no seale. But God hath given the scale of grace upon condition that wee make use thereof in Faith, else the Sacrament is blanke and null. Therefore if you beleeve, and not otherwayes, the Sacrament of the Supper seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and confirmeth you in this, that <hi>Christ is given already, and is in the present given to be nourishment to your soule to life eternall;</hi> and so oft as you eate, the certioration and assurance groweth, and the faith is increased, and a further degree of a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Christ confirmed; but it is not so in civill seales, though yee repeate and reiterate the same seale of lands, ten thousand times, it never addeth one aker more to the in heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, because the repetition of a civill seale is not commanded under the promise of addition of new lands, nor is it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as obedience to the owner of the Charter, that hee should make use of the seale; but from the using in faith, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we receive increase of Grace, and a Sacramentall Grace.</p>

                        <hi>Anabaptists, that the Church is made by baptisme, and Papists have the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and therefore place their Font at the Church doore to signifie mens entry into the Church by baptisme; but we beleeve not that baptisme doth make men members of the Church, nor to be administrated to them who are without the Church, as the way to bring them in, but to them that are within the Church, as a seale to confirme the Covenant of Grace to them.</hi>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. <hi>Anabaptists</hi> deny that <hi>any ought to be baptized while thy come to age, and while they beleeve and be regenerated:</hi> and they say not farre from your selves in this, who teach it to bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, to put a <hi>blanke seale upon a falshood,</hi> and so you presuppone all to be regenerated, and truly within the Covenant before they can be sealed to be within the Covenant by baptisme; and yet you do not think all Infants of beleeving parents to be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and truly within the Covenant, then is the seale blanck. Also you say, baptisme is not to be administrated to those who are without, but onely to those who are within the <hi>Church,</hi> you meane not within the <hi>Church</hi> by profession, for Infants have no profession, and you say <hi>the Sacrament cannot be put on a blanke or a falshood, Ergo,</hi> you thinke all that are baptized ought to be within the <hi>Church</hi> really, and not in profession ouely; <hi>Ergo</hi> they must all come to age and beleeve before they can be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. 2. We say not that baptisme maketh a Church mysticall, and the true and lively body and Spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> but that it is a seale confirming us of our entry in the visible <hi>Church.</hi> 3. The
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49702:276"/>
placing of the Font at the <hi>Church doore</hi> as a mysticall signe of our entry in the Church is an Antichristian ceremony of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising, which wee disclaime. 4. If Infants baptized must bee within the <hi>Church,</hi> before they can be baptized, how deny you to receive them to the Lords Supper when they come to age, while they bee againe, by your <hi>Church-oath,</hi> received within the Church? then are they both within the Church, because they are baptized, and without the Church, because they are not received in by your Church-oath againe. 5. If baptisme be a seale of grace to confirme the Covenant of grace to those who are within the Church, that is, onely a single Congregation, (for you deny that there be any visible Churches in the New Testament save these onely) then are persons baptized persons, and confirmed in the Covenant of grace onely within a single Congregation. I would know if baptisme should not then be repeated and reiterated in every ones person, as they come to a new Congregation; for they are confirmed in the Covenant of grace, by baptisme onely in one single Congregation, as you teach.</p>

                  <p>In this discourse three things must bee discussed, 1. With
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49702:278"/>
what Church retaining the doctrine of fundamentalls, we are to remaine. 2. Whether our separation from <hi>Rome</hi> bee not warrantable. 3.

                        </gap>ers of Faith;</hi> for <hi>praeter fundamentalia,</hi> things indifferent and besides the foundation in matters of Religion, and morall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, I acknowledge none; fundamentalls are the vitall and noble parts or the soule of Divinitie. The ignorance of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls condemneth, which is to be understood two wayes. 1. The Ignorance of fundamentalls, such as are supernaturall fundamentalls, condemneth all within the visible Church as a sinne; but it doth not formally condemne those who are without the visible <hi>Church, Job.</hi> 15. 22. It onely maketh those who are without the Church incurable, but doth not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemne them: as medicine not knowne, and so not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, maketh sicke men incurable, as a losse, but doth not kill them as a sinne. 2. Superstructures, which by consequence, arise from fundamentalls, are fundamentalls by consequent and secondarily; as the second ranke of stones that are immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid upon the foundation, are a foundation in respect of the higher parts of the wall, and therefore are materially funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall: and the ignorance of these virtually condemne, and the denying of such, by consequence is a denying of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>Things about the foundation, <hi>circa fundamentalia,</hi> are all things revealed in the word of God, as all <hi>Histories, Miracles, Chronol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As necessary, by necessitie of a meane, <hi>necessitate medii,</hi> and the knowledge; so is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49702:279"/>
to salvation, many are in glory (I doubt not) who lived in the visible Church, and yet knew never that <hi>Sampson</hi> killed a Lion; but the knowledge of all these is necessary, <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> because all in the visible Church are oblieged to know these things, therefore the ignorance of these onely doth not actually condemne, but virtually and by demerit lead to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. 2. This knowledge is considered as commanded in the excellency thereof, and so error and bad opinions about these are sinfully ill, though in the regenerate, by accident, such errors condemne not, where the foundation is holden. 3. The knowledge of these is considered as commanded and enjoyned to us with the submission of faith; for the authority of God the Speaker, and the malicious opposing of these is a fundamentall error, not formally, but by evident consequent, for though the matter of these errors be not fundamentall, yet the malicious opposing of these is a fundamentall error against this principle <hi>[What ever God saith is true;]</hi> but God saith there were eight soules in the Arke of <hi>Noah.</hi> Hence because the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storiall things of Scripture and things about the foundation, as that <hi>Paul purified himselfe with the Jewes, Act.</hi> 21. that <hi>Paul</hi> rebuked <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2. is no lesse true, because God hath so spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Word, then this fundamentall point <hi>[Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners]</hi> it is cleare that the specifice and essentiall forme of a fundamentall article is not taken from the authoritie of God speaking in the Word, (seeing Gods autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is one and the same in all that he speaketh) but from the influence that the knowledge of an article hath to unite us to God in Christ, and bring us to salvation. And secondly, it will follow that this [Thou shalt not by the use of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different kill him for whom Christ died] and the like be no lesse fundamentall, by evident consequent, in respect it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Gods own authority, then articles of our faith, Thirdly, it followeth that formalists ignorantly divide matters of Gods worship, into matters of Faith, or points fundamentall, and things indifferent, as if many Scripturall truthes were not to be found in Gods Word, such as the miracles of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> the journeyes of <hi>Paul,</hi> which are neither matters funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, nor yet things indifferent. Fourthly, many things may be fundamentall, by consequent, to one who can reade the Word, and heareth it read, which is not by consequent
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49702:279"/>
fundamentall to a rude and ignorant man.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of points fundamentall is necessary. 1. To obtaine salvation. 2.

There is a conscience simply doubting of funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points, this may be with a habit of sound faith. 2. A scrupulous conscience which from light grounds is brangled about some fundamentall points, and this is often in sound beleevers, who may and doe beleeve, but with a scruple. 3. A conscience beleeving opinions and conjecturing and guessing, as in Atheists, this is damnable; but where obstinacy is, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending with pertinacie transubstantiation, and that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to adore bread, this pertinacious defending of Idolatry doth inferre necessarily, that the faith of the article of Christs humanitie is but false and counterfeit, and not saving.</p>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49702:292"/>
vaine collection of ignorant <hi>Anabaptists; Paul</hi> writeth to the visible Church, but every priviledge that hee doth ascribe to them doth not agree to them, as they are visible. He saith to the visible Church of <hi>Colossians, ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>your life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> an unvisible life cannot agree to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> as they are a visible Church, so separation from the world made manifest and visible is the cause why the world hateth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, yet that separation is formally invisible and not seene to the eye of men, for it is an action of God to choose men out of the world, and no eye mortall can see his actions, as they be such. And therefore except <hi>Robinson</hi> prove that this choosing out of the world is common to elect and reprobate, and to be seene in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> he bringeth nothing against us to prove his point, but hee plainly contradicteth his owne tenents; for in his first reason, he will have the true Church separated from the world, as <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytor was separated from the world, which we grant that is separation in show, and in profession, and so maketh his visible Church to be made up of traytors and hypocrites, who cannot bee the Spouse of Christ, nor a part of Christ his mysticall body, and his redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med flocke. Now hee still harpeth on this, that the visible Church rightly constitute <hi>is the Spouse of Christ, the redeemed of God, the mysticall body of Christ,</hi> and so hee contradicteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and saith with us that there bee no visible separation from the world, essentiall to such a Church as they dreame of, to wit, <hi>of called Saints, Temples of the holy Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore never one of that side understood to this day the nature of a true visible Church, though they talke and write much of it; for the truth is, the essence and definition of a Church agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not equally to a true Church and a visible Church, yea a visible Church as it is visible is not formally a true Church, but the redeemed Church onely is the true Church.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Lastly, <hi>He speaketh</hi> (saith he) <hi>of such a choosing out of the world as he doth of sending unto the world, v.</hi> 18. <hi>Which sending as it was visible and externall, so was the selection and separation spoken of.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. The choosing out of the world</hi> is not opposed <hi>to sending unto the world,</hi> for sending unto the world is an Apostolick sending common to <hi>Judas</hi> with the rest, whereby they were

                  <p>3. <hi>Consideration.</hi> There is a separation from the Church in the most part, or from the Church in the least and best part.

                  <p>5. <hi>Considerat.</hi> I see not, but we may separate from the Lords Supper, where bread is adored, and from baptisme where the signe of the Crosse is added to Christs ordinances, and yet are we not separated from the Church, for we professedly heare the word, and visibly allow truth of the doctrine maintained by that Church, which doe pollute the Sacraments, and we are ready to seale it with our bloud, and it is an act of visible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a Church, to suffer for the doctrine mentioned by that Church.</p>

                  <p n="10">10. When the greatest part of a Church maketh defection from the Truth, the lesser part remaining sound, the greatest part is the Church of Separatists, though the maniest and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part in the actuall exercise of Discipline be the Church; yet in the case of right Discipline, the best though sewest, is the Church; for truth is like life, that retireth from the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est members unto the heart, and there remaineth in its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, in case of danger.</p>

                  <p>3. <hi>Dist.

                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Dist. There is a formall calling of the Church, as the laying on of the hands of the Elders, and a virtuall and interpretative calling or tacite approbation of the Church, when learned men of eminent gifts, not in office, do write Commentaries, Sermons on Canonick Scriptures, and tractates resuting heresies; to this the tacite approbation of the Church is required, but these have not ordinary pastorall care, nor are they the ordinary converters of soules to Christ, as the pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of Separatists are.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Our brethren hold that the <hi>ordinary and established way in the Church of Christ to the end of the world, is that all that are converted are made fit materialls for the visible Church by private Christians, as gifted of God to preach publikely, and to gather a true Church to Christ.</hi> 2. <hi>That none unconverted, as they are such, are under any pastorall care of Christs officers.</hi> 3. <hi>That Pastors as Pastors, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert none, but onely confirme those who are already converted; and that if Pastors shall convert any to Christ, it is by accident, as we say, with Aristotle, Musicus curat aegrotum, a Musician cureth a sick man, which he doth no wayes as a musician: for Pastors doe convert as gifted persons, and not as Pastors, and conversion of soules is no proper Church-worke, but accidentall to Pastors.</hi>

                  <p>But that none can take on him lawfully to preach the Word publikely, in the established and ordinarily approved way of Christ for the conversion of soules, but he who is not only gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but also called thereunto by <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> I prove.</p>

                  <p>3. <hi>Argum.</hi> He who <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 42. contradistinguisheth the prophet and the righteous man, as different persons, and having different rewards, he doth not acknowledge a righteous man to be a Prophet, <hi>hoc ipso,</hi> because he is a righteous man. But <hi>Christ</hi> doth contradistinguish them, <hi>v.</hi> 41. <hi>He that receiveth a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the name of a Prophet, shall receive a Prophets reward, and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous mans reward; Ergo,</hi> Christ acknowledgeth them to differ. Now if a <hi>righteous man, hoc ipso,</hi> because hee is <hi>a righteous man,</hi> and a member of the Church, should exercise these same specifice acts with a Prophet, that is, if hee should publikely preach to convert soules, he should by this place bee a Prophet, and the reward of a Prophet should be given to the receiver of the righteous man, yea and more then the reward of a Prophet, in respect he is both a righteous man, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>

And all these are duties of Pastors in office, and to ty private Christians, who are commanded to attend their owne callings were unreasonable, and repugnant to the Word of God. The proposition is cleare; no man can preach, but hee who must give himselfe to reading, and must watch and speake to the present case of the hearers; but especially such Preachers as are the onely ordinary converters of soules to <hi>Christ,</hi> must give warning that the unrighteous die not in his sinne: now to say that all these were duties incumbent to <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, artificers, fashioners, carpenters, cloathiers,</hi> were to mocke the word of <hi>God,</hi> and to say, these and these onely were the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of a <hi>Church,</hi> and Kingdome to <hi>Christ,</hi> were unknowne Divinity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All Prophets are set downe in Christs roll of lawfull officers. 2. The rules and canons for the right exercise of their ministery is set downe, especially seeing these pretended pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are presumed to be the greatest part of the visible Church. 3. The onely ordinary gainers of soules to <hi>Christs</hi> kingdome and visible <hi>Church,</hi> even to the second comming of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> 4. Seeing the <hi>Lord</hi> doth so often complaine of idle Pastors, of dumbe dogges, by whose sleeping, soules are losed. Now this Argument for the proposition seemeth most reasonable. In the old Testament <hi>Priests, Levites, Prophets;</hi> and all the edifying officers are set downe there, and so are the officers and canons anent their government set downe in the New Testament, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 17, 18. <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. All lawfull officers have power authoritatively from <hi>Iesus Christ to remit and to retaine sinnes,</hi> by the preaching of the Word.

                  <p n="2">2. They were Sermons of Propheticall instinct and divine impulsions, as the very stile of them cleareth, and therefore cannot warrant Christian Princes to bee ordinary Prophets, except you make the <hi>King</hi> a nationall Pastor over Pastors, and two thousand Congregations; for if, as Prince, hee bee their Pastor, he is equally Pastor and teacher to all these Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and he must be as Prince, obliged to bee a Prophet to convert all: How exclude they a Pastor of Pastors and a dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian prelate, who introduce a nationall Pastor? Yea how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we a Pope, if the King carry both the swords, both of the spirit as a Prophet, and that ordinarily, by his calling to feed soules, and the civill sword to take vengeance upon evill doers? for whosoever preacheth the word of God as a Prophet, hath the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven committed unto him, to bind and loose, to remit and retaine sinnes on earth, and in heaven, for the preached Gospell is the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as is the power of <hi>Church censures.</hi> Then must the Kings have both keyes of Church and State, and what hindereth but they admit the King as King, and a nationall Pastor, to be the

head of the Church under Christ. 3. Consider the King as a Christian and gifted with learning, hee is <hi>parens patriae,</hi> and publick nurse father of the Church, and may occasionally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some extraordinary exigent, at the meeting of the States, or when his armies are going out to battell, make use of the Word of God, to exhort them to generall duties of Religion, and Justice, and to be prepared for meeting with eternitie and judgement; and this he doth as a Christian father, his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects being his children: but what is this to inferre that the <hi>King</hi> as <hi>King</hi> is a Prophet, and an ordinary feeder of soules <hi>ex officio,</hi> by office, and that by <hi>knowledge and instruction,</hi> as <hi>Robinson</hi> saith, and an ordinary converter of soules, and such a Prophet as doth preach in the <hi>Church</hi> ordinarily, to the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Church,</hi> and conviction and conversion of Infidels, and gathering of a people to God, as they say of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets out of office, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 4, 5. 12. 23, 24, 25. 31.

For the second point, Giving and not granting that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were not Apostles, till after the resurrection, yet will it not follow, that they were lay-Prophets, or Prophets out of office, for they might have beene Pastors in office, though not Apostles in office, for there were beside these, others in the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> else where were <hi>Scribes, Pharisees, Lawyers, Doctors,</hi> all sitters in <hi>Moses</hi> his chaire? They were not Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles sure; what were they then? all teachers out of office? No; If then I prove that the Apostles were teachers in office, though it were granted that they were not Apostles (as in the fulnesse and plenitude thereof they were not) till Christ arose from the dead, I prove as much as taketh this argument for lay-prophets out of their hands.

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This will not conclude the Question. 1. One man published one single miracle wrought upon himselfe, which is a part of the Gospel onely. 2. And upon a particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>did show what things the Lord had done for him.</hi> 3. He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to publish it to his friends, and domesticks onely, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Go to thy house,</hi>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>to thine owne friends, and show them what the Lord hath done for thee.</hi> Hence from this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row antecedent a vaste and broad conclusion is drawne; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is lawfull, because this man published one particular of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49702:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gospel, for any gifted man to preach the whole Gospell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one man did it upon a miraculous occasion to his friends; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all gifted men may prophesie the whole Gospel to all the Churches ordinarily, it is a vaine consequence. 2. Because hee published one particular, upon a particular exigence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any gifted man may ordinarily, and weekly and daily Preach for the conversion of soules. 3. Because hee published one miracle to his friends in a private way, therefore any gifted man may preach the whole Gospell in publick, to all the Church, truly here is a weake reason.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is most like that this man was an intruding Prophet, like the Separatists Prophets, for <hi>he requested that hee might be with Jesus,</hi> and bee made a Disciple to preach the Gospell, as <hi>Calvin, Marlorat, Bullinger</hi> expone it; but Jesus suffered him not. Now if Christ had commanded him to be a Prophet, as <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> will have him, he should have granted what he sought.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the man did more then Christ commanded, for <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 20. Hee published it in <hi>Decapolis throughout all the citie,</hi> whereas Christ had limited the publishing thereof to his friends and house onely.</p>

                     <hi>Paraeus</hi> induceth many paires of witnesses, as in <hi>Bohemia, John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerome of Prague, An.</hi> 1415, 1416. in <hi>Saxonie, Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon;</hi> in <hi>Argentine Bucer</hi> and <hi>Cariton;</hi> in <hi>Helvetia, Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius;</hi> in <hi>France, Farell,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and these were Pastors in office. We need not stand upon the number of two, but because two is the least and fewest number, the witnesses were two. But first there is no reason to fetter and restrict the Text, to witnesses and Martyrs out of office, excluding the Ministers and Prophets in office, and to inferre thence that gifted persons in a constitute <hi>Church</hi> are the ordinary Ministers of conversion. 1. These two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses did prophecie in the midst of Popish <hi>Babylon,</hi> where <hi>God</hi> had no visible Church. They did upon a particular exigence, being called thereunto as the Martyrs of Christ, to give a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for Christ against Antichrist, and they sealed the truth with their blood: but the consequence is null, a Martyr at the stake, though no Pastor, may give a confession of his faith, to the persecutors, as <hi>Stephen</hi> did. Therefore a gifted person not in office, may ordinarily preach in the Church. I would not buy such logick with a rotten nut. 3. Many women were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and Martyrs, and gave a testimony against Antichrist; <hi>Ergo</hi> women may preach in the Church: what vanitie is this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Also if those witnesses had an extraordinary measure of gifts and graces to beare witnesse to the truth, it followeth not; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christians gifted with an ordinary measure of the Spirit
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49702:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are ordinary Prophets for the conversion of soules.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though these witnesses were only unofficed Prophets, yet the prophecying ascribed to them, after they arose from the dead, will not inferre that unofficed Prophets are ordinarily to preach, for the rising againe of slaine Prophets is not to be exponed of the raising againe of the persons of unofficed Prophets to preach, but it is to be exponed of the rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of the buried Gospel; which in the ministery of faithfull Pastors and in other new Martyrs, Pastors and others arose againe from the dead, with the Spirit and power of these Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and that buried truth, that was in former times persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Antichrist</hi> did now revive againe to the wondering of <hi>Babylon;</hi> for the intent of the Spirit is to show that the Gospel, and true <hi>Church,</hi> slaine and buried, shall arise againe within a short time, as three dayes and a halfe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is vaine that he saith none of the Clergy witnessed and prophecied against <hi>Antichrist;</hi> he is not versed in the Churches history who teacheth so, for Monkes and Fryars were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, (though their office unlawfull) and as Ministers of Christ. <hi>Luther, Melancthon,</hi> and thousands other gave testimony against <hi>Antichrist.</hi>

Those whom the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh as dull of hearing, who ought to bee teachers and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officed Prophets, are obliged to be indeed such Prophets; for a rebuke is for the omission of a morall dutie which wee are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged to doe, or for the committing the contrary, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh teachers in office, women, children, and ungifted brethren as dull as hearing, for that they ought to be Prophets &amp; were not, <hi>Ergo,</hi> all, even teachers in office, women, children and ungifted brethren ought to be Prophets not in office. Now the conclusion is absurd and against your selfe, for you say, Pag. 58. <hi>every particular person in the Church is not bound to have the gift of prophecying,</hi> women are not bound I am sure, yet are women rebuked <hi>for being dull of hearing, and for that they ought to be teachers of others, and were not.</hi>

This he covereth and proveth never, onely he setteth downe foure armies of Arguments to prove, I know not what, to prove forsooth that men may prophesie in publike, and not women, but who denyeth that? And the similitude of faith and workes crooketh here, for saving faith is opposed to all good workes whatsoever, both in kind and individualls, for wee are neither justified by good workes in <hi>specie,</hi> nor by any one good worke in <hi>individuo,</hi> but though all women be debarred from teaching in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet are not all men licensed to teach in the <hi>Church,</hi> but onely those (say we) <hi>who are called of God, as was Aaron.</hi> 2.

When this authority is not exercised by the precise rule and prescript of the Law of God, it is not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, but null, and of no force. 4. They are so above the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as 1. they are their Servants, for Christs sake, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. yea we are their servants servants: not as if the people had a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Pastors, or as if they had their authority from the people, they have it immediately from <hi>Christ,</hi> but because all their service is for the good, and the salvation of the people. 5.

The <hi>Lord</hi> hath given to them an over-sight, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. and hath committed to them a ministery, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. hath put them in his worke and ministery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. 5. <hi>God</hi> will seeke an account of the bloud of the lost at their hand, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and <hi>God</hi> giveth a reward for the discharge of their office, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 8 <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 45. 46. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they must have a place of authority over the people, which the people have not. 6.

                  <p>I answer. 1. Calling and electing are not to be confounded; electing is no act of authority; but that the people calleth and ordaineth the Elders, wanteth example in the word of God, and therefore the Author addeth, that the people ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Elders <hi>in defect of their Presbytery,</hi> that is, where there is no Presbytery; then in case of extraordinary necessitie, and where the <hi>Church</hi> is not constituted, they are to ordaine the Elders, but in a Constitute <hi>Church,</hi> the power of ordination is in the Presbytery; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ordinarily the people doe not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this authoritie over the Elders.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, (saith the Author) <hi>Elders have rule over the Church in preaching the word, and they have power to teach and exhort, to charge and command, to reprove and rebuke with all authoritie,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>and</hi> 6. 17. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It can not be denied, but Elders, that is, preaching Elders or Pastors, have authoritie over the people in preaching and rebuking with all authoritie; but 1. I aske at our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by what authoritie of the Scripture is pastorall bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49702:327"/>
and loosing an authoritative act of the preaching Elder onely? for the concionall or preaching power of remitting and retaining sinnes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 21. is all one with the power of the keyes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and that is given (saith our brethren) to the whole Church, and by these texts are not restricted to Pastors as they expone them. 2. Our brethren alledge there is a two-fold power of preaching in Pastors, one by vertue of their gift, another by vertue of their office. By the first Pastors doe preach to <hi>Infidels, Turkes, and unconverted ones;</hi> now this preaching is not proper to Pastors as Pastors, nor is it any authority pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Pastors over all the flocke, for all gifted persons (as our brethren teach) may preach, and so the gifted ones amongst the people have authority over the Pastors in this meaning, as well as the Pastors have over them, and so the difference of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and ruled, of feeders and the fed, is taken away. Now for the power of Pastorall teaching, the Pastors have authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the <hi>Church,</hi> but that is over the invisible Church of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and regenerated persons, for Pastors as Pastors doe not convert Soules, and so they preach to the unconverted not as Pastors, or with any Pastorall care: for they teach that Pastors, Doctors, and Church-officers are given, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. onely for confirming of those who are already converted, not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of Soules, and by this meanes, 1. Pastors doe not preach the Law, for the humbling of unconverted sinners, they doe not as Pastors, or by vertue of the office <hi>open the eyes of the blinde,</hi> nor are <hi>they Ministers by whom men beleeve,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. nor are they Fathers who begot men in Christ Jesus, through the Gospell, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 25. Nor doe they pray men in Christs stead to be reconciled unto God, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. Which is strange and uncouth Doctrine of our brethren, for all these acts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall are performed upon non-converts, who are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly members of Christs mysticall body, nor of the spouse of Christ, nor members of the visible Church, nor the <hi>Sonnes and Daughters of the Lord God Almighty,</hi> nor have <hi>some measure of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth,</hi> as this author Chap. 3. Sect. 3. requireth of members of the visible Church, and these are not under any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall care, really and in very deed, who are yet unconverted to the faith, therefore the Pastor, if hee convert any by his
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49702:327"/>
preaching, he doth it by vertue of his gift, not as a Pastor or by vertue of his office, as they teach in their answer to the 32. questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; so as Pastors they have no authoritie over the unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within the visible Church; and this authoritative act of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders over the people, falleth to the ground, by their principles.</p>
                  <p>3. This authoritative preaching doth not yet make over to the Elders authoritative power above, or over the people, such as wee now seeke. For 1. By this ruling Elders who do not preach and labour <hi>not in the Word and doctrine,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 7. 17. by office, have not this power; <hi>Ergo,</hi> yet you give no peculiar au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to the whole Eldership over the people. 2. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God requireth an authority of overseeing and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bee in Pastors beside the authoritative power of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for besides that a <hi>Bishop should bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All which are singular points of authoritative power of government diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from authoritative power of teaching. And so <hi>Titus</hi> must not onely have the oversight by sound doctrine to exhort and convince the gainesayers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. but hee hath power in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning to order the things of discipline, and to appoint Elders in every citie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 23. yea there is an oversight in watching for soules, in governing no lesse then in teaching, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now this Author sheweth us nothing, that is a peculiar authoritative power in ruling, governing and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplinary overseeing of soules, which the Word giveth to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as they are Elders, and called Governors of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as yet, yea all the people are governors, rulers and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers in government by them, no lesse then the Elders.</p>

4. <hi>The Author</hi> saith, <hi>Elders have rule over the Church in dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all the censures of the Church, (unlesse it bee in their owne cause) for though they take the consent of the Church in dispensing a censure, yet they set on the censures with great authoritie, in the name of the Lord; yea it is no small power, that they put forth in directing the Church, what censures are due according to the word: as, though the Judge dispense no sentence, but according to the verdict of the Jury, yet his authority is great both in directing the Jury to give their verdict according to the Law, and in pronouncing the sentence with power and terrour; the like d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This dispensing of Church censures hath two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. 1. A directing of the Church in the qualitie of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. 2. A binding of the censures upon them, or in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the censures of the <hi>Church.</hi> For the former, if it bee a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall direction, it is all one with preaching of the Word, and is not an act of authority by way of governing, but by way of pastorall teaching. But, 1. Wee would have a word from <hi>God,</hi> giving this power of the keyes peculiarly to the Pastors, for if you give the keyes to all the <hi>Church</hi> of beleevers, as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and because they are <hi>Christs Spouse, his mysticall body, the habitation of his Spirit by faith,</hi> then with your good leave, there bee neither keyes, nor any power of the keyes given to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors as Pastors, and in respect of their office, but onely as they are a part of <hi>Christs</hi> body; now as Pastors or Elders, they are neither beleevers, nor the bride, nor a part of the bride, but at best <hi>the friends of the Bridegroome, Joh.</hi> 3. 29. especially seeing the <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>Church,</hi> and as using actually the keyes, doth censure and judicially prescribe the qualitie and quantitie of the censure, as they are directed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. yea and the Church judicially, and authoritatively pronounceth the sentence, and maner of the censure on the sentence: for example, of ten collaterall and coequall Judges, if two of these ten bee skilled Juristes, and shall direct the rest in the qualitie of the punishment to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon a malefactor, that direction commeth from them, not as Judges over the rest, nor by any peculiar power that they have above the rest, seeing all the ten are equally and joyntly Judges of a like power, but that direction commeth
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49702:328"/>
from them as skilled Jurists: So here, though the Elders di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Church anent, the qualitie of the censure, they doe not this by an authority above the Church, seeing the Church with them have received the Keyes; yea they principally as the Spouse of Christ, and his mysticall body, have received the keyes, and the Pastoes and Elders as such have the keyes, not but as they are beleevers and a part of the mysticall body, but as they are Pastors and Elders they have not received the keyes at all, by our brethrens doctrine; yea as Elders or officers they are not parts of the Church, but onely adjuncts and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof. For the second, to wit, the execution of the censures of the Church, if they doe it as Pastors, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their office execute the sentence of the Church as Pastors, they are meere servants of the Church, not collaterall Judges, with the Church, and are not as the Judge who doth direct the Jury: for the Jury doth only cognosce of the fact, but hath no judiciall power to pronounce the sentence or discerne the qualitie of the punishment, nor can the Jury at all discerne any punishment. But the Judge cognosceth both of the Law, and the fact, and authoritatively pronounceth sentence; but the Elders have no authoritative power in directing the people to pronounce, or not pronounce the sentence; or what sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to pronounce, or what censure to inflict; for if they have this authoritative power, then we seeke Scripture to warrant this power. 2. The Elders must then have the keyes in a more emminent manner then the people or Church of beleevers; so all bee but blanke and emptie titles given to Elders hitherto.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Fiftly, saith the <hi>Author, The Elders have power to dismisse the people or Church, and that with a blessing, Numb.</hi> 6. 23. <hi>to</hi> 26. <hi>which is an act of seperioritie, Heb.</hi> 7. 7.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>An.</hi> This is but an emptie title also. For, 1. The Pastoronly, &amp; one dismisseth <hi>Doctor, Elders, Deacons,</hi> and the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and so one is a Pastor of Pastors, and an Arch-Elder of Elders hath authority, by this, over his fellow Elders, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dismisse them, therefore there is nothing peculiar in an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall power, here to the whole presbytery, above the people. 2. A majority or superioritie is one thing, and a power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction is another. Blessing of the Church at their dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49702:329"/>
is nothing, but a prayer of the whole <hi>Church</hi> (the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster being mouth) who blesseth all, and is no act of superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of jurisdiction, or power of the keyes, of which wee now dispute. And you cannot thinke that to obey those <hi>who are over you in the Lord, and submit to them,</hi> as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. is nothing but to receive a dismissory blessing from the Pastor. And I much doubt, if the Priests blessing of the people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. was <hi>morall,</hi> and if it was not <hi>typicall,</hi> hee not taking in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but as a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> pronouncing the whole visible Church blessed, sorypifying <hi>Christ</hi> our Priest, <hi>in whom all the nations of the earth are blessed, Gal.</hi> 38. 14. And do not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pay the Pastor home in his owne coyne, for you make the <hi>Church</hi> of beleevers to ordaine their owne Elders, and to lay hands upon them and blesse them, so you teach. 3. Nor is dismissing of the Church an act of authoritie, or of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall power, for your preaching and unofficed professors may dismisse, as well as they may publikely pray and preach. 2. A dismission is agreed upon by the <hi>Church,</hi> before hand, and floweth from the nature of all publike meetings. 3. <hi>Ejusdem est potestatis congregare &amp; dimittere caetum congregatum;</hi> you know to conveene <hi>Christs</hi> Courts authoritatively is due to no man on earth; the <hi>Church</hi> hath an intrinsecall power of herselfe to conveene (being the Court of the <hi>Lord Jesus)</hi> and so also to dissolve, and this is the usurped power that the Antichrist ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to himselfe to conveene the generall councells; as <note n="a" place="margin">

To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce judgement to an Idolatrous and obstinate <hi>Church,</hi> who by their Apostasie do declare themselves, not to bee <hi>Christs</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is a Pastorall act of Pastors exercised on those who now leave off to be <hi>Churches,</hi> and this is to play the Pastors to that which is not a flocke, and as unlawfull as for a husband to exercise the actions of a husband to one who is not his wife. 3. To separate from an obstinate Church is by you thought lawfull to all private Christians, who would not defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the pollutions of the <hi>Church,</hi> how then do you make it an authoritative act of ruling Pastors? 4. For Pastors to remove the Gospell, and preach no more to an obstinate <hi>Church,</hi> is not, nor can it, in reason, be, that wherein wee are to submit and obey those, who are over us in the Lord. My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, we are to be agents, at least, for most part, in submitting and yeelding our selves to those who in teaching and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>are over us in the Lord, because they watch for our soules.</hi> But in their separating from us and removall of the Gospel, wee are meere patients and cannot be agents. 5. <hi>Moses</hi> his removall of the Tabernacle, and <hi>Paul</hi> his turning from the Jewes, was by another spirits warrant, then Pastors now a dayes can dare to remove themselves, and their Ministery from a visible Church, for <hi>Paul</hi> turned from the Jewes for their universall Apostasie, blasphemy, and opposing of the maine and principall founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Christian faith, to wit, that <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> came in the world, died for sinners, rose againe, and ascended to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp;c. The 4. case, to wit, of any particular scandall, or scandals and of obstinacie therein, cannot bee the like ground for Elders to separate from a Church and never preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel againe to them.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Conclusion; Every particular Pastor hath a power, though unproper, of dominion and authoritie, even out of a Synod, about the Acts of preaching and determining truth; according to the word of God, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdomes, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Charge them that are rich that they bee not high minded, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead, &amp;c.</hi> So any Pastor hath power of dominion and authoritie over a Synod, and <hi>Paul</hi> as a Pastor might preach, even before the councell at Jerusalem passed their Synodicall determination, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. that circumcision was not necessary, and that <hi>to obstaine from things strangled, from blood and fornication was necessary and lawfull,</hi> yea and in preaching truth the Pastor is subject to no Synod. But the Pastor hath not full power of jurisdiction about his acts of preaching ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary truth. 1. Because the Church may for just causes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him from preaching. 2. Because hee cannot use the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of excommunication against those who refuse to receive

his true and necessary doctrine, without the <hi>Church</hi> joyne her power of jurisdiction with him. 3. He, his alone, cannot in a Synod determine ecclesiastically, and in an authoritative Church power, that same truth which as a Pastor hee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and with the power of pastorall dominion hee pressed upon the consciences of the Church, yea of the whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, because one man is not the Church, or Synod; and <hi>James</hi> his alone, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 15. could but say, <hi>Wherefore my sentence is that yee trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned unto God,</hi> though this was the very word of God, which <hi>James</hi> as a Pastor, even as an ordinary Pastor might have preached in the name of God; yet is it <hi>not</hi>

                     <hi>Junius.</hi> But certainly this is a meer mistake of our brethren, as if they were not orthodox writers, but conspirers against the truth with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who hold the authoritie of Synods. The essentiall end (to speak so) of Synods is unitie, and the eschewing of schisme; and wee doubt not, but <hi>Peter, Paul, James</hi> had in their Sermons, and doctrine determined that same veritie, to wit, that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and ceremonies was a yoak not to bee laid upon the Christian Churches, yet it was not a decree for unities sake, and fuller authoritie binding the Churches to observe these, as <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 4. while it was determined in a Synod, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 24. 25.</p>
                  <p>But truely wee hold nothing in this common with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and Papists,</hi> for wee condemne not that in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that hee holdeth that lawfull Synods (for of such wee dispute with him) do bind the Churches to obedience in God, to their decrees, not because they say it, but because they say it authoritatively from Gods Word; authoritie of Synods no orthodox writers deny, authoritie officiall as the representative <hi>Church of Christ they have, He that heareth you heareth mee, hee that despiseth you despiseth me; Where two or three are gathered together</hi> (in a Synod, say our Divines) <hi>I will bee amongst them.</hi> But autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie objective they have not, so as what they say, because they say it, therefore the very matter, object and thing said by them, is no lesse the <hi>Word of God,</hi> then if the Prophets and Apostles by divine inspiration had said it; at least it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true, because they say it, for that wee disclaime, and it is that authoritie of Synods, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and Papists hold, <hi>Councells</hi> (saith <note n="h" place="margin">

                     <hi>Gregorius de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia;</hi> wee hold the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Councels, but ascribe to them as much power over the conscience, as there is reason in them from Gods Word, and no more.</p>
                  <p>But 2. This is a weake reason, councels have no power to command obedience, because their Canons and Decrees are of no more force, then they have reason from Gods Word. For 1. Friends, brethren, equals, by that have no warrant to rebuke, because their rebukes have but as much force, as they have reason from the word of God, for the reason is alike in both; lawfull Pastors cannot command obedience in the Lord, your independent Congregations cannot command that <hi>which bindeth the Church to obedience,</hi> because the word or a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of a Pastor, or your independent Church is onely a commandement <hi>ministeriall and limited, and hath as much force as there is reason in it, from the Word of God;</hi> yea the Church of <hi>Corin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Conclusion: There is an authoritative power in Synods, whereby they may and doe command in the Lord the visible Churches, in their bounds; the whole Churches are subject to the ordinance and decree of the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. where with common consent of a Synodicall meeting, <hi>Matthias</hi> is ordained an Apostle; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all the Churches are to take him for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle. This argument cannot bee repelled, because the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles by their extraordinary power did choose <hi>Matthias.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49702:336"/>
1. they themselves cite this place to prove the peoples power ordinary, which is to indure to Christs second comming, in calling and electing their owne officers and Elders. 2. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> 
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Almain de potest. eccles. et civ.</note> a Papist alleadgeth the place with good reason, to prove that a generall councell is above <hi>Peter</hi> or the <hi>Pope,</hi> because <hi>Peter</hi> would not choose <hi>Matthias</hi> without consent of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and <hi>Church.</hi> 3. If this was extraordinary that <hi>Matthias</hi> was chosen, why then is the vow and consent of the <hi>Church</hi> sought? for there is nothing extraordinary and Apostolick flowing from an <hi>Apostolick spirit,</hi> which is concluded or done by the spirit ordinary of the Church of beleevers. So also <hi>Act.</hi> 6. If the Apostles did not by the ordinary and Synodicall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ordinary Pastors choose seven Deacons, how doe they first require that the Churches of Grecians and Hebrewes should seek out seven men? <hi>v.</hi> 3. and did ordaine them with the common consent of the whole multitude, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. A Synod of moe Churches give decrees which obliege the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>ch.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Synods have authoritie over the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Those who say this Synod is not a patterne for after Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, say farre aside; for their reason is, this was 1. An Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Synod; 2. the holy Ghost was here; 3. the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined was canonick Scripture. But this is a way to clude all the promises made to Pastors in the word, when as they are first made to Apostles: this promise, <hi>Behold I am with you to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd of the world,</hi> and this, <hi>I will send you the other Comforter, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> lead you in all truth,</hi> cannot bee made to faithfull Pastors, and the Christian Church, that now is, for it is certaine Christ is otherwise present with his Apostles, then with his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors after them. And that he gave them a tongue &amp; a spirit when they were before the councels and rulers, as to Apostolick men, as <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 8. 9, 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 29. as Christ promised, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 19. 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 13, 14, 15. for they were full of the holy Ghost before rulers, but by our brethrens doctrine, it shall follow none of these promises belong to Pastors now adayes in the like, because no pastors now are Apostles. Surely this were to fetter and imprison many glorious promises within the pale of the onely Apostolick Church; and because Christ ascending to heaven sent downe the Apostolick spirit to his
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49702:337"/>
Apostles to write and preach canonick Scripture, it shall follow he fulfilleth that promise, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. to none now adayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none have the Apostolike spirit in the manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that the Apostles had. Yea further it is canonick Scripture that the Apostles at the last supper did <hi>shew forth the Lords death till be come againe;</hi> therefore it shall follow that we have no warrant to shew forth the Lords death till he come againe. 2. But that the Apostles in an ecclesiastick way did determine in the Synod for our imitation, and not in an Apostolike way, is cleare by many evidences in the text, as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were sent commissioners to the Apostles and Elders about this question: <hi>Paul</hi> as an Apostle needed not be sent to know more of the matter then he knew, as an Apostle; for as an Apostle he knew the whole mystery of the Gospel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. 17. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 4, 5. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he was sent to the Synod as a Pastor, and that as an ordinary Pastor. 2. <hi>They came together,</hi> v. 6. <hi>to consider of this businesse,</hi> but as Apostles they needed not the help of a Synod. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they came together as ordinary Pastors for the Churches after imitation. 3. There was much debating and disputing, <hi>v.</hi> 7. about the matter. 4. They set down their minds and sentences in order, one after another, as <hi>Peter first, v.</hi> 7. 8. then <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul, v.</hi> 12. then <hi>James, v.</hi> 13. and to <hi>James</hi> his sentence the whole Councell agreeth, <hi>v.</hi> 22. Now what the Apostles, as Apostles and from an infallible Spirit do, they doe it not by seeking light and help one from another. 5. The Decree of the Councell is a thing that Apostles, Elders, and Brethren, and the whole Church resolveth after much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, <hi>v.</hi> 22. But all these, especially brethren, and the whole beleevers, as our Brethren say, doe not joyne themselves with the Apostles, either to write canonick Scripture, or to give their consent to the writing of it, therefore they doe consent by a synodall authority, for the after imitation of the <hi>Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also there bee reasons of moment for Synods; and 1. if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of nature, and nations, no man can bee a Judge in his owne cause, then are appeales from the Eldership of one congregation, when they are a party to the accused person, naturall, and from a Session to the Presbyteries and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods of many moe Elders. But the former is reason, nature,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:49702:337"/>
Law of Nations. <hi>Ergo,</hi> so is the latter. 1. It is best reason which hath most of Scripture. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 15. 1. 2. had no small disputation with those who said circumcision was necessary; finding their parties could not be Judges. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to a generall councell at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where were the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Elders; The <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Grecians</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> strive, neither of them can judge other, and both appeale to a higher judicatory, to the twelve Apostles, and their owne <hi>Churches</hi> meeting with them, and there is the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For, 1. all preaching of the Word, and all power of authoritie of Pastors commanding in the name of the Lord, faith and obedience, is onely morall and to perswade, and not authoritative to command, because Pastors may as well erre in preaching, as the Church may erre in Synods. 2. Because what Pastors preach hath no more force over the conscience, then they have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to speake from the Word of God, as is cleare, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 9. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 13. 2.

A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall doubting of conscience, except in two or three points fundamentall, that all Christians beleeve, yea and all hereticks, is brought in in the Church. 5. The Lords working with the word preached, is but by way of morall perswasion. 6. But our Divines hold the authoritie of Synods, and of Pastors preaching the Word from the Scriptures: <note n="z" place="margin">Matth. 18. 17. Matth. 28. 19. Joh. 20. 25.

and if they bee multiplied in the bosome of your visible Church and converted, they were not truely members of that visible Church before their conversion, and also that they were not converted by any publike ministery, but by private Christians gifted to prophesie, who are the onely successors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to plant visible Churches: but what pastorall authoritie have you to send them forth to bee a new visible Church? none at all? they have as beleevers power to remove from you, and because of multiplication, to make themselves a new Church, and this ministeriall power of making themselves a new Church they have not from you, but from their fathers who converted them, so that you make a visible Church within a visible Church, but not a Church begotten or borne of a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, as a child of the mother; and wee desire a word of God, either precept, promise, or practise of such a Church multiplication, mans word is not enough.</p>

Wee hold that the sending of the Apostles to all the world was not in it selfe, that which essentially distinguisheth the Apostle from the now ordinary Pastor, who is fixed to a single Congregation, but the gift of tongues to preach to all the world upon the Lords intention to send the Gospel to all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that as many as were chosen to life, might beleeve, was that which essentially differenceth the Apostle from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pastor, together with a speciall revelation of God, to goe to such and such people, to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and not yet to <hi>Bythinia.</hi> And now seeing these two are taken away, the ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors which now are, have as Pastors a sufficient calling to preach the Gospel to all nations, to whom by Gods providence they shall come, and can understand their language, whether of their owne Congregation or not. Neither is a Pastor tied as a Pastor by Gods Word, to one onely Congregation, for then it should bee unlawfull for a Pastor as a Pastor to plant a new Church; but shall it bee lawfull for private Christians to plant new Churches, who are not the Apostles successors, and yet it shall bee unlawfull for Pastors, who are the undoubted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the Apostles, to plant new Churches? I would think that admirable doctrine, for so you give to private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that which you make essentiall to the Apostles, and you
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:49702:343"/>
deny it to the undoubted successors of the Apostles, to wit, to Pastors. But we hold a lawfull Pastor is a Pastor in relation to all the world, with this distinction, hee is by Christs appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Churches a Pastor to all congregations, to plant and water, and preach, but by speciall designation of Gods providence, and the Churches appointment designed and set apart for such a determinate flock, just as the Apostles in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall were made Pastors to all the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28 19. <hi>Go teach all nations,</hi> but by speciall revelation and Apostolick appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Peter</hi> was appointed the Apostle of the <hi>Jewes, Paul</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles, Gal.</hi> 2. 9. yet <hi>Paul</hi> was a Pastor in relation to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> also in relation to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> so by speciall revelation, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. they are forbidden to preach the word in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and commanded to preach it elsewhere; and for this cause, pious antiquity, as <hi>Morton</hi>

Because the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate may compell, <hi>ad actus imperatos, non ad actus elicitos,</hi> commanded and externall acts of worship, though he have no power over the conscience to command the elicit acts of will and mind. 3.

Upon supposall that we see not the truth of these <hi>non-fundamentals</hi> clearly, we are neither to beleeve with a reserve, nor to beleeve them absolutely, nor yet are we to suspend our beliefe, because I conceive all the three to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and we are never obliged to sinne, but we are obliged to know and beleeve simply without all reserve, having laid away our darke and confused conscience, and are to know clearely and beleeve firmely that <hi>God</hi> speaketh this, not this in his Word; nor, because I doe fluctuate about the truth of these <hi>non-fundamentals,</hi> am I obliged to follow in <hi>non-fundamentals</hi> the endictment of a fluctuating conscience, seeing holding the plenitude and plenary perfection of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> the Lord hath no lesse manifested his will, in setting downe superstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and non-fundamentals, in his Word, then he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his mind to us in fundamentals.</p>

                     <p>But our Brethren prove that we may tolerate one another in diverse and contrary opinions about <hi>non-fundamentals,</hi> from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing yee be otherwise minded, God shall reveale this unto you.</hi> 16. <hi>Neverthelesse, whereunto we have already attained, let us walke by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. Now there is nothing more opposite to this rule, then the practises of some, who will exclude and allow communion in nothing, where there is difference in anything. The labours of</hi> Davenant <hi>and others in this needfull case of syncretisme and pacification in those times are very seasonable.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>I answer, I distinguish three things that may be judged the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of syncretisme or mutuall toleration. 1. <hi>Fundamentalia,</hi> fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:49702:354"/>
points. 2. <hi>Supra &amp; circa fundamentalia,</hi> things that are builded on the foundation or superstructures, or things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the foundation, as many positive and historicall things that cannot result by good consequence off, or from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as that there were eight soules in <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and some rituals of Gods institution in the Sacrament of the Supper and Baptisme, &amp;c. 3. <hi>Praeter fundamentalia,</hi> things meerely physicall, not morall, having no influence in <hi>Gods</hi> worship at all; as such a day for meeting of an Assembly of the <hi>Church,</hi> Wednesday rather then Thursday; a cloake when you pray in private, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a gowne; these have, or contribute of themselves no morall influence to the action, as in what corner of your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you pray in private, these are meerely indifferent, and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in these I would commend. It is true, there is a strict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion often betwixt the physicall and the morall circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so as the physicall circumstance doth put on, by some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, a morall habitude and respect, and then the physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call circumstance becommeth morall, as in what corner of your Chamber you pray, it is meerely physicall and indifferent, but if that corner that you pray in, cast you obvious to the eyes of those who are walking in the streets, that they may see and heare your private prayers, then the place putteth on the morall respect of a savour of some Pharisaicall ostentation, that you <hi>pray to be seene of men;</hi> and so the circumstance now is morall, and is to be regulated by the Word, whereas the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance that is meerely physicall is not, as it is such, in any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to receive scripturall regulation, nothing is required but a physicall convenience for the action. Now for <hi>fundamentall</hi> superstructures, for things about the foundation, in so farre as they have warrant in the Word, to me they oblige to faith and practises, in so farre as the Lord intimateth to us in his Word, either expressely, or by good consequence, that they are lawfull. Now I may adde to these, that there be some things adjacent, circumvenient, circumstantiall to these funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, superstructions, and others that I named, wherein mutuall tolerance is commendable; Nor doe we thinke any Church Reformation so perfect as that reformers have not left it in some capacity more or lesse of receiving increase and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:49702:355"/>
of Reformation; but truely I doe not see the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that therefore in all points not <hi>fundamentall</hi> the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence must be of that compliable latitude of Kid-leather to take in, and let out, so as none of these superstructures or <hi>non-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> are to be beleeved but with a reserve, that you take them to day as Gods truths, and are in capacity to beleeve their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicents to be Gods truth to morrow.</p>

So in other things, they be of one minde with <hi>Paul,</hi> as perfect men should be: and so I thinke <hi>Paul</hi> doth indeed condemne separation and breach of love for diversity of opinions in some things; and we doubt not, but if the servant of the Lord should with gentlenesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct malicious <hi>opposers of the truth,</hi> and wait on them to <hi>see, if God, peradventure, will give them repentance, to the acknowledgment of the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24, 25. farre rather should <hi>Paul</hi> walke with those that are perfect according to the same rule, though they be of another mind; but it followeth not that those who are of another mind from <hi>Paul,</hi> should, 1 obstinately conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in that mind, after that <hi>God</hi> hath by writings and dispute convinced them of their error. 2. It followeth not that their ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tinate continuance in their error should alwayes be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and never censured, especially if it be such an error as <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth divisions and offences, Rom.</hi> 16. 17. for then such should be avoided, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> in that same place. 3. It followeth not that we are to beleeve no <hi>superstructures</hi> or <hi>non-fundamentals,</hi> but with a reserve: it is observable that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh here of those who beleeve errors and doctrines contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine; Now consider then the force of the argument, those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve errors contrary to <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, have no certainty of faith, that what they beleeve is true, and therefore must beleeve with a reserve, leaving roome to new light; therefore those who beleeve any true superstructures and any <hi>non-fundamentals,</hi> have also no certainty of faith, but must beleeve with a reserve, that when light shall appeare, they shall beleeve the contradicent of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:49702:356"/>
what they now beleeve, there is no force in this connexion. It is just like the question betwixt us and the Papists, <hi>whether a man can be certaine with any divine and infallible certainty that he is in the state of grace and salvation. Papists</hi> say hypocrites beleeve that they are in the state of grace, and yet they have no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, <hi>Ergo,</hi> (say they) the regenerate beleeving that they are in the state of grace, can have no certainty. This is a very ill consequence, for a sleeping man is not certaine whether he be dreaming or waking. <hi>Ergo,</hi> a waking man knoweth not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be waking, or not. So a distracted man hath no certainty that he is as wise <hi>as seven men who can render a reason;</hi> therefore a man sober in his wits knoweth not that he is in his sober wits: these be poore and loose consequences. It is true, when we beleeve some alterable circumstances of some things rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, then in doctrine and discipline, which are disputable, and to us both sides have great probability, we have not certainty of faith, and possible here in our opinions learned and holy men; yea and whole <hi>Churches</hi> may looke beside their booke, and be deceived; and these we take not to be the subject of a sworne confession of faith, and here we grant a <hi>[non liquet]</hi> on both sides, and doe allow some graine weights of reserve to persons and <hi>Churches,</hi> to retract in those things: but hence it is badly concluded that we beleeve these <hi>non-fundamentals</hi> of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, for which we have certainty of evidence from Gods Word, with a reserve, and with a loosnesse of assent and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to beleeve the contrary to morrow; for so the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should militate against the certainty of faith in some fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals: for a person, yea any particular Church may erre in denying the resurrection of the dead, as some did in the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and Christs Disciples, though true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, doubted of his rising from the dead, <hi>John</hi> 20. 9. <hi>Peter</hi> and the disciples doubted of Christ dying for the losed world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 21, 22. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 25, 26. and because any true beleever may fall in that temptation and weaknesse, as to deny all the articles of faith, taken divisively, for they may deny this or this article fundamentall, (though I doe not thinke a regenerated person can deny the whole systeme and body of fundamentals col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively) it shall follow by this argument that regenerated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:49702:356"/>
and particular Churches are to beleeve some fundamentals with a reserve, and keeping roome for light to beleeve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and so if this argument be good, wee have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of faith in beleeving any one fundamentall article its alone. Nor can <hi>Nathan</hi> or <hi>Samuel</hi> have certainty of faith in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving their owne prophecies flowing from the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the Spirit; but they are to beleeve them with a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to receive the faith of the contradicent prophecies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Nathan</hi> had no certainty of faith in commanding <hi>David</hi> to build the Temple; and <hi>Samuel</hi> had as little certainty in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing <hi>Eliah</hi> to be the Lords annoynted.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Another doubt against this is, <hi>That if any, out of weaknesse and meere tendernesse of conscience, deny some superstructures, which are indeed scripturall truths, they are not to be counted hereticks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause out of weaknesse, not out of obstinacy they erre, nor to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured with excommunication or censures of Church or Magistrate, and therefore in these we are to beleeve truths, with a reserve, and to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the contrary minded, if they agree with us in fundamentals.</hi>

                     <p>Hence our first conclusion. The Christian Magistrate as a Christian is a member of the Church, but as a Magistrate he is not formally a member or part of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because he is neither a Pastor, Doctor, Elder, nor Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, as is cleare to any, for these offices were compleate in the Church without the Magistrate, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 11. else Christ ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to heaven should have given Kings, for the edifying of his body; Neither is hee as a Magistrate a part of the company of beleevers. 1. Because then all Magistrates as Magistrates should bee professors of the faith, which is knowne to bee false. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Magistrate, as such, is the head of an externall politick civill societie, not of Christs body.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Magistrate as a Magistrate wanteth such things as es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially constituteth a member of the Church, as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate onely hee hath neither baptisme, profession, nor faith, because then heathen Magistrates should not bee Magistrates, the contrary whereof the Word of God saith, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in Gods name commanded to obey the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> commanded to pray for Kings and heathen Magistrates, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. Hence let us have leave to deny these, (Hee who is the Churches nurs-father, is the Churches father, and a part of the family.) 2. (Whose office it is to cause all in the visible Church to professe the truth, obey God, and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, hee is a member of the Church.) 3. (Hee who is a keeper and preserver of Law and Gospell by his office, hee is by his office a member of the <hi>Church.)</hi> For the first: hee is a father metaphorically, and doth by an externall coactive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and by the sword nourish the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore is not the Church, nor a part of the Church, <hi>ex officio,</hi> by his office, as the nurs-father is not the child, nor a part of the child, whereof hee is nurse-father; and this, and both the other two are to bee denyed, because the Magistrate doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nurse the Church, nor cause the Church doe their dutie, nor desend the Law and Gospell by any power that is intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally <hi>Church-power,</hi> but by the sword, and coactive power, which in no sort belongeth to Christs kingdome as a part

                     <p n="5">5. If the Magistrate be a chiefe member of the Church, as a Magistrate with mixt power to make Church-Lawes, then is the Church not perfect in its beeing, and operations, to obtaine the end convenient to the Church as the Church, so long as it wanteth the Magistrate, because it should bee made

defective, and not able to exercise all its operations for the edification of Christs body, and gathering of the Saints, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. without this principall member, especially seeing the Magistrate is alleadged to bee a member, or integrall part of the Church, such as the head or eyes, otherwise without this, or that professor, a Church may be perfect, as an army may be perfect, without this or that common Souldier, but wanting a Leader it should not bee perfect. But so it is that the Church is and was perfect in its being, and operations, without the civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate; the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> where the Magistrate was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and a Pagan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. <hi>is yet a Church sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to bee Saints,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>graced, v.</hi> 4. <hi>inriched by Christ in all utterance and knowledge, v.</hi> 5. <hi>comming behind in no gift, v.</hi> 7. with power of excommunication which attaineth its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end, <hi>the saving of the spirit in the day of the Lord Jesus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>A perfect body of Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>able to edifie the whole body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 12. 25, 26, 27. <hi>having power of the seales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20, 21, 22, 23.

                     <p n="6">6. If the King bee a mixt person indued with Church pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make canons, and because annointed with holy oyle, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of jurisdiction ecclesiasticall, as some say, then as hee is a King by birth, so is hee also borne with an ecclesiasticall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to exercise spirituall jurisdiction: but <hi>Paul</hi> saith, all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall power that hee had, was given of God, not borne with him; <hi>hee was made,</hi> not borne <hi>a Minister, Col.</hi> 2. 25. the power to edifie was given him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
                     <p>2. Conclusion. Wee cannot by the Word of God acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that difference, betwixt the Magistrate, and the Christian Magistrate, that the Magistrat as a Magistrate hath a kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to rule over men as men, and the Christian Magistrate hath a Christian kingly power to rule over men as they are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Because by one and the same kingly power the King ruleth over men as men, and men as Christian men, commanding by the sword and kingly power that Pastors preach sound doctrin,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49702:364"/>
administrate the Sacraments aright, that all the Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christ, and abstaine from blasphemy, and Idolatry. <hi>Hee is the minister of God for good, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee is the Minister of God for all good, for a Christian good, and is a King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling to a Christian good: Also though the King were not a Christian magistrate, yet hath hee a Kingly power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand men as Christians, and it is by accident, that hee cannot in that state actually command Christian duties, and service to Christ, because hee will not, and cannot command these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remaining ignorant of Christ, even as a King ignorant of necessary civill duties cannot command them, not because hee wanteth kingly power to command these civill things, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably hee is a Judge in all civill things, but because hee hath not knowledge of them. 3. Christianitie maketh him not a King over Christians as Christians, for then hee could not bee their King, and were not a King over Christians, so long as hee wanteth Christianitie, which is false, for the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans acknowledged heathen <hi>Emperours</hi> as their <hi>Kings;</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God were to obey <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Darius, Cyrus,</hi> and other <hi>beathen Kings. Paul</hi> will have obedience and subjection due to every power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. 18. 4. It maketh way to the popish dethroning of Kings when they turne hereticks, and leave off to bee members of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Church,</hi> which wee abhorre. 5. A King is <hi>parens patriae,</hi> the father of the Commonwealth. Now Christianitie addeth no new fatherly power to a father over his children, for a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then father is as essentially a father, as a Christian Father, and a heathen commander in warre, a heathen husband, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then master, a heathen doctor or teacher, are all as essentially commanders, husbands, &amp;c. in relation to their soul diers, wives, servants, and schollers, as are the Christian commander, the Christian husband, the Christian master, and Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, in relation to Christian souldiers, Christian wives, &amp;c. and no man can say that Christianitie giveth a new husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to the husband, once a heathen, over his wife, that hee had not before.</p>
                     <p>3. Conclusion. The King is not debarred as King from the inspection, oversight, and care of ecclesiasticall affaires, but the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:49702:365"/>
end of the Kingly power, is not onely externall peace, but also godlinesse, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. And in the intrinsecall end of magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie as magistracie, is not onely naturall happinesse, and a quiet of life; as <note n="a" place="margin">

If the meaning be, that the King as King, that is rightly exercisng the office of a King, is subordinate to no Church power, that is, he cannot be justly and deservedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked by Pastors, that is most true, but nothing to any purpose; for so the Pastor as a Pastor, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> as he doth truly and in the name of the Lord exercise the propheticall office, cannot be deservedly censured, nor punished either by the <hi>Church-synodrie,</hi> or the King and Princes of the Land: but thus way all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, an I any one single beleever, doing his duty, should be as immediate, and independent, and highest next on earth to Christ as the King, and his three Estates of the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Parliament are in civill matters, and as an Occumenick Councell, or in our brethrens meaning, independent Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is against reason. But if the meaning be, the acts of a King as aberring from justice, not as a King, but as a fraile man, may be censured and rebuked deservedly by Pastors in a Church way; this way also, the Pastor as a Pastor is not subject to the Church, but onely as a fraile man, and so nothing is said to the purpose in this more then the in the former. But if the meaning
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:49702:368"/>
be thirdly, that which onely maketh good sense, that the acts of the King abstracted from good or bad, or as kingly, or not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, nor acts of justice or injustice, more then the acts of Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of sailing, of making of Shooes, and thus the King is not subject to the Church power, nor is his intrinsecall end as King, justice, and godlinesse and preservation of Religion, the man speaketh non-sense, and wonders; for the King as a King is a morall agent, and not infallible in his Lawes or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. <hi>Ergo,</hi> as a King he is under the Scepter of the King of Saints in discipline, and in the keyes of the Kingdome of God, and so the kingly office is subordinate to the power of Christ in his Ministers and <hi>Church discipline,</hi> and by that same reason, the power and offices of Ministers as they are morall agents and obnoxious to sinne, to false doctrine, blasphemy, idolatry, idlenesse and sleepinesse in feeding the flock, are under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active power of the supreme Governour; and he doth as King use the sword against them: hence it is cleare that both the kingly power is subordinate to <hi>Church-power,</hi> and that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination is mutuall, that also the <hi>Church-power</hi> is subordinate to the kingly power, and that both also in their kind are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme; the kingly power is the highest and most supreme, and under no higher coactive power: I meane the <hi>kingly</hi> as <hi>kingly</hi> conjoyned with the collaterall power of Parliaments, where the Realme is so governed, and the <hi>Church-power</hi> is the highest in the kind of Ecclesiasticall power. <note n="t" place="margin">

And it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that the King as King can doc nothing about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of life eternall, for as a King he hath a perfect right, and kingly power to doe, and being a Christian he actually exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that power, as a Nurse-father of the Church, to see that the <hi>Kings daughter</hi> be fed with wholsome milke, to see that the first and second Table be kept, and that men <hi>serve Christ,</hi> and have the seales of the Covenant in purity, under the paine of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the weight of his royall sword; and I wonder that this should be called nothing for the obtaining of eternall happines, seeing it is a way to eternall happinesse to be thus fed under a <hi>Christian King</hi> as a <hi>King.</hi> But (say they) it is Pelagianism <hi>that the Kings power compelling the Nurses to let out their breasts to the Kings daughter, that she may sucke the sincere milke of the Word, should be a meane of eternall happinesse.</hi> I answer, and it is also <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> to say, that the planting of <hi>Paul,</hi> and watering of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49702:369"/>
the ministeriall power and paines of Ministers, without the grace of God, can produce or effectuate supernaturall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and it is false that the kingly power of it self doth confer nothing whereby the spirituall and ecclesiasticall power <hi>hath intrinsecally and formally dignity, and power, and its proper effect;</hi> for it is true, the kingly power maketh not the ecclesiasticall power, but it setteth it on worke, in a coactive way, <hi>for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of Christs body,</hi> and doth causatively edifie. Lastly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>it is said the King as King is over the civill body and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, which is a body different in nature from the Christian bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Church;</hi> I say, that is false, for the King as King ruleth over men, as men, and also as Christian men, causing them to keepe both the Tables of Law. But 3. (say they) <hi>the office of a King is not a meane sanctified of God for a supernaturall good, because it is amongst the Gentiles.</hi> I answer, this is no consequence, for that office of it selfe is sanctified and ordained of God, for keeping of both Tables of the Law, and that it worketh not this, in its owne kind, is not from the nature of the kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but from the sinfull disposition of the Gentiles; so the Word is the savour of death to some, through their default. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> it is not a meane sanctified for that end; it followeth not. But 4. <hi>the office of the King of it selfe and its owne power doth not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne or subdue the inward man, for immediately and of its owne power it cannot bind the conscience, but onely by the interveening medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Word of God.</hi> Ergo, <hi>of it selfe it intendeth not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a supernaturall and eternall good.</hi> Answ. Nor can the office of a Minister of it selfe, and in its owne power, produce a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall good, but onely by the authority of the Word, <hi>Esa.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. 10. is it therefore no office sanctified for a supernaturall end? But 5. they reason, <hi>a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall good, and life eternall, are effects flowing from the mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry office of Christ, bestowed upon the Church: but the kingly power floweth not from the Mediator Christ, but from God as Creator, who bestoweth lawfull Kings and Magistrates upon many Nations, who know nothing of a Saviour.</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. No Ecclesiasticall power, or acts formally Ecclesiasticall, are competent to one who is not an Ecclesiasticall person, or not a member of the Church, but a civill person; but a power to define in Synods, and the exercise of acts Ecclesiasticall and matters Ecclesiasticall, are due to Ecclesiasticall persons, and to the Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not competent to the civill Judge. The proposition is evident by differences betwixt Ecclesiasticall persons and civill Magistrates, which might be more accurately set downe by others, then by me. But they differ, 1. that the Churches power is spirituall, the Magistrates causatively, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively or objectively spirituall, but not intrinsecally and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:49702:371"/>
spirituall, because he may command by the power of the sword spirituall acts of preaching, administrating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments purely, of defining necessary truths in Synods, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the contrary, but he cannot formally himselfe exercise these acts. 2. The Church-men are members of the Church, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate as such is a politick Father and Tutor of the Church, but not formally, as he is such a member of the Church. 3. The power of the Magistrate is carnall, and corporall, and coactive upon the bodies; for which cause, <hi>Tylenus, Daneus</hi> and others say, the externall man is the object of his power, the power of the Church is spirituall, not carnall, not coactive, not bounded upon the body; the Church hath neither power of heading or hanging, but onely they may use the sword of the Spirit, exhortations, rebukes, censures, excommunication. 4. Edification to be procured by the Word and Sacraments and Church-censures, is the end of Church-power, but edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be procured by the sword, is the end of the civill Magistrate. 5. The Magistrate judgeth not what is true and false to be beleeved simply, as teaching, instructing, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conscience, but onely what is true and false to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved or professed in relation to his sword and bodily punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or civill rewards. 6. The Magistrates judgement is king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, supreame, peremptory, and highest on earth, from which we are to provoke in no sort, except in appealing to God; the Churches judgement is ministeriall, conditionall, limited by the Word of God. 7. The Magistrates power is over all, Heathen and Christian, over men as men, and over men as Christians, and agreeth to Heathen and Christian Magistrates alike; the Church power agreeth onely to members of the Church, and is onely over members of the Church as they are such. 8. What ever causes the Magistrate handleth, as hurtfull to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and contrary to the Law of God, in a politicke and civill way, these same the Churches handleth as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote edification; or if they be sinnes, the Church cognosceth of them, <hi>sub ratique scandali,</hi> as they are Church scandals. 9. The civill power is above the Church-men as they are Church-men, and members of a Christian Common-wealth, and the Church power is above the Magistrate as he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

                        <hi>Hence our fifth Conclusion:</hi> when there is an equall rupture in the body, nothing extraordinary would be attempted, if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wayes can be had: if <hi>Saul</hi> the ordinary Magistrate had at Gods Commandement killed <hi>Hagag, Samuel</hi> the Prophet should not have drawne his Sword, and therefore in this case the Magistrate would first seeke helpe from other Churches, as that <note n="r" place="margin">

But if that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently had, as in a nationall Church it may fall out, then the Magistrate as a preserver of peace and truth, may command the sincerer part to conveene in a Synod, and doe their duty, as the good Kings of the people of God did: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. <hi>Asa</hi> gathered together a people <hi>who entered in Covenant to seeke the Lord God with all their heart,</hi> and layed an obligation of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to death on the rest, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. and <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 4. he layed charge on <hi>Hilkiah the High Priest,</hi> and the Priests of the second order, whom he knew to be better affected to the worke, to bring out the Vessels made for <hi>Baal;</hi> which proveth that the King should put the sincerest to doe that, which in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belongeth to the whole, in which case of the erring of the most part of the Church, the Prince indirectly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the erring part of the Synod, because it is his place to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid

and to punish with the sword, the transgressors of <hi>Gods Law.</hi> But because his power is accumulative, not privative, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pretence hee hath not power to hinder the sincerer part to meet and determine according to the Word of <hi>God.</hi>

                        <p>6. Conclusion. In the case of the prevailing of the corrupt part of the <hi>Church,</hi> or in the fourth case of the aberration of the <hi>Church</hi> in one particular, the <hi>King</hi> hath a regall power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Canonists, if they shall decree in their Synod Popery, and hereticall doctrine, and so give to the Bride of <hi>Christ</hi> noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and deadly milke; the Prince as nursefather may punish the Canonists. 1.

                     <p>Now that the Prince as a solitary cause, his alone defineth <hi>Church matters</hi> and without the <hi>Church,</hi> and that by his ordinary <hi>Kingly</hi> power, wanteth all warrant of the Word of God. 2.

God hath here a sort of proprietie of houses and goods as men have. Places as sacred abused are subject to regall power, hee may
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:49702:383"/>
inhibit conventions of hereticks. 2. The Apostles might preach in the Temple, though civill authoritie forbid them. 3. Kings are as much Lords of places as sacred and publick, as they have a dominion of civill places, in respect the King may be coactive power hinder that false and hereticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine bee preached, either in publick, or private places, for this hee ought to doe as a preserver of both tables and a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the Sword for the good of Religion; and if they may command pure doctrine to bee preached, and sound discipline to be exercised, they may command the same to bee done in publick places.</p>

As for taking away the power of order, it is a doubt to formalists, if the Church can doe that at all, seeing they hold Sacraments administred by ministers justly deprived to bee valid; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they must acknowledge an indeleble character in Pastors, which neither King nor Church can take away.

                           <hi>they all know well that the King hath not power to deprive men from the exercise of the holy ministery, in ether forraine Kingdomes.</hi> For the third way of deprivation, it hath a double meaning also. 1. If the meaning bee, that as the King by a regall and coactive power may take away all honours, either civill or ecclesiasticall, as hee giveth all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, then this way of depriving Ministers cannot bee given to the King, for the King may give and take away civill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, for reasonable causes, according to the Lawes.

To give the true foundation and reall ground of a Church honour, that is, gifts and gracious abilities for

That the King who may be borne an heire to an earthly Kingdome, is also borne and by nature a mixt person, and halfe a Minister of the Gospell, is against Gods word; ministers in whole, or in part, are made so of God, not so borne by nature: in <hi>Aaron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I answer: by that reason, if the King should preach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrate the Sacraments, these actions should not be called ecclesiasticall actions, and <hi>Uzzah's</hi> touching the <hi>Arke,</hi> should not be called an action by office incumbent to the <hi>Levites</hi> only; and it might be said, the person being civill, the actions are civill.

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:49702:385"/>
as a part and member of the Church, but this giveth no nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice to the Magistrate in election, but ordination is not done by all the multitude, it is a worke of authority done onely by the Church-officers. 4. The coactive and civill degradation, must have also correspondent thereunto a coactive and civill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Pastors. Now I ask what is a coactive ordination.

I deny it to follow, for both royall power and Church power concurre for the producing of one and the same end, to wit, edification and obedience to both Tables of the Law, but after different wayes, carnall and spirituall. <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> I  thinke it most considerable that though the Prince may by a coactive way, command that same which a Church Synod may command in an ecclesiasticall way, yet differeth these same powers in their formall objects, because the King commandeth that which is good, religious, decent in Gods worship as a thing already taught and determined judicially, either expressely in Gods Word, or then by a pastorall or Synodicall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that not by way of teaching, informing the mind, exponing the Scripture, or by pastorall dealing with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, as oblieging to a Church Liturgie, and ceremonies, as one who intendeth formall edification and faith, repentance, and obedience to God; but the King commands that which is good and <hi>extra,</hi> as it is already taught, and expounded, and as it is an imperated act of externall worship, or mercy and justice done by a coactive power.</p>
                     <p>Hence the Magistrates power is not to edifie formally, but to procure that edification may bee. 2. The Magistrates power is Lordly, the Churches power is onely ministeriall. 3. The Magistrates power may bee in one, to wit, in the King, the Churches power of the keyes is in the Church. 4.

                     <p>I answer: the cause that is meerely ecclesiasticall, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall act of preaching and ecclesiasticall determining of truth in Pulpits, and the determining the truth in <hi>Church assemblies,</hi> in an ecclesiasticall way in Synods, and the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a scandalous person, are immediatly subject to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> speaking in his owne perfect Testament: and these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lie not at the feet of Princes to bee determined by them, as Kings, but in a constitute <hi>Church</hi> they are to bee determined by the ordinary Church assemblies, and in this place there is no appeale from the Presbytery to a King; but it followeth not, that there can bee no appellation from a Presbytery to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, or to a nationall assembly; 1. Because though every Presbytery bee the tribunall seate of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet it is but a part of the tribunall seat of <hi>Christ,</hi> and such a part as may easily erre, and therefore appellation may bee made from the weaker, and the part more inclined to erre, to the stronger and maniest, or the whole, who may more hardlier erre: and that is not denied by this author, who dare not deny, but they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from a Bishop who doth, and may misleade soules, and emptie purses, to a Metropolitan, and an Archbishop, who is as dexterous and happy in emptying of poore mens purses, and destroying soules, if not large better, as a pettie <hi>Lord Prelate,</hi> from whom hee appealed; yet is the one Lord Prelate the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of <hi>Christ,</hi> as well as the other, by formalists bookes. And, 2. If the cause bee proper to the Presbytery, they have just right to judge it, as well as the provinciall assembly hath, but possibly not such knowledge, and if the partie complaine that hee is wronged, or may bee wronged, hee may well appeale to a larger part of Christs tribunall, lesse obnoxious to erring, which is no wrong done to the Presbyterie.

                  <p>I answer; the servant was a part of his masters patrimony, but a part thereof for sinne, not as his Oxe or his Asse, is a part of his patrimony; therefore by the Law of nature, whereby the weaker imploreth helpe of the stronger, as the Lambe seeketh helpe from the mother, and the young Eagle from the old, the slave might well have libertie to choose a Patron, and this is a ground that the Magistrate the <hi>Churches nurs-father</hi> by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice should plead the Churches cause, as her Patron, and every one in power is to defend the Church in her liberties and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony; and therefore in the Apostles time, when holinesse and the power of Religion did flourish, and was in court, there was not need of any positive, civill or Church Law, for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to the Church, every beleever in power is oblieged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Church: but when men became Vulturs and ravenous birds to plucke from the Church what was given them, the Councell of <hi>Millian</hi>

The Church may dispose and give power to one man to doe certaine actions in the Churches name, but yet so as the Church retaineth power to regulate that her delegate, or commissioner in these acts, and to correct him, in case of aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but the Church hath no power over the Patron as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to limit him in the exercise of his power, for the right of Patronage is his by birth, he may sel it for mony to another; to a Papist, to an excommunicate person, to a Jew, or an enemy of the Church, as hee may sell his lands and houses, and hath a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill right thereunto under his Majesties great Seale; therefore the patron doth here, <hi>proprio suo jure,</hi> by his owne proper right, present and give title and Law to the Church benesice, and doth not present in name of Church, or as having from the Church a power.</p>
