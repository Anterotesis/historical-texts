            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>The Humble Petition of</hi> Ezekiel Goddard <hi>of</hi> Kings Lynn, <hi>in the County of</hi> Norfolk; <hi>in behalf of many Millions now Employed in the</hi> Wollen Manufacture <hi>of this Kingdom.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HUmbly Sheweth, Whereas the Wollen-Manufacture is exceedingly decayed in ſo great meaſure, that many Thouſands have not Imployments at all wherewith to buy Bread, and without doubt it is occaſioned by the Exportation of Wool, Woolfells and Yarn made of Wool; whereby the Subjects of other Nations, are employed in the Manufacturing the Wool of this Kingdom, and both employ their own People, and enrich their Subjects, and impoveriſh this ſometimes flouriſhing Nation of <hi>England</hi> and the Subjects thereof; which if not very ſpeedily prevented, the Richer Sort will be made incapable to maintain the Poor; and your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner having a long Time been ſenſible of the ſame, he Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceives, that he hath found out a way how to prevent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102855:2"/>
ſo great a Miſchief, which may be fully eſſectual to prevent it; and therefore begs the Pardon of this High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for preſuming to diſcover his Sentiments therein, which are as followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That it might be Enacted,</hi> That all Owners of Sheep within this Kingdom, may be compelled by themſelves or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to give an Oath before the Miniſter or Church war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the Pariſh where they dwell, of the Quantity of the Weight of <hi>Wool</hi> that ſhall be ſhorn from off their Sheep every Enſuing Year, within Six Days after after their Sheep are ſhorn; and that ſuch Oath ſhall be by the Miniſter and Church-wardens Regiſtered in a Book, to be bought at the Charge of the ſaid Pariſhes under a Penalty that ſhall be thought fit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That it might be Enacted,</hi> That the Owners of the Wool, ſhall not ſell any part of their Wool to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, but ſuch as ſhall make Oath before the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the ſaid Pariſh, that they will convert, or cauſe the ſame Wool to be converted into Yarn or Cloth, or Stuffs, Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Hatts, and the ſaid Oaths to be Regiſtred in the ſaid Books, together with the Name of the Buyer and Place of his Abode, under ſuch Penalty as ſhall be thought fit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That it might be Enacted,</hi> That no Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall buy and ſell any Wool whatſoever (except only, that all Fell mongers may have Liberty to ſell ſuch Wool, as they pull from off the Skins that they ſhall buy, and all Wool-combers may have Liberty to ſell all ſuch ſhort Wool as is taken out of the Fleeces after they are broken, which is not fit for Combing, and alſo all their Noyls) provided that they ſhall not ſell any ſuch Skin Wool, Short Wool or Noyls, but to ſuch as ſhall make Oath that they will convert, or cauſe the ſame to be converted into Yarn, Cloth, Stuffs, or Stockings, or Hatts, and that all Wool-Staplers ſhall within ſix Weeks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after the publiſhing the Act, ſell and deliver all ſuch Wool as ſhall be in the Hands of themſelves, or Others for their Uſe, to ſuch Perſons as ſhall make Oath to convert the ſame as aforeſaid, under the Penalty of forfeiting the ſame; and that no Wool-Stapler
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102855:2"/>
or Wool-Jobber, ſhall buy or ſell any Wool for the future, under the penalty of forfeiting the ſame.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That it might be Enacted,</hi> That no Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever under any preterce whatſoever, ſhall put or cauſe to be put aboard any Ship or Veſſel, Boat, Barge or other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of what Denomination ſoever, any Wool, Woolfells or Yarn made of Wool, under the penalty of forfeiting the fame.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>That it might be Enacted,</hi> That no Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, under any pretence whatſoever, ſhall take aboard, or ſuffer to be taken aboard any ſuch Ship or Veſſel whatſoever, any Wool, Woolfells or Yarn made of Wool; under the penalty of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Ship or Veſſel whatſoever, together with all the Rigging, Tackle, Furniture, Utenſils and Apparel whatſoever, to the ſaid Ship belonging.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>That it might be Enacted,</hi> That all Wool, Woolfells or Yarn made of Wool; that ſhall be found in any part of this Kingdom to be Screw packed or Preſs packed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on Land or on Ship-board, ſhall be forfeited, and ſhall be to be the Uſe of Him, Her or Them that ſhall firſt diſcover or ſeize the ſame.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>That it may be Enacted,</hi> That it ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for any Perſon or Perſons, that ſhall be the firſt that ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or ſeize of any Wool, Woolfells, or Yarn made of Wool; ſo taken on board, or put on board, or being on board of any ſuch Ship, or any Boat, or other Veſſel whatſoever; ſhall have all the ſaid Wool, Woolfells, or Yarn made of Wool, to his, her, or their Uſe or Uſes, and to no other Uſe or Uſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, and alſo ſhall have and enjoy the ſaid Ship, Hoy or Veſſel of what Denomination ſoever to his, her and their own Uſe or Uſes, together with the Furniture of the ſame, and to no other Uſe whatſoever, not with ſtanding any thing whatſoever to the contrary; together with ſuch further Benevolence as ſhall be thought fit for ſo good Service done to the Nation, which Benevolence (if any ſhall be thought fit to be given) may be Levied upon the County, where ſuch Wool, Wool-fells,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102855:3"/>
or Yarn made of Wool, ſhall be laid on board as aforeſaid. Provided, That all ſuch Wool as ſhall be imported into this Kingdom from <hi>Scotland, Ireland,</hi> or any other Forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; ſhall not be intended to be within the Compaſs or Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Act.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And that whereas many Perſons that get their Living by the Wollen Manufacture, live remote from ſuch places where ſuch Wool may be had at the beſt Advantage; and have not Horſes to fetch ſuch Wool as will be needful from the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Wool, <hi>That it may be Enacted,</hi> That all Cities and Corporations, and Market-Towns within this Kingdom, ſhall find and provide ſufficient Store-houſes or Chambers, meet and convenient, ceiled about with Boards and plaunchred with Boards, and kept in good repair with all needful Reparations, to keep Wool as much as may be from taking any Damage, and that it ſhall be Lawful for all Perſons whatſoever, that will bring or ſend any Wool, Woolfells, or Yarn made of VVool, to ſuch City, Corporation or Market Town, to lodge the ſame in the ſaid Store houſe or Chambers, in order to ſell and diſpoſe of the ſame to ſuch Perſons as ſhall make Oath as aforeſaid; that they will convert, or cauſe the ſaid Wool to be converted into Yarn, or Cloth, or Stuffs, or Stockings, or Hats, and the ſame Oath to be Regiſtred in a Book, to be provided at the Coſt and Charge of the ſaid City, Corporation, or Market<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Town, and Locks and Keys to ſecure the ſaid Wool; and every City, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration or Market<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Town where ſuch Store houſe ſhall be kept, ſhall make Choice of a fit Perſon to be Key-keeper, and Orderer of the ſaid Store-houſes or Store chambers, for which ſaid Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to be Choſen the <hi>Munday</hi> in every <hi>Eaſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Week,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of every City, Corporation, or Market-Town, ſhall be liable to make ample Satisfaction to the Owner of any Wool, that may at any time happen to be loſt, ſtolen or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſeled out of the ſaid Store-houſes; and that it ſhall be Lawful for the ſaid Store keeper to ask, demand or receive of all the Owners of Wool, Lodged or Laid into any ſuch Store-houſe or Chamber, two Pence at the Time of any parcel ſo Lodged, whether ſmall or great parcel and no more, and four Pence for every Affidavit made at the Sale and Delivery of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102855:3"/>
every parcel for the Perſon that keeps the Regiſter Books, and Six pence for every pack lying any time not exceeding a Year, towards providing ſuch Store-houſes, and paying for Repairs and Six-pence for every pack towards the Maintainance of the Store-keeper, which ſhall by himſelf or ſome other by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, be ready to lock and unlock the ſaid Storehouſes or Chambers, at the Requeſt of the Owners of the Wool or their Servants, and ſhall receive the ſame Monies not exceeding Eighteen Pence at the moſt for every pack.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. <hi>That it may be Enacted,</hi> That any Perſon that ſhall diſcover or ſeize of any Wool, Woolfells, or Yarn made of Wool, by Virtue of this Act; may for the better making of it appear, that he, ſhe or they were the firſt Diſcoverers of the ſame, they ſhall (if they pleaſe) repair to the Miniſter or Church-wardens of the Pariſh, where ſuch Diſcovery ſhall be made; or the Miniſter and Church-wardens of any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and there make Oath of ſuch Diſcoveries, which Oath ſhall be recorded in the Books before mentioned, with the Name of the Diſcoverer, and the Year, Month, Day and Hour when ſuch Oath was made.</p>
            <p>And that if any Act be made to this Effect, that it may be made as ſoon as may with Conveniency be, and that it may be read in all Places of Publick Worſhip, and proclaimed in all Markets, that due Notice may be taken and due Obedience given to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Alſo I Humbly beg Pardon for my Boldneſs, in giving my Reaſon for the abſolute Neceſſity of making an Act to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may prevent the Owners of Sheep from Tranſporting their own Wool, by being liable to give an Account to whom they ſell it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If no Perſon may be ſuffered to buy and ſell Wool, then it will hinder all Engroſſers of Wool from Tranſporting any Wool; and will alſo be of great Advantage to the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturers, who are forced to buy of the Engroſſer at a dearer Rate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102855:4"/>
by Four or Five Shillings a Tod, than the Engroſſer of the Wool pay'd for it to the Owner of the Sheep; and Exporters of Wool are worſe than Engroſſers of Corn.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My Reaſons for prohibiting all Wool from being Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born are, becauſe it is an eaſie Matter to bribe a Cuſtom houſe Officer, to give up any Bond that ſhall be Entered for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landing of any Wool, that ſhall paſs Coaſtways by Coquet, or it is an Eaſie Matter to procure or counterfeit a falſe Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate that ſuch Wool is relanded, though it never was, and I beleive, that paſſing of Wool from Port to Port, hath been the great Cauſe of Tranſportation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. My Reaſon for the having all Wool that ſhall be ſcrew packt or preſs packt forfeited, is, becauſe Wool may be packt or ſcrewed into a Narrow Compaſs, either into Cask or into cloſe Package, and cannot be well diſcover'd from other Goods, and therefore ought to be forfeited wherever it ſhall be found.</p>
            <p n="5">5. My Reaſon why it ſhall be Lawful for any Perſon, that ſhall be the firſt Inſtrument of finding any Wool, that ſhall be water born, or preſſed, or ſcrewed, or ſhall be the firſt that ſhall diſcover or ſeize the ſame, may have all ſuch Wool, Woolfells, or Yarn made of Wool to his, her or their own Uſe, and the Ship or Boat, or Veſſel alſo; is, becauſe it will make all People diligent to find out ſuch Wool, and alſo it will certainly terrifie all Men from Tranſporting any; for none will be ſafe in Bribing, nor can any Man pretend to bride any, without being in all probability likely to be betrayed, either by Labourers or Boatmen, or the Maſter of the Ship, or of the Ship's Company, all which muſt be bribed, and greatly, otherwiſe they will diſcover.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All Laws heretofore made have not been Effectual, to hinder Tranſportation; tho' many Good Laws have been made mixed with Corporal Puniſhments, as Loſs of Life, Limbs, or Impriſonment, and have not been put in Execution, out of Tenderneſs to the Lives and Liberties of the Offenders.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102855:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
7. The Wool of this Nation being wholly manufactured in the Nation, is of ſo great Benefit to the Nation as cannot be well Expreſſed; and indeed is the only Support of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof, and if it be tranſported, will moſt certainly prove the Nation's Ruine and Deſtruction; and impoveriſh it in ſo great meaſure as cannot be Expreſſed, and may bring all into Diſorder and Confuſion, which God in Mercy prevent; and thoſe that do tranſport, or aid, or aſſiſt, or conceal ſuch Tranſportations, are the greateſt Enemies that the Nation ever had or can have (Traitors only excepted) for whereas other Criminals may be guilty of taking away the Lives of ſome few, theſe are guilty of Endeavouring to put Millions to the Moſt cruel Death that ever was invented; that is to ſay, to be ſtarved to Death for want of Food; and alſo if the chief Trade of the Nation be tranſmitted to the Neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then the Strength and Wealth of the Nation is loſt, and may in a ſhort Time, lay the Nation open to be ſubdued by thoſe that finding the Benefit of our Fleeces, may uſe all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile Means to obtain the Sheep, and the Lands that feed the Sheep; which Sheep and Lands are more Worth than all the Gold Duſt in the <hi>Weſt Indiei.</hi>

               <hi>Which God grant, this High Court of</hi> Parliament <hi>may by Making an Act to this Purpoſe prevent, and thereby the Whole Nation's Ruine may (by God's Bleſſing) be prevented,</hi> Amen, <hi>So be it,</hi>

            <p>MOreover, If an Act might paſs, to pardon all ſuch as have been guilty of Exporting Wool, Woolfells, or Yarn made of Wool; provided they will make Confeſſions, and acknowledge under their Hands and Seals, and name the Places of their Abode, and make full Confeſſion, what Quantities of the ſaid Goods, to the beſt of their Remembrance or Knowledge, they have been guilty of Exporting, and who were the Owners or Part-Owners of the ſame; in what Veſſels the ſame were ſent, and to what Places the ſame were ſent, and to whom the ſame were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and whether they were Owners of the ſame, or in Partner-ſhip with others; and what others by Name, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhipp'd the ſaid Goods by Commiſſion from others, and what they had for ſo doing; and by whom they were paid, and how the ſaid Goods were pack'd, whether any part thereof was combed Wool, and how much, and of whom it was bought; whether any part of it was paſſed as Coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by Coquet, and how much, and what Methods were taken to clear the Bonds; whether it was convey'd aboard by Boat, or by what means; at what Places it was ſhipp'd, and whether in the Day time, or in the Night; whether any part and how much, was ſent over under the Notion of other Goods, and what ſort of Goods, whether <hi>Tobacco, Sugars,</hi> or <hi>Wollen Cloths,</hi> or what other Goods, and what Money was received for Exportation of the ſaid Goods, which ſuch Wool was paſſed or ſhipp'd under Colour of; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Maſters of the Veſſels had any ſhare thereof, or were privy to the ſaid Exportations, and what Security was given for ſecuring the Veſſels, and what Fraights were uſually given for the ſame; and <hi>Finally,</hi> what Methods were taken, to prevent the Diſcovery of the ſaid Exportations, to the beſt of their Knowledge.</p>
            <p>And if any Perſon that hath been guilty of ſuch Practices, ſhall neglect to make and ſign ſuch Confeſſion, upon his,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102855:6"/>
her, or their Oaths, or ſhall neglect to deliver the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (Atteſted and Witneſſed before ſome Juſtice of the Peace) to the Lord Mayor of the City of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, and whoſe Clerk ſhall Record the ſame; and the Party guilty of ſuch Exportation ſhall deliver the ſaid Confeſſion as aforeſaid within Thirty Days after the publiſhing of the Act, and ſhall pay the Clerk for Recording the ſame; which Clerk ſhall keep a Catalogue of the Names of the Parties Confeſſing, and the place of their abode; in order that this High Court of Parliament may at their pleaſure have a ſight of the ſaid Confeſſions, and the names of them that are to be indemnified; and if any Perſon that ſhall be found guilty of ſuch Crime, and hath not made and delivered ſuch Confeſſion ſo as aforeſaid, then he, ſhe or they, ſhall upon due proof that they have been guilty, forfeit all their Goods and Chattels, Lands and Tenaments, and be baniſhed out of this Kingdom as Perſons not fit to live therein; one Moiety to him, her or them that ſhall make the ſame Matter appear upon the Oaths of two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes or more; and the Parties that ſhall be inſtrumental in diſcovering the ſame, ſhall receive the benefit of the Pardon; the other Moiety to be to the Poor of the Pariſhes where the Offenders live.</p>
            <p>And that a Clauſe may be made annex'd to the Act, to cauſe all Men above the Age of ſixteen Years (Noblemen and their Sons excepted) to take an Oath, that they will not Export, or ſend out of this Kingdom any Wool, or Woolfells, or Yarn made of Wool; nor will not directly or indirectly, aid or aſſiſt any ſo to do; and that they will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all ſuch, as ſhall (to their Knowledge) be any ways inſtrumental in ſo doing, and will to the beſt of their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hinder all ſuch Practices.</p>
            <p>And your Petitioner doubts not, but by making of Laws to the ſame Effect, as in this his Petition mentioned; that all Exportation of Wool will be hindred and great Sums of Money ſaved, which have been paid to the Exporters of Wool, under the Notion of Goods that receive back Money
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102855:6"/>
to the Owners when Exported; and that it will, to the great Admiration of this High Court of Parliament, bring to light many great Abuſes put upon the King and the whole Kingdom: And if any Objections ſhall be made againſt what is petitioned for; I hope, that the Anſwer to ſuch may be ſufficient, that never any Law was ever made, but ſome or other might object againſt it; but if it was made for the benefit of the <hi>Major</hi> Part of the Nation in General, as I am ſure, this will be to the benefits of Thouſands to the Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of one; then all Men will grant that it will be a good Law. And I think my Coſt and Charge, and great Labour well beſtowed; which otherwiſe I could ill have undergone, being weak in Body and of mean Eſtate,</p>
            <p>And to conclude, I queſtion not but thoſe that are the great Engroſſers of Wool, will be found to be the Cauſe why ſo much Wool is exported, and ought to be hindred from buying and ſelling of any Wool; and I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that without the hindrance of Wool from being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, the Nation will be ruined, and that ſuddenly.</p>
