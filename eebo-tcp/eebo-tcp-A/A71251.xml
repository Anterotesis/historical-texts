         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Right Honourable
RICHARD
LORD VICOVNT
PRESTON,
His Majestie's Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
in the Court

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAd I no other consideration
in the publishing of this
Discourse, than to make
an open acknowledgment of my duty
<pb facs="tcp:56982:3"/>
to your Lordship, (and not be silent
at a time when the Applauses of the
most indifferent Persons declare
their satisfaction at your continuance
of that character, which none can
better sustain, nor has any ever born
it with greater Honour and Fidelity,
than all men must confess your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to have done it) I should think
it sufficient to outweigh all those
Censures, which perhaps may pass,
with security enough, both upon me
and It.</p>
            <p>[It was not to be doubted, but
that a Prince so Wise to understand,
so Gracious to reward the services
of the meanest of his Subjects, would
have a particular regard to a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Loyalty great as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's;
and not so soon part with a
<pb facs="tcp:56982:3"/>
Minister, whom he knows to have been
such, as others promise they will be. It
is the Vanity of most men to speak
great things, it is your Lordship's
Honour that you do them: And I
may without danger of any censure,
but your own, truly say, That in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which affords, if any other, tryals
and opportunities to exercise the
highest abilities, you have exceeded
not only your own Promises, but even
our Hopes, and given us an Assurance
that there is nothing now remaining
that can equal the greatness of
your Mind.</p>
            <p>Permit me, my Lord, to render
this short testimony to your Vertues,
so far from flattery, that those who
know your Lordship, will confess it
to be hardly the truth; and if you
<pb facs="tcp:56982:4"/>
please pardon my presumption in this
address, I believe as unexpected to
your Lordship, as I can justly say it
was undesigned by me.]</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, it has been thought
fit to give your Lordship this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
that whilst you are rendring
your Obedience to his Majestie's
Commands in <hi>England,</hi> we have not
been less careful, both to shew our
selves, and to exhort others to be as
firm to their Loyalty here: and since
we could not have the Honour of
your presence to compleat the utmost
Solemnity of this Day amongst us, by
this Address at least to joyn you in
our service, and return our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
for that Opportunity we
have had under your protection, <hi>to
remember the captivity of</hi> Zion <hi>in
a strange Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56982:4"/>
The only thing that might justly
have deterr'd me from this attempt,
was the meanness of the performance,
did I not consider that Saints and
Martyrs (like that God before whom
they stand) are not so much taken
with the Elegant composures of their
Votaries, as with their Piety and
Sincerity; and accept him who brings
an honest heart, rather than an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
Discourse to their Memories.</p>
            <p>And this, my Lord, were the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
it self silent, yet the Honour I
have to belong to your Lordship, would
undoubtedly confirm to as many as
have ever known your character.
May your Lordship long have the
happiness to continue your services
to his Sacred Majesty and the Royal
Family, and encrease every day those
<pb facs="tcp:56982:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
applauses that are so justly paid to
your great Vertues; whilst I still
endeavour by all the duties of my
employ, more and more to deserve
that Title I most desire, of being,
with all humble duty and respect,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>

               <q>Blow the Trumpet in Zion, sanctifie a Fast,
call a solemn Assembly. Gather the People:
sanctifie the Congregation: assemble the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
gather the Children, and those that
suck the Breasts: let the Bridegroom go
forth of his Chamber, and the Bride out of
her Closet. Let the Priests, the Ministers of
the Lord, weep between the Porch and the
Altar, and let them say, Spare thy People, O
Lord, and give not thine Heritage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
that the Heathen should rule over
them: wherefore should they say among the
People, Where is their God?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SO contrary is the mournful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of this day, to those
Triumphs and rejoycings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
our Primitive Predecessors were
wont to celebrate the Memories of their
Martyrs, that either the Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
seems very much decayed in Us,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56982:6"/>
or something must be thought to have
been defective in that Saint, whose
death we thus Lament, instead of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
his Conflicts, and glorying in his
Victory.</p>
            <p>Indeed had we only to commemorate
the Merits of the Martyr, the Innocence
and Piety wherein he lived, and the
Constancy and Magnanimity with which
he died, these funeral Obsequies would
be very unbecoming the Solemnity of
out Remembrance: and we might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
it a Crime to let our Hymns and
our Praises fall any thing short of the
most celebrated Festivals of the Saints of
old; when both the Excellence of the
Cause, and the Resolution of the
Person, and the Barbarity of his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
so far exceeded the most of
theirs.</p>
            <p>And this Perhaps the Generations to
come may think themselves obliged to
do: But alass! the return of this day
brings with it another, and sadder Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56982:6"/>
to us; and when our
Tongues would speak the Glories of this
Martyr, our Consciences confound us
with horror to consider, that we our
selves were his Persecutors.</p>
            <p>Had the death he suffered been the
Sin of some other hand, had an Infidel
Nation risen up against him, or had the
Chance of War cut him off in our own,
we might have regretted the loss of so
Royal a defender, but should soon have
turned our Sorrow into Joy, and have
giving him a name Superiour to the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of those Hero's that Fabulous Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
can boast of. But that we who
were obliged by all the ties of God and
man to obey him, should destroy that
life, for which we ought not to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
any Hazard of our own; that we
who were certainly his Subjects, and
who pretend to be Christians too, should
violate all the rights of Majesty; tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
under foot all the Commands of
that Gospel, by which we are called;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56982:7"/>
and imbrue our hands in Royal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Bloud, after so barbarous a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that no Antiquity can afford a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel;
This raises those Clouds that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
so bright a day; and instead of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
at his Monument with Songs of
Eucharist for his Victory, calls us here,
<hi>between the Porch and the Altar,</hi> to confess
our own sins.</p>
            <p>Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not
thine Heritage to reproach; that the Heathen
should rule over them: wherefore should they
say among the People, Where <hi>is</hi> their
God?</p>
            <p>And here, would to God the Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Repentance might in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
answer the heinousness of our sin.
That out Piety this day, might as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
contribute to the appeasing, as the
Violence committed on it has too fatally
concurred to the kindling Gods anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Us. That as our Church, so far
from being involved in the Guilt, that
she partook in all his Sufferings, has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56982:7"/>
provided, by an annual return
of this day, to remember that sin, which
neither We, nor our Posterity, shall ever
be able sufficiently to lament; so may We
as sincerely observe, as she has piously
established the Fast; and speak at least
our detestation of the Sin, if we cannot
attone the greatness of the Guilt.</p>
            <p>It is not necessary that I should enter
on any curious Enquiry into the Occasion
of this Prophecy, to apply it to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
assembling at this time: that which
may be seen of it at the first View is
sufficient to approve my choice, That
the <hi>Jews</hi> by their sins had provoked God's
Anger against them, and had already felt
in great measure his Punishments too.
The Famine consumed them; the drought
burnt up their Ground; the remainder
of their increase the Worm and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillar
consumed. In a word, they were
brought down to the very Brink of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and had only remaining this
solemn manner of repentance, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56982:8"/>
his Anger, and to prevent their
ruin.</p>
            <p>I hope there is no one so little sensible
of those Evils, our own Nation has labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under, that I need enter on a Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
so fresh and so ungrateful. The
Wounds are scarce yet closed, which
our own hands have given us; and the
repose we even now enjoy, seems rather
an Interval lent us by Heaven to see if
we will yet repent, than any firm and
established Peace. Our fears have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
been awaked at new Attempts,
and we have had but too just Cause to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
if not <hi>Joel</hi>'s <hi>Famine of Bread;</hi> yet
what is infinitely worse, <hi>Amos</hi>'s <hi>Famine of
the Word among us:</hi> let us therefore as we
have transcribed the Example of these
<hi>Jews,</hi> both in our Sins and in our Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
so take now the advice of
the Prophet, as spoken to our selves; it
may be yet to redress and to secure
all.</p>
            <p>Blow the Trumpet in Sion: sanctifie a Fast,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56982:8"/>
Our Text naturally resolves its self
into these three heads of discourse, and
every one so proper to our present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that I shall not be able to pass
by any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First:</hi> the Nature of that Fast, which the
Prophet here proposes to be observed

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly:</hi> the manner how we ought
to prepare for it; <hi>Sanctifie the Fast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly: <hi>The Method of celebrating
of it;</hi> Let the Priests, the Ministers of the
Lord, Weep between the Porcb and the Altar,
and let them say, Spare thy People, O
Lord.</p>
            <p>I begin with the first of these;</p>
            <p>I. The Nature of that Fast, which
the Prophet here proposes to be observed
by us; <hi>Blow the Trumpet in Sion: call a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn

So exactly correspondent is the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of this Holy day to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of our Text, that it might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
be imagined, that our Church had
taken not only the Authority of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
to establish the Fast, but even the
particulars of his advice for her direction
how to do it.</p>
            <p>If first we consider the Original of this
Fast; Ours, as well as His, is established
by <hi>Publick Authority.</hi> The <hi>Trumpet</hi> has
<hi>sounded from Zion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 10. 2.</note> and the Voice of it is
gone out into all the Corners of our <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi>
'Tis our Obedience to this call that
draws us from our Closets to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and makes our mourning now
as publick and solemn, as both our own
Piety, and the sad occasion, would
otherwise have rendred it great and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> for the <hi>Extent</hi> of it, Ours, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56982:9"/>
well as His, is <hi>Universal:</hi> no Quality, no Sex
no age exempt: Not the Bridegoom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in the days of his Feasting; nor
the Bride to accomplish the <hi>Week</hi> of her
rejoycing.<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> From the Elders of our Tribes,
to the least Child in our Houses, all are
called to this Fast, and 'tis to be hoped
that every one will be as ready to obey
their Call, as our Governours have been
carefull to proclaim it to us.</p>
            <p>Lastly; <hi>for the</hi> Uniformity <hi>and</hi> Solemnity
<hi>of this Fast, we have our form too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
wherein to keep it; And though
our Offering be more large, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to those particulars, which our sins
have occasioned, yet is the Summ of all
the very same, which the Holy Prophet
commanded</hi> the Priests, the Ministers
of the Lord, to weep between the Porch and the
Altar; and say, Spare thy People, O Lord, and
give not thine Heritage to reproach; that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
should rule over them: wherefore should
they say among the People, Where <hi>is</hi> their God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56982:10"/>
Such is the Parallel of this day, with
the Pattern of that Fast which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Joel</hi> prescribed in our Text; and
sure nothing could have been more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to the Circumstances of our
own.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>for the Authority of its Establishment;</hi>
What could have been imagined more
proper to appease the anger of Heaven
for Faults committed by an usurped and
pretended Power, than so solemn a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
prescribed by the lawful and
true one? Long had the Trumpet been
blown to War and to Rebellion; the
Church become militant; and our Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
instead of setting forth the Gospel of
<hi>Peace,</hi> spoke nothing but Wars, and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Tumults to the People. It
became us certainly at last to sound it to
some other blast; and remember, that
God had appointed the <hi>Priests</hi> a more
proper use of the Trumpet,<note place="margin">Num. 10. 3, 7.</note> 
               <hi>to assemble
the Congregation</hi> to serve the Lord,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56982:10"/>
than always <hi>to give the Alarum</hi> to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to destroy their Enemies.<note place="margin">v. 9.</note> This pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Testimony of Sorrow, was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Act that could have been opposed to
the Iniquity of those Ordinances, that so
many years involved us in ruin and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
And our Courts of Justice, in
which such numbers of Loyal and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Persons have heretofore been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
though they can never make us
a Satisfaction equal to their Crimes, yet
seem at least in the Establishment of this
day, to speak their Repentance for it:
and by the Authority they have given to
this publick Sorrow, would appear not
only to beg it of Us, but even to intreat us
to intercede with Heaven too for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, for the universality of this Fast;</hi>
what less could have been done, than
when all the Nation were involved in
the Guilt, to join them all in the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for it? I shall not need to say, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56982:11"/>
they were our pretended Representatives
at least that were the Authors of this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and that they did it too <hi>in the name of
the People of England.</hi> And however so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
was the Violence, that not only
the open Royalist, but even many of
their own Faction, secretly regretted the
Villany they committed; yet still, so
many consented to it; of the rest, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
did nothing, or at least not so much as
they might, and ought to have opposed
it; and even those who most attempted
to prevent it, yet by their sins and their
Impieties, fought so much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
against their Soveraign, than all their
Arms could do to promote his Cause, that
even They may too much be charged as
the Authors of our Misery; and so all of
us seem to have conspired to have made
the Crime of this day, in the utmost Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the Phrase, a National Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly; for the Form prescribed,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to speak forth our Sorrow and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56982:11"/>
our pardon; as it was the Piety of
our Governours, that with one Voice,
as well as one heart, we should all join
in this great Rogation; so may it appear
too no improper manner for the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of this day above all others, that <hi>the
Priests, the Ministers of the Lord,</hi> should
by the Uniformity of a set and well
composed Liturgie, at one for the Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and irreverence, I wish I could not
say for the rash and almost blasphemous
Offerings of those <hi>uncommissioned Teachers;</hi>
who by the unpremeditated Nonsense
of their Prayers, no less profaned the
Honour of God, than by the Pulpit
Wildfire of their Sermons, they ruined
both the Peace of his Church, and the
Majesty of his Anointed.</p>
            <p>And now when such has been the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of our Governours, to establish the
Fast, and our own engagements are so
great to join in the Observation; 'twill
be time for us next to consider, how we
are to do it; that as they have <hi>Blown</hi> the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56982:12"/>
               <hi>Trumpet in Zion,</hi> so may we provide <hi>to
sanctifie the Fast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore brings me to the Second
part of this discourse,</p>
            <p>II. The manner how we ought to
prepare for it; <hi>Sanctifie the Congregation,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Word in the Original, which
our Text twice renders to <hi>Sanctifie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jos. 3. 5. 7, 13 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> in
its own Nature seems to signifie no more
than to <hi>Prepare:</hi> And in that great
Passage of <hi>Exod.</hi> XIX.<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> When God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<hi>Moses to sanctifie the People against
the third day,</hi> that he intended to come
down among them upon Mount <hi>Sinai, v.
10.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 10.</note> we find by the Execution of his
Commission, that it implied only a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
declaration that they should <hi>be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to meet the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>v. 14, 15. And Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
went down from the Mount, and sanctified
the People, and said, Be ready against the third
day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same no doubt was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56982:12"/>
of the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> in this place,
where addressing himself, as is plain, to the
Elders of the Jews, to them to whom the
Authority belonged, to <hi>Blow the Trumpet
in Zion: call a solemn Assembly, i. e.</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the Fast, that they should <hi>Sanctifie
the Congregation.</hi> His meaning must be,
that they should command the People
<hi>to be ready</hi> against the day of the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to <hi>lay aside all other business,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 23. 28, 30.</note> and attend
the Service of the Lord in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But though this therefore be the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
import of this phrase; and perhaps
all that was required of them to whom
the Prophet spoke, the rulers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the People; yet both the design
of this Warning, and the particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Expression, almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
understood of that special sort of
Preparation,<note place="margin">Exod. 29. v. 33, 36, 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> which consisted in cleansing
and purifying themselves, call upon us,
not only to <hi>be ready</hi> to assemble our selves
on the day of the Fast, but so <hi>to prepare</hi> our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56982:13"/>
selves too, that we may be fit for the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration.</p>
            <p>It was the great care of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
under the Law, that upon all such
solemn Assembling as this; the People
should be <hi>Sanctified</hi> before they came to
the Congregation, and then at least be
free from any present guilt, when they
met to implore the Forgiveness of their
past sins.</p>
            <p>Hence we find what strict charges
they had to <hi>purifie themselves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 11. 18.</note> to <hi>wash or to
change their Clothes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 14, 15.</note> to <hi>abstain even from law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
pleasures in which there might only seem to
be a Pollution;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Genes. 35. 2.</note> and when this was done,<note place="margin">Num. 19.</note>
what care the Priests took to <hi>sanctifie the
Congregation, i. e.</hi> to reconcile the People, by
their solemn forms of Expiation to God.</p>
            <p>And sure our care to prepare our
selves ought to be no less, because we
are now no longer under the <hi>pedagogy</hi>
of these <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> And if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Joel</hi> here requires it, even of the
Jews themselves, that they should, though
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56982:13"/>
not omit the other, yet rather be careful
to make that preparation of a spiritual
Holiness, which these shadows typified;
we certainly much more must resolve at
this time to lay aside every accursed
thing, and <hi>rent our hearts and not our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and turn unto the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that here then it will be our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
diligently to reflect, how we are
prepared this day <hi>to sanctifie the Fast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have we seriously repented of those
sins that once provoked the Justice of
Heaven to appear, as on this day, to our
Confusion; and which, if our Piety
does nothing to prevent it, will again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to our greater desolation?</p>
            <p>Is there any one amongst us, that by
the malignity of his Nature, the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness
of his Fortunes, or a misguided
Zeal, has been actually concern'd in this
great guilt, or otherwise partaken in the
crime of it, by assisting, or encouraging,
or even approving the doing it? Is there
any one now present, who though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56982:14"/>
in that black Parricide, is yet
involved in any of those Principles that
led to it? Has assisted, approved, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
those new Rebels, the Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the same <hi>Old Cause,</hi> that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
so lately endeavour'd to crown the
Son with the like glory their ancestours
did the Father? Let me beseech them
either <hi>to sanctifie the fast with us,</hi> or not to
joyn in the Celebration: Let them here
sacrifice this day all such villainous
thoughts, these practices, and these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
Let them offer up all those inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
and resentments, that ever have, or
ever may involve them in so great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.
And having thus <hi>washed their
cloths,</hi> by a Repentance for what is past,
Let them to compleat the <hi>Sanctification,</hi>
here engage themselves for the time to
come, actually to joyn in the contrary
duties of Loyalty and Obedience to their
King; resolving evermore to disown
all such Men and such Principles, as
shall ever hereafter endeavour to engage
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56982:14"/>
them in the like detestable Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>Without this all our Fasting and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
will stand us in little stead;
<hi>our Assemblies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 1. 13.</note> even <hi>this solemn meeting</hi> will
be so far from appeasing, that it will kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
God's anger to a yet higher degree
against us. In vain shall we <hi>cry every
man to his God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jon. 1. 5.</note> whilest such Jonases are
imbarked in the same Cause with us. But
let us <hi>cast out</hi> the man for whose sake all
these Evils are come upon us; Let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
ours souls that no <hi>accursed thing</hi>
may remain in them;<note place="margin">Jos. 7. 13.</note> then shall the
<hi>Storms</hi> of our Civil Confusions cease,
when we have sacrificed these Enemies
to Heaven and our own Peace: Religion
and Loyalty shall revive amongst us;
our Country shall again <hi>flourish as a City
that is at Unity within it self;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 122. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Peace shall be
within our Walls, and Righteousness within
our Palaces;</hi>
               <note place="margin">4.</note> Then shall <hi>the Tribes go up,
the Tribes of the Lord,</hi> and shall worship in
his House with <hi>a holy [and united] Worship.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56982:15"/>
The Throne of Judgement</hi> shall be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed;<note place="margin">v. 5.</note>
               <hi>even the Throne of the House of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
for Ever and Ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus shall we render this great Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
truly such a <hi>Fast as the Lord hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen;</hi>
Our weeping and our mourning
shall come up before him as the Incense,
acceptable in his sight: he will receive
our Confessions with Favour, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and answer our requests with Peace
and security.</p>
            <p>I shall say no more to the Second parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
The Preparation with which we
ought to sanctify the Fast: Our last Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
now to be considered, is,</p>
            <p>III. Being thus prepared, How we
ought to keep the Fast.</p>
            <p>And for this it is certainly impossible
to pursue any better method, than that
form of Confession the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> has
here proposed to the <hi>Jews; viz.</hi> To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the favour and mercies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56982:15"/>
1. For the forgiveness of this great sin:
<hi>Spare thy People, O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That our miseries may never be
turned by the Application of wicked
men; either,</p>
            <p>1. To the Scandal of God's People:
<hi>And give not thine Heritage to reproach:</hi>
Or,</p>
            <p>2. To the ruin of our Church or State:
<hi>That the Heathen should rule over them:</hi>
Or,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Finally, To the Reproach of God's
Providence:</hi> Wherefore should they say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the People, Where <hi>is</hi> their God?</p>
            <p>1. We must implore the Favours and
mercy of Heaven for the forgiveness
of this great sin: <hi>Spare thy people, O
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we are arrived at the proper
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56982:16"/>
business of this day; to implore the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of a crime which my soul trembles
to remember, and which I should doubt
had exceeded the power of any Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to expiate, had not the Apostles
left us an Example, by exhorting the
Jews to labour for a forgiveness even of
their crucifying the Lord of Glory.</p>
            <p>For indeed, What flouds of tears can
ever be sufficient to wash off the stain of
so much Innocent and Royal Blood, as
our late civil confusions have brought
upon us? Is it possible for our sorrow ever
to equal those Violences and Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
those Ruines and Devastations, the
Murders, the Sacrileges, those Sins
which our Eyes have seen, and which it
may be our Hands have acted? How
shall I recount the most flourishing of
States brought to Desolation? A Church,
the Envy and Hatred of Hell, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of its Friends, and Terrour of its
Enemies; So pure and orthodox its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Confession, so learned the Pens,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56982:16"/>
so exemplary the Lives of its Professors,
and when the fiery tryal came on, so firm
and constant their Sufferings, that the
most Primitive Christians could not have
desired any thing more conformable to
their own Piety; persecuted, profaned,
thrown down by Enthusiastick Zeal, and
a thorough Reformation: In a word,
a King, so Primitive too, that He seem'd
to have revived some <hi>Constantine,</hi> or <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius,</hi>
or <hi>Marcian</hi> again among us; so
just and brave, that he was worthy to
have ruled, though he had not been born
to Empire: Cut off by the villainy of
his own Subjects; a Martyr to his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
a Sacrifice to his Country, and the
Everlasting reproach as well as guilt of
both.</p>
            <p>This is but a light description of that
sin, which we are here assembled to
commemorate and to lament; and I must
beg leave to add yet more; For however
it will easily be imagined that all this
wickedness could not be accomplished
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56982:17"/>
but through innumerable Crimes, which
neither can any tongue express, nor any
thoughts conceive, yet such unusual Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainies
then acted us; which Antiquity
never knew, nor will Posterity believe;
that we might well be esteemed to fail
in that duty which this Fast requires,
should we not make some more solemn
and particular remembrance of them.</p>
            <p>Through what treachery did our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
first fall into their nets? When
those perfidious men, to whose trust he
had committed his Sacred Person, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all the Laws of Nature and
Nations as <hi>themselves,</hi> whilst not yet Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
enough to commit so black a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
<hi>confess'd</hi> contrary to all the senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Honour, and dictates of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
sold him into the hands of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
who even then design'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?
With a supplication indeed for
his security, but such as a Popish Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
uses when he delivers the poor He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
to the secular power, intreats for a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56982:17"/>
life, which he both desires may not, and
which he infallibly knows shall not be
granted.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, How soon did all
things conspire to his destruction? When
the violence of the Faction broke off
those Treaties that had almost restored
us to our peace: The lower House, that
had usurped the power of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self before, now becomes its self
reformed; And to accomplish a Villainy,
which an ordinary Malignant's conscience
was not thought proof enough to go
through with, only a few confiding
men were to be trusted with so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
a design; A Court of Justice was
erected, and Majesty arraigned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for treason committed against his
own Rebels.</p>
            <p>How shall I recount the wickedness
of their process? A tryal only to make
the condemnation the more grievous for
being the more solemn and publick.
In which their King was not allowed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56982:18"/>
that liberty of defence which every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Subject claims as his right, and
which they themselves enjoyed, for this
notorious, this undeniable Conspiracy:
Nay in which their President durst plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell his Sacred Majesty, <hi>That he was
now in a Court where reason was not to be
heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what Noise and Insults was all
the action carried on? When the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the people for Justice first, and
then for Execution, was the only voice
that was heard in our Streets: And as
if with our Loyalty all sence both of
Religion and Humanity had been lost
too, Some spit in his Royal Face as he
past by; Others press'd upon Him with
the smoak of their Tabaco, for which
they knew he had a particular aversion,
and even threw their Pipes in his way:
The least expression of Reverence to
Him, was punished with all the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
a populer fury could execute;
And One, who, more compassionate than
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56982:18"/>
the rest, only wish'd him well, was
kill'd upon the place for his unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
piety.</p>
            <p>When at last the fatal Sentence was
pronounced; How hardly were they
brought to allow him any Assistance to
prepare him for his death? His prayers
continually disturbed by the Rudeness
of those Guards that intruded upon his
most secret retirements: His last thoughts
diverted with Propositions to save his
Life, which they knew neither Honour
nor Conscience would permit him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
What Shouts, what Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when the cruel stroke was given
that finished the Tragedy? How greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did they thirst after his Blood, when
some plunged their hands into his
wound; Others dipt their staves in it.
The very block on which he rested his
Sacred Head cut in pieces, that every
one might satisfie his cruelty with some
memorial of their villainy; and even the
very boards and Earth Stain'd with his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56982:19"/>
blood, distributed as a mark whereby to
triumph over his fall.</p>
            <p>And here one would have expected a
conclusion of their guilt, and that they
should at least have desisted to pursue
him now he was dead, and no longer in
a condition to oppose their designs. But
alas! their malice extended beyond his
Execution; and as they had condemned
him for a <hi>Malefactour;</hi> so they resolved
he should not even in his burial be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
as a <hi>King.</hi> How small was the
expence they prescribed for his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
with what Privacy was it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted;
and He who had been the most
Zealous defender of the rights and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Church in his life, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the least usage of them at his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
now he was dead.</p>
            <p>And here then, let our own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
speak; or if we fear they may be
too partial, let the Censures of the World
tell us; Was there ever Villainy like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this guilt with which it pleased God
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56982:19"/>
to punish the sins of his People? Let
us search the Records of Antiquity, Let
us ask of the Generations that are past,
and Let us ask from one end of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
even to the other, if ever any thing
was committed amongst them that can
parallel this impiety. That a Christian
Kingdom should break through all those
bonds of duty and obedience, which the
more righteous Heathens have reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
as Sacred and Inviolable. That so
many Oaths, and Vows, repeated with
that Frequency, taken with that Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
should all be insufficient to preserve
our Fidelity. That <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
two things, than which none can
be more excellent in themselves, nor are
any more easily and more dangerously
abused, should be able to cheat us into
Wickedness, which the barbarous <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
never heard of, and which when it
was told them they were scandalized at
the report. Lastly, that not only the
<hi>Honour of God</hi> should be pretended for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56982:20"/>
the <hi>Motive,</hi> but even <hi>his Assistance</hi> be <hi>desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
and even affirm'd to have been <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
in the <hi>execution</hi> of all this great sin.
This is that circumstance which raises
our crime to the highest pitch of guilt,
and makes us even afraid to look up to
Heaven for the pardon of this sin, whose
assistance we have so often, and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
implored to the commission
of it.</p>
            <p>Yet since it has pleased God to draw
us at last out of the blindness our fury
had involved us in, let us take this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
for our Earnest, that he has not yet
totally forsaken us, but as He has delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us from the Evil, so if even now we
return unto him, He will free us from
the guilt too of our Sins. Only let our
Repentance be as sincere, as our Crimes
have been provoking;<note place="margin">Joel 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Who can tell but he
may yet repent, return, and leave a blessing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not only this pardon, which
we are this day to implore at his Hands:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56982:20"/>
Our Text carries us on to yet other Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
that being justified before God, we
may also prepare the way to take off
the reproach of Man, and clear our
selves in the sight of both together.
This brings me to the second part of
the Holy Prophet's prayer, <hi>Give not thine
Heritage to reproach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That this great Sin may never
turn, by the Application of wicked Men,
to the Scandal and Reproach of us or
our Religion.</p>
            <p>How necessary this part of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to us, I could wish the publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
of the whole World did not
too loudly speak. The Monuments are
still extant rhat shew us, how we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Scandal and a Proverb to all the
Nations round about us. Nay that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be wanting to illustrate the
Horrour of this Villainy, it scandalized
even our own selves too; and those very
Factions, that brought their King to his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56982:21"/>
ruin, by the secret Orders of Heaven,
themselves lamented his fall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the Impiety. How loudly did his
praises now sound from those Pulpits, that
had bid defiance to Him and his Party
heretofore? <hi>The Covenant</hi> its self was
taught to change its Voice, and <hi>from a
Band of Rebellion to destroy the Government,</hi>
was shewn to be <hi>a League of Loyalty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scandalous no doubt was the sin, and
that villainy detestable indeed to all
good Men, which thus forcibly stagger'd
the Consciences of these Separatists, by
Nature formed, by Principle bred up to
Faction, and now by above eight years
practice, one might have thought suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
instructed in Rebellion, not to
startle at a guilt they had themselves so
Zealously pursued. And how shall We
escape the common reproach, who have
been so unhappily united in a Country
and Society, that has produced such Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?
Blessed be God who has left us a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56982:21"/>
Mark of distinction to prevent so great a
Slander: And amidst all our regret for
the fatal Villainy of this day, we cannot
but joy and glory in this, that not any of
our Church was involved in this guilt, or
ever possibly can be in the like.</p>
            <p>Let the Actions of our Predecessors
speak our Innocence for what is past.
Their sufferings are as known, as the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their Enemies has been notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Their Loyal writings, in the midst
of a prosperous Rebellion, still shew us,
not only the Righteousness of their Cause,
but even their readiness to assert it in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of danger. And our own assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at this time, to detest the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
no less than to bewail the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of those Conspiratours, declares that
we are not at all degenerate, but still
maintain the same Opposition to that
Faction, who under the Cloak of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
have scandalized the very name
of Protestant, and by a sad Experience
taught us, that Kings may be proscribed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56982:22"/>
in other places besides <hi>Rome,</hi> and that <hi>a
Fanatick</hi> has as strong an Arm to lift up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Prince's life, as the stoutest <hi>Jesuit</hi>
or <hi>Jacobin</hi> can boast of.</p>
            <p>Let our Principles be examined; Let
the most accurate Inquisition pass upon
our writings; Let the Solemnity of our
Piety for the death of our late Soveraign,
and the firmness, we have again had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
too much to shew, of our
Zeal and Loyalty to our present King:
And if all this be not sufficient, Let the
malice of those Men who acted this Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy,
that in those days involved the
Church in the ruin of its<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Defender, and
hath again endeavoured once more to
put down Her that they might come the
more advantageously to strike at Him;
Let these shew that we have no part nor
Inheritance with them: Only that as the
Royal Martyr of this day, not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Son with his last breath to
forgive them, but Himself prayed for
their conversion; so will we never cease
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56982:22"/>
as faithfully to execute his Will, as that
Son has done it; and with the same Piety
that he has pardoned the Fact, beseech
God to bring them to Repentance too for
it.</p>
            <p>These are our Prayers, such our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
towards them; May the God of
Heaven answer our Requests, and give
us at last both the Satisfaction and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of beholding their Conversion.
But if the greatness of Their sins prevent
the Effect we so much desire of <hi>our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Offerings,</hi> we must then beg leave to
go on with Our Text, to <hi>another address</hi>
to secure our selves; The third particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
now to be spoken to, <hi>And give not thine
Heritage to reproach, that the Heathen should
rule over Them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That our own sins at least, may
never bring us to the like ruin, either of
our Church or State; nor Evermore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
these men, as they have heretofore
done, to prevail against us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:56982:23"/>
And this too is a Petition no less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to our present Circumstances, than
the preceding requests have been but too
applicable to the memory of our past E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
Our sins, which called down that
last Vengeance upon us, are still as hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and universal to provoke a new
one. Our Divisions are yet greater; and
and that fertile Brood of Factions,
which that unnatural War produced,
and which no Country or Antiquity
ever heard of before, still continue
more fatally, and more dangerously to
distract us.</p>
            <p>We have again seen the Government
divided against it self: The People have
been blown up into a new Ferment;
The <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Councellours</hi> have again
been <hi>Resolved</hi> to be <hi>Popishly affected;</hi> Nay,
the very <hi>Militia</hi> has been once more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
and they were no doubt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding
men</hi> too into whose hands it should
have again been put. And when all this
would not do, New designs have been
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56982:23"/>
laid to seize that Government by <hi>Violence,</hi>
they could not gain by <hi>Petition.</hi> How was
his Sacred Majesty almost caught in their
traps? The destruction so well laid, that
it had been impossible to have escaped
it; and Providence was forced to act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a Miracle to prevent it.</p>
            <p>And now when our danger has again
so nigh overtaken us, certainly He must
be very unsensible of the former Evils,
that can think Himself unconcerned at
such a time as this, to pray against the
Future. Let the Miseries that we suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the sins that were committed
in those days, when <hi>the Heathen, i. e.</hi>
these Enemies to our Church and State,
<hi>ruled over us,</hi> be remembred: Was there
<hi>Ever Sorrow like unto our Sorrow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>wherewith
the Lord afflicted us in those days of his fierce
Anger?</hi> I have before given you some
general Prospect of our Calamities at this
time, and your own Knowledge will
save me the regret of repeating to you
any more.<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>How did our Cities become Solitary,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56982:24"/>
that were full of people?</hi> Our Country, <hi>Once
great among the Nations, How did she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Tributary,</hi> even to her own Vassals?
Our King, <hi>the Anointed of the Lord, fell by
their hand; Our Princes were led into Captivity;</hi>
Our Churches, <hi>the Places of our Assemblies,
were profaned;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 2. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The solemn Feasts and days,
were forgotten in our Zion, and God in the
Indignation of his anger, despised both the King
and the Priest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this we have had but too
great cause to fear, may again return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us. Yet since it has pleased the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to stop the Vengeance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the destroying Angel to suspend
the Blow, if not to sheath his Sword,
and give us still longer respite to repent,
and secure our selves; Let the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this danger provoke us not to
neglect the Opportunity. Let our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
at this time be so sincere, that it
may not only obtain our pardon for Past
Offences, but prevail with Heaven to
prevent our Impending dangers. Let
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56982:24"/>
us no more give our Enemies this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
against us,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 15.</note> to force the Almighty
to withdraw <hi>his presence</hi> from amongst us,
and leave us again to engage them upon
equal Terms: But let our lives and our
prayers both join in the Request, to save
and to defend us, <hi>Spare thy People, O
Lord, and give not thine Heritage to reproach;
that the Heathen should rule over them:
wherefore should they say among the People,
Where</hi> is <hi>there God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the last Consideration, which
the Method of our Text now calls us to
conclude with.</p>
            <p>4. That neither the miseries we have
suffered, nor the dangers and confusions
we yet labour under, may by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of wicked men ever turn to the
reproach of God's Providence, any more
than of our own Church or Cause. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should they say among the People, Where</hi> is
<hi>their God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted but that this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56982:25"/>
sarcastick Exprobration was that reproach,
which <hi>Joel</hi> had before pray'd that God
would not suffer <hi>his Heritage</hi> to be exposed
to.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> He had promised in his Law to supply
them with plenty of Food, and to bless
their Victuals with Increase: <hi>That their
houses should be full of all manner of store;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 65. 13.</note>
               <hi>their Fields also should stand so thick with Corn,
that they should laugh and sing.</hi> Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might they fear <hi>the reproach of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi>
when instead of this plenty, they
should be forced to go and seek for
necessary nourishment of them, whom
they excluded from these promises; who
no doubt would be forward enough to
make a By-word of them, and insult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their pretences, as if their God either
could not, or would not relieve them.
Is this <hi>the People that hath the Lord for their
God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joel. 1. 16. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, Is not the meat cut off before their
Eyes? Their Vine laid waste? and the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of their figtree made white? Their seed is
rotten under their clods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">17.</note> 
               <hi>their Garners are made
desolate, the Barns broken down, because the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56982:25"/>
corn is withered.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joel 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>How do the beasts groan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have no pasture? for the rivers of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the
pastures of the wilderness. Where is now
their God</hi> to pity them? And where is
the Lord to be jealous for his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</p>
            <p>This was their <hi>Reproach,</hi> the
Scandal of themselves, and their Religion,
which the Prophet so much feared, and
so earnestly exhorted them to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst:
and would to God we our selves
this day had not too great cause to
fear the like. Witness, O ye pious and
excellent Souls, what scornings and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to your selves and your Religion did
ye then bear, when being forced from
that plenty and tranquility you once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed;
you become scattered abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Heathenand underwent their
reproaches, more grievous and sensible
than all the other miseries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of your cruel exile!</p>
            <p>But what need I look back to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56982:26"/>
times that are past when our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to afford us so plain an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
How far both our late calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and our present destractions have
given occasion to the Enemy to triumph
in our misfortunes, as if they were not
only the mark of our own sins, but even
an argument of the common illness of our
Cause too, this alone may be sufficient
to shew, that the Romanists not only
hope from them, to see this Ferment one
day settle among us into down right Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
again; but even at this day make
this the great, and indeed it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the strongest, prejudice against the
Reformation, that since we have thrown
off our Obedience to that Church, we
have run so many and different ways of
Errour, and are yet at such distance from
one another, as plainly shew there is no
truth nor certainty to be found for us,
but only in our return to them again.</p>
            <p>I shall not here enquire into
the Goodness of the <hi>Consequence,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:56982:26"/>
but must needs say I could wish, there
were not too much Truth and scandal in
the <hi>Premises:</hi> And who can tell whether,
since any lesser Judgements have been
ineffectual to reclaim us, God may not
at last punish us with this Blindness, and
whilst we refuse to submit to the easie
and lawful power of his Church and his
Anointed, bring us once more under the
intolerable Yoke of that usurped autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
from whose Slavery both our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and our Consciences are now so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
asserted.</p>
            <p>This I am sure we have too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and may therefore justly have
but too great Cause to fear. Only
my hope is, that whatever our own
demerits are, yet the Innocence of
our Church shall still provoke God's
providence to defend her: And that our
deliverance, as at this time, from our
Enemies, shall always disappoint such
fatal expectations, and convince them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56982:27"/>
that though we have sinned, yet are we
his People; That he chastises us as
Children, not punishes us as his Enemies;
and is still our God, though angry and
provoked.</p>
            <p>How great is the demonstration of
his mercy and loving-kindness, that we
even now continue a Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as at this day? What Miracles did
he work to <hi>turn again the Captivity of our
Zion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 126. 1.</note> and deliver both us and our King
from those Usurpers that so long had tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over both? Has not the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
shewn himself in our defence,
who but so lately has delivered us both
from Popish and Fanatick Conspiracies?
Let them ask <hi>where is their God,</hi> that have
not known by what singular and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
means these designs were both
Discover'd and Disappointed? And
though it pleases God still to leave <hi>these
men</hi> like the <hi>Canaanites in the Land, to try,
and to prove us,</hi> and which indeed but too
much fulfil their character <hi>of being scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

has he set bounds to their designs, which
they have not been able to pass, and
which we trust they never shall exceed,
to ruine and destroy us.</p>
            <p>Yet since both our peace and security
are still in such danger through their rage
and their devices; Let us endeavour not
less by our Piety than our Policies,
to countermine them. Let us engage
the Assistance of Heaven by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of our Lives, as well as the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of our Cause, to oppose their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts:
Let us exceed them as much
in the Sincerity of our Righteousness, as
they have done all others in the outward
Pretences and Hypocrisie of theirs. Let
us keep this day the fast which the Lord
hath chosen; <hi>to break the bonds of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
to have pity on the distressed; and to
execute judgement and justice in the gates.</hi>

               <hi>Let
