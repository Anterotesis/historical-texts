         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to our truſt repoſed in you, and your ſolemn deep Ingagements, Vows, and

to the preſent corrupt, delatory, chargeable practiſes of the <hi>Law,</hi> and to the cruel, impious (unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd)

And WHY NOT, that ſo <hi>Knaves</hi> may be known?</p>
            <p>

provided, That all mercenary <hi>Lawyers</hi> be exempted from coming up to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi>
but every man to have Juſtice adminiſtred at his own doore, as in the dayes of King <hi>Edward,</hi>
and King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who hanged up 45 County <hi>Iudges</hi> in one yeere, for taking Bribes, and paſſing
falſe Judgement; and <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth who hang'd 15 <hi>Goalers</hi> in one yeere for exacting monies
from Priſoners; and the <hi>Law</hi> practiſed in our Engliſh tongue, in ſome brief expedicious way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any delatory (<hi>heats, Fees,</hi> or <hi>Bribes,</hi> (as now uſed) according to the command of God, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
practiſe of all other Nations in the World where more <hi>Iuſtice</hi> is to be had for eight pence, then
here in our Land for 800. l. And WHY NOT unjuſt things aboliſhed?</p>
            <p>Finally, our deſires are. That becauſe there is a far greater number of able honeſt Conſciencious
underſtanding men in every of our Cities, Counties, Hundreds. Towns and Villages that are able to
judge and determine all <hi>Controverſies</hi> between a man and his Neighbor better then any of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of <hi>Contention,</hi> The <hi>Lawyers. (Englands Cankerworms</hi>) whoſe Nature and Profeſſion is to
fiſh in troubled Waters, and to make the Wound of <hi>Contention</hi> deeper and far larger, rather then to
cure it, That therefore they may no ways be thought fit to decide any <hi>Controverſie</hi> in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> nor
to ſit in our <hi>National Aſſemblies,</hi> but to be expunged and expelled the <hi>Houſe of Parliament,</hi> even as
the <hi>Biſhops, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> were before them? And WHY NOT the power of ſuch <hi>Serpents</hi>
deſtroyed, and quite confounded, confounded, Yea accurſed of God and abhorred of men let all them
