         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

haue not wanted the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the Bookes of

cause, there shall neuer bee
any moment of my life,
when I remember this high

my heart with all my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
I shall not render

<hi>Nicholas Flammel, Notary,</hi>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:2423:12"/>
after the decease of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
got my liuing in our
Art of Writing, by making
<hi>Inuentories,</hi> dressing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
and summing vp
the Expences of <hi>Tutors</hi> and
<hi>Pupils,</hi> there fell into my
hands, for the sum of two
Florens, a guilded Booke,
very old and large; It was
not of Paper, nor Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as other Bookes bee,
but was onely made of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Rindes (as it seemed
vnto me) of tender yong
trees: The couer of it was
of brasse, well bound, all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen
with letters, or
strange figures; and for my
part, I thinke they might
well be <hi>Greeke Characters,</hi>
or some such like ancient
language: Sure I am, I
could not reade them, and I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2423:12"/>
know well they were not
notes nor letters of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
nor of the <hi>Gaule,</hi> for
of them wee vnderstand a
little. As for that which
was within it, the leaues of
barke or rinde, were ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and with admirable
diligence written, with a
point of <hi>Iron,</hi> in faire and
neate Latine letters colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
It contained thrice se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
leaues, for so were they
counted in the top of the
leaues, and alwayes euery
seuenth leafe was without
any writing, but in stead
thereof, vpon the first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
leafe, there was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a <hi>Virgin,</hi> and <hi>Serpents</hi>
swallowing her vp; In the
second seuenth, a <hi>Crosse</hi>
where a <hi>Serpent</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified;
and in the last se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2423:13"/>
there were painted
<hi>Desarts,</hi> or <hi>Wildernesses,</hi>
in the middest whereof ran
many faire fountaines, from
whence there issued out a
number of <hi>Serpents,</hi> which
ran vp and downe here and
there. Vpon the first of the
leaues, was written in great
Capitall Letters of gold,
ABRAHAM THE
IEW, PRINCE,
PRIEST, LEVITE,
ASTROLOGER,
AND PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHER,
TO THE
NATION OF THE
IEWES, BY THE
WRATH OF GOD
DISPERSED A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONG
THE GAVLES,
SENDETH HEALTH.
After this it was filled with
great execrations and curses
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2423:13"/>
(with this word MARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATHA,
which was
often repeated there) against
euery person that should
cast his eyes vpon it, if
hee were not <hi>Sacrificer</hi> or
<hi>Scribe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee that sold mee this
Booke, knew not what it
was worth, no more than I
when I bought it; I beleeue
it had beene stolne or taken
from the miserable <hi>Iewes;</hi>
or found hid in some part
of the ancient place of their
abode. Within the Booke,
in the second leafe, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
his <hi>Nation,</hi> councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them to flie vices, and
aboue all, <hi>Idolatry,</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with sweete patience
the comming of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi>
which should vanquish
all the Kings of the Earth,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2423:14"/>
and should raigne with his
people in glory eternally.
Without doubt this had
beene some very wise and
vnderstanding man. In the
third leafe, and in all the
other writings that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
to helpe his <hi>Captiue
nation</hi> to pay their <hi>tributes</hi>
vnto the <hi>Romane</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and to doe other
things, which I will not
speake of, he taught them in
common words the <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
of Mettalls;</hi> hee
painted the <hi>Vessels</hi> by the
sides, and hee aduertised
them of the <hi>colours,</hi> and of
all the rest, sauing of the <hi>first
Agent,</hi> of the which hee
spake not a word, but onely
(as hee said) in the fourth
and fifth leaues entire hee
painted it, and figured it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2423:14"/>
with very great cunning
and workemanship: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was well and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly
figured and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet no man could euer
haue beene able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it, without being well
skilled in their <hi>Cabala,</hi>
which goeth by tradition,
and without hauing well
studied their bookes The
fourth and fifth leafe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was without any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
all full of faire figures
<hi>enlightened,</hi> or as it were
<hi>enlightened,</hi> for the worke
was very exquisite. First he
painted a <hi>yong man,</hi> with
wings at his anckles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in his hand a <hi>Caducae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
rodde, writhen about
with two <hi>Serpents,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
hee strooke vpon a
helmet which couered his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2423:15"/>
head; he seemed to my small
iudgement, to be the God
<hi>Mercury</hi> of the <hi>Pagans:</hi>
against him there came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and flying with open
wings, a great old man,
who vpon his head had an
<hi>houre-glasse</hi> fastened, and in
his hands a hooke (or sithe)
like <hi>Death,</hi> with the which,
in terrible and furious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
hee would haue cut off
the feet of <hi>Mercury.</hi> On the
other side of the fourth
leafe, hee painted a faire
<hi>flowre</hi> on the top of a very
high <hi>mountaine,</hi> which was
sore shaken with the <hi>North
wind;</hi> it had the foot <hi>blew,</hi>
the flowres <hi>white</hi> and <hi>red,</hi>
the leaues shining like fine
<hi>gold:</hi> And round about it
the <hi>Dragons</hi> and <hi>Griffons</hi>
of the <hi>North</hi> made their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2423:15"/>
nests and abode. On the
fifth leafe there was a faire
<hi>Rose-tree</hi> flowred in the
middest of a sweet <hi>Garden,</hi>
climbing vp against a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Oake;</hi> at the foot wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
boyled a fountaine of
most <hi>white water,</hi> which
ranne head-long downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the depths, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it first passed among
the hands of infinite people,
which digged in the Earth
seeking for it; but because
they were blinde, none of
them knew it, except here
and there one which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the <hi>weight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the last side of the
fift leafe, there was a <hi>King</hi>
with a great <hi>Fauchion,</hi> who
made to be killed in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senc<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
by some <hi>Souldiers</hi> a
great multitude of little <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:2423:16"/>
whose Mothers wept
at the feet of the vnpittifull
<hi>Souldiers:</hi> the bloud of
which <hi>Infants</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by other Souldiers
gathered vp, and put in a
great vessell, wherein the
<hi>Sunne</hi> and the <hi>Moone</hi> came
to bathe themselues. And
because that this History
did represent the more part
of that of the <hi>Innocents</hi>
slaine by <hi>Herod,</hi> and that in
this Booke I learned the
greatest part of the <hi>Art,</hi>
this was one of the causes,
why I placed in their
<hi>Churchyard</hi> these <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Symbols</hi> of this secret
science. And thus you see
that which was in the first
fiue leaues: I will not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
vnto you that which
was written in good and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2423:16"/>
Latine in all the
other written leaues, for
God would punish me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I should commit a
greater wickednesse, then
he who (as it is said) wished
that all the men of the
World had but one head
that hee might cut it off at
one blow. Hauing with me
therefore this <hi>faire Booke,</hi>
I did nothing else day nor
night, but study vpon it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
very well all
the operations that it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but not knowing with
what matter I should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne,
which made me very
heauy and sollitary, and
caused me to fetch many a
sigh. My wife <hi>Perrenelle,</hi>
whom I loued as my selfe,
and had lately married, was
much astonished at this,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2423:17"/>
comforting mee, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
demanding, if shee
could by any meanes deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
mee from this trouble:
I could not possibly hold
my tongue, but told her all,
and shewed her this <hi>faire
Booke,</hi> whereof at the same
instant that shee saw it, shee
became as much enamored
as my selfe, taking extreame
pleasure to behold the <hi>faire
couer, grauings, images,</hi> and
<hi>portraicts,</hi> whereof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
shee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as little as I: yet it
was a great comfort to mee
to talke with her, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
my selfe, what wee
should doe to haue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of them. In the
end I caused to bee painted
within my <hi>Lodging,</hi> as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
as I could, all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2423:17"/>
and portraicts of the
<hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> leafe, which
I shewed to the greatest
Clerkes in <hi>Paris,</hi> who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
thereof no more
then my selfe; I told them
they were found in a Booke
that taught the <hi>Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
stone,</hi> but the greatest
part of them made a mocke
both of me, and of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Stone,</hi> excepting one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Master Anselme,</hi> which
was a <hi>Licentiate</hi> in <hi>Physick,</hi>
and studied hard in this
<hi>Science:</hi> He had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to haue seene my Book,
and there was nothing in
the world, which he would
not haue done for a sight of
it: but I alwayes told him,
that I had it not; onely I
made him a large descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Method.</hi> He told
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2423:18"/>
mee that the first portraict
represented <hi>Time,</hi> which
deuoured all; and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the number of
the <hi>sixe</hi> written leaues, there
was required the space of
<hi>sixe</hi> yeeres, to perfect the
<hi>stone;</hi> and then he said, wee
must turne the <hi>glasse,</hi> and
seeth it no more. And when
I told him that this was not
painted, but onely to shew
and teach the first <hi>Agent,</hi>
(as was said in the Booke)
hee answered me, that this
decoction for <hi>sixe</hi> yeeres
space, was, as it were, a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Agent;</hi> and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
the <hi>first Agent</hi> was
there painted, which was
the <hi>white and heauy water,</hi>
which without doubt was
<hi>Argent viue,</hi> which they
could not <hi>fixe,</hi> nor cut off
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2423:18"/>
his <hi>feete,</hi> that is to say, take
away his <hi>volatility</hi> saue by
that long decoction in the
purest bloud of young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;
for in that, this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
viue</hi> being ioined with
<hi>gold</hi> and <hi>siluer,</hi> was first tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with them into an <hi>herb</hi>
like that which was there
painted, and afterwards by
corruption, into <hi>Serpents;</hi>
which <hi>Serpents</hi> being then
wholly dried, and decocted
by fire, were reduced into
powder of <hi>gold,</hi> which
should be the <hi>stone.</hi> This
was the cause, that during
the space of <hi>one and twenty
yeeres,</hi> I tryed a thousand
broulleryes, yet neuer with
<hi>bloud,</hi> for that was wicked
and villanous: for I found
in my Booke, that the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi>
called <hi>Bloud,</hi> the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2423:19"/>
minerall spirit, which is in
the <hi>Mettals,</hi> principally in
the <hi>Sunne, Moone,</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
to the assembling
whereof, I alwayes tended;
yet these interpretations for
the most part were more
subtile then true. Not seeing
therefore in my workes the
<hi>signes,</hi> at the time written in
my Booke, I was alwayes
to beginne againe. In the
end hauing lost all hope of
euer vnderstanding those
<hi>figures,</hi> for my last refuge, I
made a vow to God, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                        <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the interpretation of
them, at some <hi>Iewish Priest,</hi>
in some <hi>Synagogue</hi> of
<hi>Spaine:</hi> whereupon with
the consent of <hi>Perrenelle,</hi>
carrying with me the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi>
of the <hi>Pictures,</hi> hauing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2423:19"/>
taken the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> habit
and staffe, in the same fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as you may see me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this same <hi>Arch</hi> in the
<hi>Church-yard,</hi> in the which
I put these <hi>hyeroglyphicall
figures,</hi> where I haue also
set against the wall, on the
one and the other side, a
<hi>Procession,</hi> in which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by order all the
colours of the <hi>stone,</hi> so as
they come &amp; goe, with this
writing in French.

which is as it wete the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

his Book, which entreateth

entituled <hi>Iris,</hi> or the <hi>Raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,</hi>

of the worke is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
vnto Nature:</hi> the
which I haue put there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
for the great <hi>Clerkes,</hi>
who shall vnderstand the
<hi>Allusion.</hi> In this same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
I say, I put my selfe
vpon my way; and so much
I did, that I arriued at
<hi>Montioy,</hi> and afterwards
at <hi>Saint Iames,</hi> where with
great deuotion I accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
my vow. This done,
in <hi>Leon</hi> at my returne I met
with a Merchant of <hi>Boloyn,</hi>
which made me knowne to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2423:20"/>
a <hi>Physician,</hi> a <hi>Iew</hi> by Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and as then a <hi>Christian,</hi>
dwelling in <hi>Leon</hi> aforesaid,
who was very skilfull in
sublime Sciences, called
Master <hi>Canches.</hi> Assoone as
I had showen him the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of my <hi>Extraict,</hi> hee
being rauished with great
astonishment and ioy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of me incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if I could tell him any
newes of the <hi>Booke,</hi> from
whence they were drawne?
I answered him in <hi>Latine</hi>
(wherein hee asked me the
question) that I hoped to
haue some good newes of
the <hi>Book,</hi> if any body could
decipher vnto me the <hi>Enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes:</hi>
All at that instant
transported with great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and ioy, hee began to
decipher vnto mee the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2423:21"/>
But to be short, hee
wel content to learn newes
where this Book should be,
and I to heare him speake;
and certainly he had heard
much discourse of the
Booke, but (as he said) as of
a thing which was beleeued
to be vtterly lost, we resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of our voyage, and
from <hi>Leon</hi> wee passed to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiedo,</hi>
and from thence to
<hi>Sanson,</hi> where wee put our
selues to Sea to come into
<hi>France:</hi> Our voyage had
beene fortunate enough, &amp;
all ready, since we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into this Kingdome,
he had most truly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto mee the greatest
part of my figures, where
euen vnto the very points
and prickes, he found great
<hi>misteries,</hi> which seemed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2423:21"/>
vnto mee wonderfull, when
arriuing at <hi>Orleans,</hi> this
learned man fell extreamely
sicke, being afflicted with
excessiue vomitings, which
remained still with him of
those he had suffered at Sea,
and he was in such a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
feare of my forsaking
him, that hee could imagine
nothing like vnto it. And
although I was alwayes by
his side, yet would he inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
call for mee, but in
summe hee dyed, at the end
of the <hi>seuenth</hi> day of his
sicknesse, by reason whereof
I was much grieued, yet as
well as I could, I caused him
to be buried in the <hi>Church</hi>
of the <hi>holy Crosse</hi> at <hi>Orleans,</hi>
where hee yet resteth; God
haue his soule, for hee dyed
a good <hi>Christian:</hi> And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2423:22"/>
surely, if I be not hindered
by death, I will giue vnto
that <hi>Church</hi> some <hi>reuenew,</hi>
to cause some <hi>Masses</hi> to bee
said for his soule euery day.
He that would see the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of my arriuall, and the
ioy of <hi>Perenelle,</hi> let him
looke vpon vs two, in this
<hi>City</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> vpon the
doore of the <hi>Chappell</hi> of
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Iames</hi> of the <hi>Bouchery,</hi>
close by the one side of my
<hi>house,</hi> where wee are both
painted, my selfe giuing
thankes at the feet of <hi>Saint
Iames of Gallicia,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renelle</hi>
at the feet of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Iohn,</hi>
whom shee had so often
called vpon. So it was,
that by the grace of God,
and the intercession of the
happy and holy <hi>Virgin,</hi>
and the blessed Saints,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2423:22"/>
                        <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> I knew all
that I desired, that is to
say, The first <hi>Principles,</hi>
yet not their first <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which is a thing most
difficult, aboue all the
things in the world: But
in the end I had that also,
after long errours of <hi>three
yeeres,</hi> or thereabouts; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time, I did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but study and labour,
so as you may see me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this <hi>Arch,</hi> where I haue
placed my <hi>Processions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the two Pillars of it,
vnder the feet of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi>
and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to God, with my
Beades in my hand, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
attentiuely within a
Booke, and poysing the
words of the <hi>Philosophers:</hi>
and afterwards trying and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2423:23"/>
proouing the diuerse ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which I imagined
to my selfe, by their onely
words. Finally, I found
that which I desired, which
I also soone knew by the
strong <hi>sent</hi> and <hi>odour</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Hauing this, I easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
the <hi>Mastery,</hi> for
knowing the <hi>preparation</hi> of
the first <hi>Agents,</hi> and after
following my Booke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>letter,</hi> I could
not haue missed it, though I
would. Then the first time
that I made <hi>proiection,</hi> was
vpon <hi>Mercurie,</hi> whereof I
turned halfe a pound, or
thereabouts, into pure <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi>
better than that of the
<hi>Mine,</hi> as I my selfe assayed,
and made others assay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times. This was vpon a
Munday, the 17. of <hi>Ianuary</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:2423:23"/>
about noone, in my house,
<hi>Perrenelle</hi> onely being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
in the yeere of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of mankind, 1382.
And afterwards, following
alwayes my Booke, from
word to word, I made <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection</hi>
of the <hi>Red stone</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the like quantity of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie,</hi>
in the presence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of <hi>Perrenelle</hi> onely, in
the same house, the <hi>fiue and
twentieth day</hi> of <hi>Aprill</hi>
following, the same yeere,
about fiue a <hi>clocke</hi> in the
<hi>Euening;</hi> which I transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
truely into almost as
much pure <hi>Gold,</hi> better
assuredly than common
<hi>Golde,</hi> more soft, and
more plyable. I may
speake it with truth, I haue
made it three times, with
the helpe of <hi>Perrenelle,</hi> who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2423:24"/>
vnderstood it as well as I,
because she helped mee in
my operations, and without
doubt, if shee would haue
enterprised to haue done it
alone, shee had attained to
the end and perfection
thereof. I had indeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
when I had once
done it, but I found excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
in seeing and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating
the <hi>Admirable
workes of Nature,</hi> within
the <hi>Vessels.</hi> To signifie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee then, how I haue
done it <hi>three times,</hi> thou
shalt see in this <hi>Arch,</hi> if
thou haue any skil to know
them, three <hi>furnaces,</hi> like
vnto them which serue for
our <hi>opperations:</hi> was afraid
a long time, that <hi>Perrenelle</hi>
could not hide the extreme
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2423:24"/>
ioy of her felicitie, which I
measured by mine owne,
and lest shee should let fall
some word amongst her
kindred, of the great <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
which wee possessed:
for extreme <hi>ioy</hi> takes away
the vnderstanding, as well
as great <hi>heauinesse;</hi> but the
goodnesse of the most great
God, had not onely filled
mee with this blessing, to
giue mee a <hi>wife</hi> chaste and
sage, for she was moreouer,
not onely capeable of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but also to doe all that
was reasonable, and more
discreet and secret, than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
other women are.
Aboue all, shee was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>deuout,</hi> and therefore
seeing her selfe without
hope of children, and now
well stricken in yeeres, shee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2423:25"/>
began as I did, to thinke of
God, and to giue or selues
to the workes of <hi>mercy.</hi> At
that time when I wrote this
<hi>Commentarie,</hi> in the yeere
<hi>one thousand foure hundred
and thirteene,</hi> in the end of
the yeere, after the decease
of my faithfull companion,
which I shall lament all the
dayes of my life: she and I
had already founded, and
endued with reuenewes 14.
<hi>Hospitals</hi> in this <hi>Citie</hi> of
<hi>Paris,</hi> wee had new built
from the ground <hi>three
Chappels,</hi> we had inriched
with great gifts and good
rents, <hi>seuen Churches,</hi> with
many reparations in their
<hi>Church-yards,</hi> besides that
which we haue done at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne,</hi>
which is not much
lesse than that which wee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2423:25"/>
haue done heere. I will
not speake of the good
which both of vs haue
done to particular poore
folkes, principally to <hi>wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi>
and poore <hi>Orphans,</hi>
whose names if I should tel,
and how I did it, besides
that my reward should be
giuen mee in this World, I
should likewise doe displea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure
to those good persons,
whom I pray God blesse,
which I would not doe for
any thing in the World.
Building therefore these
<hi>Churches, Churchyards,</hi> and
<hi>Hospitals</hi> in this <hi>City,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
my selfe, to cause to
be painted in the <hi>fourth
Arch</hi> of the Church-yard
of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> as you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in by the great gate in
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Dennis street,</hi> and taking
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2423:26"/>
the way on the right hand,
the most true and essentiall
markes of the <hi>Arte,</hi> yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>vailes,</hi> and <hi>Hieroglyphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
couertures,</hi> in imitation
of those which are in the
gilded Booke of <hi>Abraham</hi>
the <hi>Iew,</hi> which may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>two things,</hi> according
to the capacity and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them: First, the <hi>myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of our future and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<hi>Resurrection,</hi> at
the day of Iudgement, and
comming of good <hi>Iesus,</hi>
(whom may it please to
haue mercy vpon vs) a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
which is well agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a <hi>Churchyard.</hi> And
secondly, they may signifie
to them, which are skilled
in Naturall <hi>Philosophy,</hi> all
the principall and necessary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2423:26"/>
operations of the <hi>Maistery.</hi>
These <hi>Hieroglyphicke fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
shall serue as two
wayes to leade vnto the
heauenly life: the first and
most open sence, teaching
the sacred <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our
saluation; (as I will shew
heereafter) the other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
euery man, that hath
any small vnderstanding in
the <hi>Stone,</hi> the lineary way
of the worke; which being
perfected by any one, the
change of euill into good,
takes away from him the
roote of all sinne (which is
<hi>couetousnesse)</hi> making him
liberall, gentle, pious religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and fearing God, how
euill soeuer hee was before,
for from thence forward,
hee is continually rauished,
with the great grace and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2423:27"/>
mercy which hee hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from God, and with
the profoundnesse of his
Diuine &amp; admirable works.
These are the reasons
which haue mooued mee to
set these formes in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
and in this place
which is a <hi>Churchyard,</hi> to
the end that if any man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this inestimable good,
to conquere this <hi>rich golden
Fleece,</hi> he may thinke with
himselfe (as I did) not to
keepe the <hi>talent</hi> of <hi>God</hi> dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the <hi>Earth,</hi> buying
Lands and Possessions,
which are the vanities of
this world: but rather to
worke charitably towards
his brethren, remembring
himselfe that hee learned
this <hi>secret</hi> amongst the
<hi>bones</hi> of the <hi>dead,</hi> in whose
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2423:27"/>
number hee shall shortly be
found; and that after this
life, hee must render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
before a iust and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable
<hi>Iudge,</hi> which
will censure euen to an idle
and vaine word. Let him
therefore, which hauing
well weighed my <hi>words,</hi>
and well knowne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
my <hi>figures,</hi> hath
first gotten elsewhere the
knowledge of the first <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
and Agents,</hi> (for
certainely in these <hi>Figures</hi>
and <hi>Commentaries,</hi> he shall
not finde any step or infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
thereof) perfect to
the glory of God the <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi>
of <hi>Hermes,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
himself of the <hi>Church
Catholike, Apostolike,</hi> and
<hi>Romane;</hi> and of all other
<hi>Churches, Churchyards,</hi> and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2423:28"/>
                        <hi>Hospitals;</hi> and aboue all, of
the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Innocents</hi>
in this <hi>Citie,</hi> (in the
<hi>Churchyard</hi> whereof hee
shall haue contemplated
these true demonstrations)
opening bounteously his
purse, to them that are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
poore, honest people
desolate, weake women,
widdowes, and forlorne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2423:31"/>
to say, <hi>blacke,</hi> whereof the
one hath the <hi>wings</hi> gilded,
and the other hath none at

such as is the <hi>sinne</hi> against

which is in the <hi>wings,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
that the greatest part
of sinnes commeth from the

which makes so many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

from whence they may
haue it: and the colour <hi>black</hi>

are the desires that come

                     <p>The man and the woman
which are next them, of an
<hi>orange colour,</hi> vpon a field
<hi>azure</hi> and <hi>blew,</hi> signifie that
men and women ought not

                     <p>Next after this, in a field
of <hi>Synople,</hi> that is <hi>greene,</hi> are

of colour exceeding <hi>white</hi>

there are two <hi>Angels</hi>
sounding musicall Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as if they had called
these dead to the day of
iudgement; for ouer these
two <hi>Angels</hi> is the figure of
our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the world in his hand,
vpon whose head an <hi>Angell</hi>
setteth a Crowne, assisted
by two others, which say in
their roules, <hi>O pater Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potens,
ô Iesu bone,</hi> that is, <hi>O
Father Almighty, ô good
Iesu.</hi> On the right side of
this <hi>Sauiour</hi> is painted S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                        <hi>Paul,</hi> clothed with <hi>white</hi> &amp;

clothed in a gowne of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range

appeared pleights or folds

his hands ioined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from betweene which
proceed these words writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in a roule, DELE
MALA QVAE FECI,
that is to say, <hi>Blot out the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
that I haue done:</hi> On
the other side on the left
hand, is <hi>Saint Peter</hi> with
his Key, clothed in <hi>reddish
yellow,</hi> holding his hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a woman clad in a gown
of <hi>orange colour,</hi> which is
on her knees, representing
to the life <hi>Perrenelle,</hi> which
holdeth her hands ioyned

where is written, CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STE

PIVS, that is, <hi>Christ
I beseech thee be pittifull:</hi>
Behind whom there is an
<hi>Angell</hi> on his knees, with
a roule, that saith, SALVE
DOMINE ANGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LORVM,
that is, <hi>All haile
thou Lord of Angels.</hi> There
is also another <hi>Angel</hi> on his
knees, behind my Image, on
the same side that <hi>S. Paul</hi>
is on, which likewise hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a roule, saying, O
REX SEMPITER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NE,
that is, <hi>O King euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</hi>
All this is so cleere,

So it seemes this <hi>Arch</hi>
was not painted for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

purpose, but to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
this. And therefore we
neede not stay any longer
vpon it, considering that the

may well know how to
giue it this interpretation.</p>
                     <p>Next after the <hi>three</hi> that
are rising againe, come two

If it be kindled with

If thou fire thy Vessell, saith

them come out <hi>red,</hi>
rather than <hi>white,</hi> and then
thy worke is spoiled; as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2423:39"/>
also if thou make too little
fire, for then thou shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
see the end, because of
the coldnesse of the <hi>natures,</hi>
which shall not haue had
motion sufficient to digest
them together.</p>
                     <p>The heate then of thy

according to the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
or rather, as saith <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi>
according to the

to flie so softly from

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2423:40"/>
two elements of <hi>cold</hi> and
<hi>heate</hi> will neuer perfectly
imbrace one another, but
by little and little, hauing
first long dwelt together, in
the middest of the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heate of their <hi>bath,</hi> and
being changed by long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
into <hi>Sulphur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combustible.</hi>
Gouern there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sweetly with equality
and proportion, thy proud
and haughty natures, for
feare lest if thou fauour one
more then another, they
which naturally are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
doe grow angry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee through <hi>Ielousy,</hi>
and dry <hi>Choller,</hi> and make
thee sigh for it a long time
after: Besides this, thou must
entertain them in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
heate perpetually,
that is to say, night and day,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2423:40"/>
vntill the time that <hi>Winter,</hi>
the time of the <hi>moisture</hi> of
the matters, be passed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they make their peace,
and ioyne hands in being
heated together, whereas
should these natures finde
themselues but one onely
half houre without <hi>fire,</hi> they
would become for euer ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable.
See therefore
the reason why it is said in
the Book of the <hi>seuenty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
Looke that their heate
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue indefatigably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

And <hi>Rasis, the haste,</hi> saith
hee, <hi>that brings with it too
much fire, is alwaies followed
by the Diuell, and Errour.
When the golden Bird,</hi> saith
<hi>Diomedes, shall be come iust
to Cancer, and that from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2423:41"/>
thence it shall runne toward
Libra, then thou maist aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

in like manner, when this

towards Capricorne,
which is the desired Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne,
the time of haruest,

viue,</hi> or cold, and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.
These are the <hi>Sunne</hi>
and <hi>Moone</hi> of the <hi>Mercurial</hi>
source, and <hi>sulphurous ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,</hi>
which by continual
fire are adorned with <hi>royall</hi>
habiliments, that being vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and afterward changed
into a <hi>quintessence,</hi> they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2423:42"/>
may ouercome euery thing
<hi>Mettallick,</hi> how solid hard
and strong soeuer it bee.
These are the <hi>Serpents</hi> and
<hi>Dragons</hi> which the ancient
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> haue painted in
a <hi>Circle,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> biting the
<hi>tayle,</hi> to signifie that they
proceeded from one and
the same thing, and that it
alone was sufficient, and
that in the turning and <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi>
thereof, it made it

<hi>Dragons</hi> which the ancient
Poets haue fained did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

the golden Apples of the
Gardens of the Virgins <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperides.</hi>
These are they vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom <hi>Iason</hi> in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
for the Golden
Fleece, powred the brothe

of whom the Books
of the <hi>Phylosophers</hi> are so
full, that there is no <hi>Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher</hi>
that euer was, but he
hath written of it, from the
time of the truth-telling
<hi>Hermes Trismegistus, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,
Pythagoras, Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius,
Morienus,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
following, euen vnto
my selfe. These are the <hi>two
Serpents,</hi> giuen and sent by
<hi>Iuno,</hi> (that is, the nature
<hi>Mettallicke)</hi> the which the
strong <hi>Hercules,</hi> that is to
say, the sage and wise man
must <hi>strangle</hi> in his <hi>cradle,</hi>
that is, ouercome and kill
them, to make them putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
corrupt, and ingender,
at the beginning of his
worke. These are the <hi>two
Serpents,</hi> wrapped and twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2423:43"/>
round about the <hi>Cadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus</hi>
or <hi>rod</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
with the which hee exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his great power, and
transformeth himselfe as
he listeth. He, saith <hi>Haly,</hi>
that shall kill the one, shall
also kill the other, because
the one cannot die but with
his brother. These two
then, (which <hi>Auicen</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the <hi>Corassene bitch</hi> and
the <hi>Armenian dogge)</hi> these
two I say, being put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the vessell of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher,</hi>
doe bite one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cruelly, and by their
great poyson, and furious
rage, they neuer leaue one
another, from the moment
that they haue seized on
one another (if the <hi>cold</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them not) till both of
them by their slauering ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2423:43"/>
and mortall hurts, be
all of a goarebloud, ouer all
the parts of their bodies;
and finally, killing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
be stewed in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>venome,</hi> which after
their death, changeth them
into liuing and <hi>permanent
water;</hi> before which time,
they loose in their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and putrifaction, their
first naturall formes, to take
afterwards one onely new,
more noble, and better
forme. These are the two
<hi>Spermes, masculine</hi> and <hi>sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine,</hi>
described at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of my <hi>Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Phylosophy,</hi> which
are engendred (say <hi>Rasis, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen,</hi>
and <hi>Abraham</hi> the

of the foure <hi>Elements.</hi>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:2423:44"/>
These are the radicall moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of mettalls, <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
and <hi>Argent viue,</hi> not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and such as are sold by
the <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,</hi>
but those which giue
vs those two faire &amp; deare
bodies which wee loue so
much. These two spermes,
saith <hi>Democritus,</hi> are not
found vpon the <hi>earth</hi> of
the <hi>liuing:</hi> The same, saith
<hi>Auicen,</hi> but he addeth, that
they gather them from the
dung, ordure, and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
<hi>Moone.</hi> O happy are they
that know how to gather
them; for of them they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
make a <hi>triacle,</hi>
which hath power ouer all
griefes, maladies, sorrowes,
infirmities, and weaknesses,
and which sighteth puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2423:44"/>
against <hi>death,</hi> leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
the life, according
to the permission of <hi>God,</hi>
euen to the time determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
triumphing ouer the
miseries of this world, and
filling a man with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
thereof. Of these two
<hi>Dragons</hi> or Principles <hi>Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallicke,</hi>
I haue said in my
fore-alledged <hi>Summarie,</hi>
that the Enemy would by
his heate inflame his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and that then if they
take not heed, they should
see in the ayre a venomous
fume &amp; a stinking, worse in
flame, and in poyson, than
the enuenomed head of a
<hi>Serpent,</hi> and <hi>Babylonian
Dragon.</hi> The cause why I
haue painted these two
<hi>Spermes</hi> in the forme of
<hi>Dragons,</hi> is because their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2423:45"/>
stinch is exceeding great,
and like the stinch of them,
and the <hi>exhalations</hi> which
arise within the glasse, are
darke, <hi>blacke, blew,</hi> and <hi>yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish,</hi>
(like as these two
<hi>Dragons</hi> are painted) the
force of which, and of the
<hi>bodies</hi> dissolued, is so veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
that truely there is
not in the world a ranker
<hi>poyson;</hi> for it is able by the
force and stench thereof,
to mortifie and kill euery
thing liuing: The <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>
neuer feeles this <hi>stinch,</hi>
if he breake not his vessels,
but only he iudgeth it to be
such, by the sight, and the

from the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his confections.</p>
                     <p>These colours then signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the <hi>putrefaction</hi> and <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:2423:45"/>
which is giuen vs,
by the biting and dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our <hi>perfect bodies,</hi>
which dissolution procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from externall heate
ayding, and from the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
fierienesse,</hi> and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
sharpe vertue of the
poyson of our <hi>Mercurie,</hi>
which maketh and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
into a pure cloud, that

it: So the heate working

For at the same time,

from the <hi>ashes</hi> of this <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi>
another may spring,
and that the <hi>sonne</hi> may bee

soeuer he see, hee shall

not <hi>putrifie,</hi> hee doeth not

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2423:47"/>
by consequent, the <hi>Stone</hi>
cannot take <hi>vegetatiue</hi> life
to increase and multiply.
And in all truth, I tell thee
againe, that though thou
work vpon the true matter,
if at the beginning, after
thou hast put thy <hi>Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in the <hi>Philosophers
Egge,</hi> that is to say, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
after the fire haue stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them vp, if then, I say,
thou seest not this <hi>head of
the Crow,</hi> the <hi>blacke</hi> of the
<hi>blackest blacke,</hi> thou must
begin againe, for this fault
is irreparable, and not to be
amended; especially the
<hi>Orange colour,</hi> or <hi>halfe red,</hi>
is to be feared, for if at the
beg<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nning thou see that in
thine <hi>Egge,</hi> without doubt,
thou burnest, or hast burnt
the <hi>verdure</hi> and iuelinesse
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2423:48"/>
of thy <hi>Stone.</hi> The colour
which thou must haue,
ought to bee intirely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in <hi>Blacknesse,</hi> like to
that of these <hi>Dragons</hi> in the
space of <hi>fortie dayes:</hi> Let
them therefore which shall
not haue these essentiall
markes, retire themselues
betimes from their operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that they may redeeme
themselues from assured
losse. Know also, and note
it well, that in this Art it is
but nothing to haue this
<hi>blacknesse,</hi> there is nothing
more easie to come by: for
from almost all things in
the world, mixed with
<hi>moysture,</hi> thou mayest haue
a <hi>blacknesse,</hi> by the fire: but
thou must haue a <hi>blacknesse</hi>
which comes of the perfect
<hi>Mettallicke bodies,</hi> which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2423:48"/>
lasts a long space of time,
and is not destroyed in lesse
than <hi>fiue moneths,</hi> after the
which followeth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
the desired <hi>white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
If thou hast this,
thou hast enough, but
not all. As for the colour
<hi>blewish</hi> and <hi>yellowish,</hi> that
signifieth that <hi>Solution</hi> and
<hi>Putrefaction</hi> is not yet fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and that the colours
of our <hi>Mercury</hi> are not as
yet well mingled, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with the rest. Then
this <hi>blacknesse,</hi> and these
colours, teach plainly, that
in this beginning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and compound begins
to rotte and dissolue into
powder, lesse than the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes</hi>
of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the
which afterwards are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into <hi>coator permanent.</hi>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:2423:49"/>
And this dissolution is by
the enuious <hi>Philosophers</hi>
called <hi>Death, Destruction,</hi>
and <hi>Perdition,</hi> because that
the <hi>natures</hi> change their
<hi>forme,</hi> and from hence are
proceeded so many <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of <hi>dead men, tombes,</hi>
and <hi>sepulchres.</hi> Others
haue called it <hi>Calcination,
Denudation, Separation,
Erituration,</hi> and <hi>Assation,</hi>
because the <hi>Confections</hi> are
changed and reduced into
most small pieces and parts.
Others haue called it <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
into the first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Mollification, Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Commixtion, Liquefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

Subtiliation, Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Humation, Impasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>Distillation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the <hi>Confections,</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:2423:49"/>
are melted, brought backe
into s<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

circulated within the glasse.
Others haue called it <hi>Xir,</hi>

Cymmerian darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
a gulfe, Hell, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
Generation, Ingression,
Submersion, Complection,
Coniunction,</hi> and <hi>impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
because that the
matter is black &amp; waterish,
and that the natures are
perfectly mingled, and hold
one of another. For when
the heate of the <hi>Sunne</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vpon them, they are
changed, first into <hi>powder,</hi>
or fat and glutinous <hi>water,</hi>
which feeling the heate,
flyeth on high to the <hi>Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi>
head, with the <hi>smoake,</hi>
that is to say, with the wind
and ayre; from thence this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2423:50"/>
water melted, and drawne
out of the <hi>confections,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
downe againe, and in
descending reduceth, and
resolueth, as much as it can,
the rest of the <hi>Aromatical
confections,</hi> alwayes doing
so, vntill the whole bee like
a blacke broath somewhat
fat. Now you see, why
they call this <hi>sublimation,</hi>
and <hi>volatization,</hi> because it
flyeth on high, and <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
and <hi>Descension,</hi> because
it mounteth, &amp; descendeth
within the glasse. A while
after, the water beginneth
to <hi>thicken</hi> and <hi>coagulate</hi>
somewhat more, growing
very <hi>blacke,</hi> like vnto pitch,
and finally comes the <hi>Body</hi>
and <hi>earth,</hi> which the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

that is, <hi>stinking earth:</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:2423:50"/>
for then because of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>putrefaction,</hi> which is
as naturall as any other can
be; this earth stincks, and
giues a smell like the odour
of <hi>graues</hi> filled with rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

what that is? The blacknesse
is called the head of the

away, at the instant comes
the white colour: Then that

These are his proper

must vnderstand the wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things

it teacheth that you must

wholly forsake his blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and become white in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2423:66"/>
the fashion of a most shining
marble, and of a naked fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
sword, will put on all
the colours that thou canst
possibly imagine, often will
it melt, and often coagulate
it selfe, and amidst these
diuers and contrary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
(which the vegetable
soule which is in it makes it
performe at one and the
same time) it will grow
Citrine, greene, red, (but
not of a true red) it will
become yellow, blew, and
orange colour, vntill that
being wholly ouercome by
drynesse and heate, all these
infinite colours will end in
this admirable Citrine
whitenesse,</hi> of the colour
of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> garments,
which in a short time will
become like the colour of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2423:66"/>
the naked <hi>sword;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the meanes of a
more strong and long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction;
it will take in the
end a <hi>red Citrine</hi> colour,
and afterward the perfect
<hi>redde</hi> of the <hi>vermillion,</hi>
where it will repose it selfe
for euer. I will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
by the way, to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
thee, that the milke of
the <hi>Moone,</hi> is not as the
<hi>Virgins milke</hi> of the <hi>Sunne;</hi>
thinke then that the <hi>inbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions</hi>
of <hi>whitenesse,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a more <hi>white</hi> milke,
than those of a <hi>golden red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
for in this passage I
had thought I should haue
missed, and so I had done
indeed had it not beene for
<hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Iew;</hi> for
this reason I haue made to
bee painted for thee, the

that our <hi>Stone</hi> hath a

by the Industrie of <hi>Arte</hi>
it is turned into a true and

and <hi>Spirit,</hi> of our <hi>white

doe ordinarily vse these
termes of <hi>Art</hi> to hide the
secret from euill men. They
call the <hi>Body</hi> that <hi>blacke
earth,</hi> obscure and darke,
which wee make <hi>white:</hi>
They call the <hi>Soule</hi> the
other halfe diuided from
the <hi>Body,</hi> which by the will
of God, and power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
giues to the <hi>body</hi> by
his inbibitions and fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
a vegetable soule,
that is to say, power and
vertue to bud encrease, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply,
and to become white,
as a naked shining sword:
They call the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the
<hi>tincture</hi> &amp; <hi>drynesse;</hi> which
as a Spirit hath power to
pierce all <hi>Mettallick</hi> things;
I should be too tedious, if
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2423:69"/>
I should shew thee how
good reason they had to
say alwayes and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Our Stone hath sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to a man, a Body, Soule,
and Spirit:</hi> I would onely
that thou note well, that
as a man indued with a
<hi>Body, Soule,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> is
notwithstanding but one;
so likewise thou hast now,
but one onely white con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
in the which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
there are a <hi>Body,</hi> a
<hi>Soule,</hi> and a <hi>Spirit,</hi> which
are inseparably vnited. I
could easily giue very cleare
comparisons and expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this <hi>Body, Soule,</hi> and
<hi>Spirit;</hi> but to explicate
them, I must of necessitie,
speake things, which God
reserues to reueale vnto
them that feare and loue
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2423:69"/>
him, and consequently
ought not to bee written.
I haue then made to bee
painted heere, a <hi>Body,</hi> a
<hi>Soule,</hi> and a <hi>Spirit,</hi> all <hi>white,</hi>
as if they were rising againe,
to shew thee, that the <hi>Sun,</hi>
and <hi>Moone,</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi>
are raised againe in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
that is to say, are
made <hi>Elements</hi> of ayre, and
whitened: for wee haue
heretofore called the <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Death;</hi> and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
the <hi>Metaphor,</hi> wee
may call <hi>Whitenesse, Life;</hi>
which commeth not, but
with, and by a <hi>Resurrection:</hi>
The <hi>Body,</hi> to shew this
more plainely, I haue made
to be painted lifting vp the
stone of his tombe, wherein
it was inclosed: The <hi>Soule,</hi>
because it cannot bee put
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2423:70"/>
into the <hi>earth,</hi> it comes not
out of a <hi>tombe,</hi> but onely I
haue made it bee painted
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the <hi>Tombs,</hi> seeking
its body, in forme of a <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
hauing her haire dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuelled;
The <hi>Spirit</hi>
which likewise cannot bee
put in a graue, I haue made
to bee painted in fashion of
a man comming out of the
<hi>earth,</hi> not from a Tombe.
They are all white; so the
<hi>blacknesse,</hi> that is, <hi>death</hi> is
vanquished, and they being
whitened, are from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
incorruptible. Now
lift vp thine eyes on high,
and see our <hi>King</hi> comming,
crowned and raised againe,
which hath ouercome
Death, the darkenesses, and
moistures; behold him in
the forme wherein our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:2423:70"/>
shall come, who
shall eternally vnite vnto
him all pure and cleane
soules, and will driue away
all impurity and vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as being vnworthy to
bee vnited to his <hi>diuine
Body.</hi> So by comparison
(but first asking leaue of the
<hi>Catholicke, Apostolicke, and
Romane Church,</hi> to speake
in this manner, and praying
euery debonaire soule to
permit me to vse this simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude)
see heere our white
<hi>Elixir,</hi> which from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
will inseparably v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
vnto himselfe euery
pure <hi>Mettallicke</hi> nature,
changing it into his owne
most sine <hi>siluery</hi> nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting
all that is impure,
strange, and <hi>Heterogeneall,</hi>
or of another kind. Blessed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2423:71"/>
be God, which of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
giues vs grace to bee
able to consider this sparck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
white, more perfect
and shining than any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
nature, and more
noble next after the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
soule,</hi> than any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
hauing life, or not
hauing life; for it is a <hi>quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence,</hi>
a most pure <hi>siluer,</hi>
that hath passed the <hi>Coppell,</hi>
and is <hi>seuen times refined,</hi>

                     <p>It is not needfull to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete

signifie, that play on
Instruments ouer the heads
of them which are raised
againe: These are rather
diuine spirits, singing the

operation, than
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2423:71"/>
Angels that call to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
To make an expresse
difference betweene these
and them, I haue giuen the
one of them a <hi>Lute,</hi> the
other a <hi>haultboy,</hi> but none
of them <hi>trumpets,</hi> which
yet are wont to be giuen to
them that are to call vs to
<hi>Iudgement.</hi> The like may
be said of the three Angels,
which are ouer the head of
our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> whereof the
one crowneth him, and the
other two assisting, say in
their <hi>Rowles,</hi> O PATER

thou must inbibe it with a

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2423:72"/>
dried vpon the <hi>Stone.</hi> In
this operation of rubifying,
although thou doe imbibe,
thou shalt not haue much
<hi>blacke,</hi> but of <hi>violet, blew,</hi>
and of the colour of the
<hi>Peacocks taile:</hi> For our
<hi>Stone</hi> is so triumphant in
<hi>drynesse,</hi> that assoone as
thy <hi>Mercury</hi> toucheth it,
the nature thereof reioycing
in his like nature, it is ioyned
vnto it, and drinketh it
greedily, and therefore the
blacke that comes of moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
can shew it selfe but
a little, and that vnder these
colours <hi>violet</hi> and <hi>blew,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that <hi>drynesse</hi> (as is
said) doth by and by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
absolutely. I haue
also made to be painted for

thee, that the two substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

substance, the <hi>fixed</hi> as
well as the <hi>volatile,</hi> being
perfectly fixed together, do
also flie together within thy
vessell: for in this operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the fixed body wil gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mount to heauen, being
all <hi>spirituall,</hi> and from
thence it will descend vnto
the <hi>earth,</hi> and whetherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
thou wilt, following
euery where the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
which is alwayes mooued
vpon the <hi>fire:</hi> Inasmuch as
they are made one selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same

The natures then are

by the apposition of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ntimony</hi> is of
the parts of
<hi>Saturne,</hi> and
hath in euery
respect the
nature thereof: so this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine
Antimonie</hi> agrees
with the <hi>Sunne,</hi> hauing in
it selfe <hi>Argent viue,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
no mettall is drowned
but <hi>gold;</hi> that is to say;
Gold onely is drowned in
<hi>Antimoniall Saturnine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2423:89"/>
viue,</hi> and without that
<hi>Argent viue,</hi> no mettall
can bee whitened: It whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
therefore <hi>Leton,</hi> that
is, <hi>Gold,</hi> and it reduceth a
perfect <hi>Body</hi> into its first
matter, that is, into <hi>Sulphur</hi>
and <hi>Argent viue</hi> of a white
colour, and shining more
than glasse. It dissolues I
say, the perfect Body which
is of his nature; for this
water is friendly, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to the <hi>Mettalls,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
the <hi>Sunne,</hi> because it
containes a white <hi>Argent
viue.</hi> And from hence thou
mayest draw a great secret,
to wit, that the water of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine
Antimony</hi> ought to
be <hi>Mercuriall</hi> and <hi>white,</hi>
to the end that it may whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the <hi>Gold,</hi> not burning
it, but dissoluing and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2423:89"/>
congealing it to the
forme of white <hi>Creame.</hi>
Therefore, saith the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,</hi>
that this water ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the <hi>Body</hi> to bee <hi>vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
because after it hath
beene dissolued in this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and cooled againe, it
mounts aloft vpon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the water; <hi>Take</hi>
(saith he) <hi>gold</hi> crude, folia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
laminated, or calcined
with <hi>Mercury,</hi> and put it
into our <hi>Vinegre Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,
Saturnine, Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi>
and drawne from <hi>Sal
Ammoniack</hi> (as is said) in a
broad vessell of glasse, foure
fingers high or more, and
leaue it there in a temperate
heate; and in short time
thou wilt see lifted vp, as
it were a liquor of oyle
swimming aloft, in manner
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2423:90"/>
of a thinne skinne: That ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a spoone, or with
a feather, dipping it in, and
so doing many times in a
day, vntill there doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more arise; afterward
make the <hi>water</hi> vapour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the fire, that is to
say, the superfluous humor
of the <hi>vinegre,</hi> and there
will remain vnto thee a <hi>fifth
essence</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> in forme of
a white oyle incombustible,
wherein the <hi>Phylosophers</hi>
haue placed their greatest
secrets; and this <hi>oyle</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>sweete,</hi> and is of
great power to mitigate the
pain and griefe of wounds.
All the secret then of this
secret <hi>Antimoniall,</hi> is that
by vertue thereof we know
how to extract &amp; draw out
of the body of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesia,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2423:90"/>
Argent viue,</hi> not
burning, (and this is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
and <hi>Mercuriall subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate)</hi>
that is, we must draw
a water liuing, incombusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and then congeale it
with the perfect <hi>Body</hi> of
the <hi>Sunne,</hi> which is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
therein, into a nature
and substance white, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
as if it were creame,
which maketh it all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
white: Neuerthelesse,
first of all this <hi>Sunne</hi> in his
putrifaction and resolution
in this water, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
will loose his light, be
darkened, &amp; become <hi>black,</hi>
and afterward will lift him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vpon the water, and
there will swimme vpon it
by little and little a white
colour i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a white substance.
And this is called to <hi>whiten
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2423:91"/>
the red Leton,</hi> to sublime it
<hi>Phylosophically,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it into his first matter,
that is to say, into white
<hi>Sulphur</hi> incombustible, and
into <hi>Argent viue</hi> fixed;
and so the terminated moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
that is to say, <hi>Gold,</hi>
our <hi>Body,</hi> by the reiteration
of liquefaction in this our
dissoluing water, is turned
and reduced into <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
and <hi>Argent viue</hi> fixed:
And so the perfect <hi>Body</hi> of
the <hi>Sunne</hi> taketh life in this
water, is reuiued, inspired,
encreased, and multiplied in
his kind, as all other things
are; for in this water it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to passe, that the <hi>Body</hi>
compounded of <hi>two bodies,</hi>
of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and of the
<hi>Moone,</hi> puffeth vp, swelleth,
putrisieth as a graine of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2423:91"/>
Corne, becommeth great
with young, is lifted vp, and
encreaseth, taking the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
&amp; nature, liuing and
vegetable.</p>
                  <p>Also our water, or our
foresaid <hi>vinegre,</hi> is the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negre</hi>
of <hi>Mountaines,</hi> that
is to say, of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
<hi>Moone,</hi> and therefore it is
mixed with the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
<hi>Moon,</hi> and cleaueth to them
perpetually: to wit, the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
taketh from this <hi>water</hi>
the tincture of <hi>whitenesse,</hi>
and with it (the <hi>water)</hi>
shineth with inestimable
brightnesse. Hee therefore
that knowes how to turne
the <hi>Body</hi> into white <hi>siluer</hi>
medicinall, hee may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by this white <hi>gold,</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
turne all imperfect met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
into very good and fine
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2423:92"/>
siluer. And this <hi>white gold,</hi>
is by the <hi>Phylosophers</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
their <hi>white Moone,</hi> the
<hi>white Argent viue</hi> fixed, the
<hi>Gold</hi> of <hi>Alchimy,</hi> and the
<hi>white smoake.</hi> Therefore
without that our <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall</hi>
vinegre, the <hi>white gold</hi>
of <hi>Alchimy,</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be made.
And because in our <hi>vinegre</hi>
there is a double substance
of <hi>Argent viue,</hi> one of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi>
and another of
<hi>Mercury</hi> sublimed; it doth
therefore giue a double
weight &amp; substance of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
viue</hi> fixed, and also
augments therein <hi>(in the
gold)</hi> the naturall colour,
weight, substance, and tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Therefore our dissoluing
water, carries a great tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and great fusion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2423:92"/>
that when it feeles
the common fire, if there be
in it the perfect <hi>Body</hi> of the
<hi>Sunne</hi> or of the <hi>Moone,</hi> it
suddenly maketh it to bee
melted, and to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his substance, <hi>white</hi> as it
is, &amp; addes colour, weight,
and tincture to the <hi>Body.</hi>
It hath also power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
all things that may be
melted, and it is a ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
body, viscous, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and honourable, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
all crude bodies into
their first matter, that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Earth,</hi> &amp; a viscous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that is to say, into <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
and <hi>Argent viue.</hi> If
therefore thou put into this
water any mettall, filed, or
attenuated, and leauest it for
a time in a gentle heate, it
will bee all dissolued, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2423:93"/>
changed into a <hi>viscous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
or a <hi>white oyle,</hi> as is said.
And so it molifies the <hi>Body,</hi>
and prepares it to <hi>fusion</hi> &amp;
<hi>liquefaction,</hi> nay, it makes
all things fusible, that is,
stones and mettals, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
giues them spirit
and life. Therefore it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solues
all things with a
wonderful solution, turning
the perfect <hi>Body</hi> into a fusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
medicine, melting, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating,
and more fixed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
the weight and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                  <p>Worke therefore with
it, and thou shalt obtaine
from it that which thou
desirest; for it is the <hi>spirit</hi>
and the <hi>soule</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi>
and the <hi>Moone,</hi> it is the <hi>oyle,</hi>
the dissoluing <hi>water,</hi> the
<hi>fountaine,</hi> the <hi>Balneum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2423:93"/>
the fire against Nature,</hi>
the <hi>moist fire,</hi> the <hi>secret, hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and inuisible <hi>fire,</hi> and
the most sharpe <hi>vinegre,</hi> of
which a certaine ancient
<hi>Phylosopher</hi> said, <hi>I besought
the Lord, and hee shewed me
a certain cleane water, which
I knew to be the pure vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre,
altering, piercing, and
digesting.</hi> The vinegre I say
penetratiue, and the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
mouing the <hi>gold</hi> or
the <hi>siluer,</hi> to putrifie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue,
and to be reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his first matter, and it is
the onely <hi>Agent</hi> in the
whole World for this Art,
that can resolue and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crudate,
or make raw againe
the <hi>Mettallicke Bodies,</hi> with
the conseruation of their
<hi>species.</hi> It is therefore the
onely fit and natural mean,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2423:94"/>
by which we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
the perfect <hi>Bodies</hi> of
the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> by an
admirable and solemne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
vnder the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of their <hi>species,</hi> and
without any destruction,
vnlesse it be to a new, more
noble, and better forme, or
generation, that is to say,
into the perfect <hi>Stone</hi> of the
<hi>Phylosophers,</hi> which is their
wonderfull, and hidden se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
                  <p>Now this water is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
middle substance, cleere
as pure <hi>siluer,</hi> which ought
to receiue the tinctures of
the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> to
the end that it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
and conuerted into
white and liuing <hi>Earth;</hi> for
this water hath need of the
perfect bodies, that with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2423:94"/>
them after dissolution, it
may bee congealed, fixed,
and coagulated into <hi>white
Earth;</hi> and their <hi>solution</hi> is
also their <hi>congelation,</hi> for
they haue one and the same
operation, for the one is not
dissolued, but that the other
is congealed; neither is
there any other water
which can dissolue the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
but that which abideth
with them in matter and
forme; nay, it cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
except it bee of the
nature of the other body,
that they may be made one
together. Therefore when
thou seest the <hi>water</hi> coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it selfe with the <hi>Bodies</hi>
that bee dissolued therein,
rest assured that thy <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Methode,</hi> and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are true and <hi>Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall,</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:2423:95"/>
and that thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedest
aright in the <hi>Art.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nature</hi> then <hi>is amended
in its like nature;</hi> that is,
<hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Siluer</hi> are amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in our <hi>water,</hi> as our <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
also with the <hi>Bodies;</hi>
which water is called the
meane of the <hi>Soule,</hi> without
the which wee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this <hi>Art;</hi> and it is
the vegetable, animall, and
minerall fire, preseruing the
fixed spirits of the <hi>Sunne</hi>
and <hi>Moone,</hi> the destroyer
and the Conquerour of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
because it destroyes,
dissolues, and changeth <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and mettallick formes,
and makes them to bee no
<hi>Bodies,</hi> but a fixed spirit, and
turneth them into a moist,
soft, and fluid substance,
which hath ingression and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2423:95"/>
power to enter into other
imperfect <hi>Bodies,</hi> and to be
mixed with them by the
smallest parts, and to colour
them and make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
which they could not
doe when they were <hi>Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallicke</hi>
bodies dry &amp; hard,
which haue no entrance,
nor power to colour and
make perfect imperfect <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
And therefore to good
purpose doe wee turne the
<hi>bodies</hi> into a fluid substance,
because euery tincture will
colour a thousand times
more, when it is in a soft and
liquid substance, then when
it is in a dry one, as appeares
by <hi>Saffron:</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the transmutation
of imperfect <hi>Bodies,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be done by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Bodies,</hi> while they are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2423:96"/>
dry, except they bee first
brought backe into their
first matter, soft and fluid:
from hence wee conclude,
that we must make the <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi>
returne, and so reueale
that which is hidden;
which is called the <hi>reincru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
or the making raw
againe of the <hi>Bodies,</hi> that is,
the boyling and the softe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, vntill they bee
depriued of their hard and
dry <hi>corporality,</hi> or bodily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
because that which is
dry, doth not enter, nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
any more then it selfe.
Therefore the dry Earthly
<hi>Body</hi> doth not teine, except
it be teined, because as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue-said,
that which is
thicke and Earthy, entreth
not, nor coloureth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it entreth not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2423:96"/>
it alters not; wherefore
<hi>Gold</hi> coloureth not, vntill
the hidden spirit be drawne
from the belly thereof by
our <hi>white water,</hi> and that it
be made altogether a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and <hi>white fume,</hi> the
<hi>white spirit,</hi> and the <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
soule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore wee ought
by our water, to attenuate,
alter, and soften the <hi>perfect
Bodies,</hi> that they may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
be mixed with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>imperfect Bodies:</hi> And
therefore if wee had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profit by that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
water,</hi> then this,
that it makes the <hi>Bodies</hi>
subtile, soft, and fluid, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his owne nature,
yet it were sufficient for vs:
for it brings backe the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
to their first originall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2423:97"/>
of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi>
that of these, we may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in a short time, in lesse
then <hi>one houre</hi> of the day,
doe that aboue ground,
which Nature wrought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground in the mines of
the Earth in a <hi>thousand
yeeres,</hi> which is as it were
miraculous. And therefore
our finall secret, is by our
water to make the <hi>Bodies
volatile, spirituall,</hi> and a tei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
water, which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
or entrance into
the other <hi>Bodies:</hi> for it
makes the <hi>Bodies</hi> to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>spirit,</hi> because it doth <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate,</hi>
(that is, bring to the
temper and consistence of
waxe) the hard and dry <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
and prepares them to
fusion, that is, turnes them
into a permanent or abiding
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2423:97"/>
water. It makes then of the
<hi>Bodies</hi> a most precious bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Oyle,</hi> which is the true
tincture, and the white <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
water,</hi> of nature hot
&amp; moist, temperate, subtile,
and fusible as waxe, which
pierceth, reacheth to the
bottome, coloureth, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
perfect. Therefore our
water doth incontinently
dissolue <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>siluer,</hi> and
maketh them an incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible
Oyle, which may
then be mixed with other
imperfect <hi>Bodies:</hi> for our
water turnes the <hi>Bodies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the nature of a fusible
<hi>salt,</hi> which is by the <hi>Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
called, <hi>Sal Albroe,</hi>
which is the best and the
noblest of all salts, being in
the regiment thereof fixed,
and not flying the fire, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2423:98"/>
it is indeed an oyle, of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hot, subtile, penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
reaching to the depth
and entring, called the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<hi>Elixir,</hi> and it is the
hidden secret of the wise
<hi>Alchimists.</hi> Hee therefore
that knoweth this <hi>salt</hi> of
the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and
the generation, or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, and afterwards
how to mixe it, and make it
friendly to the other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
bodies; hee in truth
knoweth one of the greatest
secrets of Nature, and one
way of perfection.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Bodies</hi> thus dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by our <hi>water,</hi> are called
<hi>Argent viue,</hi> which is not
without <hi>Sulphur,</hi> nor <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
without the nature of
the <hi>Luminaries</hi> (or lights)
because that the Lights (the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2423:98"/>
                     <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone)</hi> are the
principall meanes, or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
things, in the forme, by
which <hi>Nature</hi> passeth in
the perfecting and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
the generation
thereof: And this <hi>Quick-siluer,</hi>
is called the <hi>Salt</hi>
honoured, and animated
and pregnant, (or great
with Childe) and <hi>fire,</hi>
seeing that it is nothing
but <hi>fire,</hi> nor <hi>fire,</hi> but <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
nor <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but
<hi>quicke-siluer,</hi> drawne from
the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> by our
water, and reduced to a
stone of great price; that is
to say, it is the matter of the
<hi>Lights,</hi> altered from base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
vnto noblenesse. Note
that this white Sulphur is
the Father of <hi>Mettals,</hi> and
their Mother together, it is
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2423:99"/>
our <hi>Mercury;</hi> and the <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
of <hi>Gold,</hi> and the <hi>Soule,</hi>
and the <hi>ferment,</hi> and the
minerall vertue, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<hi>Body,</hi> and the perfect
<hi>Medicine,</hi> our <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and
our <hi>Quick-siluer,</hi> that is,
<hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and
<hi>Quick-siluer</hi> of <hi>Quick-sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi>
and <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
The property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of our water is that it
melteth <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>siluer,</hi> and
augments in them their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
colour; for it turnes the
<hi>Bodies</hi> from <hi>Corporality,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Spirituality,</hi> and this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is which sends into
the <hi>Body</hi> a white fume,
which is the white soule,
subtile, hot, and of much
fierinesse. This water is also
called the <hi>bloudy stone,</hi> and
it is the vertue of the <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2423:99"/>
bloud,</hi> without which
nothing is done, &amp; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of all liquable things,
and of liquefaction, which
agrees very well, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to the <hi>Sunne</hi> and the
<hi>Moone,</hi> neither is it euer se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from them, for it is
of kinne to the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
to the <hi>Moone,</hi> but more to
the <hi>Sun</hi> then to the <hi>Moone;
Note this well:</hi> It is also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>mean</hi> of conioyning
the tinctures of the <hi>Sunne</hi>
and <hi>Moone</hi> with imperfect
<hi>Mettals;</hi> for it turnes the
<hi>Bodies</hi> into a true <hi>tincture</hi>
to teine the other imperfect
<hi>Mettals,</hi> and it is the water
which <hi>whiteneth,</hi> as it is
<hi>white,</hi> which quickeneth as
it is a <hi>soule;</hi> and therefore (as
the <hi>Phylosopher</hi> saith) soone
entreth into its <hi>body.</hi> For it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2423:100"/>
is a liuing water, which
commeth to moisten its
<hi>earth,</hi> that it may budde,
and bring forth fruit in his
time, as all things springing
from the <hi>Earth,</hi> are engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by the <hi>dew</hi> or <hi>moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</hi>
The <hi>Earth</hi> therefore
buddeth not without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
and moisture: It is the
water of <hi>May-dew,</hi> that
clenseth the <hi>Bodies,</hi> that
pierceth them like raine wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whiteneth them, and
maketh <hi>one</hi> new <hi>Body</hi> of
<hi>two Bodies.</hi> This water of
life being rightly ordered
with his <hi>Body,</hi> whiteneth it,
&amp; turneth it into his white
colour; for the <hi>water</hi> is a
white fume, and therefore
the <hi>Body</hi> is whitened by it:
<hi>whiten the Body then, and
burne thy Bookes.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2423:100"/>
these two, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the <hi>Body</hi> and the
<hi>water,</hi> there is friendship,
desire, and lust, as betweene
the <hi>male</hi> and the <hi>foemale,</hi>
because of the neerenesse of
their like natures: for our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
liuing water is called
<hi>Azot,</hi> washing the <hi>Leton,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Body,</hi> compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi>
by our first water. This se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
water is also called the
<hi>soule</hi> of our dissolued <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
of which <hi>Bodies</hi> wee
haue already tyed the <hi>soules</hi>
together, to the end that
they may serue the wise
<hi>Phylosophers.</hi> O how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and magnificent is this
<hi>water,</hi> for without it the
worke could neuer bee
brought to passe! It is also
called the vessell of <hi>Nature,</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:2423:101"/>
the belly, the wombe, the
receptacle of the tincture,
the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the Nurse. It
is the Fountaine in which
the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queene</hi> wash
themselues, and the <hi>Mother</hi>
which must be put and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the belly of her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi>
that is, the <hi>Sun</hi> which
proceeded from her, and
which shee brought forth:
and therefore they loue one
another as a <hi>Mother</hi> and a
<hi>Sonne,</hi> and are easily ioyned
together, because they came
from one &amp; the same roote,
and are of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and nature. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this water is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>vegetable</hi> life,
therefore it giueth <hi>life,</hi> and
maketh the dead body to
vegetate, encrease, &amp; spring
forth, and to rise from <hi>death</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:2423:101"/>
to <hi>life,</hi> by <hi>solution</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation;</hi>
and in so doing,
the <hi>Body</hi> is turned into a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
and the <hi>spirit</hi> into a <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
and then is made amity,
peace, concord, and vnion
between the contraries, that
is, betweene the <hi>Body</hi> and
the <hi>spirit,</hi> which reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
change their natures,
which they receiue and
communicate to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the least parts, so
that the <hi>hot</hi> is mixed with
the <hi>cold,</hi> the <hi>dry</hi> with the
<hi>moist,</hi> and the <hi>hard</hi> with
the <hi>soft;</hi> and thus is there a
mixture made of contrary
natures, that is, of <hi>cold</hi> with
<hi>hot,</hi> and of <hi>moist</hi> with <hi>dry,</hi>
an admirable connexion &amp;
coniunction of enemies.
Then our dissolution of <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
which is made in this
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2423:102"/>
first water, is no other thing
then a killing of the <hi>moist</hi>
with the <hi>dry,</hi> because the
<hi>moist</hi> is coagulated with
the <hi>dry,</hi> for the moisture is
contained, terminated, and
coagulated into a <hi>Body,</hi> or
into <hi>Earth,</hi> onely by <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
Let therefore the hard
and dry <hi>bodies</hi> be put in our
first water in a vessell well
shut, where they may abide
vntill they be dissolued, and
ascend on high, and then
they may bee called a <hi>new
Body,</hi> the <hi>white gold of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimy,</hi>
the <hi>white stone,</hi> the
<hi>white Sulphur,</hi> not burning,
and the <hi>stone</hi> of <hi>Paradice,</hi>
that is, the <hi>stone</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts
imperfect <hi>Mettals</hi> into
fine white siluer: Hauing
this, we haue also the <hi>Body,
Soule,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2423:102"/>
of the which <hi>spirit</hi> and
<hi>soule</hi> it is said, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be drawn from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Bodies,</hi> but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of our dissoluing
water, because it is certaine
that the thing <hi>fixed,</hi> cannot
belifted vp, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of the thing <hi>vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</hi>
The <hi>spirit</hi> then by the
mediation of <hi>water</hi> and the
<hi>soule,</hi> is drawne from the
<hi>Bodies,</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> is made
no <hi>Body,</hi> because at the same
instant the spirit with the
soule of the <hi>Bodies</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
on high into the vpper
part, which is the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>stone,</hi> and is called
<hi>sublimation.</hi> This <hi>sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
(saith <hi>Florentius Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus)</hi>
is done by things
sharpe, spirituall, and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
which are of a sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2423:103"/>
and viscous nature,
which dissolue the <hi>Bodies,</hi>
and make them to be lifted
vp into the Ayre in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
And in this <hi>sublimation</hi>
a certaine part and portion
of our said first <hi>water</hi> ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
with the <hi>Bodies,</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it selfe to them, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and subliming into a
middle substance, which
holdeth of the nature of the
two, that is, of the <hi>Bodies,</hi>
and of the <hi>water;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
&amp; spirituall compound,
<hi>Corsufle, Cambdr, Ethelia,
Zandarach,</hi> the <hi>good Due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nech,</hi>
but properly it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the <hi>water perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi>
because it flyeth not in
the fire, alwayes adhering
to the commixed <hi>Bodies,</hi>
that is, to the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2423:103"/>
                     <hi>Moone,</hi> and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vnto them a liuing tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
incombustible, and
most firme, more noble and
precious then the former
which these <hi>bodies</hi> had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
from hence-forward
this tincture can run as <hi>oyle</hi>
vpon the <hi>bodies,</hi> perforating
and piercing with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
<hi>fixion,</hi> because this
<hi>Tincture</hi> is the <hi>spirit,</hi> and
the <hi>spirit</hi> is the <hi>soule,</hi> and
the <hi>soule</hi> is the <hi>body,</hi> because
in this operation the <hi>body</hi> is
made a <hi>spirit</hi> of a most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
nature, and likewise the
<hi>spirit</hi> is <hi>incorporated,</hi> and
is made of the nature of a
<hi>body</hi> with <hi>bodies,</hi> and so our
<hi>stone</hi> contains a <hi>body,</hi> a <hi>soule,</hi>
and a <hi>spirit. O Nature</hi> how
thou changest the <hi>body</hi> into
a <hi>spirit,</hi> which thou couldst
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2423:104"/>
not doe, if the <hi>spirit</hi> were
not incorporated with the
<hi>bodies,</hi> and the <hi>bodies</hi> with
the <hi>spirits</hi> made volatile, or
flying, and afterward <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent</hi>
or <hi>abiding.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they haue passed into
one another, and are turned
the one into the other by
wisdome. <hi>O wisdome,</hi> how
thou makest <hi>Gold</hi> to be <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile</hi>
and fugitiue, although
by nature it be most <hi>fixed.</hi>
It behoueth therefore to
dissolue and melt these <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
by our water, and to
make them a permanent
water, a <hi>golden water</hi> subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
leauing in the bottom
the grosse, earthly, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
dry. And in this
sublimation the <hi>fire</hi> ought
to be soft, and gentle; for if
in this sublimation the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:2423:104"/>
bee not purified in a
lent or slow fire, and the
grosser earthly parts <hi>(note
well)</hi> separated from the
vncleannesse of the <hi>dead,</hi>
thou shalt be hindred from
euer making thy worke
perfect; for thou needest
onely this subtile and light
nature of the dissolued <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
which our water will
easily giue thee, if thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with a slow fire, for it
will separate the <hi>Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall</hi>
(or that which is of
another kinde) from the
<hi>Homogeneall,</hi> (or that
which is all of one kinde.)</p>
                  <p>Our compound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
receiueth mundificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or clensing by our <hi>moist
fire,</hi> that is to say, dissoluing
and subliming that which
is pure and <hi>white,</hi> and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2423:105"/>
aside the <hi>foeces, like a
voluntary vomit</hi> (saith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinaban.)</hi>
For in such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and naturall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation,
there is made a
loosing, or an vntying of
the <hi>Elements,</hi> a clensing and
a separation of the pure
from the impure, so that the
pure and white ascendeth
vpward, and the impure
and earthly fixed remaines
in the bottome of the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
or the <hi>vessell,</hi> which
must be taken a way and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued,
because it is of no
value, taking onely the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<hi>white substance,</hi> flowing
and melting, and leauing
the <hi>foeculent earth,</hi> which
remained below in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
which came princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
from the water, and
is the drosse, and the <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2423:105"/>
earth,</hi> which is nothing
worth, nor can euer doe
any good, as doth the pure,
cleare, white and cleane
matter, which wee ought
onely to take. And against
this <hi>Capharaean</hi> rocke, the
<hi>ship</hi> and knowledge of the
<hi>Schollers</hi> and <hi>students</hi> in
<hi>Philosophy,</hi> is often (as it
happened also vnto mee
sometimes) most improui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
dashed and beaten,
because the <hi>Phylosophers</hi>
doe very often affirme the
contrary, namely, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
must be remooued or
taken away, but the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
that is, the <hi>Blacknesse,</hi>
which notwithstanding
they say and write, onely to
deceiue the vnwise, grosse,
and ignorant, which of
themselues without a <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:2423:106"/>
vnwearied <hi>reading,</hi>
or <hi>Prayer</hi> vnto <hi>God</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
would like conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
carry away this gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fleece.</p>
                  <p>Note therefore, that this
separation, diuision, and
sublimation, is without
doubt the <hi>key</hi> of the whole
worke. After the putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then, and dissolution of
these <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>Bodies</hi> doe
lift themselues vp to the
surface of the dissoluing
water, in the colour of
<hi>whitenesse,</hi> and this <hi>white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
is <hi>life;</hi> for in this
<hi>whitenesse,</hi> the <hi>Antimoniall</hi>
and <hi>Mercuriall soule,</hi> is by
the appointment of nature,
infused with the Spirits of
the <hi>Sunne</hi> &amp; <hi>Moone,</hi> which
separateth the subtile from
the thicke, and the pure
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2423:106"/>
from the impure, lifting vp
by little and little, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
part of the <hi>Body,</hi> from
the dregs, vntill all the pure
be separated and lifted vp:
And in this is our <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall</hi>
and naturall subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
fulfilled: And in
this <hi>whitenesse</hi> is the soule
infused into the <hi>Body,</hi> that
is, the mineral vertue, which
is more subtile than <hi>fire,</hi>
being indeed the true quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence
and life, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
to bee borne, and to
put off the grosse earthly
<hi>foeces,</hi> which it hath taken
from the <hi>Menstruous</hi> and
corrupt place of his <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
And in this is our
<hi>Philosophicall</hi> sublimation,
not in the naughty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Mercury,</hi> which hath
no qualities like vnto them,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2423:107"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:2423:107"/>

                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:2423:108"/>
wherewith our <hi>Mercury</hi>
drawne from his <hi>vitriolate</hi>
cauernes, is adorned. But
let vs returne to our <hi>subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
It is therefore most
certaine in this <hi>Art,</hi> that
this <hi>soule</hi> drawne from the
<hi>Bodies,</hi> cannot be lifted vp,
but by the putting to of a
volatile thing, which is of
his owne kinde; by the
which the <hi>Bodies</hi> are made
<hi>volatile</hi> and spirituall, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp, subtiliating, and
subliming themselues, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their owne proper
nature, which is <hi>bodily,</hi>
heauy and ponderous; and
by this meanes they are
made no <hi>Bodies,</hi> but incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,
and a <hi>fifth essence,</hi>
of the nature of the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
which is called <hi>Hermes</hi> his
<hi>Bird,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> drawne
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2423:108"/>
from the <hi>red</hi> seruant; and
so the earthy parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
below, or rather the
grosser parts of the <hi>Bodies,</hi>
which cannot by any wit
or deuice of man be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dissolued. And this <hi>white
fume,</hi> this <hi>white gold,</hi> that
is, this <hi>quintessence,</hi> is also
called the compound <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesia,</hi>
which as a <hi>man,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
or like a <hi>man</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of a <hi>Body,</hi> a <hi>Soule,</hi>
and a <hi>Spirit:</hi> For the <hi>Body</hi>
is the fixed <hi>earth</hi> of the
<hi>Sunne,</hi> which is more than
most fine, ponderously lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp, by the force of our
diuine water; The soule is
the tincture of the <hi>Sunne</hi>
and of the <hi>Moone,</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from the coniunction
or communication of these
two: But the spirit is the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2423:109"/>
minerall vertue of the two
<hi>Bodies,</hi> and of the <hi>water,</hi>
which carries the <hi>soule,</hi> or
the white tincture vpon the
<hi>Bodies,</hi> and out of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
as the tincture of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
is carried by water vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>cloth.</hi> And that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall</hi>
spirit is the Bond or
tyall of the soule of the <hi>Sun;</hi>
And the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi>
is the <hi>Body</hi> of fiction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
with the <hi>Moone</hi> the
spirit and soule. The <hi>spirit</hi>
therefore pierceth, the <hi>body</hi>
fixeth, the <hi>soule</hi> coupleth,
coloureth and whiteneth.
Of these three vnited toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is our <hi>Stone</hi> made,
that is, of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and
<hi>Moone,</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi>
Then with our gilded (or
golden) <hi>water,</hi> is extracted
a nature surpassing all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2423:109"/>
and therefore except
the <hi>bodies</hi> bee by this our
water dissolued, imbibed,
ground, softened, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
and diligently go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned,
vntill they leaue
their grossenesse and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and be turned into a
thinne and impalpable spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
our labour will alwayes
be in vaine, for vnlesse the
<hi>bodies</hi> bee changed into no
<hi>bodies,</hi> that is, into the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
Mercury,</hi> the rule
of Art is not yet found, and
the reason is, because it is
impossible to draw out of
the <hi>bodies</hi> that most thinne
or subtile <hi>soule,</hi> which hath
in it all tincture, if the <hi>bodies</hi>
be not first dissolued in our
water. Dissolue therefore
the <hi>bodies</hi> in the <hi>golden wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and boyle them, vntill
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2423:110"/>
by the water all the tincture
come out into a <hi>white</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or a <hi>white oyle,</hi> and
when thou shalt see this
whitenesse vpon the <hi>water,</hi>
then know that the <hi>bodies</hi>
are dissolued or melted, and
continue the decoction, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they bring foorth the
<hi>cloude</hi> which they haue
conceiued, darke, blacke,
and white. Put therefore
the perfect <hi>bodies</hi> in our
water, in a vessell <hi>Hermeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
sealed, vpon a soft
fire, and boyle them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
vntill they bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
resolued into a most
precious <hi>oyle:</hi> Boyle them
(saith <hi>Adfar)</hi> with a gentle
fire, as it were for the hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>chickens,</hi> vntill the
<hi>bodies</hi> bee dissolued, and
their tincture most neerely
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2423:110"/>
conioyned, <hi>(marke well)</hi>
be wholly drawne out: for
it is not drawne out all at
once, but it commeth forth
by little and little, euery day
and euery houre, vntill after
a long time this dissolution
be complete, &amp; that which
is dissolued do alwaies arise
vppermost vpon the <hi>water.</hi>
And in this dissolution let
the fire bee soft and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall,
vntill the <hi>bodies</hi> bee
loosed into a viscous impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
water, and that the
whole <hi>tincture</hi> come forth,
first in the colour of <hi>blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
which is a signe of
true <hi>solution:</hi> Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the decoction, vntill it
become a <hi>white permanent
water,</hi> for gouerning it in
its bath, it will afterward be
cleare, and in the end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2423:111"/>
like common <hi>argent
viue,</hi> climing thorow the
ayre vpon the <hi>first water.</hi>
And therefore when thou
seest the <hi>bodies</hi> dissolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>viscous</hi> water, then
know that they are turned
into a <hi>vapour,</hi> and that thou
hast the <hi>soules</hi> separated
from the <hi>dead bodies,</hi> and
by sublimation brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the order and estate of
<hi>spirits,</hi> whereupon both of
them with a part of our <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
are made <hi>spirits,</hi> flying
and clyming into the <hi>ayre,</hi>
and that there the <hi>body</hi>
compounded of the <hi>male</hi>
and <hi>female,</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi>
and <hi>Moone,</hi> and of that most
subtile nature, clensed by
<hi>sublimation,</hi> taketh life, is
inspired by his moysture,
that is, by his <hi>water,</hi> as a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2423:111"/>
man by the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from hencefoorth it
will multiply, and increase
in his kinde, like all other
things. And therefore in
such an <hi>eleuation</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical</hi>
sublimation, they
are all ioyned one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and the new body,
inspired by the <hi>Ayre,</hi> liueth
vegetably, which is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Wherefore vnlesse the
<hi>Bodies</hi> bee subtilized and
made thinne by <hi>fire</hi> and
<hi>water,</hi> vntill they doe arise
like <hi>spirits,</hi> and bee made
like water and fume, or like
<hi>Mercury,</hi> there is nothing
done in this <hi>Arte.</hi> But
when they ascend, they are
borne in the ayre, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the ayre, and are
made life with life, in such
sort that they can neuer bee
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2423:112"/>
separated, as <hi>water</hi> mixt
with <hi>water.</hi> And therefore
it is wisely said that the
Stone is borne in the <hi>Ayre,</hi>
because it is altogether <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall;</hi>
for <hi>the vulture
flying without wings, crieth
vpon the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
saying, I am the white
of the blacke, and the red of
the white, and the Citrine
sonne of the red, I tell truth,
and lie not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It sufficeth thee therefore
to put the <hi>Bodies</hi> in the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
and in the water once
for all, and to shut the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
diligently, vntill a true
separation be made, which
by the enuious is called
<hi>coniunction, sublimation,
assation, extraction, putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
ligation, despousa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
subtiliation, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2423:112"/>
&amp;c.</hi> and that the
whole <hi>Maistery</hi> bee done.
Doe therefore as in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of a <hi>man,</hi> and euery
<hi>vegetable,</hi> put the seed once
into the <hi>wombe,</hi> and shut it
well. By this meanes thou
seest that thou needest not
many things, and that our
worke requires no great
charges, because there is but
one <hi>Stone,</hi> one <hi>Medicine,</hi>
one <hi>Vessell,</hi> one <hi>Regiment,</hi>
and one successiue <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to the <hi>white,</hi> and to
the <hi>red.</hi> And although we
say in many places <hi>take
this,</hi> and <hi>take that,</hi> yet wee
vnderstand that it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to take but <hi>one</hi> thing,
and put it <hi>once</hi> in the vessell,
and to shut the vessell vntill
the worke be perfected; for
these things are so set down
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2423:113"/>
by the enuious <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
to deceiue the vnwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as is aforesaid. For is
not this Art <hi>Cabalisticall,</hi>
and full of secrets? And
doest thou, foole, beleeue
that wee doe openly teach
the <hi>secrets of secrets?</hi> and
doest thou take our words
according to the literall
sound? Know assuredly,
(I am no whit enuious as
others are) he that takes the
words of the other <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,</hi>
according to the
ordinary signification and
sound of them, hee doeth
already, hauing lost <hi>Ariad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
thread, wander in the
middest of the <hi>Laberinth,</hi>
and hath as good as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
his money to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
But I, <hi>Artephius,</hi>
after I had learned all the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2423:113"/>
                     <hi>Art</hi> and perfect <hi>Science</hi> in
the Bookes of the true-spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Hermes,</hi> was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
enuious, as all the
rest, but when I had by the
space of a <hi>thousand</hi> yeeres,
or thereabouts (which are
now passed ouer mee since
my natiuity, by the onely
grace of God Almighty,
and the vse of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>fifth essence)</hi> when, I
say, for so long time I had
seene no man that could
worke the <hi>Maistery</hi> of
<hi>Hermes,</hi> by reason of the
obscurity of the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
words, mooued with
pitie, and with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
becomming an honest
man, I haue determined in
these last times of my life
to write all things truely
and sincerely that thou
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2423:114"/>
maist want or desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the perfecting of
the <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi>
(excepting a certaine thing,
which it is not lawfull for
any person to say or to
write, because it is alwayes
reuealed by <hi>God,</hi> or by a
<hi>Maister,</hi> and yet in this
Booke, he that is not stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked,
shall with a little
experience, easily learne it.)
I haue therefore in this
Booke written the naked
trueth, although cloathed
with a few colours, that
euery good and wise man,
may from this <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
Tree happily gather
the admirable Apples of
the <hi>Hesperides.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
praised bee the most
high <hi>God,</hi> which hath put
this benignitie into our
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2423:114"/>
soule, and with a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
long olde age, hath
giuen vs a true dilection
of heart, wherewithall it
seemeth vnto mee, that I
doe truely loue, cherish, and
imbrace all men. But let
vs returne vnto the <hi>Arte.</hi>
Surely our worke is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispatched, for that
which the heate of the
<hi>Sunne</hi> doeth in a hundred
yeeres in the Mines of the
Earth for the generation of
a <hi>Mettall,</hi> (as I haue often
seene) our <hi>secret fire,</hi> that
is, our fierie <hi>sulphureous
water,</hi> which is called <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum
Mariae,</hi> worketh in
short time.</p>
                  <p>And this work is no great
labour to him that knoweth
and vnderstandeth it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the matter so deare,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2423:115"/>
(considering a small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
sufficeth) that it ought
to cause any man to plucke
backe his hand, because it is
so short and easie, that it
may well bee called the
<hi>worke of Women,</hi> and <hi>the
play of Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Work</hi> then
cheerefully (my sonne) <hi>pray</hi>
to <hi>God, read</hi> Bookes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
for one Booke ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
another, thinke of it
profoundly; fly all things
that vanish in the fire, for
thou hast not thine intent
in these combustible and
consuming things, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the decoction of thy
water, drawne from thy
lights. For by this water is
colour and weight giuen
infinitely, and this <hi>water</hi> is
a <hi>white fume,</hi> which as a
<hi>soule</hi> floweth in the perfect
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2423:115"/>
                     <hi>bodies,</hi> taking wholly from
them their blacknesse and
vncleannesse, and console<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
the <hi>two Bodies</hi> into
one, and multiplying their
<hi>water:</hi> And there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing that can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their true colour from
the perfect <hi>Bodies,</hi> that is,
from the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone;</hi>
but <hi>Azoth,</hi> that is, this our
water, which coloureth and
maketh white the <hi>red Body,</hi>
according to the regiments
thereof.</p>
                  <p>But let vs speake of <hi>fires.</hi>
Our <hi>fire</hi> therefore is <hi>mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
equall, continuall,</hi> it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
not, vnlesse it be too
much stirred vp, it partakes
of <hi>sulphur,</hi> it is taken other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
then from the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
it pulleth downe all
things, it dissolueth, congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2423:116"/>
and calcineth, it is <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall</hi>
to finde, it is a short
way (or an expence) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cost, at the least, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great cost, it is
<hi>moist, vaporous, digestiue,
altering, piercing, subtle,
ayery, not violent, not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
compassing or enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
containing but one,</hi>
and it is the Fountaine of
liuing water, which goeth
about, and containeth the
place where the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Queene</hi> bathe themselues.
In all the worke this <hi>moist
fire</hi> is sufficient for thee, at
the beginning, middest, and
end; for in it consisteth the
whole <hi>Art:</hi> This is the fire
<hi>naturall, against nature, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,</hi>
and without bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and finally, this fire is
<hi>hot, dry, moist,</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:2423:116"/>
thinke vpon this, and work
aright, taking nothing that
is of a strange nature: And
if thou doest not well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
these fires, hearken
further to what I shall giue
thee, neuer as yet written in
any Booke, from out of the
abstruse and hidden cauila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ancients, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>fires.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We haue properly <hi>three
fires,</hi> without the which
the <hi>Art</hi> cannot bee done,
and hee that workes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, takes a great deale
of care in vaine. The first is
the <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Lampe,</hi> which
is <hi>continuall, moist, vapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
ayery,</hi> and artificiall to
finde; for the Lampe ought
to bee proportioned to the
closure (or enclosure) and
herein wee must vse great
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2423:117"/>
iudgement, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not to the knowledge
of a workeman of a stiffe
necke: for if the fire of the
<hi>Lampe</hi> be not <hi>geometrically</hi>
and duly proportioned and
fitted to the <hi>Furnace,</hi> either
for lacke of heate thou wilt
not see the expected signes
in their times, and so thou
wilt loose thy hope by too
long expectation, or else
with too much heate thou
wilt burne the flowers of
the <hi>Gold,</hi> and so sadly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
thy lost labour. The
<hi>second fire</hi> is the fire of <hi>ashes,</hi>
in which the vessell <hi>herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi>
sealed is shut vp; or
rather it is that most gentle
heate, which proceeding
from the temperate vapour
of the <hi>lampe,</hi> goeth equally
round about the vessell:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2423:117"/>
This <hi>fire</hi> is not <hi>violent,</hi> if it
be not too much stirred vp,
it is digesting, a tering, it is
taken from another <hi>Body</hi>
then the matter, it is but
one, or alone, it is moist and
innaturall, &amp;c. The <hi>third</hi> is
the naturall fire of our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which for this cause is
also called <hi>fire against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
because it is <hi>water;</hi> and
yet neuerthelesse it makes a
meere spirit of <hi>Gold,</hi> which
common fire cannot doe;
this fire is minerall, equall,
and partakes of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> it
breakes, congeales, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solues,
and calcines all, this
is piercing, subtile, not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and it is the Fountaine
of <hi>liuing water,</hi> wherein
the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> bathe
themselues, whereof wee
haue neede in the whole
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2423:118"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:2423:118"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:2423:119"/>
worke, in the <hi>beginning,
middle,</hi> and <hi>ending,</hi> but the
other two abouesaid, wee
doe not alwayes need, but
onely sometimes: Ioyne
therefore in the reading the
Bookes of <hi>Phylosophers</hi>
these <hi>three</hi> sorts of fire, and
without doubt thou shalt
vnderstand all their cauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
concerning their
fires.</p>
                  <p>As touching the <hi>Colours,</hi>
hee that doth not make
<hi>blacke,</hi> cannot make <hi>white,</hi>
because <hi>blacknesse</hi> is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>whitenesse,</hi> and a
signe of putrifaction and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
and that the <hi>Body</hi>
is now pierced and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Therefore in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction
in this water,
there first appeares <hi>blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
like vnto the broth
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2423:119"/>
wherein bloud, or some
bloudy thing is boyled.
Secondly, the blacke <hi>Earth</hi>
by continuall decoction is
<hi>whitened,</hi> because the <hi>soule</hi>
of the two <hi>bodies</hi> swimmes
aloft vpon the water like
white creame; and in this
onely <hi>whitenesse,</hi> all the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are so vnited, that they
can neuer fly from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And therefore the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
must be <hi>whitened,</hi> and
teare the Bookes, least our
hearts be broken, for this
intire <hi>whitenesse</hi> is the true
<hi>stone</hi> to the <hi>white,</hi> and the
<hi>body</hi> ennobled by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of his end, and the
tincture of <hi>whitenesse,</hi> of a
most exuberant reflexion,
and shining brightnesse,
which being mixed with a
<hi>Body,</hi> neuer <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>parteth from
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2423:120"/>
it. Here then note, that the
<hi>spirits</hi> are not <hi>fixed,</hi> but in
the <hi>white</hi> colour, which by
consequent is more noble
then the other colours, and
ought more earnestly to be
desired, considering it is, as
it were, the complement &amp;
perfection of the whole
worke. For our <hi>Earth</hi> is
first putrified in <hi>blacknesse,</hi>
then it is clensed in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
or lifting vp, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
being dryed, the
<hi>blacknesse</hi> departeth, and
then it is <hi>whitened,</hi> and the
darke moist dominion of
the <hi>woman</hi> perisheth, and
then the white fume pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
into the <hi>new Body,</hi> and
the <hi>spirits</hi> are shut vp, or
bound together, in drinesse,
and that which is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
deformed and <hi>blacke</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:2423:120"/>
with moisture vanisheth,
and then the <hi>new Body</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
againe, cleere, white,
and immortall, getting the
victory oueral his enemies.
And as heate working vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that which is <hi>moist,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
or engendreth <hi>blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
which is the <hi>first</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
so by decoction euer
more and more, heate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon that which is
dry, begetteth <hi>whitenesse,</hi>
which is the <hi>second</hi> colour;
and afterward working vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that which is purely &amp;
perfectly dry, it causeth <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinity</hi>
and <hi>rednesse;</hi> and so
much concerning the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that the thing
which hath the <hi>head red</hi>
and <hi>white,</hi> the <hi>feete white,</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:2423:121"/>
and afterwards <hi>red,</hi> and yet
before that, the <hi>eyes blacke,</hi>
this onely thing is our mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery:
dissolue then the <hi>Sun</hi>
and the <hi>Moone</hi> in our dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
water, which is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
friendly, and of the
next nature vnto them,
which is likewise to them
sweete and pleasant, and as
it were a <hi>wombe,</hi> a <hi>mother,</hi>
an <hi>Originall,</hi> the beginning
and the end of life, and that
is the reason why they are
amended in this water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Nature reioyceth in
Nature, and Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
Nature,</hi> and in true
<hi>Mariage</hi> they are ioyned
together, and made one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
one new body, raised
vp, and immortall. And
thus we must ioyne consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity
with Consanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2423:121"/>
and then these natures
will meete, and follow one
another, putrifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
engender themselues,
and make one another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
because <hi>Nature</hi> is
gouerned by <hi>Nature,</hi> which
is neerest and most friendly
to it. Our water then (saith
<hi>Danthin)</hi> is the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
faire, and cleere Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
prepared onely for
the <hi>King</hi> &amp; <hi>Queene,</hi> whom
it knoweth very well, and
they know it; for it drawes
them to it selfe, and they
abide therein to wash
themselues two or three
<hi>dayes,</hi> that is, two or three
<hi>moneths;</hi> and it maketh
them young againe, &amp; faire.
And because the <hi>Sunne</hi> and
<hi>Moone</hi> haue their Originall
from this water their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2423:122"/>
therefore it behoueth
that they enter againe into
their Mothers wombe, that
they may be borne againe,
and be made more strong,
more noble, and more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant.
And therefore if these
doe not <hi>die,</hi> and be not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into water, they remain
alone, and <hi>without fruite;</hi>
but if they <hi>die,</hi> and be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in our water, they bring
fruit an <hi>hundreth</hi> fold; and
from that very place, where
it seemed they had lost
what they were, from
thence shall they appeare
that which they were not
before. Let therefore the
<hi>spirit</hi> of our liuing water,
be with great wit and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
fixed with the <hi>Sunne</hi>
and the <hi>Moone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> because
they being turned into the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2423:122"/>
nature of water, doe dye,
&amp; seeme like vnto the dead;
yet afterward being inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from thence, they liue,
encrease, and multiply like
all other <hi>vegetable</hi> things.
It is enough then to dispose
the matter sufficiently from
<hi>without,</hi> for from <hi>within,</hi> it
selfe doth work sufficiently
to its owne perfection. For
it hath in it selfe a certaine
and inhaerent <hi>motion,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the true way, better
then any order that can be
imagined by man. And
therefore doe thou onely
<hi>prepare,</hi> and Nature will
<hi>perfect;</hi> for if shee bee not
hindered by the contrary,
shee wil not passe her owne
certaine <hi>motion,</hi> as well to
conceiue, as to bring forth.
Wherefore after the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2423:123"/>
of the matter, take
heede onely least by too
much fire thou make the
<hi>bath</hi> too hot: <hi>Secondly,</hi> take
heed least the <hi>spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale,
because it would hurt
him that worketh, that is to
say, it would destroy the
worke, and cause many <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
that is, much sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and anger. From this
that hath beene spoken, is
drawne this <hi>Axiome,</hi> to
wit, <hi>that by the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he doth not know the
making of Mettals, that
knoweth not the destruction
of them.</hi> It behoueth then,
to ioyne together them that
are of kindred, for <hi>Natures</hi>
doe finde their like <hi>natures,</hi>
and being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> putrified, are
mixed together, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
themselues. It is necessary
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2423:123"/>
therefore to know this <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi>
and <hi>generation,</hi> and
how the Natures doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
one another, and are
pacified in a <hi>slow</hi> fire, how
Nature <hi>reioyceth</hi> in Nature,
and nature <hi>retaines</hi> nature,
and turnes it into a white
nature. After this, if thou
wilt make it <hi>red,</hi> thou must
boyle this <hi>white,</hi> in a dry
continuall fire, vntill it bee
as <hi>red</hi> as <hi>blood,</hi> which will
bee nothing else but <hi>fire</hi>
and a true <hi>tincture:</hi> And
so by a continuall dry fire,
the <hi>whitenesse</hi> is changed,
amended, perfected, made
<hi>Citrine,</hi> and acquireth <hi>red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
a true <hi>fixed</hi> colour.
And consequently by how
much more this <hi>red</hi> is boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
so much the more is it
coloured, and made a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2423:124"/>
of perfect <hi>rednesse;</hi>
Wherefore thou must with
a <hi>dry fire,</hi> and a <hi>dry calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
without any moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
boyle this <hi>compound,</hi>
vntill it bee clothed with a
most <hi>red</hi> colour, and then it
will be a perfect <hi>Elixir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If afterwards thou wilt
<hi>multiply</hi> it, thou must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
resolue that <hi>red</hi> in a
new dissoluing water, and
after by decoction <hi>whiten</hi>
and <hi>rubifie</hi> it by the degrees
of fire, reiterating the first
regiment. Dissolue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geale,
reiterate, shutting,
opening, and multiplying
in <hi>quantitie</hi> and <hi>qualitie</hi> at
thine owne pleasure: for
by a new corruption and
generation, there is againe
brought in a new <hi>motion,</hi>
and so we could neuer find
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2423:124"/>
an end, if we would alwayes
worke by reiteration of <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
and <hi>coagulation,</hi> by
the meanes of our dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<hi>water,</hi> that is to say,
dissoluing and congealing,
as is said in the first regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And so the vertue
thereof is increased and
multiplied in <hi>quantitie</hi> and
<hi>qualitie,</hi> so that if in the first
worke, one part of thy
<hi>Stone,</hi> will teyne an <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
in the <hi>second</hi> it will
teyne a <hi>thousand,</hi> in the
<hi>third ten thousand,</hi> and so
by pursuing thy worke, thy
proiection will come into
<hi>infinitie,</hi> teyning truly, and
perfectly, and fixedly, euery
quantitie, how great soeuer
it bee, and so by a thing of
an easie price, is added <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi>
and <hi>vertue,</hi> &amp; <hi>weight.</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:2423:125"/>
Therefore <hi>our fire and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoth
are sufficient for thee;</hi>
boyle, boyle, reiterate, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue,
congeale, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
according to thy will,
multiplying it as much as
thou wilt, and vntill thy
Medicine bee made fusible
as <hi>waxe,</hi> and that it haue
the quantitie and vertue
which thou desirest. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the accomplishment
of the worke, or of our
<hi>second Stone, (note it well)</hi>
consisteth in this, that thou
take the <hi>perfect Body,</hi> which
thou must put in <hi>our water,</hi>
in a house of <hi>glasse,</hi> wel shut
and stopped with <hi>Cement,</hi>
lest the <hi>ayre</hi> get in, or the
<hi>moysture</hi> inclosed get out;
and there hold it in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
of a gentle heate, as
if it were of a <hi>bathe,</hi> or the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2423:125"/>
most temperate heate of
<hi>dung,</hi> vpon the which with
the fire thou shalt continue
the perfection of decoction,
vntill it bee putrified and
resolued into <hi>blacke,</hi> and
afterwards be lifted vp, and
sublimed by the water, that
it may thereby bee cleansed
from all <hi>blacknesse</hi> and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that it may bee
<hi>whitened</hi> and made <hi>subtile,</hi>
vntill it come to the vtmost
purity of sublimation, and
at the last be made <hi>volatile,</hi>
and <hi>white,</hi> within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
for the <hi>vulture flying
in the Ayre without wings,
cryeth that it might get vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mountaine, that is,
vpon the water,</hi> vpon the
which the <hi>white</hi> Spirit is
carried. Then continue a
conuenient <hi>fire,</hi> and that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2423:126"/>
                     <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, the subtile
substance of the <hi>Body</hi> and
of <hi>Mercury</hi> will ascend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the water, which quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence
is <hi>whiter</hi> than the
<hi>snow;</hi> continue still, and in
the end strengthen thy fire,
vntill all which is <hi>spirituall</hi>
mount on high: for know
well, that all that is cleare,
pure, and spirituall, ascends
on high in the <hi>ayre,</hi> in the
forme of a <hi>white</hi> fume,
which the <hi>Philosophers</hi> call,
the <hi>Virgins milke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It behooueth therefore,
that (as <hi>Sibill</hi> said) <hi>the
Sonne of the Virgin bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
from the Earth,</hi> and
that the white <hi>quintessence</hi>
after his resurrection bee
lifted vp towards the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
and that the grosse and
thicke remaine in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2423:126"/>
of the vessell and of
the <hi>water;</hi> for afterwards
when the vessell is colde,
thou shalt finde in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
thereof, the <hi>foeces,
blacke,</hi> burnt, and combust,
separate from the <hi>spirit</hi> and
<hi>white quintessence,</hi> which
dregs thou must cast away.
In these times the <hi>Argent
viue</hi> raineth from our <hi>ayre</hi>
vpon our new <hi>earth,</hi> which
is called <hi>Argent viue,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed
from the ayre, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is made a <hi>water</hi> viscous,
cleane and <hi>white,</hi> which is
the true <hi>tincture</hi> separated
from all <hi>blacke foeces,</hi> and
so our <hi>brasse</hi> or <hi>Leton,</hi> is
with our water gouerned,
purified, and adorned with
a <hi>white</hi> colour, which <hi>white</hi>
colour is not gotten, but by
decoction and coagulation
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:2423:127"/>
of the <hi>water.</hi> Boyle it then
continually, wash away the
<hi>blacknesse</hi> from the <hi>Leton,</hi>
not with thy hand, but with
the <hi>Stone,</hi> or the <hi>fire,</hi> or our
<hi>second Mercuriall water,</hi>
which is the true tincture.
For this separation of the
pure from the impure, is not
done with <hi>hands,</hi> but <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
her selfe alone, by
working it circularly to
perfection, bringeth it to
passe. It appeareth then
that this composition is not
a manuall worke, but onely
a change of the natures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>nature</hi> dissolues and
conioynes it selfe, it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limes
and lifts vp it selfe,
and hauing separated the
<hi>foeces,</hi> it groweth <hi>white:</hi> and
in such a sublimation the
parts are alwayes ioyned
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2423:127"/>
together, more subtile, more
pure and essentiall, because
that when the fiery nature
lifteth vp the subtile parts,
it lifteth vp alwayes the
more pure, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
leaueth the grosser in
the bottome. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it behooueth by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
fire, to sublime in
a continuall vapour, that
the <hi>Stone</hi> may bee inspired
in the <hi>ayre,</hi> and liue. For
the nature of all things
takes life of the inspiration
of <hi>ayre,</hi> and so also all our
<hi>Maistery</hi> consists in vapour,
and in the sublimation of
<hi>water.</hi> And therefore our
<hi>brasse</hi> or <hi>Leton</hi> must by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of fire bee lifted vp,
and freely without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
of himselfe, ascend
on high, wherefore vnlesse
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2423:128"/>
the <hi>Body</hi> bee by <hi>fire</hi> and
<hi>water</hi> dissolued, attenuated,
and subtilized, vntill it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
as a <hi>spirit,</hi> or climbe
like <hi>Argent viue,</hi> or as the
<hi>white soule</hi> separated from
the <hi>Body,</hi> and carried in the
sublimation of the Spirits,
there is nothing at all done
in this <hi>Arte:</hi> But when it
ascends on high, it is borne
in the <hi>ayre,</hi> and changed in
the <hi>ayre,</hi> and is made <hi>life</hi>
with <hi>life,</hi> being altogether
spirituall and incorruptible:
And so in such a regiment
the <hi>Body</hi> is made a <hi>spirit</hi> of
a subtile nature, and the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
is incorporated with the
<hi>Body,</hi> and is made one with
it, and in such a sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
coniunction, and eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all things are made
<hi>white.</hi>

And therefore this <hi>Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall</hi>
and natural sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is necessary, for that it
maketh peace betweene the
<hi>body</hi> and the <hi>spirit,</hi> which
is vnpossible otherwise to
be done, otherwise then by
this separation of the parts:
wherefore it behoueth to
sublime them both, to the
end, that in the troubles of
this stormy Sea, the <hi>pure</hi>
may <hi>ascend,</hi> and the <hi>impure</hi>
and earthly may <hi>descend:</hi>
And for this cause it must
be boyled continually, that
it may be brought to a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
nature, and that the <hi>body</hi>
may assume and draw to it
selfe the <hi>white Mercuriall
soule,</hi> which it naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
and suffereth it not
to be separated from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is like vnto it, in the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2423:129"/>
neerenesse of the first, pure,
and simple nature. From
hence it appeares, that this
separation must be made by
decoction, vntill there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
no more of the <hi>fat</hi> of
the <hi>soule,</hi> which is not lifted
vp, and exalted into the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part, for so they shall be
both reduced vnto a simple
<hi>equality,</hi> and vnto a simple
<hi>whitenesse. The vulture
therefore flying in the ayre,
and the Toade going vpon
the Earth, is our Maistery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
And therefore when thou
shalt gently, and with great
discretion, separate the
<hi>Earth</hi> from the <hi>water,</hi> that
is, from the <hi>fire,</hi> and the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>
from the <hi>thicke,</hi> then
that which is <hi>pure,</hi> will <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend</hi>
from Earrh into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and that which is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,</hi>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:2423:129"/>
will goe downe to the
<hi>Earth,</hi> and the more subtile
part will in the <hi>vpper</hi> place
take the nature of a <hi>spirit,</hi>
and in the <hi>lower</hi> place the
nature of an <hi>Earthly Body;</hi>
wherefore let the <hi>while na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
with the more subtile
part of the <hi>Body,</hi> be by this
operation lifted vp, leauing
the <hi>foeces,</hi> which is done in
a short time: for the <hi>soule</hi> is
aided by her associate and
<hi>fellow,</hi> and perfected by it.
<hi>My Mother</hi> (saith the <hi>Body)
hath begotten mee, and by
me shee her selfe is begotten;
and after shee hath taken her
slight, (or I haue taken from
her her flying) shee after the
best manner shee can, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a pious Mother, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
and cherishing the
sonne whom shee hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2423:130"/>
vntill he come to perfect
state.</hi> Heare this secret:
Keepe the <hi>Body</hi> in this our
<hi>Mercuriall water,</hi> vntill it
ascend on high with the
<hi>white soule,</hi> and the Earthly
descend to the bottome,
which is called, <hi>the Earth
that remaines:</hi> then shalt
thou see the water coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it selfe with its <hi>body,</hi> and
shalt bee assured that the
<hi>Science</hi> is true, because the
<hi>Body</hi> coagulateth his moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
into drinesse, as the
rennet of a <hi>Lambe</hi> coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
milke into <hi>Cheese.</hi> In
the same fashion the <hi>spirit</hi>
will pierce the <hi>body,</hi> and
there will be a perfect mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
made by the least parts,
and the <hi>Body</hi> will draw vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself his <hi>moisture,</hi> that
is to say, his <hi>white soule,</hi>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:2423:130"/>
euen as the <hi>Load-stone</hi>
draweth the <hi>Iron,</hi> because
of the likenesse and neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his nature, and his
greedinesse, and then the
one will hold the other, and
this is our sublimation and
coagulation, which retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
euery thing <hi>volatile,</hi>
and maketh that it can flye
no more. Therefore this
compositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not a manuall
operation, but (as I said) a
changing of natures, and a
wonderfull connexion of
their <hi>cold</hi> with <hi>hot,</hi> and
their <hi>moist</hi> with <hi>dry:</hi> for the
<hi>hot</hi> is mixed with <hi>cold,</hi> and
the <hi>dry</hi> with <hi>moist,</hi> and so
by this meanes is made the
mixture and coniunction of
the <hi>body</hi> with the <hi>spirit,</hi>
which is called the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of <hi>contrary natures;</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:2423:131"/>
because that in such a solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and sublimation, the
<hi>spirit</hi> is turned into a <hi>body,</hi>
and the <hi>body</hi> into a <hi>spirit;</hi>
so that the natures being
mingled together, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into one, doe change
one another, in as much as
the <hi>body</hi> makes the <hi>spirit</hi> a
<hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> turnes
the <hi>body</hi> into a teyned and
<hi>white spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore (this is
the last time that I will
tell thee) boyle it in our
<hi>white water,</hi> that is, in <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
vntill it bee dissolued
into <hi>blacknesse,</hi> and then by
continuall decoction, it will
bee depriued of his <hi>blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
and the <hi>body</hi> so dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
wil at length arise with
the <hi>white soule,</hi> and then
one will bee mingled with
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2423:131"/>
the other, and they will
embrace one another, so
that they shall no more be
diuided asunder, and then
the <hi>spirit</hi> is vnited to the
<hi>body</hi> with a reall accord,
and are made one <hi>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
thing; and this is the
<hi>solution</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> and
the <hi>Coagulation</hi> of the
<hi>spirit,</hi> which haue one
and the selfe same opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Hee therefore that
knoweth how to <hi>mary,</hi>
to <hi>make with childe,</hi> to
<hi>mortifie,</hi> to <hi>putrifie,</hi> to
<hi>engender,</hi> to <hi>quicken</hi> the

<hi>white light,</hi> and to <hi>clense</hi>
the <hi>vulture</hi> from his <hi>black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
and <hi>darknesse,</hi> vntill he
be purged by <hi>fire,</hi> coloured
and purified from all his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2423:132"/>

of so great dignity, that
<hi>Kings</hi> shall reuerence
him, and doe him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let our <hi>body</hi>
abide in the <hi>water,</hi> vntill
such time as it be loosed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a new <hi>powder</hi> in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the <hi>vessell</hi> and of
the <hi>water,</hi> which is called
the <hi>blacke ashes,</hi> and this is
the corruption of the <hi>body,</hi>
which is by wise men called
<hi>Saturne, Leton,</hi> or <hi>Brasse,</hi> the
<hi>Phylosophers Lead,</hi> and the
<hi>discontinued powder.</hi> And
in this putrifaction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the <hi>Body,</hi> there
appeare <hi>three</hi> signes, to wit,
the <hi>blacke colour,</hi> the <hi>discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity</hi>
of the parts, and a
<hi>stinking smell,</hi> which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the smel of <hi>sepulchres</hi>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:2423:132"/>
or graues. This ashes then
is that of which the <hi>Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
haue said so much,
which remained in the
lower part of the vessell,
<hi>which wee ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise,</hi>
for in it is the <hi>Diademe</hi>
of our <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Argent

from whence the <hi>blacknesse</hi>
must be purged by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall

vntill it be lifted vp in a
<hi>white colour,</hi> which is called
the <hi>Goose,</hi> and the <hi>Poulet</hi> of
<hi>Hermogenes.</hi> He therefore
that maketh the <hi>red Earth
blacke,</hi> and then <hi>white,</hi> hath
the <hi>Maistery,</hi> as also hee
that <hi>killeth</hi> the <hi>liuing,</hi> and

which shineth like a naked

<hi>whitenesse,</hi> is <hi>rednesse</hi> hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
and then thou must not
take out of the vessell that
<hi>whitenesse,</hi> but onely boyle
it, to the end, that with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and heate, there may
come vpon it a <hi>Citrine</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,

praise the most good,

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Iohn Ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled
thorow
many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
that I
might know some certainty
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2423:135"/>
of the Philosophers Stone;
and going thorow as it were
all the world, I found many
false deceiuers, but no true
Philosophers, yet continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
studying, and making
many doubts, at the length
I found the trueth: But
when I knew the matter in
generall, I yet erred two
hundred times, before I
could attaine to the true
matter, with the operation
and practise thereof. First I
begunne to worke with the
matter, by putrefaction nine
moneths together, and I
found nothing: Then I put
it into <hi>Balneum Mariae</hi> for
a certaine time, and therein
I likewise erred: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I put it in the fire of
calcination for three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
space, and I wrought
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2423:135"/>
amisse. I tryed all kinds of
distillations and sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(as the Philosophers,
<hi>Giber, Archelaus,</hi> and all
the rest, either say or seeme
to say) and I found nothing.
In summe, I assayed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the <hi>Subiect</hi> of the whole
Art of Alchimy, by all
meanes possible to be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as by Dung, Bathes,
Ashes, and other fires of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
kinds, which yet are all
found in the Philosophers
Bookes, but I found no
good in them. Wherefore I
studied three whole yeeres
in the Bookes of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
especially in <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
alone, whose briefer
words doe comprehend the
whole Stone, though hee
speake obscurely of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,
and inferiour, (or
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2423:136"/>
that which is aboue, and
that which is below) of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
&amp; earth. Therefore our
Instrument which bringeth
the matter into being in the
beginning, second, and third
worke, is not the fire of a
Bath, nor of Dung, nor of
Ashes, nor of the other fires
which the Philosophers haue
put in their Bookes: What
fire is it then which perfects
the whole worke from the
beginning to the ending?
Surely the Philosophers
haue concealed it: But I
being mooued with pitie,
will declare it vnto you, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the complement
of the whole worke. The
Philosophers Stone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is one, but it hath many
names, and before thou
know it, it will be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult;
<pb facs="tcp:2423:136"/>
for it is <hi>watery,
aiery, fiery, earthy, flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
cholericke</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;</hi>
for it is sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and it is likewise <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
viue,</hi> and it hath many
superfluities, which by the
liuing God are turned into
the true essence, our fire
being the meanes: And hee
that separates any thing
from the subiect, thinking
it to bee necessary, hee true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knoweth nothing at all
in <hi>Philosophy;</hi> for that
which is superfluous, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
filthy, foeculent, and
in summe, the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Subiect, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
into a fixt spirituall
body, by the meanes of our
fire. And this the wise
men neuer reuealed, and
therefore few doe come vnto
<pb facs="tcp:2423:137"/>
the Arte, thinking that
there is some such superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and vncleane thing.
Now wee must seeke out the
properties of our fire, and
whether it agree to our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
after the manner that
I haue sayd, to wit, that it
may bee transmuted, when
as that fire doth not burne
the matter, it separateth
nothing from the matter,
it diuideth not the pure
parts from the impure, as
all the <hi>Philosophers</hi> say,
but it turneth the whole
Subiect into puritie. It
doeth not sublime, as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
maketh his sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<hi>Arnold</hi> likewise and
others speaking of sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and distillations, to
bee done in a short time. It
is minerall, equall, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall,
<pb facs="tcp:2423:137"/>
it vapours not, except
it bee too much stirred vp:
it partaketh of Sulphur,
it is taken from else-where
then from the matter; it
pulleth downe all things, it
dissolueth and congealeth,
likewise it both congeales
and calcines, and it is arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
to finde out, and is a
compendious and neere way,
without any cost, at least
with small cost: and that
fire is it, with a meane fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
for with a soft fire all
the whole worke is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and it performeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
all the due sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They that should reade
<hi>Geber,</hi> and all the other
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> though they
should liue an hundred
thousand yeeres, could not
comprehend it, because
<pb facs="tcp:2423:138"/>
that fire is found by deepe
and profound Meditation
onely, and then it may be
gathered out of Bookes, and
not before. And therefore
the errour of this Arte is,
not to finde the fire, which
turnes the whole matter
into the true Stone of the
<hi>Philosophers.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
studie vpon it, for if I
had found that first, I had
neuer erred two hundred
times, in my practise vpon
the matter: wherefore I
doe not meruaile, if so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great men haue not
attained vnto the worke.
They doe erre, they haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they will erre, because
the <hi>Philosophers</hi> haue not
put the proper <hi>Agent,</hi> saue
onely one, which is named
<hi>Artephius,</hi> but hee speakes
<pb facs="tcp:2423:138"/>
for himselfe, or by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
And vnlesse I had
read <hi>Artephius,</hi> and felt
him speake, I had neuer
come to the complement of
the work. But the <hi>practique</hi>
is this. Let it bee taken;
and ground with a physicall
contrition, as diligently as
may bee, and let it bee set
vpon the fire, and let the
proportion of the fire bee
knowne, to wit, that it onely
stirre vp the matter, and in
a short time, that fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other laying on of
hands, will accomplish the
whole worke, because ii will
putrifie, corrupt, ingender,
and perfect, and make to
appeare the three principall
colours, blacke, white, and
red. And by the meanes
of our fire the Medicine
<pb facs="tcp:2423:139"/>
will bee multiplied, if it bee
ioyned with the crude mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not onely in quantitie,
but also in vertue. With
all thy strength therefore,
search out this fire, and
thou shalt attaine thy wish,
because it doeth the whole
worke, and is the Key of the
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> which they
neuer reuealed: But if thou
muse well and profoundly
vpon those things that haue
beene spoken concerning the
properties of the fire, thou
mayest know it; otherwise
not. I beeing mooued with
pitie, haue written these
things, but that I may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
thee fully, this fire is
not transmuted with the
matter, because (as I said
aboue) it is not of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
These things therefore I
<pb facs="tcp:2423:139"/>
thought fit to say, and to
warne the prudent, that
they spend not their moneys
vnprofitably, but know
what they ought to looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For by this meanes they
may come to the truth
of the Arte, and
not otherwise.</p>
