         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen man will go about Repentance, and with his prayers turne to God; before he begin to pray, he must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider his own minde, that it is wholly and altogether turned away from God, that it is become faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to God, that it is onely bent upon this temporall, fraile and earthly life, bearing no sincere love towards God and his neighbour; and also that it wholy lusteth and walketh contrary to the commandements of God, seeking it selfe onely, in the temporall and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57657:4"/>
transitory lusts of the flesh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he must consider that all this is an enmity against God, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath raised and stirred up in him, by his deceit in our first Parents; for which abominations sake we die the death, and must undergo corruption with our bodies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he must consider the three horrible chaines wherewith our soule is fast bound during the time of this earthly life: the first is the severe Anger of God, the Abysse and darke world, which is the Center and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turly life of the soule. The second, is the desire of the devill against the soule, whereby he continually fifteth and tempteth the soul and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission striveth to throw it from the truth of God into vanity, viz. into pride, covetousnesse, envie and anger, and with his desire bloweth up and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth those evill properties in the soule, whereby the will of the soule turneth away from God and entreth into selfe. The third and most hurtfull chaine, wherewith the poore soule is tied, is the corrupt &amp; altogether vaine, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mortall flesh and blood, full of evill desires and inclinations.</p>
                  <p>Here he must consider, that he lieth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57657:4"/>
close prisoner with soule and body, in the mire of sinnes, in the anger of God, in the jawes of the pit of Hell; that the anger of God burneth in him in soule and body, and that he is that stinking keeper of Swine, that hath spent and consumed his fathers inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (viz. the love and mercy of God) with the fatted swine of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in earthly pleasures, and hath not observed the deare Covenant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of the innocent death and passion of Jesus Christ, which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God of meere Grace hath <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>put.</hi>
                     </note> given into our humanity and reconciled us in him; also he must consider that hee hath wholy forgotten the Covenant of holy Baptisme (in which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be faithfull and true to his Saviour,) and so wholy defiled and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured his righteousnesse with sinne, (which righteousnesse God hath freely bestowed upon him in Christ:) that hee now standeth before the face of God with the faire garment of Christs innocency (which he hath defiled:) as a dirty ragged and patched keeper of Swine, that hath continually eaten the graines of vanity with the devills swine, and is not worthy to be called a Sonne of the Father and member of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57657:5"/>Fourthly, he must earnestly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that wrathfull death waiteth upon him every houre and moment, and will lay hold on him in his sinnes, in his garment of a Swine keeper, and throw him into the pit of hell, as a for sworne person and breaker of faith, who ought to be kept in the darke dungeon of death to the judgement of God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he must consider the earnest and severe judgement of God, where he shall be presented living with his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations before the judgement; &amp; all those whom he hath here offended and injured with words and works, and caused to doe evill, (so that by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation or compulsion they also have committed evill) shall come in against him, cursing him, and all this before the eyes of Christ, and also before the eyes of all holy Angels and men: and that there he shall stand in great shame and ignominy, and also in great terror and eternall desperation, and that it shall for ever grieve him that he hath fool'd away so great and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse and salvation for the pleasure of so short a time, and not looked to himselfe better, that he might also have beene in the communion of the Saints, and have injoyed eternall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57657:5"/>
light, and divine power and vertue.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, he must consider, that the ungodly loseth his noble image (God having created him for his Image) and getteth in stead thereof a deformed <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Larva</hi> or <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous shape.</hi>
                     </note> vizard, like a hellish worme or ugly Beast, wherein he is Gods enemy and against heaven and all holy Angels and men, and that his communion is for ever with the devills and hellish wormes in the horrible darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He must earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the eternall punishment and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the damned, that in eternall horror they shall suffer torments in their abominations, which they have committed here, and may never see the land of the Saints in all eternity, nor get any ease or refreshment, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by [Dives] the rich man.</p>
                  <p>All this, man must earnestly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously consider, and remember, that God hath created him in such a faire and glorious Image, in his owne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in which he himselfe will dwell, that he hath created him in his praise for mans owne eternall joy and glory, viz, that he might dwell with the holy Angels, and children of God, in great joy, power and glory, in the eternall light in singing and melodious harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57657:6"/>
of the angelicall and divine King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of joy, to rejoyce eternally with the children of God without feare of any end, where no evill thoughts could touch him, neither care nor trouble, neither heate nor cold, where no night is knowne, where there is no day or time any more, but an everlasting joy, where soule and body tremble for joy, and where he should rejoyce at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wonders and vertues in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of colours and ornament of the infinite begetting in the wisedome of God, upon the new christaline Earth, which shall be as transparent glasse; &amp; that he doth so wilfully lose all this, for so short and poore a times-sake, which yet in this vanity, in the evill life of the voluptuous flesh, is full of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie feare and trouble, in meere vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it goeth with the wicked as with the righteous, as the one must die so must the other, yet the death of the Saints is an entrance into the eternall rest; but the death of the wicked an entrance into the eternall unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, He must consider the course of the world, that all things are but a play, wherewith he spendeth his time in unquietnesse; and that it goeth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57657:6"/>
with the rich and mighty, as with the poore and the begger; that all of us equally live and move in the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements; and that the mouthfull or morsell of the poore, is as relishing and savoury to him in his toyle and labour, as that of the rich is to him in his cares; also that all of us doe live <note n="b" place="margin">Or <hi>by</hi>
                     </note> in one breath, and that the rich man hath nothing but the pleasure of the palate and the lust of the eye more then other men, for else it goeth with the one as with the other; for which lust of the eye, man so foolishly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeth so great a happinesse, and for the sake thereof bringeth himselfe into so great and eternall unquietnesse.</p>
                  <p>In this consideration man shall feele in his owne heart and minde (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he <note n="c" place="margin">Or <hi>modell.</hi>
                     </note> represent and set before his eyes his owne end) that he shall <note n="d" place="margin">Or <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

And then in many, (whom the Spirit of Christ toucheth in such a consideration) there ariseth aboundant sorrow, griefe of heart, and inward lamentation over the dayes of his wickednesse, which he hath spent so in vanity, without any working in the Vineyard of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Such a one, now, whom the Spirit of Christ bringeth into sorrow and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; so that his heart is opened, that he can know and bewaile his sins, is very easily to be helped; he needeth but to draw to him the promise of Christ, viz. That God willeth not the death of a sinner, but that he wisheth them all to come unto him and hee will refresh them; and that there is great joy in heaven for one sinner that repenteth: let such a one but lay hold on the words of Christ, and wrap him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe up into the passion and death of Christ.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have a cleare exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Lucifer, and also in Adam the first man, of what Selfe doth, when it getteth the light of nature to be its owne, and may walke with the Understanding in its owne dominion: we see it also in men learned in Arts and Sciences that when they get the light of this outward world or nature into the possession of their reason, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cometh of it but pride of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And yet all the world so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently desireth and seeketh after this light as the best treasure; and it is indeed the best treasure this world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, if it be rightly used.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But while Selfe, viz. Reason is ensnared and fast bound in a close and strong prison, viz: in the Anger of God, and in earthlynesse; it is very dangerous for a man to make
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57657:42"/>
use of the light of knowledge in selfe, as if it were in the possession of Selfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For the Wrath of the eternall and temporary Nature will soone take pleasure in it, and then selfe, and a mans owne reason, will rise up in pride, and breake it selfe off from the true re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igned humility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and will no more eate of the fruite of paradise, but of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of selfe, viz. of that dominion of life, wherein good and evill are mixt: as Lucifer and Adam did; who both entred with the desire of selfe, into the Originall againe, out of which the creatures were brought forth, and entred into [the condition of the] creatures: Lucifer into the Center and wrathfull Nature, into the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Vomb, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth fire.</hi>
                     </note> Matrix of the fire, and Adam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earthly Nature, into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of the outward world, viz. into the lust after good and evill.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Which happened to them both, because they had the light of understanding shining in selfe, wherein they could behold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by which the spirit of selfe, went into the Imagination, (viz. into a desire to get the Center,) that they might exalt themselves, and so grow
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57657:42"/>
great, potent and more skilfull: Now when Lucifer sought after the Mother of fire in his Center, and thought to raigne therewith over the Love of God, and all the Angels; and when Adam also desired to trie in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, [what it was in] the Mother, from whence evill and good did spring, and brought his desire into her, of purpose to become skilfull and full of understanding thereby; Both Lucifer and Adam were captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby in their evill <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>false.</hi>
                     </note> desire in the Mother, and did breake off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from Resignation (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes from God) and so were capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the spirit of the will, by the desire, in the Mother, which desire immediately did get the dominion in nature, and so Lucifer stucke fast in the wrathfull Source of fire, and that fire became manifest in the spirit of his will, whereby the creature in its desire became an enemy to the love and meekenesse of God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, So also Adam was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately caught by the earthly Mother, which is evill and good, created out of the love and anger of God, &amp; made one substance, upon which the earthly property immediately got the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57657:43"/>
in Adam, and from thence heate and cold, envy and anger, and all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and contrariety against God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came manifest, and did beare rule in him.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, But if they had not brought the light of knowledge into selfe, then the Glasse of the knowledge of the Center, and of the Originall of the creature, viz. of the power of it selfe had not been manifested, from whence the Imagination and Lust did arise.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 As also we see now a dayes it bringeth danger upon the enlightned children of God, so that when the Sunne of the great Presence of Gods Holinesse shineth, by which the life passeth into triumph, and then Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son beholdeth it selfe therein, (as in a glasse,) and the will goeth on in selfe, viz. in its owne searching, and will trie [what] the Center [is] out of which the Light shineth, and will of it selfe force it selfe into it, from whence ariseth abominable pride and selfe love, so that <note n="o" place="margin">The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> its owne reason (which is but a mirrour or glasse of the eternal [wisedome,] supposeth it selfe to be greater then it is, and then whatsoever its [Reason] doth, it thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57657:43"/>
Gods will doth it, in it, and that it is a Prophet, and yet is but in it selfe, and goeth on in its owne desire, in which the Center of nature sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly raiseth it selfe a loft, and entreth into that owne selfe desire of falshood against God, and so the will entreth into selfe-conceitednesse.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 And then the flattering Devill entreth into <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature.</hi>
                     </note> it, and fifteth the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of nature, and bringeth <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>false.</hi>
                     </note> evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires into it, so that a man becomes as it were drunken in selfe, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himselfe that he is driven by God: by which the good beginning, (wherein the divine light did shine in nature,) cometh to be spoyled, and so the Light of God departeth from him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Yet then the outward light of the outward nature remaineth shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the creature (for its owne selfe throweth it selfe thereinto) and then supposeth that it is still the first light of God, (but it is not so:) and into this selfe-conceitednesse, in the light of its outward reason, the Devill throweth himselfe againe (though in the first light, which was divine, he was forced to depart) returning with a seven-fold desire, of which Christ
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57657:44"/>
spake, saying, when the uncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit departeth out of a man, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth through dry places seeking rest &amp; findeth none, and then he taketh to himselfe seven spirits worse then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and returneth to his first house, &amp; findeth it swept &amp; garnished, and then he dwelleth therein, and so it is worse with the man then it was before.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 This house, that is thus swept and garnished, is the light of reason in selfe: for if a man bring his desire and will into God, and goeth on in abstinence from this wicked life, and desireth the love of God, then that love will manifest it selfe to him with its most friendly and chearefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, by which the outward light also is kindled; for where the light of God is kindled, there all will be light, the Devill cannot stay there, he must depart thence: and then he search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through the Mother of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of life, viz. the Center, but it is become a dry * feeble place: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, viz. the Center of nature, is in its owne property altogether <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>barren.</hi>
                     </note> feeble, leane and dry, and cannot get the dominion, in the wrathfull property. Satan searcheth through these places to finde an open gate to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57657:44"/>
enter with the desire, &amp; so sift the soul that it might [come to] exalt it selfe.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 And now if the spirit of the will of the creature, doe throw it selfe with the light of reason into the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, viz. into selfe, and entreth into selfe-conceitednesse, then it goeth forth againe from the light of God: and then the Devill findeth an open gate for him to enter in at, and a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished house to dwell in, viz. the light of reason: and then he taketh to himselfe the seven <hi rend="sup">o</hi> formes of the property of life in selfe, viz. the flatterers which are departed from God into selfe. And there he entreth and putteth his desire into the lust of selfe, and evill Imaginations: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the spirit of the will beholdeth it selfe in the formes of the properties of life, in the outward light, and there that man sinketh into himselfe, as if he were drunk, and then the stars lay hold on him, &amp; bring their strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations into him, <note n="*" place="margin">Into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reason.</note> that he might seek the wonders of God there, that so they may manifest themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: For all creatures groane, and long after God. And though the starres cannot apprehend the Spirit of God, yet they had rather have a house of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57657:45"/>
light wherein they may rejoyce, then a house shut up, wherein they can have no quiet.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Then this man goeth on, as if he were drunke in [the light of the outward reason: which is called] the starres, and apprehendeth great and wonderfull things, and hath a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall guide in them: and then the Devill presently observeth, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gate standeth open for him, where he may kindle the Center of life, that so the spirit of the will may mount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft in pride, in selfe conceit, or covetousnesse; from whence selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrogancy ariseth, the will of reason desiring to be honoured: for it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it hath attained the summe of all happinesse, when it hath gotten<note place="margin">* Or, of <hi>hidden my ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
                     </note> the light of reason, and can judge the <hi rend="sup">o</hi> house that is shut up, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse God can well unlocke; He now supposeth, that the honour is due to him, because he hath gotten the understanding of reason, and never considereth that the Devill maketh himselfe merry with his desire in his seven formes of life, of the Center of nature, nor what abominable errour he setteth up.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 From this understanding, false
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57657:45"/>
Babell is brought forth in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church on earth; where men rule and teach by the conclusions of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and have set the childe (which is drunke in its owne pride and selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covetousnesse,) as a faire Virgine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 But the Devill is entred into its seven formes of life of the Center, viz. into its owne selfe [conceited] reason, &amp; continually bringeth his desire into this trimmed Virgin: which the starres receive. Hee is her Beast on which shee rideth well adorned in her owne forces of life, as may be seene in the Revelations; Thus it hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into possession the outward glance of divine holinesse, viz. the light of Reason, and supposeth it selfe to be the faire childe in the house, but the Devill hath his lodging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 And thus it is with all these that have beene once enlightened by God, and after goe forth againe from true resignation, and weane themselves from the true milke of their Mother: viz. true humility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The way which a true Christian must follow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57657:46"/>16 REason will object and say: Is it not right for a man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the light of God, and also the light of the outward nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that he may be able to order his life wisely, as the Scripture sayth?</p>
                  <p n="17">17 Yes it is very right, nothing can be more profitable to a man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any better thing happen to him; nay it is a treasure above all earthly treasures, for a man to have the light of God and of time, for it is the eye of time and of eternity.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 But marke how thou oughtest to use it; the light of God first mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth it selfe in the soule, it shineth forth, as light from a candle, and kindleth the outward light of reason immediately: yet it yeeldeth not it self wholly up to reason to be under the dominion of the outward man; no, the outward man beholdeth himselfe in this, through shining lustre as he doth his likenesse in a looking-glasse; he presently learneth to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which is good and profitable for him.</p>
                  <p n="19">19 And when he doth so, Reason, which is the creaturely selfe, cannot doe better then to behold it selfe in the selfe of the creature, nor to enter
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57657:46"/>
with the will of the desire into the Center, in seeking it selfe, if it doe, it breaketh it selfe off from the substance of God, (which riseth together with the light of God, of which the soule ought to eate, and refresh it selfe therewith,) and eateth of the outward substance and light, and thereby draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the venome into it selfe againe.</p>
                  <p n="20">20 The will of the creature ought to sinke wholly into it selfe with all its reason and desire, accounting it selfe an unworthy childe, that is no whit worthy of this so high a grace, nor should it arrogate any knowledge or understanding to it selfe, or desire and begge of God to have any understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in its creaturely selfe: but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and simply sinke it selfe into the grace and love of God in Christ Jesus, and desire to be as it were dead to it selfe, and its owne reason in the divine life, and wholly resigne it selfe to the life of God in love, that he may doe how and what he will with it, as with his owne instrument.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 Its owne reason ought not to enter upon any speculation in divine, or in the ground, [or foundation] of humane matters; nor to will and desire any thing but the grace of God in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57657:47"/>
Christ; and as a child continually longeth after the breasts of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so must its hunger continually enter into the love of God, and not suffer it selfe to be broken off from this hunger by any meanes, when the outward reason triumpheth in the light, saying; I have the true child; but then the will of the desire must bow it selfe downe to the earth, and bring it selfe into the deepest humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and simple ignorance, and say; thou art foolish, and hast nothing, but the grace of God: thou must wrap thy selfe up into that, with great humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and become nothing at all in thy selfe; and neither know nor love thy selfe; all that thou hast, or is in thee must esteeme it selfe as nothing, but a meere Instrument of God, and then must bring the desire onely into Gods mercy, and goe forth from all thy owne knowing and willing, and esteeme it as nothing at all, nor must thou ever entertaine any will to enter into it againe.</p>
                  <p n="22">22 As soone as this is done, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall with entreth into weakenesse, and then the Devill is not able to fift it thus any more with his <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>false.</hi>
                     </note> evil desire, for the places of his rest become very

                     <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, or barren.</hi>
                     </note> weake and drie, and then the holy Spirit [proceeding] from God, taketh possession of the formes of life, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his dominion prevaile, viz. He kindleth the formes of life with his flames of love; and then the high skill and knowledge of the Center of all <note n="*" place="margin">Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or substan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces.</note> Things ariseth, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward Constellation of the creature, in a very subtile drying fire, with great delight, and desire to sinck downe into that light, and esteeme it selfe nothing; and thinketh it self to be unworthy of it.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And thus its own desire pierceth into that nothing (viz. into that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God createth,) and doth what hee will therein: and the Spirit of God springeth forth through the desire of the resigned Humility: And so the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane self immediately followeth the Spirit of God in trembling and joy of Humility; and so it may behold what is in time and eternity; for all is present before it.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. When the Spirit of God riseth up as a fire and the flame of Love, then the spirit of the soule descendeth, and saith: Lord, glory be to thy Name, not to me; Thou art able to take vertue power strength wisdom &amp; knowledge:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57657:48"/>
doe as thou wilt, I can doe nothing, I know nothing; I will goe no whither, but whither thou leadest me as thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, doe thou in me and with me what thou wilt.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. In such an humble and totall Resignation, the spark of Divine power falleth into the center of the forms of life (as a spark into Tinder) and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, viz. the <note n="o" place="margin">The. earnest zeale.</note> fire of the soule, (which Adam made to be a dark coale in himselfe,) so that it glimmereth. And when the light of Divine power hath kindled it selfe therein, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture must goe on as an instrument of Gods Spirit, and speak what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God <note n="p" place="margin">Or promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it.</note> telleth it: and then it is no more in its own proper possession, but it is the instrument of God.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But the will of the Soule must without ceasing, in this fiery-driving sink into nothing, viz. into the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest humility in the sight of God. For no sooner doth the will of the soule in the least measure goe on in its own speculation, or searching, but Lucifer layeth hold of it in the center of the formes of life, and sifteth it, so that it entreth into Selfe: it must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore continue close to resigned humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lith, as a Well doth to its Fountain, &amp;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57657:48"/>
must suck and drink of Gods Fountain, and not depart from the wayes of God at all.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. For, as soon as the soule eateth of Selfe, and of the light of outward Reason, it goeth on in its own opinion; and then its doings, which it sets forth for Divine, are but from the outward Constellation, which presently then layeth hold on the soule, and maketh it dry, and then the soule goeth on in Errours, till it yeeld it selfe up again into Resignation, and acknowledging it selfe anew to be a defiled child, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth reason, and so getteth the love of God again, which is harder to doe now, then it was at first: for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill brîngeth in strong doubts, he will not easily leave his Fort of prey.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. This may be seen clearly in the Saints of GOD from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world; that many who have been driven by the Spirit of God, have yet oftentimes depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Resignation into Selfe, viz. into their owne reason and will, in which Satan hath cast them into sins, and into the anger of God, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by DAVID &amp; SOLOMON, also by the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles, who have oftentimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57657:49"/>
great errours, when they have departed from Resignation into Selfe, viz. into their own reason and lust.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Therefore it is necessary for the children of God to know how to behave themselves when they will learn the way of God. They must beat down &amp; cast away their very thoughts, and desire nothing, nor have the least will to learn any thing, unlesse they find themselves to be in true Resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so that Gods Spirit, leadeth, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and guideth mans Spirit, and that the humane will which is addicted to it self, be wholly broken off from its own lust, and resigned in God.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. All speculation in the wonders of God, is very dangerous, for the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the will may soon be captivated therewith; unlesse the spirit of the will goeth or walketh after the Spirit of God, and then it hath power in the resigned humility to behold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God.</p>
                  <p n="31">31 I doe not say that a man should search and learn nothing in naturall Arts and Sciences; no, for it is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for him, but a man must not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with his own reason: Man ought not onely to govern his life by the light of outward reason, which is good
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57657:49"/>
in it selfe; but he must sink with that light into the deepest humility before God, and set the Spirit and will of God first in all his searching, so that the light of reason may see through the light of God. And though reason doe know much, it must not arrogate to it selfe as if it were in its own possession, but give glory to God, to whom alone wisdome and knowledge doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. For the more, Reason, sinketh it selfe down into simple humility in the sight of God, and the more unworthy it accounts it selfe in its sight, the more it dieth from self-desire, and the more the Spirit of God pierceth through it, and bringeth it into the highest knowledge; so that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the great wonders of God. For the Spirit of God worketh onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed humility, in that which neither seeketh nor desireth it selfe. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God taketh hold of whatsoever desireth to be simple and lowly before him, and bringeth it forth in his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; he hath pleasure onely in those that feare and bow themselves before him.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. For God hath not created us for our selves onely, but to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57657:50"/>
of his wonders, by which he desireth to manifest his wonders. The resigned will trusteth God, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth all good from him; but self-will ruleth it selfe, for it is broken off from God. All that self-will doth is sinne, and against God, for it is gone out of that order (wherein God created it) into disobedience, and desireth to be its own Lord and Master.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. When its own will dieth from it selfe, then it is free from sinne; for it desireth nothing but that which God desireth of his creature; it desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth onely to doe that for which God hath created it, and that which God will doe by it; and though it is and must bee the doing, yet it is but the instrument of the doing, by which God doth what he will.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. For this is the true Faith in<note place="margin">Note what true faith is.</note> Man, viz. to die from himselfe, viz. from his own desire; and in all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and designes, to bring his desire into the will of God, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the doing of nothing to himselfe, but esteem himselfe in all his doings, to be but a Servant or Minister of God, and to think that all he doth, or goeth about, is for God; for in such an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Spirit of God leadeth him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57657:50"/>
into true uprightnesse and faithfulnes towards his neighbour: for he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus with himselfe: I doe my work not for my self, but for God, who hath called and ordained me to doe it, as a servant in his Vineyard: hee listeneth continually after the voyce of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who within him commandeth him what hee shall doe: The Lord speaketh in him, and biddeth him doe it.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. But Selfe doth what outward reason from the starres commandeth, into which reason the Devill bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe flying in with his desire. All what ever Selfe doth, îs without the will of God, and it is done altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the phantasie, that the anger of God may accomplish its pastime there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. No work which is done without the will of God, can reach the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, it is all but an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable <note n="*" place="margin">Carv'd work.</note> Imagery in this great tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyling of mankind: for nothing is pleasing to God, but what he himselfe doth by the will, [as his instrument.] For there is but one onely God in the Essence of all Essences, and all that which worketh with him in that Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, is one Spirit with him: but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57657:51"/>
that which worketh in it selfe in its own will, is in it selfe without [being under] his dominion; it is indeed [under] or in that Dominion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ruleth every life, but not in [or under] that holy Divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in himselfe, but in the dominion of Nature, wherewith he governeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and good, nothing is divine, which walketh and worketh not in the will of God.</p>
                  <p n="38">38 Christ saith, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted out, and burnt in the fire: All the works of man which hee hath wrought without the will of God, shall bee burnt up in the last fire of God, and given to the wrath of God, viz. to the pit of darknesse to recreate it selfe withall: For Christ saith, Hee that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not with me, scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Whosoever worketh, and doth it not in a resigned will, with confidence in God, he doth but make desolate and scatter, it is not acceptable to God; nothing is pleasing to him but that which himselfe willeth with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and doth himselfe by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Therefore whatsoever is done
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57657:51"/>
by the conclusions of humane Selfe, in matters of the divine will, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is a meere Fiction, or Fable, and it is Babel, and is but a worke of the starres, and of the outward world, and not ackowledged by God to be his work; but it is the play of the wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wheele of Nature, wherein good and evill wrastle one with the other, what the one buildeth, the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth. And this is the great misery of vain turmoylings, all which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the judgement of God to decide the quarrell.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Whosoever therefore worketh or laboureth much in such turmoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, he worketh but for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: for no whit of it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
                     </note> permanent, ît must all be separated in the putrifaction. For that which is wrought in the anger of God, will be received thereby, and shall be kept in the mystery of its desire, to the day of Gods judgement, where evill and good shall be severed.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. But if a man turn and go forth from himself, and enter into the will of God, then also that good which he hath wrought in himself, shall be freed from the evill which he hath wrought. For Isaiah saith, Though your sins be as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57657:52"/>
red as scarlet, if yee turne and repent, they shall become as wooll, white as snow: for the evill shall be swallowed up in the wrath of God into death, and the good shal goe forth as a sprout out of the wild earth.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. WHosoever intendeth to work any thing that is good and perfect, wherein he hopeth eternally to rejoyce, and enjoy it, let him depart from himselfe, viz. from his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and enter into Resignation, into the will of God, and work with God: and though the earthly desire of Selfe in flesh and bloud cleaveth to him, yet if the will of the soule doe not receive that desire into it, Self cannot perform any work: for the resigned will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually destroyeth the being of Selfe againe, so that the anger of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach it; but if it should happen to reach it sometime, as it may so come to passe, yet the resigned will prevaileth with its power, and then it beareth the figure of a victorious work in the wonders, and may inherit the <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57657:52"/>
is kindled in the desire of Selfe; for then the desire worketh in the anger of God, by which a man would suffer losse: for his work is brought into the anger of God, and kept there to the great day of Gods judgement.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. All evill workes done purposely; belong to the judgement of God: but he that turneth, hee goeth out from them, and those his works belong to the fire. All things, shall and must be made manifest in the end: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God brought his working power into essence, that the love and anger of God might be made manifest, and be a representation of Gods deeds of wonder, to his glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And every creature must know, that it should continue in that [con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition] wherein it was created, or
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57657:53"/>
else it doth run on into a contrary will, and into enmity to the will of God, and bringeth it selfe into pain: For a creature which is created of darknesse, hath no pain in the darknesse: As a venomous Worm hath no pain in its venome, the venome is its life; and if it should lose its venome, and have some good thing in stead thereof brought into it, and be made manifest in its essence, this would bee pain and death to it, and so also the evill is pain and death to the good.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Man was created of, for, and in Paradise; of, for, and in the love of God; but if hee bring himselfe into anger, which is as a poysonous pain and death; then that contrary life is a pain and torment to him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the Devill had been created of the wrathfull Matrix, for, and in Hell, and had not had the divine <note n="*" place="margin">or, <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Ens,</hi> he could have no pain in Hell: but he being created for, and in Heaven, and yet did stirre up the source or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of darknesse in himselfe, and did bring himselfe totally into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; therefore the light is now a pain to him, viz. an everlasting despairing of Gods grace, and a continuall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; being God cannot endure him
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57657:53"/>
in himselfe, but hath spewed him out: and therefore the Devill is angry and wrathfull against his own mother, (of whose Essence and Being he hath his originall,) viz. the eternall Nature, which keepeth him prisoner in his own place, as a revolter, or fallen Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and sporteth it selfe in him, with its property of anger and wrath. And seeing he would not help forward the delight of the Divine joy, therefore he must now doe the contrary, and be an enemy against goodnesse. For, of God, and in him, are all things, darknesse and light, love and anger, fire and light; but hee calleth himselfe God onely, as to the light of his love.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is an eternall contrariety between darknesse and light; neither of them comprehendeth the other, and neither of them is the other; yet there is but one onely Essence, Being, or Substance, wherein they subsist: but there is a difference in quality and will, and yet the Essence or Substance is not divided, but a Principle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the division; so that the one is a nothing in the other, and yet, it is there, but not manifest in the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that thing wherein it is.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For the Divell continued in his

own Dominion, or Principality, but not in that wherein God created him, but in the aking, painfull birth of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in the center of Nature and the property of wrath, in the property which begetteth darknesse, anguish and pain. Indeed he is a Prince in the place of this world; yet in the first Principle in the Kingdome of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in the Pit.<note n="*" place="margin"> or, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bysse.</hi>

                  <p n="9">9. But not in the Kingdome of the Sunne, Starres, and Elements, he is no Lord or Prince therein, but in the wrathfull part, viz. in the root of the evill of every thing, and yet he hath no power to doe what hee pleaseth with it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For there is some good in all things, which holdeth the evill cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and shut up in the thing; there he can walk and rule onely in the evill, when it stirreth up an evill desire in it selfe, and bringeth its desire into wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse; which the inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot doe: but man can doe it through the inanimate creature, if he bring the center of his will, with the desire out of the eternall center into it, which is an Inchantment, and false Magick. The will of the Devill can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so enter into that whereinto Man
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57657:54"/>
bringeth the desire of his soul (which is also from the eternall) in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For the originall of the soule, and of Angels, out of the eternall, is the same. But the Divell hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er more over the time, [or temporary condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of this world, but in the <note n="o" place="margin">Or, <hi>Turba, magna,</hi> the Curse.</note> great <hi>Turba;</hi> wheresoever that kind leth it selfe in the eternall and naturall wrath, there he is busie, as in warres, fighting and strife, as also in great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests without water: in the fire he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth as farre as the <note n="*" place="margin">Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, or hurt.</note> 
                     <hi>Turba</hi> goeth in great showres and tempests of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, lightning and haile; but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not direct them; for he is not Lord or Master in them, but servant.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Thus the creature stirreth up, with the desire, good and evill, life and death. The Humane Angelicall desire standeth in the center of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Nature (which is without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) and wherein it kindleth it selfe, whether in good or evill, it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisheth its work in that.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Now, God created every thing for, and in that wherein it should be, the Angels for and in heaven, and Man for and in Paradise: if therefore the desire of the creature goe forth from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57657:55"/>
its own mother, then it entreth into the contrary will, and into enmity, and it is tormented with the contrariety therein, and so a false will ariseth in a good: and thence the good will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into its nothing again, viz. into the end of Nature and Creature, and so leaveth the creature in its own [e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, or] wickednesse, as appeareth by Lucifer and also by Adam, and had not the will of the love of God met with him, and of meere mercy entred into the humanity again, there could be no good will in man.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Therefore all speculation and searching about Gods will, is a vain thing, without the mind be converted: For when the mind sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth captivated in the selfe-desire of the earthly life, it cannot <hi rend="sup">o</hi> comprehend [what] the will of God [is,] it runneth on but in Selfe, from one way into another, and yet findeth no rest; for selfe-desire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore bringeth disquietnesse: but when it sinketh it selfe wholly into the mercy of God, desiring to die from it selfe, and to have Gods will for a guide to the understanding, so that it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth and esteemeth it selfe as nothing, and willeth nothing but what God will: and then if the desire of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57657:55"/>
in the earthly flesh, goe along or joyneth with the Devils imagination, and assaulteth the will of the soule, then the resigned desire crieth to God, and saith, Abba, Ioving father, deliver me from the evill: And then (though the earthly wil should grow too strong in the wrath of God by the infection of the Devill) the desire of anger would work but in, or upon it selfe; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith: Now, if I sin, I doe it not, but sin that dwelleth in my flesh: also, now I serve the Law of God in my mind; but in my flesh, the law of sinne. <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth not, that the will should consent in the will of the flesh; but sin is so strong in the flesh; viz. the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened anger of God in Selfe, that oftentimes it is brought into lust by force, through the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
                     </note> evill provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wicked men, or else by behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding worldly pomp and glory, so that it wholly bedeafeth the resigned will, and ruleth by force.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Now, when sin is wrought in the flesh, then the wrath sporteth it selfe therewith, and catcheth at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed will, and then the resigned will crieth to God for deliverance from the evill, and prayeth that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the sinne away from it, aud bring
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57657:56"/>
sin into the center, viz. into death, that it might die.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith further, Now there is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus, that are called according to the purpose of God, that is, those that in that purpose of God (in which God called man) are again cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the same calling, to stand again in that purpose of God, wherein he created man to be his likenesse, and image of him.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. So long as a mans own will standeth in Selfe, so long it is not in the purpose and calling of God, it is not called, for it is gone forth from its own place; but when the mind turneth it selfe back again into the calling, viz. into Resignation, then the will is in the calling of God, viz in the place for, and in which God created it, and then it hath power to become the child of God as it is written, He hath given us power to become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The power which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us is his purpose, for, and in which he created Man in his Image, this God hath brought again into the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he hath given power unto that power, to break the head of sinne in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57657:56"/>
the flesh, viz. the will and desire of the Serpent: that is, the resigned will in Christ treadeth upon the head of the desire of the sinful wil of the Serpent, and killeth again the sins which were committed. This power that is given, becommeth a death to death, and the power of life to life.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Therefore no man can make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excuse, as if he could not will. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, while he sticketh fast in himselfe, in his own desire, and serveth onely the law of sinne in the flesh, he cannot: For he is kept back, as being a servant of sinne; but when he turneth the center of his mind away, and turneth it into the will and obedience of God; then he can.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Now, the center of the mind is [come] out of eternity, out of Gods Omnipotence, it can bring it selfe into what it will, and whither it will: for that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> in God, and that is eternall love, a desire of thatwhich is his like, viz. Power, Beauty, and Vertue.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. God desireth nothing but what is like his desire; his desire receiveth nothing but what it selfe is.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. God receiveth no finner into his power and vertue, unlesse the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner goe forth from his sinnes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth with the desire into him: and he will not cast out them that come unto him; he hath given to the will an open gate in Christ, saying, Come unto me all yee that are heavie laden with sinnes, I will refresh you; take my yoak upon you, that is, the Crosse
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57657:57"/>
of the enmity in the flesh, which was the yoak of Christ, who must beare it for the sinnes of all men. This crosse the resigned will must take upon it, in the evill earthly sinfull flesh, and beare it after Christ in patience, in hope of deliverance, and always breakt he head of the Serpent with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed will of the soule, in Christs will and Spirit, and kill and destroy the earthly will in Gods anger, and not let it rest on a soft bed when sinne is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, thinking I wil repent one time or other.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. No, no, the earthly will grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth strong, fat and wanton upon this soft bed: But so soon as the breath of God shineth in thee, and sheweth sinne to thee, the will of the soul must sink it selfe down into the passion and death of Christ, &amp; wrap it selfe up close in it, and take the passion of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its possession, and be a Lord over the death of sin by the death of Christ, and kill it and destroy it in the death of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. It must die though it be never so unwilling: Be at enmity with the voluptuous earthly flesh, give it not what it would have; let it fast and suffer hunger till its tickling cease; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

the will of the flesh thy enemy, and do not what the desire in the flesh will, and then thou shalt bring a death into the death in the flesh.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Regard not any scorne of the world, think they doe but scorn thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and that it is become a foole to them; nay, doe thou thy selfe account it thy foole, which <hi>Adam</hi> caused thee to have in thee, and suffered to be thy false heire. Cast the sonne of the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman out of the house, (that strange child which God did not give to be in the house of life in <hi>Adam</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:) for the son of the bond-woman must not inherit with the son of the free-woman.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. The earthly will is but the son of the Bond-woman: for the foure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements should have been mans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but <hi>Adam</hi> hath brought them into <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>
                     </note> filiation: Therefore God said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he had opened the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the promise in him: Cast out the son of the bond-woman; for hee shall not inherit with the sonne of the free. This [sonne of the] Free is Christ, which God of his grace hath brought again into the flesh for us, viz. a <note n="*" place="margin">Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed mind.</note> new mind, wherein the will, viz. the eternall will of the soul, may draw
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57657:58"/>
and drink the water of life, of which Christ speaketh, saying: Whosoever shall drink of this water that he will give us, it shall spring up in him, and be a Fountain of eternall life. This Fountaine is the renovation of the mind of the soule, viz. the eternall <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum</hi> [or Constellation] of the eternall Nature, viz. of the creaturely property of the soul.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Therefore I say, that all fictions and devices, to come to God by, let them have what name soever they will, which men contrive and invent for wayes to God, are lost labour and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, without a new mind There is no other way to God, but a new mind; which turneth from wickednes, and entreth into repentance for the sinnes it hath committed, and goeth forth from its iniquity, and willeth it no more, but wrappeth its will up in the death of Christ, and with all earnestnesse dieth from the sinne of the soule in the death of Christ, so that the mind of the soule willeth sinne no more.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. And although all the Devils did follow him hard, and did go with their desire into the flesh, yet the will of the soule should stand still and hide it selfe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57657:59"/>
in the death of Christ, willing and desiring nothing but the Mercie of God.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. No hypocriticall flattery, or outward comforting ones self availeth at all, as when men will cover sinne and iniquity in the flesh, with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Christ, and remain in Self still. Christ saith, Except ye turn and become as children, yee shall not see the Kingdome of God: the mind must become as wholly new as in a child, that knoweth nothing of sinne. Christ saith also, Ye must be born anew, or else yee shall not see the Kingdome of God. There must arise a will wholly new, in the death of Christ, it must be brought forth out of Christs <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>intar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
                     </note> entring into the humanity, and rise in Christs resurrection.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Now before this can be done, the will of the soule must dye in the death of Christ first; for in Adam it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the son of the bond-woman, viz. sinne into it. This, the will of the soul must first cast out, and the poore cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive soule must wrap it selfe up in the death of Christ earnestly, with all the power it hath; so that the sonne of the bond-woman, viz. sin, in it selfe, may dye in the death of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="34">
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:57657:59"/>34. Truly, sin must dye in the will of the soule, or else there can be no vision of God; for the earthly will in sinne, and the anger of God, shall not see God: but Christ that came into the flesh. The soul must put on the Spirit and flesh of Christ: it cannot inherit the Kingdome of God in this earthly Tabernacle; for the kingdome of sin hangeth to it outwardly, which must putrifie in the earth, and rise again in new power.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Hypocrifie, flattery, and verball forgivenesse, availeth nothing, we must be children, not by outward imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but born of God from within, in the new man, which is resigned in God.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. All such flattering of our selves, in saying, Christ hath paid the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and made satisfaction for sinne, he is dead for our sinnes: if we also do not dye from sinne, in him; and put on his merit in new obedience, and live therein, all is false, and a vain frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous comfort.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. He that is a bitter enemy and hater of sinne, he can and may comfort himselfe with the sufferings of Christ; he that doth not willingly see, hear, nor tast sinne, but is at enmity with it, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57657:60"/>
would willingly always doe that which is well and right, if he knew but what he ought to doe: he that is such a one, I say, hath put on the Spirit and will of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. The outward flattery of being accounted a child of God by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or externall application, is false and vain: the work done in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward flesh onely, doth not make the child of God, but the working of Christ in the Spirit, maketh, and is the child of God; which working is so powerfull in the outward work, that it shineth forth as a new light, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth it self to be the child of God in the outward work of the flesh.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. For if the eye of the soule be light, then the whole body is light in all its members. Now if any boast himself to be the child of God, and yet suffereth the body to burn in sins, he is not yet capable of being a child, but lieth captive in the fetters of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, in great darknesse: and if he doe not find in himselfe an earnest will burning in him, of well-doing in love; then his pretence is but an invention of Reason, proceeding from Selfe, which cannot see God, unlesse it be born anew, and shew forth in its power
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57657:60"/>
and vertue, that it is his child: For there is no fire but hath light in it: and if the divine fire be in the mind, it will shine forth, and the mind will doe that which God will have done.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. But perhaps thou wilt say, I have a will indeed to doe so, I would willingly doe it, but I am so hindred, that I cannot?</p>
                  <p n="41">41. Yes, thou vile man, God draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee to be his child, but thou wilt not; the soft cushion in evill, is dearer to thee then so; thou preferrest the joy of wickednesse before the joy of God, thou wholly stick'st fast in Selfe still, and livest according to the law of Sin, and that hindereth thee: thou art unwilling to dye from the pleasure of the flesh, and therefore thou art not in the filiation, and yet God draweth thee to it, but thou thy selfe wilt not.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. O how fine a thing would A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam think it to be, if he might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into heaven with this will [of the voluptuous flesh.] &amp; to have the child of wickednesse, that is full of deceit, set upon the Throne of God. Lucifer also would fain have had it so, but he was spewed out.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. It is a troublesome thing to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57657:61"/>
mortifie the evill will, none are willing to have it so: we would all willingly be the children of God, if we might be so with this <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>fleshly lust.</hi>
                     </note> garment, but it cannot be. This world passeth away, and the outward life must dye; what good can the childhood in the mortall body doe me?</p>
                  <p n="43">43. If we would inherit the filiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we must also put on the new man, which can inherit the filiation, which is like the deity. God wil have no sinner in heaven, but such as are born anew, and become children, which have put on heaven.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Therefore it is not so easie a matter to become the children of God, as men imagine. Indeed it is not a burdensome thing to him that hath put on the filiation, whose light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; for it is joy to him. But to turn the mind, and destroy Selfe, there is a strong continual earnestnesse requisite, and such a purpose, that if the body and soule should part asunder by it, yet the will should persevere constantly, and not enter again into Selfe.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. A man must wrastle so long, till the dark center that is shut up so close, break open, and the spark in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kindle, and from thence immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57657:61"/>
the Noble <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Lilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twig.</hi>
                     </note> Lilly-branch sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as from the divine grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard seed, as Christ saith. A man must pray earnestly, with great humility, and for a while become a foole in his own reason, and see himselfe as voyd of understanding therin, untill Christ be formed in this new incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. And then when Christ is born, Herod is ready to kill the child, which he seeketh to doe outwardly by perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and inwardly by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to try whether this Lilly-branch will be strong enough to destroy the kingdome of the Devil, which is made manifest in the flesh.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. Then this destroyer of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is brought into the wildernesse, after he is baptized with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and tempted and tried whether he will continue in Resignation in the will of God: he must stand so fast, that if need require, hee would leave all earthly things, and even the outward life, to be a child of God.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. No temporall honour must be preferred before the filiation; but he must with his will, leave and forsake it all, and not account it his owne, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem himselfe as a servant in it onely, in obedience to his Master; hee must
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57657:62"/>
leave all worldly propriety. Wee doe not mean that hee may not have, or possesse any thing; but his heart must forsake it, and not bring his will into it, nor count it his own; if he set his heart upon it, he hath no power to serve them, that stand in need, with it.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. Selfe onely serveth that which is temporary, but Resignation hath rule over all that is under it. Selfe must doe what the Devill will have it to doe in fleshly voluptuousnesse and pride of life: but Resignation ttea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it under with the feet of the mind. Selfe despiseth that which is lowly and simple; but Resignation sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down with the lowly in the dust: it saith, I will be simple in my selfe, and understand nothing, lest my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing should exalt it selfe and sin. I will lye down in the Courts of my God at his feet, that I may serve my Lord in that which he commandeth me: I will know nothing my selfe, that the commandment of my Lord may lead and guide mee, and that I may only doe what God doth through me, and will have done by me: I will sleep in my selfe untill the Lord awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mee with his Spirit: and if he will not, then will I cry out eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57657:62"/>
in him in silence, and wait his commands.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. Beloved brethren, men boast much now-a-dayes, of faith, but where is that faith? The modern faith is but the History. Where is that child, which beleeveth that Jesus is borne? If that child were in Being, and did beleeve that Jesus is born, it would also draw neere to the sweet child Jesus, and receive him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="51">51. Alas! the Faith now a dayes is but Historicall, and a meere know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the story, that the Jewes killed him, that hee left this world, that he is not King on earth in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall man: but that men may doe what they list, and need not dye from sinne, and their evill lusts: All this the wicked child Selfe rejoyceth in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it may fatten the Devil by living de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously.</p>
                  <p n="52">52 This sheweth plainly, that true faith was never weaker and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler since Christs time, then it is now, when neverthelesse the world cryeth a loud, and saith, we have found the true saith, and contend about a child, so that there was never worse conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion since men were on earth.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. If thou beest Zion, and hast

that new-born Child which was lost and is found again; then let it be seen in power and vertue, and let us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly see the sweet Child JESUS brought forth by thee, and that we may see that thou art his Nurse: if not, then the children in Christ will say, thou hast found nothing but the History, viz. the Cradle of the Child.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Where hast thou the sweet child Jesus, thou that art exalted with the History, and with thy false and seeming faith? O how will the Child Jesus visit thee once in the Fathers <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of anger.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Shewing how Man should consider himselfe.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRIST said, Except yee turn, and become as children, yee shal not see the Kingdome of God: Again, he said to Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, Except a man be born a-new, of Water and of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God: for that which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit. Joh. 3. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Also the Scripture witnesseth plainly, that the fleshly Naturall Man
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57657:68"/>
receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishnesse unto him, neither can he know them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now, seing that all of us have flesh and bloud, and are mortall, as we see by experience; and yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, that we are the Temple of the holy Ghost, who dwelleth in us; and that the kingdome of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; and that CHRIST must be formed in us; also, that he will give us his flesh for food, and his bloud for drink: and saith further, Whosoever shall not eat of the flesh of the Sonne of Man, he hath no life in him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should seriously consider, what kind of man in us it is, that is capable of being thus like the Deity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For it cannot be said of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall flesh, that turneth to earth again, and liveth in the vanity of this world, and contînually Iusteth against God; that it is the Temple of the holy Ghost: much lesse can it be said, that the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth commeth to passe in this earthly flesh, which dyeth and putrifieth, and is a continuall House of sin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet seeing it remaineth true, that a true Christian is born of CHRIST, and that the New-birth is the Temple
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57657:68"/>
of the' holy Ghost which dwelleth in us, and that the new Man onely, that is born of Christ, partaketh of the flesh and bloud of Christ; it appeareth that it is not so easie a matter to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And that Christianity doth not consist in the meere knowing of the History, and applying the knowledge thereof to our selves onely, in saying, that Christ died for us, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed death, and turned it into life in us, and that he hath paid the ransome for us, so that we need do nothing but comfort our selves with this, and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly beleeve that it is so.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For we find in our selves, that sin is living, lusting, strong, and powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working in the flesh: and therefore it must be somewhat else (that doth not co-operate in the flesh of sin, nor willeth sin,) that is the New-birth in Christ.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. For St. Paul saith, There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. And further, should we, that are Christians; be yet sinners? God forbid, seeing wee are dead to sinne in Christ.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Besides, the Man of sinne cannot be the Temple of the holy Ghost; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57657:69"/>
yet there is no man that sinneth not: For God hath shut up all under sinne. For the Scripture saith, No one living is righteous in thy sight, if thou im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putest his sinnes to him. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man falleth seven times a day: and yet it cannot be meant, that the righteous falleth and sinneth, but his mortall and sinfull man.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. For the righteousnesse of a Christian in Christ, cannot sinne: For St. Paul saith, Our conversation is in heaven, from whence we expect our Saviour Jesus Christ. Now, if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation be in heaven, then heaven must be in us: Christ dwelleth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and then if we are his Temple, that Temple, Heaven, must hee in us.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But for all this, seeing sinne tempteth us within us, whereby the Devill hath within us an accesse to us, therefore hell also must bee in us too: for the Devill dwelleth in hell; wheresoever he is, he is in hell, and cannot come out of it. Yes, when he possesseth a Man, hee dwelleth in hell, viz. in the Anger of God in that man.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Therefore we ought to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well, what Man is, and how hee is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57657:69"/>
a Man; and then we may perceive, that a true Christian is not a meere Historicall New Man, as if it were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us outwardly to confesse Christ, and beleeve that he is the Son of God, and hath paid the ransome for ns; for righteousnes availeth nothing if it be imputed from without, that is, by beleeving onely that it is imputed: but an innate righteousnesse, or the righteousnesse born in us, in which we are the children of God, that avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And as the flesh must dy, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the life and will must dye from sin, and be as a child knowing nothing, but longeth after the mother w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> brought it forth: so must also the will of a Christian enter again into its mother, viz. into the Spirit of Christ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a child in it selfe in its own will and power, having its will and desire inclined and directed onely towards its mother, and a new will and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in righteousnesse, which willeth sinne no more, must rise from death out of the Spirit of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. For that will is not born a-new, which desireth and admitteth vanity into it selfe: and yet there remaineth a will which longeth after vanity, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57657:70"/>
sinneth in the New-born, or Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man. Therefore the Image of man must well be considered, and how the New-birth commeth to passe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not wrought in the mortall flesh; and yet truly and really in us in flesh and bloud, in Water and Spirit, as the Scripture saith.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. We should therefore rightly consider what kind of man it is in us, that is the member of Christ, and Temple of God who dwelleth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And then also what kind of man it is, that the Devill Ruleth and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; for he cannot meddle with the Temple of Christ, nor doth he care much for the mortall flesh; and yet there are not three men in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for all make but one man.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Now, if we will consider this rightly, we must consider Time and Eternity, and how they are in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; also light and darknesse, good and evill: but especially the originall of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This may thus be considered:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. The outward world, with the Starres and foure Elements, wherein Man and all creatures live, neîther is,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57657:70"/>
nor is called God. Indeed God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in it, but the substance of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward World comprehendeth him not.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. We see also, that the light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in darknesse, and the darknesse comprehendeth not the light, and yet they both dwell in one another. The foure Elements are also an example of this, which in their originall are but one element, which îs neither hot nor cold, nor dry nor moist, and yet by its stirring, severeth it selfe into foure properties, viz. into Fire, Aire, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Earth.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Who would beleeve that fire<note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>genera<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teth.</hi>
                     </note> produceth water? and that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of fire could be in water? if we did not see it with our eyes in tempests of thundring, lightning and rain; and did not find also, that in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, the essentiall fire in the body dwelleth in the bloud, and that the bloud is the mother of the fire, and the fire the father of the bloud.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And as God dwelleth in the world, and filleth all things, and yet possesseth nothing: and as the fire dwelleth in water, and yet posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it not: also, as the light dwelleth in darknesse, and yet possesseth not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57657:71"/>
the darknesse; as the day is in the night, and the night in the day; time in eternity, and eternity in time: so is man created according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humanity, he is the time, and in the time, and the time is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward world, and it is also the outward man.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The inward man is eternity, and the spirituall time and world; which also consisteth of light and darknesse, viz. of the love of God, as to the eternall light; and of the anger of God, as to the eternall darknesse: whichsoever of these is manifest in him, his spiirit dwelleth in that, be it darknesse or light.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. For light and darknesse are both in him; but each of them dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in it selfe, and neither of them possesseth the other; but if one of them doe enter into the other, and will possesse it, then that other loseth its right and power.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. The passive loseth its power: For if the light be made manifest in the darknesse, then the darknesse lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth its darknesse, and is not known or discerned. Also on the contrary, if the darknesse arise in the light, and get the upper hand, then the light and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57657:71"/>
the power thereof is extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is to be considered also in man.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. The eternall darknesse of the soule, is hell, viz. an aking source of anguish, which is called the anger of God: but the eternall light in the soul, is the kingdome of heaven, where the fiery anguish of darknesse is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into joy.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For, the same nature of anguish, which in the darknesse is a cause of sadnesse, is in the light a cause of the outward and stirring joy: For the <note n="*" place="margin">or, <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</hi>
                     </note> source in light, and the source in darknesse, is but one eternall source, and one nature, and yet <note n="*" place="margin">light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> they have a mighty difference in the source: the one dwelleth in the other, and beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the other, and yet is not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The fire is painufll and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, but the light is yeelding, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, powerfull, and delightfull, a sweet and amiable joy.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. This may be found also in man, he is, and liveth in three worlds, One is the eternall dark-world, viz. the center of the eternall nature, which <note n="a" place="margin">gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gette. h.</note> produceth the fire, viz. the <note n="b" place="margin">Or, <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                     </note> source of anguish.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. The other is the eternall light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>world,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57657:72"/>
which begetteth the eternall joy, which is the Divine Habitation, wherein the Spirit of God dwelleth, and wherein the Spirit of Christ recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the humane substance, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth the darknesse; so that it must be a cause of joy in the Spirit of Christ in the light.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. The third is the outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible world, in the foure elements and the visible starres; though indeed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry element hath its peculiar constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it selfe, whence the desire and property ariseth, and is like a mind.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Thus you may understand, that the fire in the light is a fire of love, a desire of meeknesse and delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but the fire in the darknesse is a fire of anguish, and it is painfull, irk some, enimicitious, and full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in its essence. The fire of the light hath a good relish, or taste, but the taste in the essence of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is unpleasant, loathsome and irksome: For all the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </note> Forms till fire, are in great anguish</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> How Man is created.</head>
                  <p n="30">30 HEre we are to consider the creation of Man. Moses saith, God created Man in his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, in the Image of God created he him. This we understand to be both out of the eternal and temporall birth, out of the inward spirituall world, which hee breathed into him, into the created Image; and then out of the substance of the inward spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all world, which is holy.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. For as there is a nature and substance in the outward world: so also in the inward spirituall world, there is a Nature and Substance which is Spirituall; out of which the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward world is breathed forth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of light and darknesse, and created [<note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>into.</hi>
                     </note> to have] a beginning and time.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And out of the substance of the inward and outward world, Man was created out of, &amp; in the likenesse of the birth of all <note n="a" place="margin">Or, <hi>things.</hi>
                     </note> substances. The body is a <note n="b" place="margin">a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or a kind of seed, which containeth aell the thing hath from whence it is.</note> 
                     <hi>Limbus</hi> of the earth, &amp; also a <hi>Limbus</hi> of the heavenly substance: for the earth is <note n="c" place="margin">or, <hi>out-spoken, or expressed.</hi>
                     </note> breathed forth out of the dark and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57657:73"/>
light world. In the word <note n="d" place="margin">Or, <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting word.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Fiat,</hi> viz. in the eternall desire, man was taken out of the earth, and so created an Image out of time and eternity.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. This Image was in the inward and spirituall element, from whence the foure elements proceed and are produced. In that one element was Paradise; for the properties of nature from the fire-dark-and-light-world, were all in <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>
                     </note> harmony, in like agreement both in number, weight, and measure, none of them was manifested eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more then another: and so there was no fragility therein; for one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was not predominanr ovet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither was there any strife or contrariety among the powers and properties.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Into this created Image God breathed the Spirit and breath of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding out of all the three worlds, as one onely soule; which <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
                     </note> is in the inward dark and fire world, of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall spirituall nature, according to which God calleth himselfe a strong zealous God, and a consuming fire.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And this now is the eternall creaturely great soule, a magical breath of fire; in which fire consisteth the originall of life, from the great power
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57657:73"/>
of variation: Gods anger, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall darknesse is in this property; so farre as sire reacheth, without giving light.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. The second property of the breath of God, is the Spirit of the source of light, proceeding from the great fiery desire of love, from the great meeknesse, according to which God calleth himselfe a loving merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God; in which consisteth the true Spirit of understanding and of life in power.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. For as Light shineth from fire, and as the power of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is discerned in the light: so the breath of the light was joyned to the breath of the fire of God, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into the Image of man.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. The third property of the breath of God, was the outward aire, with its <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Astrnm</hi>
                     </note> Constellation; wherein the life and Constellation of the outward substance and body did consist: This he breathed into his Nostrils; and as time and eternity hang together, and as time is produced out of eternity, so the inward breath of God hung to the outward: and this threefold soul was at once breathed into man.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. Each substance of the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57657:74"/>
the Spirit according to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: thus the outward flesh received the outward aire and its constellations, for a rationall and vegetative life, to the manifestation of the wonders of God: and the light-body, or heavenly substance, received the breath of the light of the great divine powers and vertues, which breath is called the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Thus the light pierced through the darknesst, viz. through the dark breath of sire, and also through the breath of the outward aire, and its <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>astrum</hi>
                     </note> constellation; and so deprived all the properties of their power, that neither the anguish of the breath of Fire in the inward property of the soule, nor heat and cold, nor any of all the properties of the outward constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, might or could be manifested.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. The properties of all the three worlds in soule and body, were in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall <note n="*" place="margin">har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</note> agreement and weight: That which was inward and holy, ruled through the outward, viz. through the outward parts of the outward life, of the outward <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </note> Starres, and the foure Elements, and that was the holy Paradise.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. And thus Man was both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57657:74"/>
and also in the outward world; and was Lord over all the creatures of this world, nothing could destroy him.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. For such was the earth also, till the curse of God was: The holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Spirituall world, sprung up also through the earth, and brought forth holy Paradisicall fruits, which man could then eat in a Magical Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disicall manner.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. And had neither need of teeth nor <note n="*" place="margin">Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and guts.</note> entrails in his body. For as the light swalloweth up darknesse, and as the fire devoureth water, and yet is not filled therewith; just such a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man also had <note n="*" place="margin">or, <hi>in</hi>
                     </note> for his mouth [to to eat withall] according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eternity.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. And in such a manner he could also <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Beget.</hi>
                     </note> generate his like out of himself, without any dividing or opening of his body and spirit, as God did generate the outward world, and yet did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himselfe; but did in his desire, viz. in the word <hi>Fiat,</hi> manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and brought it into a figure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eternall spirituall birth; so also man was created such an Image and likenesse, according to time and eterntiy, out of both time and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57657:75"/>
yet in and for an eternall immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, which was without enmity and contrariety.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. But the Devill, having been a Prince and Hierarcha in the place of this world, and having been cast out for his pride, into the dark anguishing painfull, and hostile property and source, into the wrath of God: Hee therefore envied man that glory, of being created in and for the Spirituall world, the place which he himselfe had, and therefore brought his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into the Image of Man, and made it so lusting, that the dark world and also the outward world, arose in Man, and departed from the equall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and harmony, and so one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver weighed the other.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. And then the properties were every one made manifest in it self, and every one of them lusted after that which was like it selfe, viz. that which was out of the birth of the dark world; and also that which was out of the birth of the light world; would each of them eat of the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the earth,<note place="margin">* See Limbus before.</note> according to its hunger, and so evill and good became manifest in Adam.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. And when the hunger of the properties went into the earth, from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57657:75"/>
whence the properties of the body were extracted, then the <hi>Fiat</hi> drew such a branch out of the earth, as the properties could eat of in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="49">49. Being the spirit of the strong and great magicall power of Time and Eternity was in Adam, from which the earth with its properties was brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed forth: and so the <hi>Fiat,</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> viz. the strong desire of the eternall Nature, attracted the essence of the earth. And thus GOD let the Tree of knowledge of good evill grow for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, according to his awakened pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: for the great power of the soule and of the body, caused it.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. And then man must be tried, whether he would stand and subsist in his own powers, before the Tempter, the Devill, and before the wrath of the eternall Nature; and whether the soule would continue in the equall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the properties in true Resignation, under Gods Spirit, as an instrument of Gods Harmony, a tuned instrument of divine joyfulnesse for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit of God to strike upon. This was tried by this Tree here, and this severe commandement was added, Thou
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57657:76"/>
shalt not eat thereof: For at that day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt dye the death.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. But it being known to God, that Man would not stand, and that he had already imagined and lusted after good &amp; evill, God said, It is not good for man to be alone: Wee will make him an Help meet for him.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. For God saw that Adam could not generate Magically, having entred with his lust into vanity. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Moses saith, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and he slept; that is, seeing man would not continue in obedience of the divine harmony in the properties, submitting himselfe to stand still as an instrument of the Spirit of God: therefore God suffered him to fall from the Divine Harmony, into an harmony of his own, viz. into the awakened properties in evill and good, the spirit of his soule went into these,</p>
                  <p n="53">53. And there in this sleep he dyed from the Angelicall world, and fell to be the share of the outward <hi>Fiat,</hi> and then bad farewell to the eternall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which was of Gods begetting. Here his Angelicall form &amp; power lay on the ground, and fell into a swound.</p>
                  <p n="54">
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:57657:76"/>54. And then by the <hi>Fiat,</hi> God made the woman out of him, <hi>ex matrice Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi> of the matrix of Venus, viz. out of that property wherin Adam had the begettresse in himselfe; and so out of one body he made two, and divided the properties of the Tinctures, viz. the watery and fiery Constellations in the Element, yet not wholly in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but in the Spirit, viz. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Watery and Fîery Soule.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And yet it is but one thing, but the property of the Tincture was divided, the desire of Self-love was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Adam, and formed into a woman according to his likenesse; and therefore man now so eagerly desireth the Matrix of the woman, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man desireth the <hi>Limbus</hi> of the man, viz. the Fire-element, the originall of the true soule, by which is meant the Tincture of fire: For these two were one in Adam, and therein consisted the Magicall begetting.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. And as soon as Eve was made out of Adam in his sleep, both Adam and Eve were at that instant ordained, and constituted in the outward naturall life, having the members given the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Bestiall and animall <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57657:77"/>
and also the earthly <note n="*" place="margin">That which when we are dead is meat for worms</note> Carkasse into which they might put their vanity, and live like beasts.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. Which the poore soule, that is captivated in vanity, is at this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of, that its body hath gotten a bestiall monstrous shape, as is manifest: And from hence came mankind to be ashamed of their members and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to borrow their clothîng from the earthly creatures, having lost the Angelicall form, and is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Beast.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. This clothing sheweth man suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, that having this awakened va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and heat and cold, seizing upon him, he is not at home with his soule therein: For the vanity, together with this false clothing, must perish. and bee severed from the Soule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. Now, when Adam awaked from sleep, he beheld his wife, and knew that she came out of him: For he had not yet eaten of vanity with his [out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward] mouth, but with the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, desire and lust onely.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. And it was the first desire of Eve, that she might eat of the Tree of vanity, of Evill and Good, to which the Devill, in the form of a Serpent,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57657:77"/>
perswaded her, saying, That her eyes should bee opened, and she bee as GOD himself, which was both a lye and truth.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. But he told her not that she should lose the divine light and power thereby: he only said, her eyes should be opened, that she might taste, prove, and know, evill and good, as he had done: he did not tell her neither, that heat and cold would awake in her, and that the property of the outward <note n="*" place="margin">stars or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra.</note> constellations would mightily domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere in the flesh and in the mind.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. His onely aim was, that the Angelicall Image, viz. the Substance which came from the inward spirituall world, might disappeare in them; for then they would be constrained to live [in subjection] to the grosse earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; the <note n="*" place="margin">Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Stars.</hi>
                     </note> Constellations, and then he knew well enough that when the outward world perished, the soule should then be with him in darknesse: for he saw that the body should dye, which he perceived by that which God had intimated: and so he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed yet to be Lord to all eternity in the place of this world in his false shape which he had gotten; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he seduced Man.</p>
                  <p n="63">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57657:78"/>63. For when Adam and Eve were eating of the fruit, evill and good, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body, then the imagination of the body received vanity in the fruit, &amp; then vanity awaked in the flesh, and the Dark-world got the upper hand, &amp; dominion in the vanity of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse; upon which the faire Image of heaven, [that proceeded] out of the Heavenly divine world, instantly disappeared.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. Here Adam and Eve dyed to the Kingdome of heaven, and awaked to the outward world; and then the faire soule in the love of GOD, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared as to the holy power, vertue, and property; and in stead thereof, the wrathfull anger, viz. the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire-world awaked in it: and so the soule became in one part, viz. in the inward Nature, a halfe Devill, and in the outward part of the outward world, a beast.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. Here are the bounds of Death, and the gates of Hell; for which cause God became man, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy death, and change Hell into great love again, and destroy the vanity of the Devill.</p>
                  <p n="66">66. Let this be told you, yee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, it is told you in the

                  <p n="68">68. And then the flesh became grosse and rough, as the flesh of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beast, and the noble soule was captivated in the essence therewith, and saw that its body was become a beast; and it saw also the bestiall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for multiplication, and the stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Carkasse into which the desire would stuffe the loathsomnesse which it was ashamed of in the presence of GOD, and therefore they hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57657:79"/>
under the Trees of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden; heat and cold also seized on them.</p>
                  <p n="69">69. And here the Heaven in Man trembled for horror, as the earth did quake in wrath, when this anger was destroyed on the Crosse with the sweet love of God; there the anger trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before the sweet love of God.</p>
                  <p n="70">70. And for this vanities sake, which was thus awakened in Man, God cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the earth, lest the holy Element should<note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>shine forth.</hi>
                     </note> spring forth any more through the outward fruit, and bring forth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radisicall fruit; for there was no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could then have enjoyed it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the earthly Man worthy of it any more.</p>
                  <p n="71">71. God would not cast the pretious Pearles before Beasts, an ungodly man in his body being but a meere grosse beastiall creature; and though it be of a noble Essence, yet it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poysoned and loathsome in the sight of God.</p>
                  <p n="72">72. Now, when God saw that his faire Image was spoyled, he opened himselfe before them, and had pitty on them, and promised himselfe to them for an everlasting possession, and that with his great love in the received hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57657:79"/>
he would destroy the power of the Serpentine property, (viz. of vanity in the wrath of God) with love. And this was the breaking of the head [of the Serpent, which he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form] viz. he would destroy the dark Death, and subdue the anger with his great love.</p>
                  <p n="73">73. And this covenant of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which was to come, he put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the light of life; to which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the Jewish sacrifices pointed, as to a <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Limit.</hi>
                     </note> mark, to which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised himselfe with his love: For the Faith of the Jewes entred into the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and offerings; and Gods ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination entred into the covenant.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. And the offering was a figure of the Restitution of that which Adam had lost; and so God did expiate his anger in the humane property, through the offering in the limit of the covenant.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. In which covenant, the most holy sweet Name JESUS, [proceeding] out of the holy Name, and great power JEHOVAH, had incorporated it selfe: so that he would again move and manifest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the substance of the heavenly world, which disappeared in Adam,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57657:80"/>
and kindle the holy divine life therein again.</p>
                  <p n="76">76. This mark or limit of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was propagated from Adam and his children, from Man to Man, and did goe through, from one upon all, as sinne also, and the awaked vanity, did go through from one upon all.</p>
                  <p n="77">77. And it stood in the promise of the covenant at the end, in the root of David, in the virgin Mary, who was in the inward Kingdome of the hidden humanity, (viz of the essentiality that disappeared, as to the Kingdome of God) the daughter of Gods covenant, but in the outward, according to the naturall humanity, she was begotten by her true bodily father Joachim, and her true mother Anna, out of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences and substance of their soules and bodies, like all other children of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, a true daughter of Eve.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57657:80"/>
substantiality into the humanity of the heavenly part, (which was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared in Adam, from which he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Paradise) into the seed of Mary, viz. into the Tincture of love, viz. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that property wherin Adam should have propagated himselfe in a Magical and heavenly manner, viz. into the true seed of the woman, of heavenly substantiality, which disappeared in Paradise.</p>
                  <p n="79">79. And when the Divine Light in the heavenly Essence was extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Word of God, viz. the divine power of the divine understanding, did bring in heavenly and living Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality, and awakened the disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared Substantiality in the seed of Mary, and brought it to life.</p>
                  <p n="80">80. And so now Gods Substance, wherein God dwelleth and worketh, and the disappeared Substance of man, are become one person: For the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Divine Substantiality, did anoynt the disappeared, therefore that person is called CHRISTUS, the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God.</p>
                  <p n="81">81. And this is the dry Rod of Aaron, that blossomed and bare Almonds, and the true high Priest; and it is that humanity of which Christ spake,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57657:81"/>
saying, that he was come from heaven and was in heaven; and that no man could ascend into heaven but the Son of man which is come from heaven, and is in heaven, John 3. 13.</p>
                  <p n="82">82. Now, when he saith, He is come from heaven, it is meant of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Substance, the heavenly Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: for the power and vertue of God needeth no comming [any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther] for it is every where altogether unmeasurable and undivided: But Substance needeth comming; the power or vertue needeth to move it selfe, and manifest it selfe in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                  <p n="83">83. And that substance entred into the Humane substance, and received it; and not that part onely of hevena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly substantiality, which disappeared in Adam, but the whole humane Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in soule and flesh, according to all the three Worlds.</p>
                  <p n="84">84. But the awakened and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vanity, which the Devill by his imagination brought into the flesh, by which the flesh did commit sinne: he hath not received that, nor taken that upon him; he hath indeed received the awakened formes of life, as they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were gone forth from their equall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement

each of them into their own desire.</p>
                  <p n="85">85. For herein lay our infirmity, and the death which he was to drown with his heavenly holy blood: Herein he took upon himselfe all our sins and infirmities, also Death and Hell, in the wrath of God, and destroyed the Devill in the humane properties.</p>
                  <p n="86">86. The wrath of God was the Hell into which the Spirit of Christ went, when he had shed that heavenly bloud into our outward humane bloud, and tinctured it with the love, and changed that hell of the humane property into heaven, and reduced the humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties into equall agreement, into the heavenly Harmony.</p>

                  <p n="88">88.

                  <p n="89">89: Great and strong earnestnesse is required here, and not onely a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowing, but a hunger and great thirst after the Spirit of Christ: For to know onely, is no <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>beliefe.</hi>

                  <p n="90">90.

                  <p n="91">91. In such a hunger, and desire, the will impresseth into it self, the Spirit of Christ, with his heavenly corporali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that is, its great hunger and desire taketh hold of, and receiveth the body of Christ, viz. the heavenly substantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, into its disappeared Image, within which the word of the power of God is the working.</p>
                  <p n="92">92. The hunger of the soule bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its desire quite through the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed property of its humanity in the heavenly part; which disappeared in Adam: which humanity, the sweet fire of love in the death of Christ, did bruise, when the death of that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humanity was destroyed.</p>

                  <p n="95">95. That essence of that life eateth the flesh of Christ, and drinketh his bloud: For, the Spirit of Christ, viz. the Word (which made it selfe visible with the humanity of Christ, out of, and in our disappeared humanity, through the outward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this world:) swalloweth its holy substance, into its fiery; every spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit eateth of its own body.</p>

Now if the soule eat of this sweet, holy, and heavenly food, then it kindleth it selfe with the great love in the Name JESUS; whence its fire of anguish becommeth a great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph [and glory] and the true Sunne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ariseth to it, wherin it is born to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will.</p>

                  <p n="102">102. The outward man in soule &amp; flesh, (we mean the outward part of the soule) hath no Divine will, neither doth he understand any thing of God, as the Scripture saith, The naturall man perceiveth nothing of the Spirit of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="103">103. But the Fire-breath of the inward world, if it be enlightned once, understandeth it; It hath a great long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sighing, hunger and thirst after the sweet fountain of Christ: it refresheth it selfe, by hungring and desiring, (which is the true faith) in the sweet Fountain of Christ from his new body, from the heavenly substantiality, as a hungry Branch in the Vine Christ.</p>
                  <p n="104">104. And the cause why the fiery soule cannot attain to perfection du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this [lifes] time, is because it is fast bound with the outward bond of vanity, through which the Devill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually casteth his venemous Rayes [of influence] upon it, and so fifteth it, that it often biteth at his bait, and poysoneth it selfe: from whence mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and anguish ariseth, so that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57657:84"/>
Noble <hi>Sophia</hi> hideth her selfe in the Fountain of Christ, in the heavenly humanity; for she cannot draw neere to vanity.</p>
                  <p n="105">105. For she knew how it went with her in Adam, when she lost her Pearle, which is of grace freely bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again upon the inward humanity: therefore she is called <hi>Sophia,</hi> viz. the Bride of Christ.<note place="margin">See the 3 prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, cap. 16. from verse 47. to verse 51.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="106">106. Here she faithfully calleth to the fiery soule, viz. to her Bridegroom, and exhorteth him to repentance, and to the unburthening of himselfe, or going from the abomination of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="107">107. Here warre assaulteth the whole man, wherein the outward flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man lusteth against the inward spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall man, and the Spirituall against the fleshly: and so man is in continuall warfare and strife, full of trouble, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery anguish and care.</p>
                  <p n="108">108. The inward saith to the fiery soule: O my soule: O my love! turne I beseech thee, and goe forth from vanity; or else thou losest my love, and the noble Pearle.</p>
                  <p n="109">109. Then saith the outward Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, viz. the bestiall soule; Thou art foolish, wilt thou be a foole, and the

Thou needest the outward world to maintain this life: beauty, power and glory is thy chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Treasure, wherein onely thou canst rejoyce and take delights.

                  <p n="110">110<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With such filth the true man is often defiled; viz. the outward man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth himselfe, as a Sow in the mire, and obscureth his Noble Pearle: For the more vain the outward man grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the more dark the inward man cometh to be, till at length it disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth together.</p>
                  <p n="111">111. And then the faire Paradificall Tree is gone, and it will be very hard to recover it again: for when the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light, viz. the outward soule is once enlightned, so that the outward light of Reason is kindled by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light; then the outward soule commonly useth to turn hypocrite, and esteem it selfe divine, and though the Pearle be gone, which sticks hard to many a man.</p>
                  <p n="112">112. And so the tree of Pearle in the Garden of Christ, is often spoyled; concerning which the Scripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

a hard knot, [or conclusion] viz. That these who have once tasted the sweetuesse of the world to come, if they fall away again, they shall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see the kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p n="113">113. And though it cannot he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that the gates of grace do yet stand open; yet the seeming light of the outward Reason of the soule, so keepeth them back, that they suppose they have the Pearle, and yet live to the vanity of this world, and dance with the Devill after his pipe.</p>

                  <p n="114">114. HEre a Christian should consider wherefore he calleth himselfe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and ponder well whether he be one or no: For surely my learning to know and understand that I am a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that Christ hath killed my sins on the Crosse, and shed his bloud for me, doth not make me a Christian.</p>
                  <p n="115">
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:57657:86"/>115. The inheritance belongeth onely to the children: A maid-servant in a house knoweth well enough what the Mistresse would have to be done, and yet that maketh her not an heire of her Mistresses goods: The very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils know that there is a God, yet that doth not change them into Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But if the Maid-servant in the house shall be married to the Sonne of her Mistresse, then she may come to inherit her Mistresses goods. And so it is to be understood also in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
                  <p n="116">116. The children of the History are not the heires of the goods of Christ, but the legitimate children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated of the Spirit of Christ: For God sayd to Abraham, Cast out the son of the Bond woman, he shall not inherit with [the son of] the Free: For he was a scorner, and but a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall sonne of the faith and spirit of Abraham: and so long as he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such a one, he was not a true inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritor of the faith of Abraham, and therefore God commanded he should be cast out from inheriting his goods, which was a type of the Christendome which was to come.</p>
                  <p n="117">117. For the promise of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57657:86"/>
was made to Abraham; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the type was then also represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by two brethren, viz. Isaac and Ishmael, [shewing] how Christendome would behave it selfe, and that two sorts of men would be in it, viz. true Christians and lip Christians, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of Christianity would be but mockers, as Ishmael and Esau was, who also was a type of the outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, as Jacob was a type of Christ, and his true Christendome.</p>
                  <p n="118">118. Thus every one that will call himselfe a Christian must cast away, and out, from himselfe the sonne of the Bond-woman, that is, the earthly will, and be evermore killing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of it, and not settle it in the inheritance.</p>

                  <p n="120">120. This Mocker and Titular-Christian is the sonne of a whore, he must be cast out: for he must not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the inheritance of Christ in the Kingdome of God: he is not fit, he is but Babel, a confusion of that one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage into many languages: he is but a talker, and a wrangler about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, he meanes to get it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by talking and wrangling, by the hypocrisie of his lips, and seeming ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and yet he is but a blood-thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty murtherer of his brother Abel, who is a true heire.</p>
                  <p n="121">121. Therefore we say what we know, that he that will call himselfe a true Christian, must try himselfe, and [find] what kind of properties dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57657:87"/>122. Now if he find that he hath such a hunger after such a vertue, then he may surely think that he is drawne. And then he must put it in practice, and not have a will onely without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The drawing of the Father, to Christ, consisteth in the will, but the true life consisteth in the doing: for the right Spirit doth that which is right.</p>
                  <p n="123">123. But if there be the will to do, and yet the doing followeth not, then the true man is [shut up] in vain lust, which keepeth the doing captive, and he is but an hypocrite and an Ishmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, he speaketh one thing and doth another, and witnesseth that his mouth is a lyer; for he himselfe doth not that which he teacheth, and so he onely serveth the Bestiall man in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="124">124. For he that will say, I have a will, and would willingly doe good, but for the earthly flesh which I have, which keepeth me back that I cannot; yet I shall be saved by grace, for the merits of Christ: I comfort my selfe with his merit and sufferings, he will receive me of meere grace, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merits of my owne, and forgive me my sinnes; such a one I say, is like

him that knew what food was good for his health, yet did not eat of it, but eat poyson in stead thereof, from whence sicknesse and death would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p n="125">125. What good doth it the soule to know the way to good; if it will not walk therein, but go a wrong way that leadeth not to God? What good will it doe the soule to comfort it self with the filiation of Christ, with his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and death, and so flatter it selfe, if it will not enter into the filiall birth, that it may be a true child, born out of the Spirit of Christ, &amp;c. out of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, death and resurrection? Surely, the tickling and flattering of it selfe with Christs mirits, without the true innate childship, is falshood and a lye, whosoever he be that teacheth it.</p>
                  <p n="126">126. This comfort belongeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the penitent sinner, who stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth against sinne, and the anger of God. When temptations come, and the Devill assaulteth the soule; then the soule must wholly wrap it selfe up in the passion and death of Christ, and in his Merits.</p>
                  <p n="127">127. Christ indeed hath merited [redemption for us] alone, but he hath not merited it as such a merit
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57657:88"/>
(for upon a Merit a Reward is given) that for his own proper merits sake he would outwardly freely grant us his childshîp, and so receive us for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren [when we are none.] No, hee <note n="*" place="margin">Note Christ is the merit.</note> himselfe is the merit, he is the open gate [that leadeth] through death, through that gate we must enter: But he receiveth no beast into his merit, but those onely that turn and become as children: those children that come to him, are his reward, which he hath merited and deserved.</p>
                  <p n="128">128. For thus he sayd, Father the men were thine, and thou hast given them to me, [as my reward] and I will give them eternall life. But the life of Christ will be given to none, unlesse they come to him in his Spirit, into his humanity, suffering, and merit, and in his merit be born a true child of the merit.</p>
                  <p n="129">129, We must be born of his Merit, &amp; put on the merit of Christ in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and death: not <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra.</hi>

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57657:89"/>130. This innate essence is not of this world, but in heaven, of which St. Paul speaketh, saying, Our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in heaven; the filiall essence wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in Heaven, and Heaven is in man.</p>
                  <p n="131">131. But if heaven in man be not open, and a man stand without heaven flattering himselfe, and say, I am still without, but Christ will receive me in by his grace, is not his merit mine? Such a one is in vanity and sinne with the outward man, and with the soule in Hell, viz. in the anger of God.</p>
                  <p n="132">132. Therefore learn to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand rightly what Christ hath taught us, and done [for us:] he is our heaven, he must get a forme in us, or else we shall not be in heaven. Thus then, the soules inward man, with the holy body of Christ, viz. in the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, is in heaven; and the outward mortall man is in the world, of which Christ spake, saying, My sheep are in my hand, and none shall plucke them away, the Father, which gave them to me, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then all.</p>

                  <p n="134">134. Men tye us now-a-dayes to the History, to the Materiall Churches of stone, which were indeed good in their kind, if men did also bring the Temple of Christ into them. And men teach, that their absolution is a forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of sinnes, &amp;c. That the Supper of the Lord taketh away sinne: Also, that the Spirit of God is infused into men by the Ministery. All this hath a proper meaning, if it were truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and if men did not cleave
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57657:90"/>
meerly to the Husk.</p>
                  <p n="135">135. Many a man goeth to Church twenty of thirty yeares, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Sermons, receiveth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and some heare Absolution read, or declared; and yet is as much a Beast of the Devill and vanity, at the last, as at the first. A Beast goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and to the Supper, and a Beast commeth out from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p n="136">136. How will he eat that hath no mouth? How will he heare that hath no hearing? Can any man eat that Food which is so shut up that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get it? How will he drink that can come by no water?</p>
                  <p n="137">137. What good doth it to me to goe to the material Churches of stone, and there fill my eares with empty breath? Or to goe to the Supper, and feed nothing but the earthly mouth, which is mortall and corruptible? can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I feed and satisfie it with a peece of bread at home? What good doth it to the soule, which is an immortall life, to have the beastiall man, observe the form of Christs Institution, if it cannot obtain the Jewell of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? For St. Paul saith of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, You receive it to judgement,

because yee discerne not the Lords body.</p>
                  <p n="138">138. The covenant stands firm, and is stirred in the use of the Institution: Christ proffereth his Spirit to us in his Word, (viz. in his preached Word) and his Body and Bloud in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and his absolution in a brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciliation [one to another.]</p>
                  <p n="139">139. But what good doth it to a Beast, to stand and listen, and yet hath no hearing to [receive] the inward living Word, nor any <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>ground</hi>

                  <p n="140">140. And thus it is with Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what good doth it me for one to say, I pronounce [or declare] to thee, the absolution of thy sinnes, when the soule is wholly shut up in sinne? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever saith thus to a sinner so shut up, erreth; and he that receiveth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the voyce of God within himselfe, deceiveth himselfe. None can forgive sins but God onely.</p>
                  <p n="141">141. The mouth of the Preacher
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57657:91"/>
hath not forgivenesse of sinnes in his own power; but it is the Spirit of Christ in the voice of the Priests mouth that hath the power, if he be also a Christian.</p>
                  <p n="142">142. What good did it do to those, that heard Christ himselfe teaching on earth, when he sayd, Come unto me all yee that are weary, and are heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, &amp; I will give you rest? What good did it to those that heard it, and yet laboured not, nor were heavy laden What became of the refreshment, or rest then? being they had dead eares, and heard onely the outward Christ, and not the word of the Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; surely they were not refreshed: and so much good the bestiall man hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of his absolution, and so much good also the Sacraments doe him.</p>
                  <p n="143">143. The covenant now is open in the Sacraments, and in the <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</hi>

                  <p n="144">144. That is, the outward Beast receiveth bread and wine, which it may have as well at home. And the fiery soule receiveth the Testament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its property, viz. in the

And after that manner the wicked shall behold Christ at the last judgement as a severe Judge; but the Saints shall behold him as a loving Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel.</p>
                  <p n="145">145. Gods anger standeth open in his Testaments towards the wicked, but towards the Saints, the heavenly loving kindnesse and in it the power of Christ in the holy name JESUS, standeth open. What good doth the holy thing doe to the wicked, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy it? And what then is it, that can take away his sinnes, when his sinne is but stirred and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by it?</p>
                  <p n="146">146. The Sacraments doe not take away sinne, neither are sinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thereby; but it is thus: When Christ ariseth, then Adam dyeth in the the essence of the Serpent: when the Sunne riseth, the night is swallowed up in the day, and the night is no more: so sins are forgiven.</p>

Or what doth it concern the Devils? Or the soul that is in the anger of God? these eat of the heavenly body, that is in the heaven they dwell in, which is the Abysse, or bottomlesse pit.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of unprofitable opinions, and strife about the Letter.</head>
                  <p n="158">158. A True Christian, who is born anew in the Spirit of Christ, is in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Christ, and hath no strife or contention with any man about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: he hath strife enough in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, with his own beastiall evill flesh and blood: he continually thinketh that he is a great sinner, he is afraid of God; but the love of Christ pierceth through and expelleth that feare, as the day swalloweth up the night.</p>
                  <p n="159">159. But the sinnes of the ungodly man rest in the sleep of death, and bud forth in the pit, and bring forth fruit in hell.</p>
                  <p n="160">160. The Christendome [that is] in Babel striveth about knowledge, how men ought to serve God, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him; also how to know God, and what he is in his essence and will; and they preach peremptorily, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not one and the same in every particular with them for knowledge
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57657:94"/>
and Opinions, is no Christian but a Heretick.</p>
                  <p n="161">161. Now I would faine see how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can bring all their Sects so to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, in that one which might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a true Christian Church, when all of them are scorners, every party of them reviling the other, and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it to be false.</p>
                  <p n="162">162. But a Christian is of no Sect, he can dwel in the midst of Sects, and also appeare in their services, and yet adhere and be addicted to no Sect: He hath but one knowledge only, that is Christ is him. He seeketh but one way which is the <hi>Desire,</hi> alwayes willingly to doe and teach, [that which is] right: and he putteth all his knowing and willing into the life of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="163">163. He sigheth and wisheth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, that the will of God might be done in him, and that his Kingdome might be manifested in him: He, daily and hourely killeth sinne in the flesh: For, the seede of the woman, <hi>viz.</hi> the inward man in Christ; continually breaketh the Head of the [Serpent, <hi>viz.</hi> of the] Devill, which is in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="164">164. His Faith is a Desire to God [and goodnesse] which he wrappeth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57657:95"/>
up into a sure hope, and therefore ventureth it upon the words of the promise; and liveth and dyeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: though, as to the true man, hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dyeth.</p>
                  <p n="165">165. For Christ telleth us, saying, whosoever believeth in me shall never dye, but hath pierced through from death to life; and Rivers of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall flow from him, <hi>viz.</hi> good Doctrine and works.</p>
                  <p n="166">166. Therefore I say, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever fighteth and contendeth about the Letter, is all Babell: The Letters [of the word proceed from, and] stand all in one Root, which is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: as the many flowers stand all in the earth, and grow by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: None of them fight with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about their colours, smell, and taste: they suffer the Earth, the Sun, the Raine, the Wind, the heate &amp; cold to doe with them as they please, and yet every one of them grow in their own Essence and property.</p>
                  <p n="167">167. And so it is with the children of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have various gifts and knowledge, yet all from one Spirit: They all rejoyce at the great wonders of God, and give thankes to the most High in his wisdome: why should they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57657:95"/>
long contend about him, in whom they live and have their being, and of whose substance they themselves are?</p>
                  <p n="168">168. It is the greatest folly [that is] in Babel, for people to strive about Religion, as the Devill hath made the World to doe; so that they contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Opinions of their owne forging, <hi>viz.</hi> about the Letter: though the Kingdome of God consisteth in no O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but in Power and Love.</p>
                  <p n="169">169. As Christ said to his Disciples, and left it to them at the last; saying, Love one another, as I have loved you; For thereby men shall know that you are my Disciples: If men would as fervently seeke after Love and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, as after Opinions, there would be no strife on Earth: and wee should live as children in our Father; and should need no Law or Ordinance.</p>
                  <p n="170">170. For God is not served by any Law, but only by Obedience. Lawes are for the wicked, which will not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Love and Righteousnesse, they are compelled and forced by Laws.</p>
                  <p n="171">171. We all have but one only <note n="*" place="margin">Law or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is, to stand stil to the Lord of all Beings, &amp; resign our wil up to him, and suffer his Spirit to play [what mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick he will] and work and make in us
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57657:96"/>
what he will; and wee give to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as his own fruits, that which he worketh and manifesteth in us.</p>
                  <p n="172">172. Now, if we did not contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the various fruits, gifts, and knowledge, but did acknowledg them in one another, like children of the Spirit of God, what could judge us? For, the Kingdome of God consisteth not in our knowing and supposing, but in power.</p>
                  <p n="173">173. If wee did not know halfe so much, and were more like children, and had but a Brotherly [minde or good] will towards one another, and did live like children of one. [and the same] mother, and as branches of one tree, taking our sap all from one root, we should be far more holy, [then we are]</p>
                  <p n="174">174. Knowledge serves only to this end, to learne to know, (wee having lost the Divine power in <hi>Adam,</hi> and so now are inclined to evill) that wee have evill properties in us, and that doing of evill pleaseth not God, so that with our knowledge wee might learne to do right: Now if we have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in us, and desire with all our powers to doe, and to live aright, then our knowledge is but our sport wherein we rejoyce.</p>
                  <p n="175">
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57657:96"/>175. For true knowledge is the Manifestation of the Spirit of God through the eternall wisedome: Hee knoweth what he will, in his children: He powreth forth his wisedome and wonders by his children, as the Earth [produceth] its various flowers.</p>
                  <p n="176">176. Now if we dwell one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, like humble children in the spirit of Christ, one rejoycing at the Gifts and knowledge of another, who would judge [or condemne] us? who judgeth [or condemneth] the birds in the woods, that praise the Lord of all Beings, with various voyces, every one in its owne Essence? Doth the Spirit of God reprove them, for not bringing their voyces into one harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie? doth not the sound of them all proceed from his power, and they sport before him.</p>
                  <p n="177">177. Those men therefore that strive and wrangle about knowledge and the will of God, and despise one another, for that, are more foolish, then the birds in the woods, and the wild beasts that have no true understanding: they are more unprofitable in the sight of the Holy God, then the flowers of the field, which stand still quietly [submitting] to the Spirit of God,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57657:97"/>
and suffering him to manifest the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisedome and power through them: yes those men are worse then Thistles and Thornes [that grow] a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong faire flowers, for they stand still: indeed those men are like the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Beasts, and Birds of prey, which fright the other birds from singing and praising God.</p>
                  <p n="178">178. In summe; they are <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>branch bud or sprout.</hi>
                     </note> the growth of the Devill in the anger of God; which must by their paine yet serve the Lord: for by their plaguing and persecuting, they presse out the sappe through the Essence of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God so, that they move and stir themselves in the Spirit of God, with praying and continuall sighing: in which the Spirit of God moveth himselfe in them.</p>
                  <p n="179">179. For thereby the Desire is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, and so the Children of God grow greene, flourish and bring forth fruit: for the children of God are manifested in Tribulation, as the Scripture saith: when thou chasti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="180">180. ALL Christian Religion wholly consisteth in this, To learn to know our selves; First, what we are, and whence we are come, how we are gone forth from the Unity into dissention, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, and unrighteousnesse, how we have awakened and stirred up these things in us.</p>
                  <p n="181">181. Secondly, how we were in the Unity when we were the children of God in Adam before he fell. Thirdly, how we are now in dissention and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, in strife &amp; contrariety. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whither we goe when we passe out of this corruptible Being; whither we goe with the immortall, and whither with the mortall part.</p>
                  <p n="182">182. In these foure poynts our whole Religion consisteth, viz. to learn to come forth from disunion &amp; vanity, and to enter again into that one Tree, Christ in us, out of which we are all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57657:98"/>
sprung in Adam.</p>
                  <p n="183">183. We need not strive about any thing, we have no contention: Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one exercise himselfe, in learning how he may enter again into the love of God and his Brother.</p>
                  <p n="184">184. The Testaments of Christ are nothing else but a loving Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> brotherly covenant, wherewith God in Christ bindeth himselfe to us, and * us to him: All teaching, willing, living, and doing, must aim at that. All tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and doing otherwise whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is Babel, and a fiction, also a meer graven Image of pride in unprofitable judgings, a disturbing of the world, and an hypocrifie of the Devil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he blindeth simplicity.</p>
                  <p n="185">185. Every one whatsoever, that teacheth without the Spirit of God, and hath no divine knowledge, and yet setteth himselfe up for a Teacher in the Kingdome of God, and will serve God with teaching, [that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] is false, and doth but serve the belly, his Idoll, and his own proud and insolent mind, in desiring to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and accounted <note n="*" place="margin">a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in holy orders.</note> holy: he beareth an office to which he is set apart and chosen by the children of men, who doe but flatter him, and for favour
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57657:98"/>
have ordained him thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="186">186. Christ sayd; Whosoever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth not by the doore into the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, that is, through MEE, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thiefe and a murtherer, and the sheep follow him not.</p>
                  <p n="187">187. For they know not his voyce; he hath not the voyce of the Spirit of God, but the voyce of his own Art and learning onely; himselfe teacheth, and not the Spirit of God: But Christ sayth, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shal be plucked up by the roots.</p>
                  <p n="188">188. How then will he that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly plant heavenly plants, that hath no seed [alive] in its power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? Christ saith expresly, the sheep heare not his voyce, they follow him not.</p>
                  <p n="189">189. The written Word is but an Instrument whereby the Spirit leadeth [us to it selfe within us.] That Word which will teach, must be living in the literall Word: The Spirit of God must be in the literall sound, or else none is a Teacher of God, but a meere Teacher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Letter, a knower of the History, and not of the Spirit of God in Christ.</p>

                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:57657:99"/>190. All that men will serve God with, must be done in faith, viz. in the Spirit: the Spirit maketh the worke perfect and acceptable in the sight of God. All that a man beginneth and doth in faith, he doth that in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which Spirit of God doth co-operate in the work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, for he hath done it himself, and his power and vertue is in it, it is holy.</p>
                  <p n="191">191. But whatsoever is done in Selfe, without faith, is but a figure and <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>Husk.</hi>
                     </note> shell of a true Christian work.</p>
                  <p n="192">192. If thou servest thy brother, and dost it but in hypocrisie, and givest him unwillingly, then thou servest not God; for thy faith proceedeth not from love, nor entreth into hope, into thy gift. Indeed thou servest thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hee for his part thanketh God, and he for his part also blesseth thee; but thou blessest not him: for thou givest him a <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
                     </note> grudging spirit in thy gift, which entreth not into the Spirit of God, into the hope of faith; therefore thy gift is but halfe given, and thou hast but halfe thy reward for it.</p>
                  <p n="193">193. The same is to be understood of receiving a gift: if any giveth in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57657:99"/>
faith, in Divine hope, he blesseth his gift in his faith; but he that receiveth it unthankfully, and murmureth in his Spirit, he curseth it in the use or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it. Thus every one shall have his own, whatsoever he soweth, that he shall also reap.</p>
                  <p n="194">194. And so it is in the Office of teaching: what ever a man soweth, that also hee reapeth: For if any man sow good seed from the Spirit of Christ, it sticketh in the good heart, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good fruit; but in the wicked that are not capable of it, the anger of God is stirred.</p>
                  <p n="195">195. If any sow contentions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, misconstructions, all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people receive it into them, it sticketh in them also, and bringeth forth fruit accordingly, so that men despise, revile, slander, and miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue one another, out of which [Root] the great Babel is sprung and grown; where men, out of meere pride and strife, contend about the History, and the justification of a poore sinner in the sight of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make the simple erre and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, insomuch that one brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth and curseth the other, [and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicateth] or casteth him to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57657:100"/>
Devill, for the History and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters sake.</p>
                  <p n="196">196. Such Railers and Revilers fear not God, but to raise the great buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of dissention; and seeing corrupt lust lyeth in all men in the earthly flesh still: therefore they raise and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken abominations even in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple children of God, and make the people of God, as well as the children of Iniquity to blaspheme: and so are master-builders of the great Babel of the world, and are as usefull as a fift wheele in a Wagon: and beside that, they erect the hellish building.</p>
                  <p n="197">197. Therefore it is highly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the children of God, to pray earnestly, that they may learn to know this false building, and goe forth from it with their minds, and not help to build it up, and so themselves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute their fellow-children of God; whereby they keep themselves back from the kingdome of God, and are seduced.</p>
                  <p n="198">198. According to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saying of Christ to the Pharisees, Woe unto you Pharisees: For you compasse Sea and Land to make one Proselite; and when he is one, you make him two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold more the child of Hell then your
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57657:100"/>
selves: which truly commeth to passe after the same manner, in these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Factions and Sects among these Cryers and Teachers of strife.</p>
                  <p n="199">199. I desire therefore, out of my gifts which are revealed to me from God, that all the children of God that intend to be the members of Christ, faithfully be warned to depart from such abominable contentions, and bloudy fire-brands, and to goe forth from all strife with their Brethren, and to strive onely after love and righteousnesse towards all men.</p>
                  <p n="200">200. For he that is a good Tree, must bring forth good fruits, and must sometimes suffer Swine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his fruits, and yet must continue a good tree still, and be alwayes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to work with God, and not suffer any evill to master him: And then he standeth and groweth in the Field of God, and bringeth forth fruit [to be set upon Gods Table; which he shall enjoy for ever. Amen.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. MY writing to you, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, from a deep Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian consideration and good will, not to commit my writings into the hands of every one, for they belong not to every one.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Also none should cast the Pearle into the way, to bee troden under
<pb facs="tcp:57657:102"/>
foot; whereby the highly pretious Name of God might be blasphemed: For I know very well what Satan intendeth to doe; but it is signified to me, that his purpose shall bee brought to nought.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet there is a thicke dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be feared: in the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the light shall first spring up in the hearts of men, when they shall be in great distresse and want, and quite forsaken: And then they shall seeke the Lord, and hee will bee found.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. My Writings are not for those whose bellies be full, but for the hungry stomach: they belong to the Children of the hidden Mystery, because in them many pretious Pearles lye lockt up, and some are manifest.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I have made my Writings neither for the simple nor the wise; but for my selfe, and for those to whom God shall give the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb facs="tcp:57657:102"/>
of them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That Bud, or Branch, is in Gods power, or hand: therefore I my selfe acknowledge it, not to be a worke of my Reason, but to be the revelation of God: and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to be ascribed to me at all in it; neither ought any to regard my Person, as if it were some won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous thing; for he shall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a very mean simple man: for my knowledge is hidden in God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And though I know much, and that a great manifestation is given me, yet I know also well, that I shall be as one that is dumb, to all those that are not born of God: and therefore I intreat you to manage my writings wisely.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Also to conceale my name, till at length the darke night shall come, as is signified to mee, and then the Pearle shall bee found: For so long as my beloved is full,
<pb facs="tcp:57657:103"/>
and satisfied, she slumbreth, and lyeth in the sleep of this world.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But when the <hi>LORD</hi> shall awaken her with his storme, and that shee shall bee in anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, shee will then, in her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cry to the <hi>LORD,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake from sleep, then shall my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting stand forth, and the Pearle will be sought in them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I desire, and also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that none goe about to have them printed without my consent; for that shall first be after the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But let them bee made knowne to the hearts of the wise onely, whom thou knowest that they love <hi>GOD:</hi> To others it will not hee profitable at present: For many seeke after them for nothing but evill will, and pride, and out of false wisdome, or subtile cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. that they may appeare to be some body: therefore I intreat you to
<pb facs="tcp:57657:103"/>
mannage them wisely.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Many will receive them with joy, but having an evill Root, yet thinke to bee honest, and to amend their lives, but suffer the Devill to deceive them still: and then afterwards come to be despisers and scorners of these manifestations. This I tell you for good will; not from a conceit, opinion, or supposition, but even from my present and certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. There is somewhat very high and deep, begun in a new Booke; but there is strong oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition made against mee by the Prince of wrath; which hath so hindered mee till now, (but I hope it will be written shortly) for it is an hearb which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill will not relish: yet the will of God must stand.</p>

                     <p>That I said, its vertue is that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, thou mayst understand thus: when thou art gone forth wholly from the creature, and art become No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to all that is Nature and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then thou art in that eternall One, which is God himselfe, and then thou shalt perceive and feele the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est vertue of Love.</p>
                     <p>But that I said, its power is [in and] through all things, thou perceivest and findest, that in thy own Soul &amp; Body, when this great love is kindled in thee, it will burn more then any fire can doe: Thou seest also in all the works of God, that love hath powred forth it selfe into all things, and is the most inward and most outward ground in all things: Inwardly, in the [vertue and] power, and outwardly in the [fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, forme or] shape [of every thing.]</p>
                     <p>And that I said, Its height is as high as God, thou mayest understand this in thy selfe, in that it bringeth thee to be as high as God himselfe is: as may be seen by our beloved Lord Christ in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57657:114"/>
our humanity; which humanity love hath brought into the highest throne, into the power of the Deity.</p>
                     <p>But that I also said, Its Greatnesse is greater then GOD; that is also true: for love entreth into that where God dwelleth not: as when our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Lord Christ was in hell, hell was not God, but love was there, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed death. Also, when thou art in anguish or trouble, God is not the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish or trouble, but his love is there, and bringeth thee out of anguish into God: when God hideth himselfe in thee, love is there, and maketh him manifest in thee</p>
                     <p>Also, that I sayd, whosoever findeth it, findeth nothing and all things; that is also true: for he findeth a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, super-sensuall abysse, having no ground, where there is no place to dwel in; &amp; he findeth also nothing that is like it, and therefore it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to nothing; for it is deeper then any thing, and is a as nothing to all things; for it is not comprehensible: and because it is nothing, it is free from all things, and it is that onely Good, which a man cannot expresse, or utter what it is.</p>
                     <p>But that I lastly sayd; He that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Loving Master, pray tell me why Christ saith, What have you done to the least of these, you have done it to me: and what you bave not done to them, neither have you done it to me?

                     <p>Christ dwelleth really and essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the faith of those that wholly yeeld up themselves to him, and he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them his flesh for food. and his bloud for drink; and so possesseth the ground of their faith, according to the <note n="*" place="margin">or the inward man.</note> inwardnesse of Man; and therefore a Christian is called a branch of the vine Christ, and a Christian, because Christ dwelleth spiritually in him, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever any shall doe to such a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in his bodily necessities, that is done to Christ himselfe who dwelleth in him: for such a Christian is not his

own, but is wholly resigned to Christ, and is his peculiar possession, and therefore it is done to Christ himselfe. Therefore also whosoever shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their hand from such a needy Christian, and will not serve him in his necessity, they thrust Christ away from themselves, and despise him in his members. When a poore person that belongeth to Christ, asketh [any thing] of thee, and thou deniest it him in his necessity, then thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it to Christ himselfe. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hurt any shall doe to such a Christian, they doe it to Christ himself. When any mock, reproach, revile, or reject, or thrust away such a one, they doe all that to Christ himselfe: but he that receiveth him, giveth him meat and drinke, cloatheth him, and assisteth him in his necessities, he doth it to Christ himselfe, and to the [fellow] members of his own Body; nay thus, he doth it to himse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The life [it selfe] standeth in strife, that it may be made manifest, sensible, and palpable, and that the wisdome may be made separable and known; and it maketh the eternall joy of the victory [to be:] For there will arise great praise in the Saints from hence, that Christ in them hath overcome Darknesse, and all selfe of Nature, and that they are delivered from the strife; at which they shall rejoyce eternally, when they shall know how the wicked are recompenced. And therefore God suffereth all things to stand in a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57657:128"/>
that the eternall Dominion both of Love and Anger, of Light and of Darknesse, may be made manifest and known, and that every life might cause and raise its own sentence in it selfe. For that which is now a strife and pain to the Saints in their misery, shall be turned into great joy to them; and that which hath been a joy and pleasure to ungodly persons in this world, shall be turned into eternall pain and shame to them. Therefore the joy of the Saints must arise to them out of Death, (as the light ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of a Candle by the dying and consuming of it in its fire;) that so the life may be freed from the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse of Nature, and possesse ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57657:133"/>
First then, there arose the lust of pride, to be great, mighty, and powerfull, to bring all things under subjection at command, and so be its own Lord without controule, to despise humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and equality, to esteeme it self one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prudent, witty, and cunning, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all folly that is not according to its way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly arose the lust of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, a desire of getting, which would draw all things to it selfe, into its pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session: for when the lust of pride had turned away its will from God, then the life [of the soule] would not trust God any further, but would take care for its selfe, and therefore brought its desire into the creatures, viz. into the earth, metals, trees, [and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,] and so the kindled fiery life became hungry and covetous, when it had broken it self off from the unity, love, and meeknesse of God, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to it selfe the foure Elements and their essence, and brought it selfe into beastiality, and so the life became obscure, dark, void and wrathfull, and the heavenly vertues and colours <note n="*" place="margin">like a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> went out.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there awaked a stinging thorny lust in the fiery life, viz. envie,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57657:134"/>
a hellish poyson, and a property which all Devils have, and a torment which makes the life an enemy to God, and to all creatures: Which envie did rage furiously in the desire of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, as a sting of poyson in the body: Envie cannot endure, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and mischieveth that which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse could not draw to it selfe, by which the noble love of the soule was smothered.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, there awaked in this fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life a torment, like fire, viz. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which would murther and destroy all that which would not be subject to this pride. Thus the ground and foundation of hell, which is called the anger of God, was wholly manifested in this soule, and thereby it lost the Paradise of God, and the Kingdome of heauen, and became such a worme as the fiery Serpent was, which the Devil presented to the soule in his owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and likenesse. And so the soule began to rule on earth in a beastiall manner, and did all things according to the will of the Devill, living in meere pride, covetousnesse, envy and anger; and having no true love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God any more; but there did arise in the stead thereof an evill bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57657:134"/>
love of filthy Lechery, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vanity, and there was no purenesse more in the heart: for the soule had left Paradise, and taken the Earth into its possession, the Minde thereof was onely bent upon cunning knowledge, subtilty, and getting a multitude of naturall things: no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse nor vertue remained in it at all: but whatsoever evill and wrong it committed, the soule covered it cunningly and subtilly under the cloak of its power and authority [Law] and called it by the name of Right and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and accounted it good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Devil came to the soule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this the Devill drew neere to the soule, and brought it on from one vice to another; for hee had taken it captive in his Essence, and did set joy and pleasure before it therein, and said to the soule: Behold now thou art powerfull, mighty and noble: endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be greater, richer, and more powerfull still: use thy knowledg, wit, and subtilty, that every one may feare thee [and stand in awe of thee] and that thou maist be respected, and get a great name in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The soule did so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The soule did as the Devill counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57657:135"/>
it, and yet knew not that it was the Devill, but thought it was its owne knowledge, wit, and understanding, and that it selfe did very well &amp; right [all this while.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jesus Christ met with the soule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The soule going on in this course of life, our deare and loving Lord Jesus Christ (with the love and wrath of God) who was come into this world to destroy the works of the Devill, and to execute Judgement upon all ungodly workes; at a Time hee met with the soule, and spake, by a strong power, viz. by his Passion and Death, into the soule, and destroyed the works of the Devill in it, and discovered the way to his Grace to the soule, and did shine upon it with his Mercy, calling it back to returne and repent, and then hee would deliver it from that monstrous deformed shape, vizard or Image which it had gotten, and bring it into Paradise againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How Christ wrought in the soule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when the sparke of the [love of God or the] Divine light was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the soule, it presently saw it selfe with its will and workes to bee in Hell, in the wrath of God, and found that it was a mishapen ugly Monster in

the presence of God, and the kingdom of Heaven; at which it was so affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the greatest anguish awaked in it, for the judgment of God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What Christ said.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this the Lord Christ spake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it with the voyce of his grace, and said, Repent and forsake vanity, and thou shalt attaine my grace.</p>

                  <p>But the poore soul turned its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57657:136"/>
to God, and desired grace from God, <hi>viz.</hi> that God would bestow his love upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Devill came to it again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the Devill saw that the soule thus prayed to God, and would enter into Repentance, he drew neere to the soule and thrust the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earthly properties into its prayers, and disturbed the good thoughts [and desires] which pressed forward towards God, and drew them back again to earthly things, that they might have no accesse to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The soule sighed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The will of the soule sighed after God, but the Thoughts arising in the Mind, that should penetrate into God were destroyed [scattered and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted] so that they could not reach the power of God; the poore soule was more affrighted at this, that it could not bring its desires into God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pray more earnestly: but the the Devill with his desire took hold of the Mercuriall-kindled-fiery wheele of life; and awakened the evill proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties so, that evill or false inclinations arose and went into that thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had taken pleasure and delight before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57657:136"/>The poor soule would very fain goe forward to God with its will, and therefore used all its endeavours: but all its thoughts fled away from God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to earthly things, and would not goe to God.</p>
                  <p>The soule sighed and bewailed it selfe to God, but it was as if it were quite &amp; clean forsaken, and cast out from the presence of God, it could not get so much as one looke of grace, but was in meer anguish, and also in great fear and terrour, and supposed every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the wrath and severe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God would be manifested in it, and that the Devill would take hold of it [and have it] and so fell into such great heavinesse and sorrow; that it became weary of all the joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it took in temporal things, though it were never so delighted with them before.</p>
                  <p>The Earthly naturall will desired those things still; but the soule would willingly leave them altogether, and desired to dye to all temporall Lust and Joy, and longed only after its first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country from whence it came ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, but it found it selfe to be farre from thence, also in great distresse and want, and knew not what to doe: yet

                  <p>The Devil awaked the earthly lusts in its heart, that the inclinations might stil keep their<note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>false na turall right.</hi>

                     <p>But since thou desirest I should tell thee, how to forsake thy own perverse creaturly will, that the creatures might die, and that yet thou mighst live with them in the world: I tell thee, that there is but one way to doe it, which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57657:143"/>
is narrow and strait, and it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry troublesome, and irkesome to thee at the first beginning, to walke in it, but afterwards thou wîlt walk in it cheerefully.</p>
                     <p>Thou must rightly consider, that in the course of this worldly life, thou walkest in the anger of God, and in the foundation of Hell, and that this is not thy true native Countrie: and that a Christian should, and must live in Christ, and in his walking truly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; and that hee cannot be a Christian, unlesse the Spirit and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Christ so live in him, that hee becometh wholly subject to it: now being the Kingdome of Christ is not of this world, but in Heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou must alwaies be in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ascension towards Heaven, if thou wilt follow Christ, though thy bodie must dwell among the creatures and use them.</p>
                     <p>The narrow way to this perpetuall ascension into Heaven, and the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christ, is this: thou must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of all thy owne power and strength (for in and by thy owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thou canst not reach the gates of God) and firmely purpose, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve wholly to give thy selfe up to the

mercie of God, and also resolve to sinke downe with thy whole mind and reason, into the Passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ, alwaies desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to persevere therein, and to die from all thy creatures therein: also thou must resolve to turne away thy mind, and lusts from all receiving of evill [into them] and not suffer thy selfe to be held fast by temporall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and <note n="*" place="margin">Or, <hi>goods.</hi>
                        </note> profit, and thou must resolve to put away from thee all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse, and whatsoever else may hinder thee; thy will must bee wholly pure, and thou must be in such a Resolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thou wilt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to thy evill creatures any more, but that thou wilt that very instant leave them, and separate thy mind from them, and that thou wilt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enter into the sincere way of Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and righteousnesse; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Doctrine of Christ: and as thou now doest purpose, to forsake the Enemies of thine owne nature, so thou must also forgive all thy outward enemies, &amp; resolve to meet them with thy love, that there may be no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all, that might be able to take hold of thy will, and stay thee, but that thy wil may be sincere &amp; purged from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57657:144"/>
all creatures: and also, that if it should be required, thou must be willing, and readie to forsake all temporall Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profit for Christs sake, and regard nothing that is earthly, to love it, but to esteeme thy selfe in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever state, degree, and condition thou art, for temporall honour, or Riches, and worldly goods, to be but a servant of God, and of thy fellow-Christians, as a Steward of God in thy office, [which he hath set thee in.] The lofty lookes, and selfe love, must be humbled, brought low, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, that no creature may stay in the mind, to bring the thoughts, or Imagination to be set upon them.</p>
                     <p>Also thou must firmely imprint in thy mind, that thou shalt partake of the promised Grace, in the merit of Jesus Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> of his out-flowing love [which is in thee] which will deliver thee from thy creatures, and enlighten thy will, and kindle it with the flame of love, whereby thou shalt have victorie over the Devill: not as if thou couldest will, or doe any thing, but enter into the suffring, and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jesus Christ, and take them to thy selfe, and with them assault, and breake in peeces the Kingdome
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57657:144"/>
of the Devill in thee, and mortifie thy creatures; and thou must resolve to enter into this way, this very houre, and never to depart from it, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to submit thy selfe to God, in all thy endeavours and doings, that hee may doe with thee what he pleaseth.</p>
                     <p>When thy will and purpose is thus prepared, it hath broken through its owne creatures, and is sincere in the presence of God, and cloathed with the merits of Jesus Christ, and then it may freely goe to the Father with the Prodigall Sonne, and fall downe in his presence, and poure forth its prayers, and put all its strength forth in this Divine worke, and confesse its sinnes and disobedience, and that it hath turned away from God: and that must bee done not with bare words, but with all its strength, which is but a strong purpose, and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to doe it; for the soule it selfe hath no strength, nor power to effect it.</p>
                     <p>And when thou art thus ready, and that thy eternall Father shall see thy comming and returning to him in such repentance and humility, then he will inwardly speak to thee, and say in thee, Behold, this is my son which I had lost, he was dead and is alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57657:145"/>
and he will come to meet thee in thy mind with the grace and love of Jesus Christ, and embrace thee with the beams of his love, and kisse thee with his Spirit and strength: And then thou shalt receive strength to powre out thy confession before him, and to pray powerfully. And this now is the right place where thou mayst wrastle, in the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and if thou standest resolutely here, and shrinkest not back, thou shalt see or feele great wonders: For thou shalt find Christ in thee assaulting hell, and crushing thy beasts in peeces, and that a great tumult and misery will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise in thee: also that thy secret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known sinnes will then first awake, and labour to separate thee from God, and to keep thee back; and thou shalt truly find and feele, how death and life fight against one another; thou shalt also find what heaven and hell is. At all which be not moved, but stand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, and shrink not; and then at length all thy evill creatures will grow faint. &amp; weak ready to dye: and then thy will shall wax stronger, and be able to subdue and keep down the evill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and so thy will and mind shall ascend into heaven every day,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57657:145"/>
and thy creatures dye daily, and thou wilt get a mind wholly new, and begin to be a new creature, and be changed into the Image of God again, and be rid of the beastiall monstrous Image, shape, or vizard. And thus thou shalt come to rest again, and be delivered from thy anguish.</p>

                  <p>When the poore soule began to practice this course with such earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, it conceived it should get the victory presently; but the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were shut against it in its own strength and power, and it was as it were, left and forsaken of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not so much as one beam, look, or glimpse of grace; and then it thought in it self [and said to it selfe] surely thou hast not sincerely submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thy selfe to God; desire nothing at all of God, but onely submit thy selfe to his judgement [sentence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation] that he may kill thy evill inclinations: sink down into him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of Nature and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and submit thy selfe to him, that he may doe with thee what he will; for thou art not worthy to speak to him. Upon this the soule took a resolution to sink down and to forsake

its own will: and when it had done so, there fell upon it the greatest repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>innes it had committed, and it bewailed bitterly its ugly shape, and was very sory that the evill Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures did dwell in it. And because of its sorrow it could not speak one word more in the presence of God, but in its repentance did consider the bitter pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and death of Jesus Christ, viz. what great anguish and torment he had suffered for its sake, that he might deliver it out of its anguish, &amp; change it into the Image of God; and in that consideration it wholy sunk down, and did nothing but complain of its igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and negligence, and that it had not been thankfull [to its Redeemer] nor had once considered so great love, but had so idlely spent its time, &amp; not regarded to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider how it might come to partake of that grace; but in the mean while had formed in it selfe the Images and figures of earthly things, with the vain lusts and pleasures of the world, from which it had gotten such beastiall inclinations, that now it must lye captive in great misery, and for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shame dareth not lift up its eyes to God, who hideth the power [or light] of his countenance from it, and will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57657:146"/>
not so much as look upon it. And as it was thus sighing and crying, it was drawn into the Abysse or pit of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and as it were at the gates of hell, and should there perish. Upon which the soule was, as it were, bereft of sense, and wholly forsaken, and thereby did forget all its doings, as if it would wholly yeeld it selfe to death, and cease to be a creature any more; and so did yeeld it selfe to death; and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing else, but to dye and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in the death of its Redeemer Jesus Christ, who had suffered such torments and death for its sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke: and in this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing it began to sigh and pray in it selfe very inwardly to the mercy of God, and to sink down into the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest mercy of God. Upon this there appeared unto it the amiable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the love of God, and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through it as a great light, by which it grew exceeding joyfull, and began to pray aright, and to thank the most high for this grace, and to rejoyce exceedingly, that it was delivered from the death and anguish of Hell; and there it tasted of the sweetnesse of God, and of his promised truth. And in that very instant, all evill spirits which had afflicted it before, and kept
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57657:147"/>
it back from the grace, [love and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward presence] of God, were forced to depart from it: and the wedding of the Lamb was kept and solemnized, with the espousing or contracting of the Noble <hi>Sophia</hi> with the Soule, and the Seal-ring of Christs victory was impressed [or printed, or set upon its substance or] into its essence; and it was received to be a child and heire of God again.</p>

                  <p n="9">9 Which Images he shall find to be, 1. Pride, in liking and loving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and desiring to be honored by all others also: an image inclining him to get power and dominion in his pride, that he might be honoured above all others. 2. An Image of a Swine, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, which would have all to it selfe onely, and if it had the whole world, and heaven too, yet it would have the dominion in hell also, desiring more then this temporall life hath need of; and hath no faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God in it, but is a defiled Swine, that desireth to swallow all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it selfe. 3. An Image of Envie, stinging the hearts of all others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying and grudging that any other should have more temporall goods
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57657:154"/>
and honour then it selfe hath. 4. An Image of anger, which when envy as a poyson dwelleth in it, will upon any very little or frivolous occasion, storm, fight, wrangle, and be furious, and will revenge it selfe. Also, there will be found a multitude, yea thousands of earthly beasts to be in him which he loveth [and fostereth.] sor he loveth every thing that is in the world, and hath set it in the stead of Christ, and honoureth it more then he doth God. Let him but observe the words of his mouth, and see how his lips slander, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid, and speak evill of others secrer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and setteth them forth in the worst sense, [and giving others the worst character] to their fellows, [associats, and familiar friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] and often back bite without any sure ground or cause, rejoycing at his neighbours mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, or the evill that commeth upon him, and wishing it to him. All which are the pawes and ginnes, slights or tricks of the Devill, and the Image of the Serpent, which man beareth in him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And let him compare all this with the word in the Law and in the Gospel: and he shall find that hee is more a beast and a Devill, then a man,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57657:155"/>
and shall clearly see how these here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, imprinted, [ingraved or graven] Images keep him back, and lead him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray from the Kingdome of God; so that many times when he would fain repent and turn to God, these pawes and Talons of the Devill keep him off, and keep him back, perswading the poore soule that this Monster is holy, and so the soule entreth again into the lusts thereof, and so sticketh fast in the anger of God, and at length goeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Abysse or bottom lesse pit, when the grace and drawing of the Father ceaseth.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. We tell this man our way that we have gone, and which we have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that as soon as he shall discover these beasts, he should that very houre and moment take a resolution, and bring himselfe into a will to depart from the bestiall will, and by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance turn to God [and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:] and being he cannot doe it by his own power, let him take the promise of Christ into him selfe, when he sayd, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you. No sonne asketh bread of his father, and he giveth him a stone, or an egge and he giveth him a Scorpion: And if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57657:155"/>
you that are evill can give good gifts to your children, how much more shall my heavenly Father give the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost to them that aske him for it.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Let him imprint this promise in his heart, (for it is poyson and death to the Devill, and all hereditary innate, and imprinted beasts) and let him immediatly that very hour come with these words of promise imprinted in his mind, and prayers, into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and let him first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider with himselfe, all these abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable beasts which are in himselfe, and let him think no otherwise of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but that he is that silthy keeper of swine. who hath spent all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers [portion] of goods [that he bestowed upon him] and his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right upon those Swine of the world, viz. those evill beasts in himselfe: and also that now he standeth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, as a miserable, naked, forlorne, ragged Keeper of Swine, that hath spent and cast away his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Inheritance in whoredome, with these worldly beasts [or graven] Images; and hath no more right to the grace of God, neither is in the least measure worthy of it, much lesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

be called a Christian, or the child of GOD. Let him also despaire of all the good workes that ever he did; for they proceeded but from an hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, seeming, or out-side holinesse, for which the Man [that is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly] a Devill, would be accounted an Angell; for without Faith it is impossible to please God, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 But let him not despaire of the Divine grace [that is in him] but of himselfe onely, and of his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and strength; and let him with all the power and strength he hath, bow down himselfe in his soule, in the presence of God. And though his own heart be utterly against it, and say to him, Doe it not, stay a while, it will not be convenient to day: Or, if it say, Thy sinnes are too too great, it cannot be that thou shouldest at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the grace of GOD; and so he commeth into such anguish. that hee cannot pray to God, and receiveth no comfort nor strength in his heart, but is as if his soule were quite blind, and dead to God, [and goodnesse,] yet he must be resolnte, considering the promise of GOD is a certain infallible truth; and with a submissive

heart sigh to the grace of God, and in his great unworthinesse wholly resign himselfe thereto.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 And though he doe esteem himselfe unworthy, as a stranger and alien to whom the inheritance of Christ doth not any more belong, hee having lost his right: yet he should stedfastly rest upon that which Christ sayd, [knowing, that what hee saith, is certainly true,] that hee came to seek and to save that which was lost, viz. the poore sinner that is blind and dead to GOD: He must firmly imprint this promise in himselfe, and take to himselfe such a strong purpose and resolution, that he will not goe forth from the promised grace of GOD in CHRIST, though Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soule should bee broken to peeces; and though hee should get no comfort in his heart all the dayes of his life, or the least assurance of the remission of his sinnes, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the promises of God are more s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="15">15. Also let him purpose to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and shut up his will so firmely in this Resolution, that he will no more enter into the former beastiall Images
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57657:157"/>
and vices againe, though all his swine and beasts [in him] should lament to the death the losse of their food, and pasture; and hee himselfe should be a foole in the account of all the world for so doing, yet hee would be constant in his purpose [in cleaving] to the promised Grace of God: and if he [must come to] bee a child of Death, he would desire to be so in the Death of Christ, to die and live to him at his pleasure: and let him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and direct his purpose in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally praying, and fighing to God, and commit all his endeavours and doings, in the workes of his hands, unto God, and cease from the Imagination, or thought of Pride, covetousnesse, or Envie; let him but deliver up these three Beasts, and the rest will soone become weake, faint, and readie to die: for Christ will soone get a forme, in the words of his Promise, which that man imprinteth in himselfe, and cloatheth himselfe withall, and so come to life, and begin to worke in him, whereby his Prayers will bee more powerfull, and he be more and more strengthned [and confirmed] in the Spirit of Grace.</p>
