            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>A True Blue Protestant will never stain</l>
               <l>His good profession, for the hopes of gain:</l>
               <l>Most Loyal thou dost call them, and sayst true,</l>
               <l>For they're no such dissembling Knaves as you.</l>
               <l>The Whigs from North to South, from West to East</l>
               <l>Did all contribute to a Loyal Feast,</l>
               <l>To shew their hatred to the Roman Beast.</l>
               <l>Eight Hundred Guineys were laid up in store,</l>
               <l>There would have been at least as many more,</l>
               <l>Such hatred we do bear the Roman Whore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Feast was thrown aside, and nought but reason:</l>
               <l>Some did surmise a new Gun-Powder Treason,</l>
               <l>That cou'd not be suppos'd, for our good King,</l>
               <l>Doth hide his Parliaments beneath his wing:</l>
               <l>He will not let them meet in any place,</l>
               <l>For fear of mischief from the Roman Race.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Let this be Sung to what tune <hi>Thomson</hi>
pleases, but let the rest be to his own Tune,
<hi>Sawny will ne're be my Love again.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>Tory is small and of no good race,</l>
               <l>And is belov'd by very few;</l>
               <l>He broaches his Shams in e'ry place,</l>
               <l>And that in time I hope he'l rue.</l>
               <l>He sends to Yeoman, Lord and Knight,</l>
               <l>His Roguish tricks to entertain:</l>
               <l>But Tory'l be hang'd, if he has but his right,</l>

                  <hi>Then Tory shall ne're be my Love again.</hi>

               <l>He sends to the Devil for Plots good store,</l>
               <l>And they too oft do come to Town:</l>
               <l>His Tap doth run for the Roman Whore;</l>
               <l>The True Blue Protestants to drown.</l>
               <l>He sends to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To all the Papists in the Land,</l>
               <l>That they may bring in Plots amain.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>At some great Houses in this Town,</l>
               <l>Tory did meet with a Jovial Crew,</l>
               <l>Of Traytrous Lords of high renown,</l>
               <l>Not one a Protestant True Blue.</l>
               <l>They threw in heeps of yellow boys,</l>

               <l>Old <hi>Rowly</hi> their Treason now destroys,</l>

               <l>And Loyal Subjects should have been:</l>
               <l>But their duty was all worn out long since,</l>
               <l>By their Plots we have too plainly seen.</l>
               <l>From Church to Chappel they did go,</l>
               <l>Their Popish guests to entertain,</l>
               <l>They sought to kill us at one blow,</l>

               <l>Can any tale or tydings bring,</l>
               <l>Why they should raise the D. so high?</l>
               <l>They'd Crown him if they might have leave,</l>
               <l>And our good King they would have slain:</l>
