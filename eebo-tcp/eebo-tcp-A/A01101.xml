            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of Artificers in the whol Cuntrie, conuened there, of all craftes for that seruice, and his Maiesties owne person daily ouerseer, with large and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall payment: but the chiefest cause, was the long absence of an Ambassadour from <hi>England,</hi> which his Maiestie greatly respected for many causes: And last of al, exspecting, that some Ambassadour should haue come from <hi>France,</hi> which fel not out as was looked for. But when the Ambassadour was come from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> foorthwith, his Maiestie dispatched one of the Gentlemen of his Nienes chalmer, to request him to repair towards <hi>Striuiling</hi> the next day with all possible diligence, (which was the 28. day of <hi>August</hi>) because he wold haue had the Baptisme administred the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. But neither were the Propynes sent by the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> neither her Ambassadours owne cariages as then come: Therfore the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme was delaied vntill the 30. day of <hi>August,</hi> as ye shall heare particularly hereafter.</p>
            <p>But in the meanetime, it is to be vnderstoode, that all these Noble Ambassadours before expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, were honourablie sustained vpon the Kings Maiesties owne proper costes, during the whole time of their residence in <hi>Scotland,</hi> saue onely the Ambassadour of <hi>England,</hi> whose whole expences, were defrayed by his Souerane the Queene of <hi>England.</hi> And because the rest of the Ambassadors were repaired to <hi>Striuiling</hi> by his Maiesties direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, long before the comming of the English Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador his Hienes bestowed the time with them in magnifique banketting, reuelling, &amp; daily hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with great honour.</p>

            <p>All the Ambassadours likewise were sent for, and conuoyed to the Princes Chalmer of presence where the Prince was lying on his bed of Estate, richly decored, and wrought with brodered work, containing the story of <hi>Hercules</hi> and his trauels.</p>

            <p>Then <hi>Triton</hi> with his wilke Trumpet, was next to her with this deuise, <hi>Velis, votis, ventis,</hi> by Sayles, by Vowes, by Windes.</p>
            <p>Round about the Ship, were all the Marine people, as <hi>Syrenes,</hi> (aboue the middle as women, &amp; vnder as fishes:) and these were <hi>Parthenope, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gea,</hi> and <hi>Leucosia,</hi> who accommodating their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures to the voice of the Musitions, repeated this verse, <hi>Vnus eris nobis cantandus semper in orbe.</hi> And all the same was decored with the riches of the seas, as Pearls, Corals, Shelles, and Mettalls, very rare and excellent.</p>
            <p>The bulke of this Ship was curiouslie pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and her Galleries, wherevpon stood the most part of the Banket in Christalline glasse, gilt with Gold and Azure.

            <p>On the Main-saile, was painted the Armories of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> with this deuice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent in the person of the Prince of <hi>Scotland.

            <p>Her tops were al armed with Taffataes of his Maiesties Collours, Golde, and Geules: and all her flaggs and streamers sutable to the same.</p>
            <p>Her Marriners were in number six, apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led al in changeable Spanish Taffataes, and her Pilote in cloth of gold, he alone stood at the helme, who only mooued and gouerned the whole frame, both the Ship and her burden, very artificially.</p>
            <p>The Musitions within the same, were 14. all apparelled in Taffataes of his Maiesties collors, besides <hi>Arion</hi> with his Harp.</p>
            <p>Being thus prepared, at the sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, she approached, and at the next sound of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> wilk Trumpet, together with the Masters whistle, she made sayle till shee came to the Table, discharging the ordinance in her Sterne by the way: But because this deuise caried some morall meaning with it, it shal not be impertinent to this purpose, to discover what is meant and propyned thereby.</p>
