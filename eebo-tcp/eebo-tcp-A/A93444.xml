         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Conſideration of the Natural, as well as Spiritual Benefits that God in his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodneſs, through the variety of his Gifts hath afforded amongſt his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whereby they are made mutual Helps and Comforts one unto another, move us
to ſend theſe Lines unto you, by way of recommendation of ſome <hi>Medicines</hi> prepared by our
Friend <hi>Charles Marſhall,</hi> that we by long experience have known to be ſafe and harmleſs, and
through the bleſſing of God made effectual for our own and others Relief, among whom we
live, and that many times in caſes of eminent danger, wherein the ſaid Medicines have (through
the bleſſing of the Lord) ſhown themſelves very quick and powerful in Operation, as a Friend
and Help to Nature, by the recovery of many, particularly theſe two Medicines, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Spiritus Mundus,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritus Sedativus,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Spirit</hi> in one entire Medicine, made
mention of at large in his printed Paper, with the Uſes and Directions for their taking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what we have heard by account from other places, both in this Nation, and from beyond
the Seas, in a more than ordinary manner of the great good they have done to many there,
againſt the Diſtempers incident to thoſe places; and conſidering how many unuſual and mixt
Diſtempers of theſe times are, and how many periſh for want of help; and withal, conſidering
how much Teſtimonals upon a frequent Experience is acceptable to the weak and diſtempered,
we thought it but juſt and tender to recommend theſe Medicines, as what may be of good Service
and Benefit to many, who are yet unacquainted with them, and to the end they may be made
publick, for the good of all under neceſſity, for their Health, eſpecially among Friends: And
the Mercy of God therein known and received to his praiſe, we in uprightneſs and ſincerity of
our Hearts do ſend theſe Lines unto you, and with the Salutation of our dear and brotherly
Love, in the fellowſhip of the bleſſed Truth remain</p>
