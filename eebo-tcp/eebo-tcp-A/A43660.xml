         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Couſin,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was very glad to receive your Letters, but very ſorry to find by them, that you are ſtill ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly deſirous of <hi>Innovations</hi> in a <hi>Government</hi> ſo well Eſtabliſhed, as that is under which you live. I perceive you are more zealous then it becomes a good Subject, or a good Chriſtian to be, for carrying on a Project of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> as Unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as New; <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Diſabling a Papiſt to Inherit the Crown.</hi> For doubtleſs that propoſal was firſt made, and afterwards promoted by him, the laſt <hi>Seſſions</hi> of Parliament, not out of true Love to the Reformed Religion, but out of <hi>Spite</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> to the D. of <hi>Y—</hi> Who, were he not only Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, but Heathen or Mahumetan (which I think is not much worſe) would certainly have as good a Title to his Crown, and all his Temporal <hi>Rights,</hi> as if he were the moſt Orthodox and Holy Chriſtian in the World. And I am perſwaded, that my zealous Lord <hi>Choſe</hi> would not be willing that the King and Parliament ſhould make a particular Act, to diſable his own Poſterity, to Inherit the great Eſtate he hath got, if they ſhould turn Papiſts or <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> as others have done before them. We all know what miſchief in the World, that Damnable Doctrine has made, <hi>That Temporal Rights and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances depend upon Saintſhip and Grace.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108255:3"/>And if it be clear from <hi>Scripture</hi> (as nothing is more clear) that a King ought not to loſe his Crown, for not being a Chriſtian, or for renouncing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Religion</hi> as <hi>Julian</hi> did; then it is plain, that neither the Duke nor any other <hi>Prince</hi> ought to be debarred from the Crown, which is the greateſt and moſt ſacred of Temporal Rights, for not being Proteſtants; or which is more, for renouncing the Chriſtian <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am heartily glad, that God gave the Fathers of the Engliſh Church the Grace and Courage to defend her Doctrine, in oppoſing that Unreaſonable, and truly <hi>Romiſh</hi> Propoſal of my Lord <hi>Choſe;</hi> which if they had approved, and defended after it was propoſed, they had truly acted in that like Prelats Popiſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and really ſhewed themſelves to be what their Adverſaries would fain perſwade the World, they are. For 'tis the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which maintain, <hi>That Kings Excommunicated, or Heretick Kings, or</hi> (which is all one) <hi>that Kings that renounce the Apoſtolick Faith, ought to be Deprived and Depoſed.</hi> But 'tis the Church of <hi>England</hi> that maintains the contradiction of that Unſcriptural, Unevangelical <hi>Principle;</hi> and thinks her ſelf as much obliged to ſubmit her ſelf to a <hi>Heathen, Atheiſtical, Heretical,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh Prince,</hi> where ſhe can, as to an Orthodox King; and where ſhe cannot, ſhe thinks her ſelf obliged to ſuffer, as her <hi>Saviour,</hi> like a Lamb brought to the ſlaughter; and dares pretend to take up to Arms but thoſe of the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> (<hi>Whoſe true Copy ſhe is</hi>) <hi>Tears, Arguments</hi> and <hi>Prayers.</hi> I ſay, it is the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:108255:3"/>that is of this Judgment, and neither the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Kirk of <hi>Scotland;</hi> both of which have actually <hi>Excommunicated</hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>poſed Lawful</hi> and <hi>Rightful Princes,</hi> under the Notion of being <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> to Chriſts Kingdom; forgetting both alike the <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cepts</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> on which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath grounded the contrary Doctrine, as well as on right reaſon.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, though God rendred unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that were <hi>Caeſar's;</hi> he owned his right to the Empire, both by word and deed, although he were but the adopted Succeſſor of the greateſt Uſurper that ever was in the World. Nay furthermore, he owned and ſubmitted to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatory Power of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who acted but by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Emperour <hi>Tiberius;</hi> who (if there be any truth in the Character of <hi>Tacitus</hi>) was one of the greateſt Tyrants, and moſt wicked men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the World ſaw. And as for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> there is no <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> not even that, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> more clear in his Epiſtles, than that <hi>Every Soul ſhould be ſubject to the Higher Powers; that we ſhould Obey, not only for Wrath, but Conſcience ſake; that whoſoever reſiſieth, receiveth to himſelf Damnation;</hi> and laſtly, <hi>that all the Powers</hi> (and when he wrote there were none but <hi>Heathen Powers) were ordained of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here inſiſt upon the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> as it is repreſented in their <hi>Acts,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> as they are reported by the <hi>Eccleſiaſtcal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:108255:4"/>and <hi>Hiſtoriaens;</hi> but the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to demonſtrate the truth of this <hi>Argument,</hi> which the Church of <hi>England</hi> has not only eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her Doctrine, but her Fathers and Sons of late, maintained in their <hi>Practices:</hi> and which the Kirk of of <hi>Scotland</hi> (agreeing in this and many other <hi>Points</hi> with that of <hi>Rome</hi>) did ever oppoſe, both in Word and Deed. And ſince that Kirk and Nation have been of this Opinion, we need not wonder that the <hi>Engliſh Diſciples</hi> of their <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> have practiſed thoſe rebellious <hi>Principles,</hi> which have ſo debauched and corrupted the Subjects of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as to make them be proverbially called, <hi>The Kings of Devils:</hi> And which the <hi>Anababtiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> improved into this Maxim, <hi>That Saintſhip was the Foundation of Soveraignty, and that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ought to Inherit the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And furthermore, if Crowns ought to deſcend upon Proteſtants only, then it is but juſt, that the <hi>Eſtates</hi> of all Subjects whatſoever ſhould be ſo <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed:</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd if for example, the <hi>D</hi>—of <hi>Y</hi>—muſt be cut off from his <hi>Right,</hi> for being a <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> then let the reſt of the Papiſts loſe theirs; they are all alike <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and let them all alike ſuffer. And, to bring the Caſe to your own <hi>Houſe,</hi> can you imagine that you your ſelf ought to loſe your <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Eſtate</hi> you have, or may have hereafter, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſuppoſition, that you ſhould turn Papiſt; which men as firmly reſoved againſt it as you have certainly done. Theſe Practiſes and Propoſals are ſuch, that they have left a blot on the memories of ſome men, that ſeem more zealous than their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108255:4"/>And I am glad at preſent, that the <hi>Religious</hi> Lord <hi>Choſe</hi> is the Chief <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Promoter</hi> of ſuch and Unreaſonable and <hi>Romiſh Deſign.</hi> It is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to exclude a Popiſh Heir from a Crown, to which he derives his right from <hi>Popiſh</hi> Anceſtors, and I have more than ordinary reaſon to call it Romiſh, becauſe I have heard it maintained here among all the Prieſts I converſe with. It is a Doctrine dearly beloved by the <hi>Romaniſts:</hi> And put but the Name of Heretick to a Prince here, and it is juſt the ſame caſe, as when you call a Prince a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> where, if there be no more than my good Lord <hi>Choſe</hi> that are Fautors of this <hi>Romiſh Doctrine,</hi> my Country is in a far better caſe than I thought it to be. And truly this noble <hi>Project</hi> of the late Lord <hi>Choſe</hi> was condemned by all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as ſoon as it took air in <hi>France;</hi> not only for that it was an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſpel way of <hi>Proceeding,</hi> and ſavours ſtrongly of the Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they abhor; but becauſe it puts their King in mind of a <hi>Project</hi> he is very much inclined to, <hi>viz.</hi> To make a like <hi>Law</hi> here, that none but a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> ſhall ever be King, or bear any <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Truſt</hi> in the Kingdom. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if it ſhould ever pleaſe God, for our ſins, to ſuffer our <hi>Princes</hi> to backſlide into <hi>Romiſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> we have nothing to do, but to pray, and like our Glorious Anceſtors in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> days, ſuffer quietly, when we cannot flie. And therefore I wonder that you would ſo obliquely reflect upon the Biſhops, and cenſure them for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which in Honour and Duty, they were bound to do, and repreſent this to their <hi>Diſgrace,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:108255:5"/>which all good and well adviſed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> muſt needs Commond them for, if they will be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial.</p>
            <p>But put the caſe ſuch an Act were made, who can ſee the bad conſequences thereof? The Union of <hi>Great Bri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tain</hi> will be broke upon it, and War en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon both Kingdoms, and by the ſame reaſon, that none but a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſhall ſucceed now, Faction ſtill increaſing, none perhaps within a while, will be thought ſit to Inherit the Crown, but a <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> &amp;c. For you that are uſed to talk of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Strength,</hi> can beſt tell how Numerous and Powerful they are that are poſſeſſed with as firm a prejudice againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; denying Communion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with both; and who educate their Children in perfect hatred of the one, as the genuine Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the other.</p>
            <p>I have wrote all this to preſent to your view what (perhaps in the hurry of Zeal) you have not had time to conſider. And though I think it very impious and unreaſonable to debar any ſuch Prince from the Crown, upon this account, yet could we imagine the Government were to be formed again, I would be as Zealous for this condition, as the greateſt <hi>Zealot</hi> of them all: And am as ſorry as any other good Proteſtant, that it was not always one of the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> though now it be too late to make it ſuch.</p>
            <p>You tell me alſo that my Lord — intends to come and live in <hi>London;</hi> I ſuppoſe it may be under pretence to ſecure his Perſon from the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but I

The Reaſon that makes me fear it, is the conformity of our times in <hi>England</hi> with thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> as you may ſee by the following account.</p>
            <p>The Duke, who was a man of an <hi>High Spirit,</hi> and not able to bear the leaſt diſgrace, being remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Henry</hi> III. from them moſt Rich and Honourable of his <hi>Court-Preferments,</hi> became thereupon Male-content; and retiring from the Court, which he now did hate, went to live at his <hi>Houſe</hi> in <hi>Paris:</hi> where, by many Arts, as in particular by the ſubtle Practiſes of the Prieſts and Jeſuits, he became in a ſhort time the Minion of the People; whoſe Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he drew off from the King, by repreſenting him (though a hearty <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>) as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorer of the <hi>Hereticks;</hi> who under the protection of the Princes of the Bloud increaſed mightily in his <hi>Reign.</hi> He alſo repreſented him in particular to be a great favourer of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> againſt whom he himſelf had a particular ill will; and whom the <hi>People,</hi> through the Inſtigation of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> did perfectly hate, becauſe he was a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> although he was <hi>Primier Prince</hi> of the Blood (for whom the French commonly have a great Reverence) and by Conſequence Heir Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or as a Friend of your would have ſaid, <hi>Heir Preſumptive</hi> (for the King had no Child to Inherit) to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> After he had thus made the credulous <hi>People,</hi> by the help of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108255:6"/>
               <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> zealous for the Defence of their Declining Religion, he drew them to League into Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their lawful Soveraign, under a pretence of ſecuring the ſame, by removing Evil Councellors from his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and obliging him to employ his Royal <hi>Power</hi> in ſuppreſſing the <hi>Proteſtans;</hi> and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular by declaring the <hi>Heretick</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>H.</hi> IV.) uncapable of ſucceeding to the Crown.</p>
            <p>For the ſake of <hi>Peace</hi> the King was willing ſo far to deny himſelf as to grant the two firſt, but could never be made ſo falſe to the Intereſt of the Royal Family, as to conſent to the laſt, by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of Succeſſion to the Crown, by which his Anceſtors had Reigned ſo many hundred years; and which have been ſo long eſtabliſhed, without any reſpect to Religion, by the Salique or Original Laws of <hi>France. Hereupon</hi> the <hi>League</hi> (in Imitation, and after the Pattern of which the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> was formed) or Rebellion grew ſo high, as to beat the King out of <hi>Paris;</hi> where the <hi>Guiſards</hi> had a deſign to ſieze upon his ſacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhut him up, like King <hi>Chilperick,</hi> in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and ſet up the ſilly old Cardinal <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the King of <hi>Navar</hi>'s Uncle, to Reign in his ſtead. But the King eſcaping from <hi>Paris,</hi> ſheltered himſelf in <hi>Chartres;</hi> where to compoſe Differences, he iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out Writs to call together the three Eſtates (which much reſemble our <hi>Parliaments</hi>) at <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is.</hi> Thither the Deputies or Members repair, ſome for the King, but far more for the Curſed League; and therefore the <hi>Guiſards</hi> finding themſelves more potent than <hi>the Royaliſts,</hi> inſiſted almoſt on nothing elſe, but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108255:6"/>ſecuring the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> by de claring the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> becauſe an <hi>Heretick,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Succeeding to the moſt Chriſtian Crown.</p>
            <p>You ſee Couſin, what a Parallel there is between thoſe times and ours; excepting Firſt, that there are no Prieſts and Jeſuits to ſecond ſuch a Deſign in <hi>England,</hi> as there were in <hi>France:</hi> But to ſupply that Defect, there may be found men as fit in all points as they in <hi>Black,</hi> to ſtir up the People to Diſcontent and Rebellion. I mean the ſame ſort of Perſons that Preached up the late Bloody War; who really are the Baſtard-brood of the Monaſtick and Jeſuitical Emiſſaries, though they bear not the Names of their Fathers; but (like Baſtards) are diſowned by thoſe that begot them. The Seditious <hi>Principles. Preached</hi> and <hi>Printed</hi> by them in the late Times, are Evident Proofs of what Race they are come: And as a man may Travel ſo far Weſt, till at laſt he come to the ſame Eaſtern Point from which he did ſet out, ſo you Couſin, and your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have gone ſo far from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that you are (ſome I believe unawares) come thither again; as is unanſwerably proved by <hi>Lyſimachus Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenor,</hi> lately reprinted at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in his Letter of Congratulation to the Kirk. But Secondly, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> fails in this too, That his Royal Highneſs is not a declared <hi>Papist,</hi> as the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was a declared <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> nor has yet openly renounced the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for which his bleſſed Father died a Martyr. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the two, our Engliſh <hi>Guiſards</hi> are much more to blame, in repreſenting his Roual High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108255:7"/>as a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> which is ſo difficult to imagine him <hi>Strictly</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>But furthermore, upon ſuppoſition he were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Papiſt,</hi> the <hi>Propoſal</hi> of my Lord <hi>Choſe</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ridiculous, ſince it did ſuppoſe a poſſibility of prevailing with his Majeſty to Diſinherit his Royal Brother, who muſt needs be ſo much dearer to him, than the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was to <hi>Henry</hi> III, as he is nearer in Blood. And for may own part, I cannot but imagine at this diſtance, that his Majeſty who is a <hi>Prince</hi> incomparably wiſer and juſter then was <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> muſt needs diſdain and abhor ſuch a <hi>Propoſal;</hi> which, were it Enacted, it would enervate the Laws of Succeſſion by which <hi>He</hi> and <hi>His Anceſtors</hi> have hitherto Reigned, and give a greater Blow to the Engliſh <hi>Monarchy,</hi> than that which cut off <hi>His</hi> Royal Fathers <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here forborn to give you an Account of the Tragical End of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which is a Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well worth your Learning, and may teach all <hi>Perſons,</hi> ſo diſpoſed as he was, how unſafe it is to provoke Soveraign <hi>Authority;</hi> ſince the goodneſs of the beſt of Kings, like the infinite Goodneſs of God himſelf, whoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> they are, may at length be ſo injured and affronted, as to be forced to ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it ſelf into Sovereign Vengeance and Juſtice. <hi>And</hi> therefore Couſin, let me adviſe you, if not for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet for Wraths ſake, to have nothing to do in Blowing up the Flames of Sedition: Nor let your <hi>Soul</hi> enter into the ſecret of my Lord — though his <hi>Intereſt</hi> among the Senators (as you write) be ſo very conſiderable and ſtrong.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108255:7"/>
            <p>You likewiſe forget your ſelf, in miſcalling the Execution of the late Laws by the odious name of <hi>Perſecution;</hi> which if you can prove to be ſuch, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptural notion of Perſecution, <hi>viz. Infliction of Evil for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> then will I become your Proſelyte, and forſake the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as much as I have this Idolatrous Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For no man is perſecuted, but either for immediate matters of Divine Worſhip, which concern the Firſt Table; or with reſpect to matters of Morality, or a Good Life, which concern the Second.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the Firſt; a man is perſecuted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a negative account, for not worſhiping a Falſe God, as the three Children in <hi>Daniel;</hi> or for not worſhipping the True in a Falſe way: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles were perſecuted by the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, for not worſhipping the True God according to the Jewiſh manner after it was abrogated: Or as our Fore fathers in <hi>England,</hi> For not worſhiping God and our Saviour after the Romiſh Rites. Or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, on a poſitive account, For worſhipping the true God in a way that is true; or to expreſs it yet more clearly and abſolutely in your own terms, <hi>For ſerving of God:</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> was caſt into the Lyons Den, for praying to God againſt the King's Decree.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the Second; A man is alſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on a negative account, For not doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which is in its own nature, or by God; poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command, morally evil: as the good Midwives were afraid to be perſecuted by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108255:8"/>murthering the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Infants. Or elſe on a poſitive account, for doing ſome good moral action, which ought in ſuch and ſuch circumſtances to be done: and thus was our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> perſecuted, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the eyes of the blind man, and for healing on the <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe diſtinctions being premiſed, tell me <hi>in which of theſe caſes you are Perſecuted?</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>for what you are Confeſſors and Martyrs?</hi> For no man is perſecuted, but as he is perſecuted he is a Confeſſor or Martyr; and by his ſufferings bears witneſs to the Truth. With reſpect to the <hi>Second</hi> head, you cannot ſay that you are perſecuted; and therefore let me ſee whether you are ſo with reſpect to the firſt. And Firſt, 'tis plain that you do not ſuffer for not worſhiping a falſe God; and 'tis likewiſe as plain, that you do not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for not worſhipping the true God in a falſe way. For firſt, the Laws, whoſe Execution you miſ-call Perſecution, do not puniſh you for not worſhiping God after our way; or if they did to prove their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution to be Perſecution, you muſt Firſt prove that the Church of <hi>England</hi> (whoſe Doctrine is down right againſt Idolatry and Superſtition) does worſhip God in an Idolatrous and Superſtitious manner; which, good Couſin, you know can never be proved.</p>
            <p>There remains nothing then but to aſſert, That you are puniſhed <hi>for ſerving God, or for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God in a way which you are ſure is true.</hi> That you worſhip God in a true way, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, and could heartily joyn with you in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances. But then you are not puniſhed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108255:8"/>for worſhipping God in that manner; for the ſame Laws you complain of, allow you to worſhip God in what faſhion you pleaſe; and not only you, but your Family, be it as great as it will; and laſtly, not only your Family, but Five Perſons more; Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, were you the only Chriſtians in the World, and the Magiſtrates Heathens; or, which your Friends are more likely to ſuggeſt, were they Papiſts or Atheiſts, is ſo far from being Perſecution, that were you of the temper of the Primitive Chriſtians, you would eſteem it as a great priviledg, and inſtead of reviling, thank the kind Magiſtrate for the ſame. But then if on the contrary hand you be conſidered (and many good Engliſh men, and good Chriſtians cannot but conſider you) as a ſort of men that have formerly raiſed a moſt Unnatural Rebellion, and now make Schiſm in the Church, and Broyles in the State, the puniſhments you ſuffer and complain ſo loudly off, will be ſo far from ſeeming Perſecution of you as Chriſtians, that they will rather ſeem your juſt Deſert, as Factious and Turbulent Subjects. And I aſſure you, that your Brethren in <hi>France</hi> (whom you falſly ſo call, and for whom you pretend ſo great reſpect) are ſo far from Judging you perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they will not excuſe you; but wonder at your non-ſubmiſſion to the Church, and pity your miſtakes, that make you ſtand out againſt the Laws. They that have ſeen and examined our Engliſh Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which is Printed at <hi>Geneva</hi> in French, cannot underſtand your Notion of Perſecution. And <hi>Miniſtre Claude,</hi> the moſt famous of them all, for Piety and Learning, told me in the preſence of many others,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108255:9"/>(after a Diſcourſe, wherein he ſaid all for you that could be ſaid) that he wondred how the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in <hi>England</hi> could rend the Peace of the Church, for ſuch little indifferent mat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers; and that, if he were in <hi>England,</hi> he would be of the <hi>Epiſcopal Party,</hi> and heartily ſubmit himſelf to the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And if you would do ſo too, how happy a thing would this be both for your ſelves and the Nation? Or ſeeing, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you cannot, yet at leaſt live <hi>Peaceably,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to trouble the World with compaſſing <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land;</hi> that is, by doing all that you can, like your Fathers the old <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to make <hi>Proſelytes;</hi> when yet you cannot ſhew any ſinful condition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> nor prove your way of <hi>Worſhip</hi> as <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> as that of hers; from which out of <hi>Pride, Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or partly altogether you Diſſent. I am ſure this would rather become the Diſſenting <hi>Brethren,</hi> then to Foment <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi> Raiſe <hi>Parties,</hi> betake themſelves to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedeſt of <hi>Men,</hi> as of late to —and cry up the <hi>Kings Prerogative,</hi> which they formerly cried down; which with many other ſelf-contradictions, confirms me in an opinion you know I was of before, That in thoſe matters wherein you differ from us, you are men of no <hi>Principles,</hi> and know not where to ſix.</p>
            <p>I have Enlarged upon this <hi>Theam</hi> more than I thought to do a firſt, becauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> here in <hi>France</hi> complain as loudly as you of the cruelty of our <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws;</hi> and cry out wherever they come, how their <hi>Brethren</hi> have been; and ſtill are <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted among us;</hi> though with this difference, that

It is a very ſinful way thus to abuſe and amuſe the Vulgar, by calling things by their wrong Names: and as to this particular, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and knowing men will be apt to ſuſpect, that through the Name of <hi>Perſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cution,</hi> you have a deſign to make your Governours paſs for Tyrants, and your ſelves for Martyrs.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:108255:11"/>
            <p>To conclude: If this which you call <hi>Perſecution,</hi> be not ſuch indeed, then I doubt not but they who <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> it ſo, that is all preſumptuous or affectedly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Schiſmaticks, without bitter pangs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, will be perſecuted by the God of <hi>Peace</hi> himſelf to a ſad and endleſs eternity.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Bill of Comprehenſion,</hi> it begun to be talked of, before I left my Country, and I have often diſcours'd it with many of the <hi>Projectors,</hi> but could never underſtand from them, how it was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable to unite ſo many <hi>Incompoſſible Sects,</hi> which agree in nothing, but their oppoſition to the Church. However if the altering, or taking away of a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or two could <hi>effectually</hi> unite the <hi>Proteſtant Partys,</hi> as you are pleaſed to aſſert, I think it would be worth the while to do it, and that the doing of it for ſo ſure an end, would reflect no diſhonour upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which acknowledgeth the few innocent and decent Ceremonies, which ſhe hath ordained to be indifferent and alterable, according to the Exigency of times. Neither, if this were done, could the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> have the leaſt apparent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reproach us for ſuch a ſlight alteration; ſeeing her own <hi>Miſſals</hi> and <hi>Breviaries</hi> have been ſo diverſe and different in ſeveral times and places; and have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſo many Emendations, or rather Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before they were eſtabliſhed in the preſent Form, by the Authority of <hi>Pius</hi> V. and the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But unleſs this Alteration would ſurely and infallibly produce this effect, it had far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be let alone, and in the mean time, I would have all good Chriſtians wait in Peace and Complyance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108255:11"/>with the Eſtabliſhed Religion, till <hi>Authority</hi> ſhall think to make this <hi>Alteration</hi> in it, that ſo a poor <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Traveller would not be tauntingly asked by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impertinent Prieſt here, Whether he were a true Son of the Church, or <hi>Preſbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Independant,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> or <hi>Quaker.</hi> And I aſſure you, when they meet with a man that owns himſelf a true <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> they will ſeem with great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality to pity him more than any other; but yet they will never attempt to convert him. But when they meet with one that will own himſelf of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort, they will be pleaſed, ſmile in their Sleeves, and ſet upon him as a Perſon not far from their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Ana I am perſwaded, had you ſeen or heard as much of their Idolatries, Blaſphemies and Superſtitions, as I have done in one <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> one <hi>Line</hi> and one <hi>Eaſter,</hi> you would be ſo far from doing the Church of <hi>England</hi> any ill Office, that you would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (like St. <hi>Paul</hi> after his <hi>Converſion</hi>) preach againſt your own <hi>Partizans,</hi> and thank God that you lived in a <hi>Church</hi> reformed from <hi>Romiſh Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</hi> And I cannot but freely confeſs, that I am ſince my <hi>Travels</hi> become ten Times a greater Lover of our own Church, and as many times a greater Hater and Deteſter of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> than I was before. And therefore I cannot here diſſemble the hearty Grief I have conceived, for the great hopes you have, that the <hi>Licenſes</hi> (as you expreſs it) will be once more authorized by his Majeſty, or the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration revived. For as it is that which at firſt was hammered out by a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Lord, who was the Patron and Idol of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> ſo 'tis that which the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108255:12"/>
               <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> here (eſpecially the Prieſts) do hope, and wiſh for as well as you. They deſire nothing more, than ſuch a <hi>Toleration,</hi> as that was, knowing that it muſt needs tend to the Ruine of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is the principal Butt of all their Envy and Malice; as being the main ſupport and credit of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> every where, and the only hedg againſt <hi>Popery</hi> it ſelf in our unfortunate <hi>Britiſh Iſles.</hi> We meet with not a few Prieſts of ſeveral Orders, that have the confidence (in our moſt familiar confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) to tell us, that by the juſt Judgment of <hi>God</hi> upon our <hi>Church,</hi> the time of Her <hi>Ruin</hi> is at <hi>Hand;</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> it ſelf being over-ſpread with Schiſm and Atheiſm, and the Hearts of the <hi>Faithful</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the <hi>Spirit Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to re-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Holy Catholick Truth.</hi> And therefore they freely Confeſs, that this time of <hi>Distraction</hi> is their <hi>Harveſt;</hi> and withal expreſs their Intentions and Zeal to Tranſport themſelves into <hi>England</hi> at the Critical time of Toleration, that they may be Fellow-laborers with your ſelves in the <hi>Harveſt.</hi> They ſeem to lament as much, and complain as faſt, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious increaſe of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm</hi> among us, as you are wont to do of the daily growth of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi> And whilſt you both complain alike, and in the formality of your complaints, both alike reflect upon the Church of <hi>England:</hi> It is ſhe only that is the ſufferer, and ſhe only that truly laments the growth, and at the ſame time ſets up Banks to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the perfect <hi>Inundation</hi> of all the three among us! As for Schiſm among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> you were the firſt <hi>Fathers,</hi> and continue the chief Fautors thereof;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108255:12"/>all the inferior <hi>Sects</hi> having ſprung from you, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding both from you and one another, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the ſame Reaſons, for which you profeſs to divide from the <hi>Church.</hi> And 'tis from you, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Quakering Sect</hi> it ſelf (the dregs of <hi>Schiſm</hi>) have learned to talk of <hi>Illumination,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit:</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Sectaries;</hi> in what number ſoever they be, differ no more from you than the ſecond, third, or fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the firſt Book of <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And therefore, if the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> from which you wilfully divide, and to which by your Diviſions you cauſe ſo much Scandal abroad and Evil at home, be not a Schiſmatical Church,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108255:13"/>that is, a Church which requires ſome ſinful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Communion; in what a woful condition will your unpeaceable, ſeditious <hi>Spirits</hi> appear before the God of Peace? And how will you anſwer that, at the Tribunal of his Wiſdom and Juſtice, which neither your Fathers, nor you could never yet anſwer, to thoſe Inſtruments of his Glory, Judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> and the Venerable <hi>Sanderſon?</hi> But whether you are <hi>Schiſmas ticks,</hi> or whether you are not, the Separations which you and your Brood have made from the Church, are the <hi>Apparent Cauſes</hi> of the <hi>Growth of Popery;</hi> and both your <hi>Separations,</hi> and your <hi>Superſtitious Enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Way of Worſhipping</hi> that God, whoſe People you Emphatically pretend to be, are the true Cauſes of that abundant Atheiſm, which at preſent makes <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> an Aſtoniſhment nad a Scandal to Foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And if you, or any other of the Brother-hood, think it ſtrange, that I charge yours, which is the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Sect,</hi> with Enthuſiaſm, or make <hi>Superſtition,</hi> which ſeemeth diametrically oppoſite to <hi>Atheiſm</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> thereof; I offer, upon the Challenge, to make good the Charge, in both particulars: But in the mean time, to ſhew you how unſafe it will be to provoke me to that Trouble, I adviſe you to read one or two ſhort chapters in the beginning of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, concerning theſe Diſtempers of the Soul, and you ſhall find what I have ſaid, proved with more Plainneſs and Perſpicity, than, I am confident, you would wiſh to ſee.</p>
            <p>But beſides the <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> the Bloody Wars, which you formerly made in the <hi>State,</hi> under
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108255:13"/>pretence of the Glory of God, and the Reformation of of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> have given many inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men occaſion to ſuſpect, that all Religion, like that of moſt of your <hi>Leaders,</hi> is but a <hi>Politick Engine</hi> which Men uſe, to make themſelves <hi>Popular</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,</hi> that they may afterwards act with good colour whatſoever their Intereſt ſhall ſuggeſt. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, to conſider, That the great <hi>Pretenders</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion, (which with reſpect to <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> teacheth nothing but to <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>ſuffer</hi>) ſhould notwithſtanding Preach up <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt their <hi>Rightful Prince,</hi> Fight Him from Field to Field, Romove Him from Priſon to Priſon, and at laſt moſt barbarouſly put Him to Death, is ſuch an Abſurdity againſt the Principles of Right Reaſon, ſo repugnant to the Laws of our own Nation, and ſo inconſiſtent with the Peaceable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel; that, beſides the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> it hath made, it hath, and ever will conſtrain Men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Principles,</hi> and juſt Reſentments, to <hi>Perſecute</hi> you with <hi>Satyrs</hi> and <hi>Exclamations</hi> to the end of the World. I had not here preſented that Tragical Scene of the King's Murther, but that I have had ſo many unpleaſant Occaſions to hear Our <hi>Nation</hi> Reproach'd with the Scandal and Diſhonour of that Inhumane Fact. Particularly, it was my bad Fortune to be at a Station in <hi>Paris;</hi> where there were met about two hundred Perſons, to read the <hi>Gazetts,</hi> at that very ſame time, when that of <hi>England</hi> came full charged with the News of Burning the Pope in <hi>Eſſigie</hi> at <hi>London.</hi> This Feat did at firſt ſurprize that <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Concourſe of People; but after a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108255:14"/>collection, they ceaſed to wonder, ſaying in every Company as we paſſed along; <hi>It is not ſo ſtrange that the Engliſh Devils ſhould do this, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Murthered their King.</hi> And another time, it was my ill luck alſo to be at the ſame place, when the <hi>London</hi> Gazette brought us the News, <hi>That the Houſe of Lords had taken into conſideration the Growth of Atheiſm in our Nation:</hi> Whereupon ſome <hi>French Gentlemen</hi> of my acquaintance ſeriouſly enquired of me the Cauſes of ſo much <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> amongſt ſuch a Thinking and Solid People. I aſſigned the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I have written above, beſides ſome others which I will not ſtand to mention, as the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Cauſes thereof. And as I hope I did not miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, ſo I am confident did not unjuſtly charge you in any particular, eſpecially with the <hi>Murther of the King.</hi> For there were no Acceſſaries in the Murther of that Sacred Perſon: neither was it the laſt ſtroke only that ſell'd the <hi>Royal Oak;</hi> but you and the Independants, like the two Sacrilegious Prieſts of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> are equally guilty of the Crime; the one for Binding the direful Victim, and the other for putting the Knife to his Throat.</p>
            <p>But to be ſhort, where I am ſo unacceptable, I'le conclude my <hi>Argument</hi> with a <hi>Fable.</hi> A <hi>Principal. Ship,</hi> which for many <hi>Years</hi> had been Sovereign of the Seas, was at laſt <hi>Attacted</hi> by a <hi>Tempeſtuous Wind,</hi> which the Devil raiſed, and notwithſtanding all the <hi>Help</hi> that could be made to ſave her, was driven by the force of that Malignant Wind, and ſplit upon a <hi>Rock.</hi> The very ſame Inſtant ſhe daſhed upon the <hi>Rock</hi> the Wind ceaſed; and being afterwards curſed by the <hi>Sea-men,</hi> for the <hi>Wrack</hi> of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108255:14"/>the Royal <hi>Charles</hi> (for ſo the <hi>Capital Veſſel</hi> was called) anſwered, You <hi>Charge</hi> me moſt unjuſtly my Friends, it was not I, but the Rock as you ſaw that ſplit your Ship. The <hi>Moral</hi> of this <hi>Parable</hi> is very <hi>Obvious;</hi> and if the <hi>Application</hi> thereof, or any thing elſe that I have written, may conduce to awaken your <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and reclaim you from <hi>Schiſm,</hi> I ſhall think my pains well beſtowed. But if you and your ſeditious <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> will ſtill perſevere to aſſault the Church on one <hi>Hand,</hi> as faſt as the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts</hi> do undermine her on the <hi>other,</hi> her days are like to be but few and evil; and except God encline the <hi>Hearts</hi> of our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to put the Laws in Execution againſt them, and ſind ſome effectual means to reduce you, you may live to ſee her Ruin accompliſhed, which you both alike deſire and expect. How numerous you are, the <hi>World</hi> can gueſs, and if the Accounts which we receive from the Fathers of <hi>Intelligence</hi> of ſeveral Orders, be credible, there are about three <hi>Thouſand</hi> of them, which ſind Entertainment and Succeſs within the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s Dominions. But in the mean time, till her hour is come, ſhe ſtruggleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both, like her Saviour againſt the Phariſees, whoſe true Diſciples in part you both are; they repreſenting thoſe ſworn Enemies of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by the Cabala of their ridiculous and impious Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and you repreſenting them in their <hi>Hypocriſie, Pride, Envy, Evil-ſpeaking,</hi> moroſs and cenſorious <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> &amp;c. (which are Sins ſcarce conſiſtent with <hi>Humanity,</hi> much leſs with <hi>Grace</hi>) as likewiſe in obſerving many Faſts and making long, Prayers, with deſign not <hi>to ſerve God,</hi> but to <hi>delude the People.</hi> And therefore I wonder not that you are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108255:15"/>ſuch malignant Enemies to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> ſince that Phariſaical ſpirit, which reigneth ſo much amongſt you, is a wicked Puſilanimous ſpirit, that affects to be ſeen in the Head of Parties, and Dictate amongſt the Ignorant; and loves as much to <hi>Rule,</hi> as it hates to <hi>Obey.</hi> But would you once be ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, as to ſubdue your Pride, lay aſide your Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, inform your Ignorance, and forſake your dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved <hi>Intereſt,</hi> for the <hi>Truth;</hi> it would not be long ere we ſhould ſee you joyn with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> without troubling our Senators to bring you in with an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>incomprehenſible Comprehenſion.</hi> Your <hi>Pride</hi> appeareth in <hi>Heading of Parties,</hi> and in the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> you are ſeen to take in the <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi> that run after you; and in your boaſting, that without you the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>People</hi> would ſtarve for want of <hi>Knowledg.</hi> Your <hi>Prejudice</hi> is an effect of your <hi>Pride,</hi> and diſcovers it ſelf together with your <hi>Ignorance,</hi> in not ſubmitting to thoſe Invincible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which you cannot <hi>Anſwer:</hi> And as for your <hi>Intereſt,</hi> the greateſt <hi>Paradox</hi> of all, that is evident enough to me, who have ſo often heard many of you glorifie your ſelves in the Number and Riches of your Followers, boaſt of their <hi>Affection</hi> to your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſons, and brag of the great Sums you have <hi>Collected</hi> in your <hi>Congregations;</hi> which makes the <hi>King's Chapples</hi> (as you arrogantly call your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles</hi>) better places than moſt of the <hi>Churches,</hi> of which <hi>He is Patron.</hi> And therefore never complain that you live either worſe, or at greater uncertainties than you did before. For by your <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> to <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and by other <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108255:15"/>Arts,</hi> you have ſo wrought your ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eſteem of your Diſciples, that few of them are either ſo <hi>Covetuous</hi> or ſo <hi>Poor,</hi> but they will Pinch at home to ſupply you. There are ſeveral orders of <hi>Franſciſcans</hi> here, who have renounced not only <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages,</hi> but all <hi>Temporal Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and by their vain Glorious <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities,</hi> they have got (like you) ſuch faſt hold on the Souls of the <hi>People</hi> (which is the faſteſt hold of all) that they can eaſily make moſt of them diſpoſe of their <hi>Children,</hi> caſhire their <hi>Servants,</hi> and ſettle their <hi>Eſtates</hi> as they pleaſe; and by theſe Tricks do more effectually promote the <hi>Intereſt of Rome,</hi> than all the <hi>Pariſh Prieſts</hi> within the <hi>Pale</hi> of that <hi>Church.</hi> And really, when I conſider what <hi>Influence</hi> theſe <hi>Sanctimonious</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denying Zealots</hi> have o're all Families, in all places where they live; how they <hi>Steal</hi> away the Hearts of the <hi>People</hi> from their <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts,</hi> and drain their Congregations; and how the deluded <hi>People</hi> had rather give them the worth of a ſhilling, than the dues of two pence, to their own <hi>Curees;</hi> it makes me often run the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel between you and them, and think what a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Gainful Pretence you have got to renounce your Livings, for to ſecure your Conſciences, and to preach the Word <hi>gratis</hi> like the <hi>Primitive Apeſiles;</hi> when God knows, 'tis not out of love to the People, but to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>And I proteſt to you, were I a man to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and conſulted my <hi>Proſit</hi> more than the Goodneſs of my Cauſe, I ſhould take the ſame courſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108255:16"/>that you do; I ſhould rather be Mr. <hi>M.</hi> than Dr. <hi>A.</hi> of <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and ſhould chuſe the plentiful Income of that dull Zealot Dr. <hi>Manton,</hi> before that of his moſt Learned and Religious Succeſſor of <hi>Govent-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> But though you live very well, and better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed than moſt of the Miniſters of the Church, yet the Miſchief of it is, you are uncapable of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which makes you ſuch <hi>Aerians,</hi> and upon all occaſions openeth your Throats as wide as Sepulehres againſt the Biſhops and the Church. You know what an Hiſtory of Biſhops Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath wrote, and what a fair Collection the Learnes <hi>Smec.</hi> hath taken out of him; as if when a Biſhop is defective, either in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Learning or the Skill of Government, it were not the deplorable unhappineſs, but the fault of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Should an Heathen or Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, make ſuch an Hiſtorical Collection of Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Chriſtians, either in this or former Ages, you would not be perſwaded for all that, to prefer the <hi>Alcoran</hi> before the Goſpel; or the moſt exalted <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm</hi> whatſoever, before the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Therefore wiſe and ſober men will make no <hi>Inference but this, from ſuch a malicious enumeration of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; that corruptions will creep into Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithſtanding all the care that can be uſed to the contrary; and that by the favour of <hi>Princes (who hear with other mens ears, and often receive undeſerved <hi>Characters</hi> of Men) ſometimes <hi>Ambitious,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Slothful, Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> or <hi>Debauched Perſons,</hi> will be <hi>Preferred</hi> to the moſt <hi>Honourable Dignities</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> But this, as often as it happens, is the miſery of the <hi>Church</hi> of

                     <hi>England,</hi> which all true <hi>Church men</hi> lament;</hi> though the men of the ſhort <hi>Cloke</hi> take all ſuch occaſions to expoſe her to the ſcorn of the <hi>common people</hi> who judge <hi>by Senſe,</hi> and not by <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and who are taught by you, to make no diſtinction between the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> But were all her <hi>Biſhops</hi> the beſt <hi>Christians,</hi> the beſt <hi>Scholars</hi> and the beſt <hi>Governours</hi> in the <hi>World;</hi> and ſhould the <hi>Royal Hand</hi> place her Mytres on the <hi>Heads</hi> of none but <hi>Jewels, Whit-gift</hi>'s, <hi>Andrews</hi>'s, <hi>Hall</hi>'s, <hi>Uſhers</hi>'s, <hi>Morton</hi>'s, <hi>Taylor</hi>'s, and <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s, yet that Unchriſtian <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Envy</hi> and Diſcontent,</hi> which informs the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> would ſtill fly upon her with open Mouth, like <hi>Beaſts</hi> upon the <hi>Saints</hi> of old condemned to the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater;</hi> and make her, as ſhe hath already been for almoſt forty years, a <hi>Speactacle</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Angels,</hi> and to Men. The wicked Lives of <hi>Scandalous Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> if there be any ſuch, are her ſad Misfortune, but cannot juſtifie the <hi>Schiſm</hi> you are guilty of; who are bound to hear even them, as much as the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> thoſe <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair. And in that deplorable ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> when the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> were both alike cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and called by the <hi>Holy Spirit, Dumb and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Dogs,</hi> yet it had been unlawful to make a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſet up other Altars againſt that which <hi>God</hi> (who was their <hi>King</hi>) had ſet up. I cannot but mind you of the <hi>Schiſm</hi> of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> was pleaſed to divide the Kingdom into two parts, made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin. But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Seceſſion, and write all, that is

Beſides, it would oblige me to anſwer Mr. <hi>Hale</hi>'s Treatiſe of Schiſm, with whoſe Leaves you vainly endeavour to cover you ſhame: And I had indeed a year ago underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that eaſie Task, but that a <hi>Weſtern</hi> Gentleman, to whom I diſcovered my Intentions, told me, That Mr. <hi>Long Prebendary</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> a Friend of his had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begun that good Work: ſo that I hope it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this time. And if either that or this, or any thing elſe, a thouſand times better, and I am able to write, may prove effectual to reclaim you from <hi>Schiſm;</hi> I ſhall be as glad, as to ſee ſome other of our <hi>Friends</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from Drunkenneſs, Swearing, and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are very grievous, and dreadful Sins, but yet not more damnable in their Nature, nor more deſtructive to the Chriſtian Religion, nor more deeply rooted in the Soul of man, than that of Schiſm; From which, I pray God, by the Power of his Grace, to Preſerve me, and Reform you, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord; to whoſe Protection I commit you, and reſt,</p>
