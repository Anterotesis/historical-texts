            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe little Obligation I have to some of the witty Sparks and Poets of the Town, has put me on a Vindication of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy from those Censures that Malice, and ill Nature have thrown upon it, tho in vain: The Poets I heartily excuse, since there is a sort of Self-Interest in their Malice, which I shou'd rather call a witty Way they have in this Age, of Railing at every thing they find with pain successful, and never to shew good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and speak well of any thing; but when they are sure 'tis damn'd, then they afford it that worse Scandal, their Pity. And nothing makes them so through-stitcht an Enemy as a full Third Day, that's Crime enough to load it with all manner of Infamy; and when they can no other way prevail with the Town, they charge it with the old never failing Scandal—That 'tis not fit for the Ladys: As if (if it were as they falsly give it out) the Ladys were oblig'd to hear Indecencys only from their Pens and Plays and some of them have ventur'd to treat 'em as Coursely as 'twas possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without the least Reproach from them; and in some of their most Celebrated Plays have entertained 'em with things, that if I should here strip from their Wit and Occasion that conducts 'em in and makes them proper, their fair Cheeks would perhaps wear a natural Colour at the reading them: yet are never taken Notice of, because a Man writ them, and they may hear that from them they blush at from a Woman—But I make a Challenge to any Person of common Sense and Reason—that is not wilfully bent on ill Nature, and will in spight of Sense wrest a double <hi>Entendre</hi> from every thing, lying upon the Catch for a Jest or a Quibble, like a Rook for a Cully; but any unprejudic'd Person that knows not the Author, to read any of my Comedys and compare 'em with others of this Age, and if they find one Word that can offend the chastest Ear, I will submit to all their peevish Cavills; but Right or Wrong they must be Criminal because a Woman's; condemning them without having the Christian Charity, to examine whether it be guilty or not, with reading, comparing, or thinking; the Ladies taking up any Scandal on Trust from some conceited Sparks, who will in spight of Nature be Wits and <hi>Beaus;</hi> then scatter it for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick all over the Town and Court, poysoning of others Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>I say, after all these Supervisors the Ladys may be convinc'd, they left nothing that cou'd offend, and the Men of their unjust Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on so many Judges of Wit and Decencys. When it happens that I challenge any one, to point me out the least Expression of what some have made their Discourse, they cry, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Leigh <hi>opens his Night Gown, when he comes into the Bride-chamber;</hi> if he do, which is a Jest of his own making, and which I never saw, I hope he has his Cloaths on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

with course ill Manners, and very little Modesty, and yet they so naturally fall into the places they are designed for, and so are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Business, that there is not the least Fault to be found with them; though I say those things in any of mine wou'd damn the whole Peice, and alarm the Town. Had I a Day or two's time, as I have scarce so many Hours to write this in (the Play, being all printed off and the Press waiting,) I would sum up all your Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Plays, and all the things in them that are past with such Silence by; because written by Men: such Masculine Strokes in me, must not be allow'd. I must conclude those Women (if there be any such) greater Criticks in that sort of Conversation than my self, who find any of that sort in mine, or any thing that can justly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach't. But 'tis in vain by dint of Reason or Comparison to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the obstinate Criticks, whose Business is to find Fault, if not by a loose and gross Imagination to create them, for they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find the Jest, or make it; and those of this sort fall to my share, they find Faults of another kind for the Men Writers. And this one thing I will venture to say, though against my Nature, because it has a Vanity in it: That had the Plays I have writ come forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Mans Name, and never known to have been mine; I appeal to all unbyast Judges of Sense, if they had not said that Person had made as many good Comedies, as any one Man that has writ in our Age; but a Devil on't the Woman damns the Poet.</p>
            <p>Ladies, for its further Justification to you, be pleas'd to know, that the first Copy of this Play was read by several Ladys of very great Quality, and unquestioned Fame, and received their most favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opinion, not one charging it with the Crime, that some have been pleas'd to find in the Acting. Other Ladys who saw it more than once, whose Quality and Vertue can sufficiently justifie any thing they design to favour, were pleas'd to say, they found an Entertainment in it very far from scandalous; and for the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Town, I found by my Receipts it was not thought so Criminal. However, that shall not be an Incouragement to me to trouble the Criticks with new Occasion of affronting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring at least to divert; and at this rate, both the few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>oets that are left, and the Players who toil in vain, will be weary of their Trade.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit to tell you, that a Wit of the Town, a Friend of mine at <hi>Wills</hi> Coffee House, the first Night of the Play, cry'd it down as much as in him lay, who before had read it and assured me he never saw a prettier Comedy. So complaisant one pestilent Wit will be to another, and in the full Cry make his Noise too; but since 'tis to the witty Few I speak, I hope the better Judges will take no Offence, to whom I am oblig'd for better Judgments; and those I hope will be so kind to me, knowing my Conversation not at all addicted to the Indecencys alledged, that I would much less practice
<pb facs="tcp:40161:5"/>
it in a Play, that must stand the Test of the censuring World. And I must want common Sense, and all the Degrees of good Manners, renouncing my Fame, all Modesty and Interest for a silly Sawcy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

All I ask, is the Priviledge for my Masculine Part the Poet in me, (if any such you will allow me) to tread in those successful Paths my Predecessors have so long thriv'd in, to take those Measures that both the Ancient and Modern Writers have set me, and by which they have pleas'd the World so well. If I must not, because of my Sex, have this Freedom, but that-you will u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp all to your selves I lay down my Quill, and you shall hear no more of me, no not so much as to make Comparisons, because I will be kinder to my brothers of the Pen, than they have been to a desenceless Woman; for I am no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <l>How briskly dear Variety you pursue;</l>
               <l>Nay though for worse ye change, ye will have New.</l>
               <l>Widdows take heed, some of you in fresh Youth</l>
               <l>Have been th' unpity'd Martyrs of this Truth.</l>

               <l>Tho you shou'd change them oftener than your Fashions,</l>

                     <p>Pity, hang him Rogue, 'sbobs, and all the young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the Town deserve it; we can never keep our Wives and Daughters honest for rampant young Dogs; and an old Fellow cannot put in amongst 'em, under being undone, with Presenting, and the Devil and all.

               <l>Than be Fop-mangl'd under colour of Wit.</l>

               <l>Hear me ye Scribling Beaus,—</l>
               <l>Why will you in shier Rhime, without one stroke</l>
               <l>Of Poetry, Lady's just Disdain provoke,</l>
               <l>And address Songs, to whom you never spoke.</l>
               <l>In doleful Hymns for dying Fellons fit,</l>
               <l>Why do you tax their Eyes, and blame their Wit?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:40161:42"/>
Vnjustly of the Inn'cent you complain,</l>
               <l>'Tis Bulkers give, and Tubs must cure your Pain.</l>
               <l>Why in Lampoons will you your selves revile?</l>
               <l>'Tis true, none else will think it worth their wh ile:</l>
               <l>But thus you're hid! oh, 'tis a Politick Fetch:</l>
               <l>So some have hang'd themselves, to ease <hi>Jack Ketch.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Justly your Friends and Mistresses you blame,</l>
               <l>For being so they well deserve the Shame,</l>
               <l>'Tis the worst Scandal to have born that Nam</l>
               <l>At Poetry of late, and such whose Skill <note place="margin">See the late Satyr on Poetry.</note>

               <l>Excels your own, you dart a feeble Quill;</l>
               <l>Well may you rail at what you Ape so ill.</l>
               <l>With vertuous Women, and all Men of Worth,</l>
               <l>You're in a state of Mortal War by Birth.</l>
               <l>Nature in all her Atome Fights ne'er knew</l>
               <l>Two things so opposite as Them and You.</l>
               <l>On such your Muse her utmost Fury spends,</l>
               <l>They'r slander'd worse than any but your Friends.</l>
               <l>More Years may teach you better, the mean while,</l>
               <l>If you can't mend your Morals, mend your Stile.</l>
