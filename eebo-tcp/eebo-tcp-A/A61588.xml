            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But it is a part of her present <hi>Felicity,</hi> that they are ashamed of that insulting Question, <hi>What is become of your Church now?</hi> and are driven back to their old
<pb facs="tcp:101069:3"/>
impertinency, <hi>Where was your Church before</hi> Luther? They might as well alter the date of it, and ask Where she was before your <hi>Majesties</hi> restauration? For as she only suffered an <hi>Eclipse</hi> in the late confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; no more did she, though of a longer stay, in the times before the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And it was her great <hi>Honour,</hi> that she was not awakened out of it (as of old they fancied) by the <hi>beating</hi> of <hi>drums,</hi> or the rude <hi>clamours</hi> of the <hi>people</hi>; but as she Gradually regained her <hi>light,</hi> so it was with the <hi>Influence</hi> of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority.</hi> Which hath caused so close an union and combination of <hi>Interests</hi> between them, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> have like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>Twins</hi> both <hi>wept</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd</hi> together. And nothing doth more argue the excellent constitution of our <hi>Church,</hi> than that therein the purity of <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> is joyned with the most hearty Acknowledgment of your <hi>Majesties Power</hi> and <hi>Supremacy.</hi> So that the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of the members of it, can neither be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of private Interest, or of depending on the pleasure of a Forreign <hi>Bishop,</hi> but is inlaid in the very <hi>Foundations</hi> of our <hi>Reformation.</hi> Which stands on those two <hi>Grand Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> The <hi>giving to God the things that are God's, and to</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesar's. And as long as these two remain unshaken, we need not fear the continuance and flourishing of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and your <hi>Majesties
<pb facs="tcp:101069:3"/>
Interest</hi> in the members of it. Which it is hard to conceive those can have any zeal for, who are the busie <hi>Factours</hi> among us for promoting so opposite an <hi>Interess</hi> as that of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For what a contradiction is it, to suppose it consistent with your <hi>Majesties Honour</hi> and <hi>Interess,</hi> to rob your <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of one of the richest <hi>Jewels</hi> of it, to expose Your <hi>Royal Scepter</hi> to the <hi>mercy</hi> of a <hi>Forreign Prelat,</hi> to have another <hi>Supreme Head</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within Your <hi>Dominions,</hi> and thereby to cut off the dependence of a considerable part of the Nation wholly from <hi>Your Self,</hi> and to exhaust the <hi>Nation</hi> of an Infinite <hi>Mass</hi> of <hi>Treasure</hi> meerly to support the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> They who can make men believe that these things tend to <hi>Your Majesties</hi> Service, think they have gained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a considerable step to their <hi>Religion,</hi> which is by baffling mens reason, and perswading them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve contradictions. But if, notwithstanding the received principles of their <hi>Church,</hi> any have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Faithful in their Loyalty to <hi>Your Majesty,</hi> we have much more cause to attribute it to their <hi>Love</hi> to their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> than to their <hi>Religion.</hi> We deny not, but there may be such rare tempers which may conquer the <hi>malignity</hi> of <hi>poison,</hi> but it would be a dangerous <hi>Inference</hi> from thence, that it ought not to be accounted hurtful to humane nature. If any such have been truly <hi>Loyal,</hi> may they continue so, and their number increase: and
<pb facs="tcp:101069:4"/>
since therein they so much come off from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, we hope they may yet come nearer to us, whose <hi>Religion</hi> tends as much to the settling the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sure <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> as theirs doth to the weakning of them. And were this the only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie between us, there need not many Books be written to perswade men of the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>But if these men may be believed, we can as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle please <hi>God</hi> on the principles of our <hi>Church,</hi> as they <hi>Your Majesty</hi> on the principles of theirs. A strange Assertion! and impossible to be entertain'd by any, but those who think there is no such way to please <hi>God,</hi> as to renounce the judgement of Sense and Reason. And then indeed we freely confess, there are none so likely to do it, as themselves. With whom men are equally bound to believe the greatest <hi>repugnancies</hi> to sense and reason, with the most <hi>Fundamental Verities</hi> of <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> As though no <hi>Faith</hi> could carry men to Heaven, but that which can, not only <hi>remove,</hi> but <hi>swallow Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> Yet these are the persons who pretend to make our Faith <hi>Infallible,</hi> while they undermine the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of it, as they advance <hi>Charity</hi> by denying <hi>Salvation</hi> to all but themselves, and promote true <hi>Piety</hi> by their gross <hi>Superstitions.</hi> By all which they have been guilty of <hi>debauching Christianity</hi> in so high a measure, that it cannot but heartily grieve those who honour it as the most excellent <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the World, to see its <hi>beauty</hi> so much <hi>clouded</hi>

by the <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Superstitions</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That these are <hi>great</hi> as well as <hi>sad truths,</hi> is the design of the ensuing Book to discover.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now about a twelvemonth, since there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the world a Book, under the Title of <hi>Dr. Lawd's Labyrinth</hi>; but, with the usual sincerity of those persons, pretended to be Printed some years before. It is not the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Preface to enquire, Why if Printed then, it remained so long unpublished, but to acquaint the Reader with the scope and design of that Book, and of this which comes forth as a Reply to it. There are three things mainly in dispute between us, and those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> Whether they, or we, give the more satisfactory account of the <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Faith?</hi> Whether their <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>ours,</hi> be guilty of the charge of <hi>Schism?</hi> And, Whether their <hi>Church</hi> be justly accused by us of introducing many <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Superstitions</hi>? In the handling of these, all our present Debate consists; and therefore, for the greater Advantage of the Reader, I have distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the whole into three distinct parts: which I thought more commodious, than carrying it on in one continued dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. And, lest our <hi>Adversaries</hi> should complain, that we still proceed in a destructive way, I have not only endeavoured to lay open the palpable weakness of their Cause, but to give a rational account of our own Doctrine in opposition to theirs. Which I have especially done in the great Controversie of the
<pb facs="tcp:101069:6"/>
               <hi>Resolution</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as being the most difficult and important of any other. I hope the Reader will have no cause to blame me for false or impertinent Allegations of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> since it hath been so much my business to discover the fraud of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> in that particular: which I have chiefly done from the scope and design of those very Books, out of which their testimonies are produced. In many of the particular Differences, I have made use of several of their late Writers against themselves; both to let them see, how much <hi>Popery</hi> begins to grow weary of it self; and, how unjustly they condemn us for denying those things, which the moderate and rational men of their own side dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, and dispute against as well as we; and chiefly to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world, as to their great pretence of <hi>Unity</hi> among themselves. Since their Divisions are grown to so great a height both at home, and in foreign parts, that the dissenting parties mutually charge each other with <hi>Heresie,</hi> and that about their great <hi>Foundation</hi> of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Popes Infallibility</hi>; The <hi>Jansenists</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and a growing party in <hi>England,</hi> charging the <hi>Jesuits</hi> with <hi>Heresie</hi> in asserting it, as they do them with the same for denying it. As to my self, I only declare, that I have with freedom and impartiality enquired into the Reasons on both sides, and no interest hath kept me from letting that side of the ballance fall, where I saw the greater weight of reason. In which respect, I have been so far from dissembling the force of any of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> Arguments, that if I could add greater weight to them, I have done it; being as unwilling to abuse my self as the world. And therefore I have not only consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their greatest Authours, especially the three famous <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Baronius, Bellarmin,</hi> and <hi>Perron</hi>; but the chiefest of those, who, under the name of <hi>Conciliators,</hi> have put the fairest Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish on the Doctrine of that <hi>Church.</hi> However, I have kept close to my <hi>Adversary,</hi> and followed him through all his windings, from which I return with this satisfaction to my self, that I have vindicated his <hi>Lordship</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> together. As to the style and way of writing I use, all that I have to say, is, that my design hath been to joyn clearness of Expression, with evidence of <hi>Reason.</hi> What success I have had in it, must be left to the Readers judgement; I only desire him to lay aside <hi>prejudice</hi> as much in judging, as I have done in writing; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I despair of his doing me right, and of my doing him good. For, though reason be tractable and ingenuous, yet prejudice and interest are invincible things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101069:6"/>Having done thus much by way of Preface, I shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thee longer, by a particular Answer to the impertinencies of our <hi>Authours</hi> Preface, since there is nothing contained therein, but what is abundantly answered in a more proper place. And I cannot think it reasonable to abuse so much the Readers <hi>Appetite,</hi> as to give him a tedious <hi>Preface</hi> to cloy his stomach. If any, after perusal of the whole, shall think fit to return an Answer, if they do it fairly and rationally, they shall receive the same civility; if with clamour and impertinency, I only let them know, I have not leisure enough to kill <hi>Flyes,</hi> though they make a troublesome noise. If any service be done to <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> by this present work, next to that <hi>Divine Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> through which I have done it, thou owest it to those great Pillars of our <hi>Church,</hi> by whose command and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement I undertook it. Who the Authour was of the Book I answer, I have been the less solicitous to enquire, because I would not betray the weakness of my cause, by mixing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal matters in debates of so great importance. And, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be now living, or dead, I suppose our <hi>Adversaries</hi> cannot think it at all material, unless they judge that their Cause doth live and dye with him.</p>

                     <label>THe Question of Schism explained. The nature of it enquired into. Several general Principles laid down for clearing the present Controversie. Three grounds of the charge of Schism on Protestant Churches by our Authour. The first, of the Roman Churches being the Catholick Church, entred upon. How far the Roman Church may be said to be a true Church. The distinction of a Church mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and metaphysically true, justified. The grounds of the Unity of the Catholick Church, as to Doctrine and Government. Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi>'s distinction of the formal, causal, and participative Catholick Church examined. The true sense of the Catholick Church in Antiquity manifested from S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and several cases happening in his time: as, the Schism of <hi>Novatianus</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> the case of <hi>Felicissimus</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus.</hi> Several other Instances out of Antiquity to the same purpose, by all which it is manifest, that the Unity of the Catholick Church had no dependence on the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The several Testimonies to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom, John</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantiople,</hi> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, Optatus,</hi> &amp;c. particularly examined; and all found short of proving that the Roman Church is the Catholick Church. The several Answers of his Lordship to the Testimonies of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,</hi> S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> about the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> justified. From all which it appears, that the making the Roman Church to be the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, is a great Novelty, and perfect Jesuitism.</label>

How far our Church, in reforming her self, condemns the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope's equality with other Patriarchs, asserted. The Arabick Canons of the Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil proved to be supposititious. The Polity of the Ancient Church discovered from the sixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Rights of Primats and Metropolitans settled by it. The suitableness of the Ecclesiastical, to the Civil Government. That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had then a limitted Jurisdiction within the suburbicary Churches; as Primate of the <hi>Roman</hi> Diocese. Of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Priviledge; that it was not peculiar, but common to all Primats of Dioceses. Of the Pope's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy according to the Canons, how far pertinent to our dispute. How far the Pope's Confirmation requisite to new elected Patriarchs. Of the Synodical and Communicatory Letters. The testimonies of <hi>Petrus de Marc√¢</hi> concerning the Pope's Power of confirming and deposing Bishops. The Instances brought for it, considered. The case of <hi>Athanasius</hi> being restored by <hi>Julius,</hi> truly stated. The proceedings of <hi>Constantine</hi> in the case of the Donatists cleared, and the evidence thence against the Pope's Supremacy. Of the Appeals of Bishops to <hi>Rome,</hi> how far allowed by the Canons of the Church. The great case of Appeals between the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Bishops discussed. That the Appeals of Bishops were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, as well as those of the inferiour Clergy. <hi>T.

The case of <hi>Wilfrids</hi> Appeal answered. The Primacy of <hi>England</hi> not derived from <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Grant to <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk.

                     <label>HOw far this tends to the ending Controversies. Two distinct Questions concerning the Infallibility and Authority of General Councils. The first entred upon, with the state of the Question. That there can be no certainty of faith, that General Councils are Infallible; nor, that the particular decrees of any of them are so: which are largely proved. <hi>Pighius</hi> his Arguments against the Divine Institution of General Councils. The places of Scripture considered, which are brought for the Churches Infallibility, and that these cannot prove that General Councils are so: <hi>Matth. 18.20. Act. 15.28.</hi> particularly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The sense of the Fathers in their high expressions of the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. No consent of the Church as to their Infallibility. The place of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> about the amendment of former General Councils by latter, at large vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated. No other place in St. <hi>Austin</hi> prove them Infallible, but many to the contrary. General Councils cannot be Infallible in the conclusion, if not in the use of the means. No such Infallibility without as immediate a Revelation as the Prophets and Apostles had: taking Infallibility not for an absolute unerring Power, but such as comes by a promise of Divine Assistance preserving from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. No obligation to internal assent, but from immediate Divine Authority. Of the consistency of Faith and Reason in things propounded to be believed. The suitableness of the contrary Doctrine to the Romanists principles.</label>

                     <label>The denying the Infallibility of General Councils takes not away their Vse and Authority. Of the submission due to them by all particular persons. How far external obedience is required in case they erre. No violent opposition to he made against them. Rare Inconveniencies hinder not the effect of a just power. It cannot rationally be supposed, that such General Councils as are here meant should often or dangerously erre. The true notion of a General Council explained. The Freedom requisite in the proceedings of it. The Rule it must judge by Great Difference between external obedience, and internal as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Decrees of Councils. This latter unites men in errour, not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. As great uncertainties supposing General Councils Infallible as not. Not so great certainty requisite for submission as Faith. Whether the Romanists Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Infallibility of Councils, or ours, tend more to the Churches peace? St. <hi>Austin</hi> explained. The Keyes according to him given to the Church. No unremediable inconvenience supposing a General Council erre. But errours in Faith are so, supposing them Infallible when they are not. The Church hath power to reverse the Decrees of General Councils. The power of Councils not by Divine Institution. The unreasonableness of making the Infallibility of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils depend on the Popes Confirmation. No consent among the Romanists about the subject of Infallibility, whether in Pope or Councils. No evidence from Scripture, Reason, or Antiquity, for the Popes personal Infallibility.</label>

Sacramental actions sufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from others without the Priests Intention. Of the moral assurance of the Priests Intention, and the insufficiency of a meer virtual Intention. The Popes confirmation of Councils supposeth personal Infallibility. Transubstantiation an errour decreed by Pope and Council. The repugnancy of it to the grounds of Faith. The Testimonies brought for it out of Antiquity examin'd at large, and shewed to be far from proving Transubstantiation. Communion in one kind a violation of Christs Institution.

The occasion of the Conference about the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The rise of the dispute about the Greek Church, and the consequences from it. The charge of Heresie against the Greek Church examined, and she found, Not-guilty, by the concurrent testimony of Fathers, General Councils, and Popes. Of the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> and the proceedings there; That Council neither General nor Free. The distinction of Ancient and Modern Greeks disproved. The debate of the <hi>Filioque</hi> being inserted into the Creed. The time when and the right by which it was done, discussed. The rise of the Schism between the Eastern and Western Churches, mainly occasioned by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, if possible, the imputation of that fault on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their Accusers, which they are most lyable to be charged with themselves, is the great Artifice made use of by you in the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Designe</hi> of your <hi>Book.</hi> For there being nothing which your Party is more justly accused for, than involving and perplexing the grounds of Christian Faith under a pretext of Infallibility in your Church, you thought you could not better avoid the <hi>odium</hi> of it, then by a confident recrimination: And from hence it is that you call his Lordships Book a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> and pretend to discover his <hi>abstruse turnings, ambiguous wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and <hi>intricate Meanders,</hi> as you are pleased to stile them. But those who will take the pains to search your Book for the <hi>discoveries</hi> made in it, will find themselves little satisfied but only in <hi>these,</hi> that no cause can be so bad, but interessed persons will plead for it; and no writing so clear and exact, but a perplexed mind will imagine nothing but <hi>Meanders</hi> in it. And if dark passages and intricate windings, if obscure sense and perplexed consequences, if uncertain wandrings and frequent self-contradictions may make a writing be call'd a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> I know no Modern <hi>Artist</hi> who comes so near the skill of the <hi>Cretan Artificer</hi> as your self. Neither is this meerly your own fault; but, the nature of the <hi>cause</hi> whose defence you have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101069:13"/>
espoused, is such, as will not admit of being handled in any other manner. For you might assoon hope to perswade a Traveller that his nearest and safest way was through such a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> as that of <hi>Creet,</hi> as convince us that the best and surest Resolution of our Faith is into your <hi>Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi> And while you give out, that all other grounds of <hi>Christian Faith</hi> are uncertain, and yet are put to such miserable shifts in defence of your own, instead of establishing the Faith of <hi>Christians,</hi> you expose <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> it self to the scorn and contempt of <hi>Atheists</hi>; who need nothing more to confirm them in their <hi>Infidelity,</hi> then such a senseless and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable way of proceeding as you make use of, for laying the Foundations of <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> Your great Principle being, that no Faith can be Divine, but what is Infallible; and none Infallible, but what is built on a Divine and Infallible Testimony; and that this Testimony is only that of the present Catholick Church; and that Church none but yours: and yet after all this you dare not say the Testimony of your Church is <hi>Divine,</hi> but only <hi>in a sort</hi> and <hi>after a manner.</hi> You pretend that our Faith is vain and uncertain, because built only on Moral certainty and Rational evidence; and yet you have no other proof for your Churches Infallibility, but the motives of credibility. You offer to prove the Churches Infallibility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently on <hi>Scripture</hi>; and yet challenge no other Infallibility but what comes by the promise and assistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on the Truth of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> You seek to disparage <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> on purpose to advance your <hi>Churches Authority,</hi> and yet bring your greatest evidences of the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> from it. By which <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> you often tell us that <hi>Christian Religion</hi> can only be proved to be Infallibly true, when if but one errour be found in your <hi>Church,</hi> her Infallible Testimony is gone, and what becomes then of <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> And all this is managed with a peculiar regard to the Interest of <hi>your Church,</hi> as the only <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which you can never attempt to prove but upon supposition of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the belief of which yet you say depends upon your <hi>Churches</hi> being the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> These, and many other such as these, will be found the rare and coherent Principles of your Faith and Doctrine, which I have here only given this taste of, that the Reader may see with what honour to your self and advantage to your Cause, you have bestowed the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Labyrinth</hi> on his <hi>Lordships Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet you might be pardonable, if rather through the weakness of your Cause than your ill management of it, you had brought us into these amazing <hi>Labyrinths</hi>; if you had left us any thing whereby we might hope to be safely directed in our passage through them: Whereas you not only endeavour to put men out of the True way, but use your greatest industry to keep them from a possibility of returning into it: by not only sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting false Principles to them, but decrying the use of those things which should discover their falsity. For although the judgement of sense were that which the <hi>Apostles</hi> did appeal to <hi>(that which we have seen and heard‚Äî declare we unto you)</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.1, 3.</note> although that were the greatest and surest evidence to them of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; although <hi>Christ</hi> himself <hi>condemned them for their unbelief and hardness of heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 16.14.</note> 
                  <hi>because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen</hi>; yet according to your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples men must have a care of relying on the judgement of sense in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, lest perchance they should not believe that great <hi>Affront</hi> to humane Nature, the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> Neither are men
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101069:13"/>
only deprived of the judgement of sense, but of the concurrent use of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi>; for these are pretended to be uncertain, fallible, nay, dangerous without the Churches Infallibility: So that the short of your grounds of establishing Faith, is, If we will find our way, we must renounce the judgement of sense and reason, submit our selves and <hi>Scripture</hi> to an <hi>Infallible Guide,</hi> and then you tell us we cannot miss of our way; when it is impossible for us to know our <hi>Guide,</hi> without the use of those things which we are bid to renounce. These things laid together make us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire more at your <hi>confidence</hi> than <hi>invention</hi> in making the current title of your Book to be <hi>Dr. Lawd's Labyrinth,</hi> in which it is hard to say, whether your immodesty or blindness be the greater.</p>
               <p>But as though you were the only <hi>Heroes</hi> for asserting the <hi>Christian Cause,</hi> and all others but more <hi>subtle betrayers</hi> of it,<note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> you begin your Book with a most ingenious comparison <hi>of the learned labours of those of your Church to the stately Temple of</hi> Solomon; <hi>and the artificial but pestiferous works of all Heretical Authors</hi> (i. e. all but your selves) <hi>to Labyrinths and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Dungeons.</hi> In which only your discretion is to be commended,<note place="margin">P. 1.</note> in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this at the entrance of your Book; for whosoever looks but further into it, and compares it with that you pretend to answer, will not condemn the choice of your Similitudes, but your forgetfulness in misapplying them. But it matters not what titles you give to the books of our <hi>Authors,</hi> unless you were better able to confute them: and if no other book of any late <hi>Protestant</hi> Writer hath been any more discovered to be <hi>of this intangling nature,</hi> than this of his Lordship (whom you call <hi>our grand Author</hi>) is by you, you may very justly say of them as you do in the next words, <hi>they are very liable to the same Reproach</hi>:<note place="margin">P. 2.</note> In which we commend your inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, that when you had so lately disparaged our Authors and Writings, you so suddenly wipe off those <hi>Aspersions</hi> again by giving them the deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved name of <hi>Reproaches.</hi> When you say his Lordships Book <hi>is most arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially composed,</hi> we have reason to believe so fair a Testimony from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Adversary; but when notwithstanding this you call it a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> we can interpret it only as a fair plea for your not being able to answer it. And who can blame you for calling that a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> in which you have so miserably lost your self? but, in pity to you, and justice to the cause I have undertaken, I shall endeavour with all kindness and fairness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you out of your strange entanglements into the plain and easie paths of Truth; which I doubt not to effect by your own Clew <hi>of Scripture and Tradition,</hi> by which you may soon discover what a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> you were in your self, when you had thought to have made <hi>directive Marks</hi> (as you call them) for others to avoid it.</p>
               <p>To omit therefore any further preface,<note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> I shall wait upon you to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; the first of which is, <hi>the Occasion of the Conference,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>which</hi> (you say) <hi>was for the satisfaction of an honourable Lady, who having heard it granted in a former Conference, that there must be a continual visible company ever since Christ teaching unchanged doctrine, in all points necessary to salvation; and finding</hi> (it seems) <hi>in her own reason that such a company or Church must not be fallible in its teaching, was in quest of a Continual, Visible, Infallible Church, as not thinking it fit for unlearned persons to judge of particular do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinals, but to depend on the judgement of the true Church.</hi> The Question then was not concerning a <hi>Continual</hi> and <hi>Visible Church,</hi> which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge was granted, but concerning such a <hi>Church</hi> as must be <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> in all she teaches, (and, if she be infallible, according to your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101069:14"/>
of Fundamentals, whatever she teaches is necessary to salvation) which that <hi>Lady</hi> thought necessary to be first determined, because, saith <hi>Mr. Fisher, It was not for her, or any other unlearned persons, to take upon them to judge of particulars, without depending upon the judgement of the true Church</hi>; which seeming to allow of some use of our own judgement, supposing the Churches Authority, you pervert into these words, <hi>Not thinking it fit to judge, &amp;c. but to depend, &amp;c.</hi> But let them be as they will, unless you gave greater reason for them, it is not material which way they pass. For his <hi>Lordship</hi> had returned a sufficient Answer to that pretence (which you are content to take no notice of) in saying <hi>That it is very fit the people should look to the judgement of the Church before they be too busie with particulars.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 2. sect. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>But yet neither Scripture, nor any good Authority denyes them some moderate use of their own understanding and judgement, especially in things familiar and evident, which even ordinary capacities may as easily understand as read. And therefore some particulars a Christian may judge without depending.</hi> To which <hi>you,</hi> having nothing to say, run post to the business of <hi>Infallibility:</hi> for when it was said, <hi>The Lady desired to rely on an Infallible Church, therein,</hi> his Lordship says, <hi>neither the Jesuite nor the Lady her self spake very advisedly:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 3. sect. 3. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>For an Infallible Church denotes a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, in that it is set in opposition to some other particular Church that is not infallible.</hi> Here now you begin your discoveries: for you tell us, <hi>he makes this his first crook in his projected Labyrinth; which is apparent to any man that has eyes, even without the help of a Perspective.</hi> As seldome as <hi>Perspectives</hi> are used to discern the turns of <hi>Labyrinths,</hi> nothing is so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as that your eyes or your judgement were not very good when you used this expression. For I pray, what <hi>crook</hi> or <hi>turn</hi> is there in that, when a <hi>Lady</hi> demanded an <hi>Infallible Church</hi> to her <hi>guide,</hi> to say, that by that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion she supposeth <hi>some particular Church</hi> as distinct from, and opposite to others, to be <hi>infallible.</hi> No, say you, <hi>she sought not any one particular Church infallible, in opposition to another Church not infallible; but some Church, such as might without danger of errour direct her in all doctrinal points of Faith.</hi> Rarely well distinguish'd! Not <hi>any</hi> particular Church, but <hi>some</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church. For if she enquired after <hi>some Church, which, without danger of errour, might direct her in all doctrinal points of Faith,</hi> doth she not thereby imply, that some other Church might bring her into danger of errour under pretence of directing her in matters of Faith? and if this be <hi>some particular fallible Church,</hi> the other must be <hi>some particular infallible Church?</hi> And is it possible to conceive some Church that may erre in directing, and some other that may not erre, without some particular Church being taken in opposition to some other Church? But you would fain perswade us that the force of his Lordships Argument rests wholly <hi>upon the importance of the particle</hi> a <hi>or</hi> an, <hi>which cannot be applyed but to particulars,</hi> which you very learnedly disprove: whereas the main strength of what his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship says, depends upon the nature of the question, and the manner of proposing it. For the <hi>Lady</hi> enquiring after such a <hi>Church</hi> whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she might relye on as to the matters in dispute in the Christian world, must mean such a <hi>Church</hi> whose communion must be known as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from other <hi>Churches</hi> which are <hi>not infallible</hi>; for otherwise she might be deceived still. And if you give a pertinent answer to her question, you must shew her some such <hi>Church</hi> as an <hi>Infallible Guide,</hi> which can be no other in this case, but some particular Church considered as distinct from others. For a general answer concerning the Infallibility of the <hi>Catholick
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101069:14"/>
Church,</hi> without shewing how the Infallible judgement of that <hi>Church</hi> may be known, can by no means reach the case in hand: which doth not meerly respect an Infallibility in the subject, but such an infallibility as may be a <hi>sufficient guide in all doctrinal points of Faith.</hi> When you say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>she meant no other then the Vniversal visible Church of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 3</note> you must tell us how the <hi>Vniversal visible Church</hi> can become such an <hi>Infallible guide</hi> in the matters in Controversie between those <hi>Churches,</hi> which yet are <hi>members</hi> of that <hi>Vniversal visible Church.</hi> For the notion of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church</hi> not being in its nature confined to any one of these parties, but all of them concurring to the making of it up, can no more be an <hi>Infallible guide</hi> in the <hi>matters in difference,</hi> then the common notion of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> can direct us in judging what Beings are <hi>sensitive</hi> and what <hi>rational.</hi> Therefore though you would fain deceive the world under a pretence of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> yet nothing can be more evident, then that in the question what <hi>Church</hi> must be a <hi>guide in Doctrinal points of Faith,</hi> it must be understood of some <hi>Church</hi> as distinct from other <hi>Churches</hi> which ought not to be relyed on as infallible guides. But the subtilty of this is, that when you challenge <hi>Infallibility</hi> to your <hi>Church,</hi> we should not apprehend her as a <hi>particular Church,</hi> but as the <hi>true Catholick Church,</hi> which is a thing so every way absurd and unreasonable, that you had need use the greatest <hi>Artifice's</hi> to disguise it, which yet can deceive none but such as are resolved to be deceived by them. For any one <hi>who had his eyes in his head might discern without a Perspective,</hi> as you speak, that <hi>Churches</hi> of several and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Communions from each other were placed in competition for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility:</hi> For Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi>'s next words are. The Question was, <hi>Which was that Church?</hi> Do you think he means, Which was that <hi>Vniversal visible Church?</hi> Certainly not: for the nature of the Question supposes several <hi>Churches:</hi> now I think you do not believe, there are several <hi>Vniversal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Churches.</hi> And it immediately follows, <hi>A Friend of the Ladies would needs defend that not only the Roman, but the Greek Church was right</hi>; to which Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> answers, <hi>That the Greek Church had erred in matter of doctrine.</hi> Can any thing be more plain then that this <hi>Question</hi> doth relate to <hi>Churches</hi> considered severally and as under distinct Communions and Denominations. And therefore notwithstanding your pittiful pretences to the contrary, this Question can be no otherwise understood then, as his Lordship said, <hi>of some particular Infallible Church, in opposition to some other particular Church which is not Infallible.</hi> And if you judge this <hi>an affected mistake</hi> as you call it, <hi>your discerning faculty</hi> will be as lyable to Question as your Churches Infallibility.</p>
               <p>That you might seem to avoid the better the force of his Lordships following discourse against <hi>Bellarmine</hi> about the Infallibility of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; you first tell us,<note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is sufficient for a Catholick to believe that there is an Infallibility in the Church, without further obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to examine whether the particular Church of Rome be infallible or no.</hi> Which is an egregious piece of Sophistry. For, put case a man believes the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of <hi>all Ages</hi> Infallible, but not of <hi>any one particular Age</hi> since the <hi>Apostles</hi> times; suppose a man believe the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age</hi> Infallible, but not of <hi>any one particular Communion</hi> but as it takes in those common truths wherein they are all agreed; will you say this is sufficient for a <hi>Catholick</hi> to believe without obligation to examine further? If you will, speak it out, and, I dare say, you shall not have much thanks at <hi>Rome</hi> when you have done it. But the mysterie is, If a man believes the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101069:15"/>
                  <hi>Roman Church</hi> only, to be the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> it is no matter whether he enquires whether the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> be only at <hi>Rome</hi> or no. It is not the place, but the communion of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> which is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after in the question of <hi>Infallibility</hi>; although I cannot see but those places out of the <hi>Fathers</hi> which are produced to prove the <hi>Roman Church</hi> Infallible, will hold for the continuance of that Infallibility in that particular place of <hi>Rome.</hi> For St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith expresly of the <hi>Romans,</hi>

Church,</hi> when yet you have no way to discern which is so much as a <hi>true Church,</hi> but by examining the <hi>doctrine</hi> of it. So that of necessity the rule of Faith and Doctrine must be certainly known, before ever any one can with safety depend upon the judgement of any <hi>Church.</hi> For having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved that there can be no other meaning of the Question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Church,</hi> as here stated, but with relation to <hi>some particular Church</hi> to whose Communion the party enquiring might joyn, and whose judgement might be relyed on; we see it presently follows in the debate, <hi>Which was that Church</hi>; and it seems, as is said already, <hi>a Friend of the Ladies undertook to defend that the Greek Church was right.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> answers, <hi>That the Greek Church had plainly changed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 21. sect. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and taught false in a point of Doctrine concerning the Holy Ghost:</hi> and after repeats it, <hi>that it had erred.</hi> Before I come to examine how you make good the charge you draw up against the poor <hi>Greek Church</hi> in making it <hi>erre funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,</hi> it is worth our while to consider upon what account this dispute comes in. The Inquiry was concerning the <hi>True Church</hi> on whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one might safely depend in <hi>Religion.</hi> It seems, two were propounded to consideration, the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi>; the <hi>Greek</hi> was rejected <hi>because it had erred:</hi> From whence it follows, that the dispute concerning the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> must necessarily precede <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> For by Mr. <hi>Fishers</hi> confession and your own, <hi>A Church which hath erred cannot be relyed on</hi>; therefore men must be satisfied whether a <hi>Church</hi> hath <hi>erred</hi> or no, before they can judge whether she may be relyed on or no. Which being granted, all the whole <hi>Fabrick</hi> of your Book falls to the ground; for then 1. Men must be <hi>Infallibly certain</hi> of the <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to the <hi>testimony of the Church</hi>; for if they be to judge of a <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they must in order to such a judgement be certain what that <hi>Doctrine</hi> is which they must judge of the <hi>Church</hi> by. 2. No <hi>Church</hi> can be known to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> unless it appear to be so by that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they are to examine the truth of the <hi>Church</hi> by, and therefore no <hi>Church</hi> can be known to be Infallible by the <hi>motives of credibility.</hi> 3. No <hi>Church</hi> ought to be relyed on as <hi>Infallible,</hi> which may be found guilty of any errour by comparing it with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which we are to try it by. Therefore you must first prove your <hi>Church</hi> not to have erred in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; for if she hath, it is impossible she should be Infallible: and not think to prove that she <hi>hath not erred</hi> because <hi>she cannot,</hi> that being the thing in question, and must by your dealing with the <hi>Greek Church</hi> be judged by particulars. 4. There must be a <hi>certain rule of Faith</hi> supposed to have sufficient <hi>Authority</hi> to decide <hi>Controversies</hi> without any dependence upon the <hi>Church.</hi> For, the matter to be judged is the <hi>Church</hi>; and if the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> may and must decide that, Why may it not as well all the rest? 5. Every mans <hi>reason</hi> proceeding according to this <hi>rule of Faith</hi> must be left his <hi>Judge</hi> in <hi>matters of Religion.</hi> And whatever inconveniencies you can imagine to attend upon this they immediately and necessarily follow from your proceeding with the <hi>Greek Church</hi> by excluding her because she hath erred, which while we are in pursuit of a <hi>Church</hi> can be determined by nothing but every ones particular reason. 6. Then <hi>Fundamentals</hi> do not depend upon the <hi>Churches declaration.</hi> For you assert the <hi>Greek Church</hi> to erre fundamentally, and that this may be made appear to one who is seeking after a <hi>Church.</hi> Suppose then I inquire, as the <hi>Lady</hi> did, after a <hi>Church</hi> whose judgement I must absolutely depend on, and some mention the <hi>Greek</hi> and others the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> You tell me, It cannot
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101069:16"/>
be the <hi>Greek, for that hath erred fundamentally.</hi> I inquire how you know, supposing her to erre, that it is a fundamental errour? will you answer me, <hi>because the true Church hath declared it to be a fundamental errour?</hi> but that was it I was seeking for Which that <hi>Church</hi> is, which may declare what errours are fundamental and what not? If you tell me <hi>It is yours,</hi> I may soon tell you, You seem to have a greater kindness for your <hi>Church</hi> then <hi>your self,</hi> and venture to speak any thing for the sake of it. Thus we see how finely you have betrayed your whole Cause in your first onset, by so rude an attempt upon the <hi>Greek Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And truly it was much your concernment, to load her as much as you can: For though she now wants one of the great marks of your <hi>Church</hi> (which yet you know not how long your <hi>Church</hi> may enjoy) <hi>viz. outward splendor and bravery,</hi> yet you cannot deny, but that <hi>Church</hi> was planted by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> enjoyed a continual <hi>Succession</hi> from them, flourished with a number of the <hi>Fathers</hi> exceeding that of yours, had more of the <hi>Councils</hi> of greatest credit in it, and, which is a commendation still to it, it retains more purity under its persecutions then your <hi>Church</hi> with all its <hi>external splendour.</hi>

                     <hi>But she hath erred concerning the Holy Ghost, and therefore hath lost it.</hi> A severe censure which his Lordship rebukes Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> for citing King <hi>James</hi> so boldly for: <hi>but two wayes it may be taken,</hi> he adds. 1. <hi>To lose such assistance as preserves from all errour.</hi> 2.

                     <hi>the whole Latine Church hath decreed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it to be flat Heresie in the Greeks; and they decreed the contrary to be an Heresie in the Latin Church, and both together condemned the opinion of the Grecians as Heretical in a General Council (in</hi> Florentino) <hi>how then bears it any shew of probability, what some few of yesterday (forced to it by an impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of otherwise avoiding the strength of Catholick arguments against them) affirm, that the matter of this Controversie was so small and inconsiderable, that it is not sufficient to produce an Heresie on either side? Is not this to make all the Churches of Christendome for many hundred years quite blind, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves only clear and sharp-sighted? which swelling presumption what spirit it argues, and whence it proceeds, all those who have learn'd from St.</hi> Augustin <hi>that Pride is the mother of Heresie, will easily collect.</hi> I grant this speech of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> to be true; only let it be added, that <hi>Pride is likewise the Mother of making Heresies,</hi> as will appear in this present Controversie; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we, who vindicate the <hi>Greek Church</hi> from <hi>Heresie,</hi> or you who would find the <hi>Bill</hi> against her (to keep her from any rivalship with your Church) be more guilty of <hi>Pride</hi> will be soon discovered; but sure you believe us not only to be <hi>men of yesterday,</hi> but <hi>to know nothing</hi> who should sentence the <hi>Greek Church</hi> for <hi>Heresie</hi> upon such feeble pretences as these are. I know not what <hi>presumption</hi> that can be to say, Men may be too forward on both sides in calling each other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and it may be not so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101069:16"/>
much their <hi>Blindness,</hi> as <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> which may make them do it. But if they will condemn that for <hi>Heresie,</hi> which is not so made appear to be upon any evidence from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> they were not so blind in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining it, as we should be in following their judgement without further examination. <hi>But this was for many hundred years.</hi> The more to blame they, for continuing in so rash judgements so long, if it appear so. But it is well still you tell us, that <hi>as the Latin Church condemned the Greek for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, the Greek condemned the Latin for it too.</hi> And so by your own rule the one was as blind as the other. <hi>But the Latin Church had the right to determine Heresie, and the Greek had not.</hi> This is the question, Which <hi>Church</hi> must be relyed on for judgement? and if they mutually condemn each other, we must have a higher <hi>rule</hi> to judge of both by. <hi>But still, Is it not an Argument, that it is a Heresie of one side or the other, because each party condemns the other of Heresie?</hi> Just as much, as if two men fall out and call each other <hi>Knaves,</hi> it must be granted, that if both be not, yet at least the one of them is so. <hi>Heresie</hi> being grown the <hi>scolding word in Religion</hi>; and no two parties can differ, but they seek to fasten this reproach on each other. If one should bring greater evidence than the other of his <hi>Knavery,</hi> he ought to be more accounted so. No otherwise can it be here; if suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof be brought of Heresie on the one side and not the other, that party may be looked on as more guilty: but still remembring, that the more confident affirmation, the pretence to greater honesty and power, be not taken for the only evidences of it: As I doubt it will appear in our present case. But still suppose, that of two men who have so reproached each other, the one of them being fallen into distress and poverty, and not hoping for relief but from the other person, and he denying it, unless he be content by joynt-consent to be proclaimed <hi>Knave,</hi> which he through his necessity yeilding to, but assoon as that is over declaring on what account they agreed; Must this man be more pittied for his Necessity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for his Knavery? Just such I shall make it appear, that which you call condemning the <hi>Grecians</hi> as <hi>Heretical</hi> in a <hi>General Council</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> to have been and no otherwise.</p>
                  <p>But I come to a closer examination of this Subject to see with what Justice you charge the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> either with <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Schism</hi>;<note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> For both these you accuse it of in this Chapter. Two things were the most in dispute between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Churches,</hi> the one was the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Procession of the Holy Ghost from Father and Son,</hi> the other was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>addition</hi> of the <hi>Fili√≥que</hi> to the <hi>Creed.</hi> And although the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the debates at <hi>Ferrara</hi> would not meddle with the Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Latins</hi> could clear themselves concerning the <hi>addition,</hi> which they said was the main cause of the <hi>Contest</hi> between them; yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to follow your method and handle the other first. Your discourse concerning the first consists of two parts, Proofs and Answers; <hi>Proofs</hi> of their <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Answers</hi> to his Lordships <hi>Arguments</hi> against it. The Proofs are double, the one from <hi>Authority,</hi> the other from <hi>Theological reason.</hi> Through every of these particulars I shall follow you, and from them I doubt not to evince, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are not guilty of the faults you lay to their charge.</p>
                  <p>We have already seen what your Proofs from Authority are; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning one another for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> being condemned by a <hi>General Council.</hi> If I can therefore prove that the <hi>Greeks</hi> opinion was not accounted an <hi>Heresie</hi> before the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and that it did not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101069:17"/>
become a Heresie by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> I shall sufficiently discover the weakness of your Arguments from authority.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That it was not accounted a Heresie before the Council of</hi> Florence; I mean not, that there were no hot-brain'd persons in all the time of the difference, who did not brand the <hi>Greek Church</hi> with <hi>Heresie,</hi> but that it was never accounted a <hi>Heresie,</hi> by any of those whom your selves account the only competent Judges of <hi>Heresie</hi>; and those are either the <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Popes,</hi> or <hi>Councils</hi>: which I prove in their order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it was not accounted Heresie by the <hi>Fathers</hi>; which will be proved by these two things. 1. Because it is very doubtful whether many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> did believe the Procession of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from the <hi>Son</hi> or no. 2. Because those who did believe it, did not condemn those of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> who did not.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is very doubtful whether many of them did believe the <hi>Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son or no</hi>; at least, so far as to make it <hi>an Article of Faith</hi>; for 1.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there are clear testimonies, that they did not account it a thing necessary to be believed:</hi> both because they in terms asserted the nature of this <hi>procession</hi> to be <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> and withall, did as clearly affirm the belief of that, which doth not imply this procession to be sufficient for salvation. 1. <hi>They in terms assert, that the mystery of this Procession is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.</hi> And can you, or any reasonable man, imagine they should make the manner of that <hi>Procession</hi> to be an article of Faith, which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be absolutely beyond our apprehension? I grant, Something sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by them to be <hi>incomprehensible</hi> is made an <hi>article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>: but then it is not <hi>that</hi> which is supposed as <hi>incomprehensible</hi> under that notion, which is made so; but the <hi>thing it self</hi> which may be <hi>incomprehensible</hi>; yet being clearly revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> ought to be believed, notwithstanding that incomprehensibility of it: As the <hi>mystery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> it self, the <hi>Eternal Generation</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Procession</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> from the <hi>Father, &amp;c.</hi> But then I say, these things are such, as are either declared by them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or necessarily consequent from something sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be so. As for instance, supposing the <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Vnity</hi> to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing divinely revealed, whatever is necessarily consequent from that, and is necessary to be believed in order to that, though it be <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> must be believed; as, Supposing these two things clear from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that there is but one true <hi>God,</hi> and that there are <hi>three Persons,</hi> who have the Name, Properties, and Attributes of <hi>God</hi> given to them, though our reason be too short to fathom the manner how these can have three distinct <hi>Subsistences,</hi> and yet but one <hi>Essence,</hi> because our reason (<hi>i. e.</hi> all those conceptions which we have formed in our mind from the observation of things) doth tell us, that <hi>Those things which agree or disagree in a third, agree or disagree one with another</hi>; and from thence it would inferr, that, if the <hi>Father</hi> be <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Son God,</hi> there could be no difference between <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi>; yet this being meerly as to the connexion of two propositions, both of which are supposed distinctly revealed in <hi>Scripture</hi>; we are bound in this case to believe such a <hi>Connexion,</hi> because both parts are equally revealed by an <hi>Infallible Testimony,</hi> though the <hi>Mode</hi> of that <hi>Connexion</hi> be to us <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible:</hi> But it is not so, where neither clear Revelation, nor a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Consequent from something which is divinely revealed doth inforce
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101069:17"/>
our belief of it. As in our present case: Since we suppose it revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are <hi>God,</hi> whatever is necessary to the belief of that, though <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> we ought to believe it: but if there be something without which I may believe the <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and this not clearly asserted in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but is a thing in it self incomprehensible, that cannot be made a necessary article of Faith: Thus that the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth proceed from the <hi>Father seems</hi> necessary on both accounts, as consequent upon the belief of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>Vnity,</hi> and as clearly expressed in <hi>Scripture</hi>: but that the <hi>Spirit</hi> should proceed from <hi>Father and Son</hi> as from <hi>one principle,</hi> that they should communicate in an action proper to their <hi>Subsistences,</hi> and yet be distinguished from each other in those <hi>Subsistences,</hi> and agree only in <hi>Essence,</hi> (and if the <hi>Spirit</hi> proceeds not from their <hi>Subsistences,</hi> but from the <hi>Essence,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> must proceed from it self, because that is common to all three;) these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themselves <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> and not necessary to the belief of the <hi>Divinity</hi> either of <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> nor pretended to be clearly revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> cannot be said to make a necessary article of Faith, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of which must suppose <hi>Heresie.</hi> And therefore that which is the only Objection in this case, is removed, <hi>viz.</hi> that this <hi>Procession</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> is incomprehensible, and yet supposed to be an article of <hi>Faith</hi>; for that I have already shewed is expresly revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>the Spirit doth proceed from the Father.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 15.26.</note> But neither is the procession from the <hi>Son</hi> necessary to the belief of the <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi>; for if it were, it would be as necessary to the <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> that the <hi>Son</hi> should be begotten by the <hi>Spirit</hi>; neither doth it follow from any place of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> for all those places which are usually brought are very capable of such interpretations, as do not at all infer it; from hence then it follows, that those who upon these terms acknowledge this Procession incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, do therein imply that the belief of it is no article necessary to salvation, and therefore the denyal no Heresie.</p>

But that which I insist on is, If this Article of the Procession of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from the <hi>Son</hi> had been by these <hi>Fathers</hi> judged necessary, when had there been a fitter time to insert it, then now, when purposely they added the Procession to the former Creed? And yet we see they did not judge it at all necessary to be insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It may be you will say, it was, <hi>Because the Controversie was not then started concerning the</hi> Filioque; But that can signifie nothing here, because we have already shewed that the <hi>Fathers</hi> themselves spake differently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and looked upon it as a thing not necessary to be known; but the things which were upon the rising of <hi>Hereticks</hi> inserted into the <hi>Creed,</hi> were such as by the <hi>Fathers</hi> were judged and believed as necessary before ever those Hereticks arose; as in the Case here of <hi>Macedonius,</hi> for I hope you will not say it was no Heresie to deny the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> till it was determined in this <hi>Oecumenical Council?</hi> For the <hi>Fathers</hi> never thought that they made Articles of Faith in <hi>Councils,</hi> but only declared themselves and what they believed against the Hereticks which did arise in the <hi>Church:</hi> And therefore that Answer of the <hi>Filioque</hi> not being then controverted comes to nothing.

Concerning the meaning of this Decree, we shall fully enquire when we come to the addition of the <hi>Filioque.</hi> That which I take notice of it now for, is, not only the further ratification of what was in the <hi>Creed</hi> before, and that what was therein contained was as much as was judged necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but an express Decree made against all after-additions; which doth, as fully as a <hi>General Council</hi> could do, declare that nothing else was necessary to be believed, but what was already inserted in the Creed: or else, To what end did they prohibit any further additions? To the like purpose, the fourth <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> determins, <hi>That by no means they would suffer that Faith to be moved which was already defined.</hi>

If they were, were they not Infallible in this Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, That it should not be lawful to add to the <hi>Creed</hi> any thing else but what was in before? were they Infallible in declaring the received <hi>Creed</hi> to be full and sufficient? If they were so, how comes any Article to become necessary, which was not then in the <hi>Creed?</hi> If you say, The <hi>Pope</hi> and another <hi>General Council</hi> have power Infallibly to contradict these, and to say that somewhat else is necessary to be inserted into the <hi>Creed,</hi> and to be believed in order to Salvation; I must content my self with having brought you to the humble confession, that both parts of a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction may be Infallibly determined. Thus we see that the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whether single or joyned, in such <hi>Councils</hi> which are of the greatest Authority in the Christian world, have been so far from believing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining this Article of the <hi>Procession of the Holy Ghost</hi> to be necessary, (which must be, if the denyal of it be a fundamental error) that they have plainly enough expressed and determined the contrary.</p>

                     <hi>That those Testimonies which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of the Fathers, are so far from asserting the necessity of this Article, that the most of them do not evidently prove that they believed it.</hi> For these two Answers the <hi>Greeks</hi> return to them. 1. That they do not assert the Procession of the <hi>Spirit</hi> from the <hi>Son,</hi> but the <hi>consubstantiality</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> with the <hi>Son.</hi> 2.

the <hi>Fathers</hi> in those expressions is only to assert the <hi>consubstantiality</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> because when they used them it was in their disputes with them who denyed it.

                     </note> he wonders at them, that leaving the plain and clear places both of <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> which do (as he saith) so openly proclaim the <hi>Spirit</hi>'s <hi>Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Father only,</hi> they should hope for relief from other obscure places, which are capable of a different interpretation. As from the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which only relates to the <hi>Spirit</hi>'s <hi>manifestation,</hi> and is quite different from the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and so cannot imply his Eternal Procession. Therefore for the clearing the controversie, and giving account of the mistakes in it, he begins with the signification of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which when it is applyed to the <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> is capable of different significations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken either for the several gifts of the Spirit, or for the person of the Spirit; and so, though the word Procession be taken in a peculiar manner for the Eternal Procession of the Spirit, yet it is not only some times at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the bestowing the forementioned gifts, but likewise to the Eternal <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi>; and therefore whenever they meet with the word Procession attributed to the Spirit with a respect to the <hi>Son,</hi> they must not presently infer the Eternal Procession, but the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101069:21"/>
would think, if the belief of this Procession had been a tradition of their Church, or fully expressed in the Writings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> could not be so ignorant or wilful as either not to see this to have been their meaning, or supposing they had seen it to persist in so obstinate a belief of the contrary. I can therefore with advantage return your words back again to you. <hi>It is to be considered, that for many hundred years the whole Greek Church never believed this to be an article of Faith; nay the Fathers were so far from it, that both single and in General Councils they did plainly express the contrary; how then bears it any shew of probability, what some few of yesterday (forced to it by an impossibility of otherwise defending the Power and Infallibility of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church) affirm, that the matter of this Controversie is so great and considerable, that it is sufficient to produce an Heresie on either side? Is not this to make Fathers, and General Councils, and consequently all Christendom for many hundred years, quite blind, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves only clear and sharp-sighted? Which swelling presumption, what spirit it argues, and whence it proceeds, all those who have learnt from reason, if not from</hi> S. Augustine, <hi>That Pride is the Mother of making Heresies in unnecessary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, will easily collect.</hi> Do not you see now, how unadvisedly those words came from you, which with so small variation in the manner of expression, and much greater truth in the matter of it, is restored upon your self?</p>
                  <p>

For which we must consider, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as we have already seen, did speak ambiguously in this matter, yet the first who appears openly and stoutly to have denyed it, was <hi>Theodoret</hi>; which, being the rise of the <hi>Controversie,</hi> must be more carefully enquired into. It appears then, that a <hi>General Council</hi> being summoned by the <hi>Emperour Theodosius</hi> to meet at <hi>Ephesus</hi> concerning the opinions of <hi>Nectorius</hi> which were vehemently opposed, by <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and several <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>Asian Bishops,</hi> who being there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, proceed to the <hi>deposition</hi> of <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Anathematizing</hi> his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, before <hi>Johannes Antiochenus,</hi> and several other <hi>Bishops</hi> who favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Nestorius,</hi> were come to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> When these therefore came and found what had been done by the other <hi>Bishops,</hi> they, being seconded by <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianus</hi> there and the <hi>Court-party</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> assemble apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and proceed on the other side to a deposition and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Memnon,</hi> who were the leaders of all the rest; and these make an <hi>Anti-Synod</hi> to the other, which consisted of persons of several interests and perswasions, some <hi>Pelagians,</hi> some <hi>Nestorians,</hi> and others, more as <hi>Friends</hi> to <hi>Nestorius</hi> than his opinions, as being his <hi>Ancient Familiars</hi> and acquaintance, did joyn with them to prevent his deposition; among which, the chief were <hi>Johannes Antiochenus,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret.</hi> But, before the <hi>Council, Cyril</hi> had published his <hi>twelve Anathema</hi>'s against the opinions of <hi>Nestorius:</hi> to these therefore, not only the <hi>Oriental Bishops</hi> gave an answer, but <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> particularly appoints <hi>Theodoret</hi> to refute them. The <hi>ninth Anathema</hi> of <hi>Cyril</hi> was against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and all others who said, <hi>That Christ used the Holy Ghost as a distinct power from himself, for the working of miracles, and that did not acknowledge him to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                     <hi>and knowing it, will not believe it, he cannot be saved. For there are many things, of which this is one, which being the deeper mysteries of Faith, to the knowledge of which many can attain, but many others cannot, being hindred either through want of age, or capacity; and therefore, as we said before, he that can and will not, shall not be saved.</hi> I pray, Sir, do me the Favour to let me know your judgement, whether this <hi>Pope</hi> were Infallible or no? or, will you acknowledge that he was quite <hi>beside the Cushion,</hi> that is, not <hi>in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dr√¢</hi> when he spake it? What? not then, when Solemn <hi>Legats</hi> were dispatched from a <hi>Council</hi> purposely to know his judgement in a matter of Controversie, which the Church was divided about? If so, the <hi>Pope</hi> shall never be <hi>in Cathedr√¢</hi> but when you will have him; or if he were there, you will surely say, he did not act very Apostolically, when he spake these words. For, can any thing be more plain, then that the <hi>Pope</hi> determins this Article of the <hi>Procession</hi> from the <hi>Son,</hi> to be no necessary Article of Faith: but acknowledgeth it to be one of the deeper <hi>mysteries</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> which none were obliged to believe, but such as could reach to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of; which either want of age in some, capacity in others, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible prejudice in many more, might keep them from the knowledge of? Thus it appears by the <hi>Pope's</hi> judgement, the denyal of this could be no Heresie then, because he declares it, not to be necessary to be believed by all. What now must we think of this <hi>Pope,</hi> if we apply your words to him. <hi>Were all other succeeding ages blind, and this Pope only clear and sharp-sighted? which judgement of his must be called nothing short of swelling presumption</hi>; and if you please St. <hi>Austin shall be quoted for it too,</hi> but it must be in some other place, besides that where he sayes, that <hi>Pride is the Mother of Heresie.</hi> Do you think we can do other then hugely applaud our selves, in seeing you so furiously lay about you, when we know, your first <hi>blows</hi> fall on the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and your second cut off one <hi>Leg</hi> at least of your <hi>Infallible Chair.</hi> Can we have better security against you then the judgement of one of your own <hi>Popes?</hi> may we not well be <hi>accounted blind,</hi> when for our sakes <hi>Infallibility</hi> it self must be so too?

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101069:23"/>
the Doctrine of our Lord Christ, and the Holy Fathers, and we place them in the Society of</hi> Judas. What Article was this, I pray, which the <hi>Pope</hi> is so zealous against? even no other then that <hi>which you account all blind who do not esteem the denyal of it Heresie.</hi> It seems then we have one more added to the number of Heretical <hi>Popes</hi>; for, <hi>Photius</hi> himself could not express more vehemency against this Article then the <hi>Pope</hi> doth, and that when by his <hi>Legats</hi> in a <hi>Council</hi> (therefore <hi>Infallible,</hi> according to you, because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the <hi>Pope</hi>) he had declared himself utterly against the addition of this <hi>Article</hi> to the <hi>Creed.</hi> And instead of accounting them Hereticks who denyed it, you see how much worse then <hi>Hereticks</hi> he accounted them who first added it. So that I wonder, you do not rather account the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of that Article <hi>Heresie,</hi> than the denyal of it. I know well enough, how your party rail here to purpose against <hi>Photius</hi>; but what is all that to the business? Let <hi>Photius</hi> be what he will, Were not the <hi>Popes Legats</hi> present at the <hi>Council?</hi> Did not they confirm the decrees of it? Did not the <hi>Pope</hi> afterwards ratifie it? So that if ever Council were Infallible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Principles, this must be; choose therefore, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish the <hi>Pope's</hi> and <hi>Councils Infallibility,</hi> or else acknowledge that men at one time may be infallibly guilty of violating <hi>Scriptures, Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> for asserting that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which they may be Infallibly guilty of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> for not asserting at another. I know very well, that <hi>Marinus</hi> who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>John</hi> 8. at <hi>Rome,</hi> condemned his Predecessors acts and <hi>Photius</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (for he was before imployed both by <hi>Nicolaus</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> in the excommunicating and condemning <hi>Photius</hi>) but what this proves I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, any further, then that still one <hi>Pope</hi> may Infallibly contradict another, or that a <hi>Pope</hi> without a <hi>Council</hi> shall be more Infallible then with one, or lastly (which is the grand <hi>Arcanum Imperii</hi>) those <hi>Popes</hi> and those Decrees which are for the present interest of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> must be owned as Infallible; but for the rest, the best Art must be used to blast them that may be. And for this you want not your many tricks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to accuse Authors of Forgery, cry out on them for Hereticks, rail out of measure when you have nothing else to say; or if after all this, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies stand of force against you, then nothing is left, but <hi>Excogitato commento detorquere in alium sensum,</hi> to find out some trick to wrest them to another sense, as the Authors of the <hi>Belgick Index Expurgatorius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in the case of <hi>Bertram.</hi> But for all men who think it not lawful to say any thing in a bad Cause, this may certainly be sufficient to shew, that if <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> may be relyed on, if <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that was not accounted an Heresie by them, which you condemn for such in the <hi>Greek Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus discovered,<note place="margin">¬ß. 13.</note> that this opinion you condemn for <hi>Heresie</hi> in the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> was otherwise esteemed both by <hi>Fathers, Oecumenical Councils, and Popes</hi>; I come to that which you seem to rely on for making it Heretical, <hi>viz. That the Greeks and Latins both together condemned it for Heretical in the</hi> General Council <hi>at</hi> Florence. Although it might be worth our while to inquire how far any <hi>General Council</hi> can either make or declare that to be a necessary Article of Faith, which was determined to be otherwise by former <hi>General Councils.</hi> But omitting that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent which we may have a fitter occasion to discuss in the question of <hi>fundamentals,</hi> and the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils</hi>; I therefore come to examine the matter of fact in the <hi>Florentine Council,</hi> concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of this opinion there as <hi>Heretical.</hi> Wherein if we consider
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101069:24"/>
the time in which, and the occasion upon which this <hi>Council</hi> was call'd, if we consider the way of the managery of it, the <hi>Arts</hi> whereby the <hi>Greeks</hi> were drawn to this consent, the manner of proposing the <hi>Decrees</hi> of it, or the acceptance which it found in the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> upon none of these respects we shall have cause to look upon it as a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>General Council,</hi> determining that opinion as Heretical, which you say was so determined here. In all which we must profess how much we are obliged to that faithful and impartial account of all the proceedings relating to this <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> written by <hi>Sylvester Sguropulus</hi> one present at the most secret negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of it, transcribed out of the <hi>MS</hi> in the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> his <hi>Library,</hi> by <hi>Claudius Sarravius,</hi> and first published for the general good of the world by our learned <hi>Dean of Wells.</hi> It appears then, that which gave the first rise to the thoughts of union between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Churches,</hi> was the miserable condition which the <hi>Greek Empire</hi> was now reduced to, by the incursions of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens.</hi> For it seems for thirty years, (before that an <hi>Embassadour</hi> was sent to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Manuel Palaeologus</hi> to negotiate the business of the union) from the time of the <hi>Patriarch Nilus</hi> and <hi>Pope Vrban,</hi> there had been no entercourse at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> but now upon this address made to them by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> caress them with all imaginable kindness, feed them high with Promises, engage their utmost to promote this union, (well knowing with what advantage to themselves it might be managed in this <hi>Critical</hi> juncture of their affairs).

But they might easily understand the terms of that <hi>Vnion</hi> from the Speech of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> to the <hi>Emperours Legats,</hi> That the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was the <hi>Mother,</hi> and the <hi>Eastern</hi> only the <hi>Daughter,</hi> and therefore it was but fit that the <hi>Daughter</hi> should submit to the <hi>Mother</hi>; That for their parts, they would not leave the decision of this Controversie to multitudes of voices, (it seems then they had high thoughts of the Infallibility of <hi>General Councils</hi>),<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> but three should be chosen on either side, who being apart by themselves should invoke <hi>God,</hi> and whatever he should reveal unto them, that all should consent to: For he that hath said, that <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in his Name he would be in the midst of them; he that made the Ass to speak</hi> (the Cardinal's own Argument) <hi>would not fail of letting them know his Will Infallibly, which was to be received from them by all others.</hi> (There may be then a much readier way for Infallibility, than by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi>). But if nothing else would satisfie but a <hi>Council,</hi> it must be in <hi>Italy,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Popes</hi> promise before, that it should be at <hi>Constantinople</hi>; but when they urged the vastness of the expense, and unsuitableness of it to their present neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities; rather then a matter likely to be so much for the advantage of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> should not go forward, the <hi>Pope</hi> proffers to advance a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable sum of money for the defraying the charges of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> both

in coming to, and abiding at the <hi>Council.</hi> Which those who understand not the <hi>intrigues</hi> of that <hi>Court,</hi> would have thought had been far better spent in a present supply of the <hi>Greek Emperour,</hi> the better to have enabled him to defend the <hi>Christian Churches</hi> from the invasion of their enemies. But any one who looks into the management of things, will easily discern upon what grounds the <hi>Pope</hi> chose rather a dilatory proceeding, drawing the <hi>Emperour</hi> and so many <hi>Bishops</hi> from <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> at that time, and all the while to feed them with rich Promises of Assistance upon condition that the <hi>Vnion</hi> was accomplished; but at last after two years attendance (for so long the <hi>Council</hi> continued at <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi>) the poor <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> was sent home as empty as he came, and found things in a much worse condition then he left them. Which could not rationally be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be otherwise. When the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew that the <hi>Emperour</hi> had assented that the <hi>Council</hi> should be in <hi>Italy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">C. 17, 18.</note> they began strangely to be troubled at it, some resolved never to communicate more in the <hi>Councils</hi> of the <hi>Vnion</hi>; the <hi>Patriarch</hi> often said, that he knew no good issue could come of a <hi>Council</hi> held in the <hi>Popes</hi> Territories; and if they must receive their allowance from the <hi>Pope,</hi> what did they else but therein confess themselves his <hi>Vassals</hi> already, and therefore nothing could be expected from them, but to do just what he would have them; or else he might easily starve them into consent and approbation of his Will. For they should be wholly under his power, and if he denyed their stipends, there was no possibility of getting from him. Was not this then like to be a very <hi>free Council?</hi> And it proved accordingly: for when they were at <hi>Council</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> kept them short enough, so that many of them were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the greatest necessities, and were not suffered unless by stealth to go so much as out of the <hi>Gates</hi> of the City, as <hi>Bessarion</hi> himself once found,<note place="margin">

But as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101069:25"/>
the <hi>Romanists</hi> are never backward at such arts, they had caused it by their Instruments to be reported at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Basil</hi> had submitted to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which within fifteen days was confuted by the arrival of the <hi>Gallyes</hi> sent from the <hi>Council</hi> to convey the <hi>Greeks</hi> over to it;<note place="margin">C. 11.</note> upon which the <hi>Emperour</hi> had much to do to keep <hi>Condelmerius</hi> the <hi>Popes Nephew</hi> from fighting the <hi>Councils Gallies</hi> within his view; for he said, he had express order from the <hi>Pope</hi> to sink them where-ever he met them. And were not these fair tendencies to a free and <hi>General Council?</hi> And yet after all this, not full thirty <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> went along with the <hi>Patriarch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">C. 15.</note> as appears by the particular enumeration of them by <hi>Sguropulus:</hi> other <hi>Officers</hi> indeed, and <hi>Monks,</hi> there were to fill up the number; and yet these were more then the <hi>Emperour</hi> could well mould to his designes when he had them there. But the <hi>Pope</hi> soon accomplished the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> prediction in keeping them bare enough, when they were at his finding,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> that he might be sure to make them <hi>hungry Greeks,</hi> and then he supposed the other part of the <hi>Proverb</hi> would follow after. After the <hi>Council</hi> had begun at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and continued there sixteen <hi>Sessions,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were many publick and solemn Disputes between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> it was removed to <hi>Florence</hi>; where the <hi>Greeks</hi> still underwent the same hardships, and the <hi>Latins</hi> sought to hold out at Disputations, till the <hi>Greeks</hi> necessity should be so pressing, as to necessitate them to an absolute submission to the <hi>Latin Church.</hi> But, Reports and Messages coming from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> acquainting the <hi>Emperour</hi> with the difficulties the City was in, and the Progress which the enemies made; and finding, that during the sitting of the <hi>Council</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> still put him off and gave him nothing but words, he therefore resolves upon another course; he breaks all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and <hi>Conciliary</hi> proceedings, pretending that no issue would come of those Disputations, calls a private <hi>Cabal</hi> of such whom he knew fittest for his purpose to contrive some shorter way to put an end to this business.

When these things took no effect, the <hi>Patriarch</hi> who carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s design, often convenes the <hi>Greeks</hi> together, and in plain terms perswades them to perfect dissimulation, that since the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of affairs was such, it would be hugely for their advantage, if in some things they did yield to the <hi>Latins</hi> desires. When they told him that in matters of Faith they could not do it, he replyes, that if in twenty four Articles of <hi>Faith</hi> they yielded but in one, the soundness of <hi>twenty three</hi> would make amends for the <hi>twenty fourth.</hi> Such kind of Arguments as these were they driven to, to bring the <hi>Greeks</hi> to hearken to any terms of <hi>Vnion.</hi> After this, the <hi>Latins</hi> sent them an explication of Faith, which if the <hi>Greeks</hi> would subscribe, there might be an Union between them: which being read among them,<note place="margin">C. 13.</note> containing chiefly the acknowledgement of the <hi>Procession from the Son,</hi> all but the four who were the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s instruments in this work, unanimously disown it: and when the <hi>Emperour</hi> urged them every one to deliver their <hi>Suffrages</hi> in writings,<note place="margin">C. 14.</note> they tell him, it was contrary to the proceeding of all <hi>Oecumenical Councils:</hi> However, he told them he commanded them to do it. By which means rebuking some, cajoling others, he at last brought it by the multitude of <hi>Suffrages,</hi> that five persons were selected among the rest,<note place="margin">C 16.</note> to draw up a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Vnion</hi>; which, though drawn up very favourably for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet, those who were for it,<note place="margin">C. 18.</note> did not easily carry it from those who opposed it.

                     <hi>Theological Reason is so strong a Foundation to confirm it, that I wonder how rational men could ever be induced to question the truth of it.</hi> Still you so unadvisedly place your expressions, that the sharpest which you use against your adversaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with more force upon your self: For it being so fully cleared, that these <hi>clouds of witnesses</hi> are <hi>Fathers, Councils, and Popes</hi> against you, What do you else by this expression, but exclude them from the number of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men,</hi> because, forsooth, not acquainted with the depth of your <hi>Theological Reason.</hi> But, <hi>Is not this to make all the Churches of Christendom for many hundred years quite blind, and your self only clear and sharp-sighted? Which swelling presumption what Spirit it argues, &amp;c.</hi> You see wee need no other weapons against you, but your immediate preceding words. What pitty it is, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> had not been made acquainted with this grand Secret of your <hi>Theological Reason</hi>? but happy we that have it at so cheap a rate! but it may be that is it which makes us esteem it no more. But such as it is, it being <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Theological</hi> too, it deserves the greatest respect that may be, if it makes good its title. <hi>His Lordship</hi> had said,<note place="margin">Sect. 9. n. 1. p. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>That since the Greeks, notwithstanding this opinion of theirs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not the equality or Consubstantiality of the Persons in the Trinity, he dares not deny them to be a true Church for this opinion, though he grants them erronious in it.</hi> So this you reply, <hi>Is it (think you) enough to assert the Divinity, and Consubstantiality, and personal Distinction of the Holy Ghost (as the Bishop sayes) to save from Heresie the denyal of his Procession from the Father and the Son as from one Principle?</hi> But why is it not enough? your <hi>Theological Reason</hi> is that we want, to convince us of the contrary; That therefore follows. <hi>Would not he that should affirm the Son to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct person from, and Consubstantial to the Father, but denyed his eternal Generation from him, be an Heretick? Or he, who held the Holy Ghost, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from, and Consubstantial to them both, but affirmed his Procession to be from the Son only, and not from the Father, be guilty of Heresie? It is then most evident, that not only an errour against the Consubstantiality and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, but against the Origination, Generation, and Procession of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons, is sufficient matter of Heresie.</hi> Your faculty at <hi>Clinching</hi> your Arguments, is much better than of <hi>Driving them in:</hi> For your Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is <hi>most evident,</hi> when your Premises have nothing <hi>like evidence</hi> in them. For, 1. He that doth acknowledge the <hi>Son</hi> to be <hi>Consubstantial</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> and yet a distinct person from him, must needs therein acknowledge his <hi>Eternal Generation</hi>: for how he should be the <hi>Son</hi> of the same nature with <hi>God,</hi> and yet having a distinct <hi>Personality</hi> as a <hi>Son,</hi> without <hi>Eternal Generation</hi>; is so hard to understand, that I must confess, that whoever asserts the one, and deny's the other, is so far from <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Reason,</hi> that I think he hath no <hi>common reason</hi> in him. Is this then, think you, a parallel case with the Procession of the <hi>Spirit</hi> from the <hi>Son,</hi> which may be supposed <hi>Consubstantial</hi> to <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and a distinct person from both, without any Connotation of respect to the <hi>Personality</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> as a principle of <hi>Spiration?</hi> 2. He that should affirm the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> only from the <hi>Son,</hi> and not the <hi>Father,</hi> would speak

much more absurdly than the <hi>Greeks</hi> do; for thereby he would destroy the <hi>Father's</hi> being the <hi>fountain</hi> or <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>Origination,</hi> as to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct <hi>Hypostases</hi> of <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>; he would plainly and directly thwart the <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>second General Council</hi>; and, which is more than would speak directly against express words of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which say, <hi>The Spirit proceeds from the Father</hi>: which by the consent of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> hath been interpreted of the Eternal Procession. And by this time, I hope you begin to have better thoughts of rational men, than to make such a wonder at their questioning the <hi>Greeks Heresie</hi>; but if this be your <hi>Theological Reason,</hi> one scruple of <hi>common reason</hi> goes far beyond it.</p>

Your main defence lyes in a distinction which ruines you; for you think to ward off all the citations his Lordship produceth against you out of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and others, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> agree with each other, <hi>in eandem fidei sententiam,</hi>

The Ancient,</hi> you say, <hi>expressed themselves per filium, but they meant thereby √† filio: whereas the Modern Greeks will not admit that expression √† filio, but per filium only, and that too in a sense dissignificative to √† filio.</hi> This is the substance of all the answer you give, both in general, and to the particular authorities for several pages; The disproof therefore of this distinction must by your own Confession, make all those testimonies stand good against you; which I shall do by two things. 1. By shewing that the <hi>Ancient Greeks</hi> did assert as much as the Modern do in this Controversie. 2. That those who speak expresly of the <hi>Modern Greeks,</hi> do deny their difference from us in any matter of Faith. 1. That the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> did assert as much as the <hi>Modern</hi> do. By the Ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> we must here understand those who writ before the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> whose testimonies you would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by this distinction. Now nothing can be more clear than that those <hi>Greeks</hi> who writ before them, did as peremptorily deny <hi>the Procession from the Son,</hi> as any of the <hi>Modern Greeks</hi> do. We have already produced the testimony of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who accounts the contrary opinion blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and impious; and that of <hi>Photius,</hi> who so largely and vehemently disputes against the Procession from the Son. To whom I shall add two more of great reputation, not only in the <hi>Greek,</hi> but in the <hi>Latin Church</hi>; and those are <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Damascen. Theophylact,</hi> whether he lived in the time of <hi>Photius,</hi> about 870, as the common opinion is, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably in the time of <hi>Michael Cerularius,</hi> as great an adversary as <hi>Photius</hi> to the <hi>Latins,</hi> about 1070. yet was long enough before the <hi>Schoolmen:</hi> for <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> flourished. <hi>A.

We find not therefore any ground for this distinction of yours concerning the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern Greeks</hi>; and therefore they who said, that there was no real difference in any matter of Faith between the <hi>Ancient Greeks and Latins,</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as well of the <hi>Modern Greeks,</hi> as them: Their words being no more capable of such a tolerable interpretation as you speak of, than the words of any of the <hi>Modern Greeks</hi> are.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> was proving, that the point was not fundamental,<note place="margin">¬ß. 16.</note> that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> differed in <hi>from that acknowledgement of Peter Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, and the Schoolmen; that is to say, The Holy Ghost is the Spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, and that he is, or proceeds from the Father and the Son, is not to speak different things, but the same sense in different words. Now in this cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>where the words differ, but the sentence of Faith is the same, (penit√πs eadem) even altogether the same, can the point be fundamental?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>But,</hi> say you, <hi>he was to prove, that such as were in grievous errour in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, erred not fundamentally; and, for proof of this, he alledges such as have no real errour at all in Divinity.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> But do you not herein wilfully mistake his <hi>Lordships</hi> meaning? For in the Paragraph foregoing, his <hi>Lordship</hi> first declares his own judgement concerning the denying the Procession of the Holy Ghost, <hi>viz. That he did acknowledge it to be a grievous errour in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>: but yet he could not judge the <hi>Greeks</hi> guilty of a fundamental er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which he proves by a double medium. 1. <hi>Because they did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deny the Equality and Consubstantiality of the persons.</hi> 2. <hi>Because divers learned men were of opinion, [that √† filio, &amp; per filium] in the sense of the Greek Church, was but a question in modo loquendi, and therefore not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi>; now for this he produceth those testimonies. Now, I pray, do you put no difference between <hi>the making the denyal of a Proposition to be an errour, and the saying, that such persons are guilty of the denyal of that Proposition.</hi> His Lordship grants the <hi>denyal of the Procession to be a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous errour in Divinity,</hi> but he questioned (<hi>as the Greeks expressed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> for those very words he inserts) whether they were guilty of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that Proposition,</hi> as appears by the authorities of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and therefore certainly much less guilty of a fundamental errour. Thus you see his <hi>Lordship</hi> fully proves what he intends; for if they agreed in sense, they were much less guilty of a fundamental errour, than if they had plainly denyed the Procession, which he supposeth from those <hi>Authorities</hi> that they did not. And therefore when you <hi>Sarcastically</hi> ask, <hi>Is not this strong Logick?</hi> The only answer I shall give you, is, That if you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it not to be so, it is <hi>because of the weakness of your Theological Reason.</hi> And therefore you put his <hi>Lordships</hi> Defender on a strange task, <hi>to prove from those Authorities, that those Greeks who erre grievously in Divinity, erre not fundamentally.</hi> When the only design of his <hi>Lordship,</hi> in producing those Authorities, was to shew, that according to their opinion, the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:101069:28"/>
were so far from erring fundamentally, that <hi>they did not erre grievously in Divinity.</hi> And to this purpose the citation of <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> was pertinent, <hi>who saith, That because the Greeks acknowledge, that the Holy Ghost is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Son,</hi>

                        </expan>,</hi> and not be excused after through greater ignorance of any such <hi>Power</hi> in your <hi>Church, to declare such things to be matters of Faith,</hi> is an assertion not easie to be swallowed by such as have any strength of <hi>Logick,</hi> or one <hi>drachm</hi> of <hi>Theological Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>: Or else it is a very strange thing, you should think it sufficient for the <hi>Greeks</hi> to know, what your <hi>Church</hi> had declared without an antecedent knowledge that your <hi>Church had power to declare.</hi> How much you answer at random, appears by your answering <hi>Aquinas</hi> his <hi>testimony,</hi> instead of that of <hi>Jodocus Clictoveus,</hi> as is plain enough in his Lordships Margin; and you might have been easily satisfied that it was so, if you had taken the pains to look into either of them. But the art of it was, <hi>Aquinas</hi> his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony might be easily answered, because he speaks only by hear-say, <hi>concerning the opinion of some certain Greeks</hi>; but <hi>Clictoveus,</hi> his was close to the purpose, who plainly confesseth, that the difference of the <hi>Ancient Greeks was more in words, and the manner of explaining the Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion then in the thing it self.</hi> This therefore you thought fit to slide by, and answer <hi>Aquinas</hi> for him. Your answer to <hi>Scotus</hi> depends on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer distinction of <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern Greeks,</hi> and therefore falls with it. <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s answer concerning <hi>Damascen,</hi> and your own after <hi>Bonaventure</hi> of his <hi>non dicimus,</hi> hath been sufficiently disproved already.

But any indifferent Reader would think it had been your concernment to have shewn the contrary, that thereby you might seem to make good so heavy a charge, as that of <hi>Heresie,</hi> against the whole <hi>Greek Church.</hi> For, if the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> cannot be equal and consubstantial with the <hi>Son,</hi> if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from the <hi>Son</hi>; then it follows, that they who deny this Processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, must deny that <hi>Equality</hi> and <hi>Consubstantiality</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> with the <hi>Son</hi>: which you ought to prove, to make good your charge of Heresie. But on the other side, if the <hi>Spirit</hi> may be proved to be <hi>God</hi> by such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as do not at all infer his <hi>Procession from the Son</hi>; then his equality and consubstantiality doth not depend upon that Procession: for I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you grant, that it is the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Essence</hi> in the Persons which make them equal and consubstantial; but we may sufficiently prove the <hi>Spirit</hi> to be <hi>God</hi> by such Arguments as do not infer the Procession from the <hi>Son</hi>; as I might easily make appear by all the Arguments insisted on to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: but I only mention that which the second <hi>General Council</hi> thought most cogent to that purpose, which is the <hi>Spirit's eternal Procession from the Father</hi>; if that proves the <hi>Spirit to be God,</hi> then its equality with the Son, is proved without his Procession from the Son; for I hope you will not say, that the proving his Procession from the Father, doth imply Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Son too: because the Procession cannot be supposed to be from the essence, for then the <hi>Spirit</hi> would proceed from it self, but from the <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> and therefore one cannot imply the concurrence of the other. And since you pretend so much to understand these depths; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you renew a charge of Heresie against the <hi>Greek Church</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, make use of your <hi>Theological reason</hi> in giving an Intelligible Answer to these Questions. 1. Why the <hi>Spirit</hi> may not be equal and consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial to the other Persons in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> supposing his Procession to be only from the <hi>Father,</hi> as the <hi>Son</hi> to be equal and consubstantial with <hi>them,</hi> when his <hi>Generation</hi> is only from the <hi>Father?</hi> 2. If the Procession from the Son be necessary to make the Spirit consubstantial with the Son, why is not Generation of the Son by the Spirit necessary to make the Son con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial with the Spirit? 3. If the Spirit doth proceed from Father and Son as distinct <hi>Hypostases,</hi> how he can proceed from these <hi>Hypostases</hi> as one principle by one common Spiration, without confounding their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonalties?</hi> or else, shew how two distinct <hi>Hypostases</hi> alwayes remaining so, can concur in the same numerical action <hi>ad intra?</hi> 4. If there be such a necessity of believing this as an Article of Faith, why hath not <hi>God</hi> thought fit to reveal to us, the distinct <hi>emanations</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>; and wherein the <hi>eternal Generation</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> may be conceived as distinct from the <hi>Procession of the Spirit,</hi> when both equally agree in the same <hi>essence,</hi> and neither of them express the <hi>personality</hi> of the <hi>Father?</hi> Either I say undertake intelligibly to resolve these things, or else surcease your charge of <hi>Heresie</hi> against the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and upbraid not his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for not entering into these depths. Methinks, their being confessed to be Depths on both sides, might teach you a little more modesty in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, and much more charity to men who differ about them. For you may see, the <hi>Greeks</hi> want not great plausibleness of reason on their side, as well as Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> plain for them, but not so against them. As long therefore as the <hi>Greek Church</hi> confesseth the <hi>Divinity, Consubstantiality, Eternal Procession</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi>; and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it to be <hi>the Spirit of the Son,</hi> there must be something more in it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101069:29"/>
then the bare denyal of the Procession from the Son, which must make you so eager in your charge of Heresie against her. The truth is, there is something else in the matter; by this Article of <hi>Filioque,</hi> the Authority of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in matters of Faith is struck at: and therefore if this be an <hi>Heresie,</hi> it must be on the account of denying the plenitude of her power in matters of Faith, as <hi>Anselm</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ingenuously confess it, and plead it on that account. And therefore wise men are not apt to believe, but that if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had not been particularly concerned in this <hi>addition</hi> to the <hi>Creed</hi>; if the <hi>Greeks</hi> would have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in all other things to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> this charge of Heresie would soon be taken off the File. But, as things stand, if she be not found guilty of Heresie, she may be found as <hi>Catholick</hi> as <hi>Rome,</hi> and more too, and therefore there is a necessity for it, she must be contented to bear it, for it is not consistent with the Interest of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that she should be free from <hi>Heresie, Schism,</hi> &amp;c. But if she hath no stronger Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to make good the charge then you, she may satisfie her self, that though the blows be rude, yet they are given her by feeble hands. For let us now make way for <hi>Theological reason</hi> to enter the lists armed <hi>Cap-a-pe</hi> in Mood and Figure. For now at last you tell us, <hi>You will argue in Forme against his Lordship and the Greek Church together.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 11.</note> And thus it proceeds, <hi>If the Greeks errour be not only concerning, but against the Holy Ghost, then (according to the Bishops own distinction) they have lost all assistance of that blessed Spirit, and are become no true Church; But their errour is not only concerning, but against the Holy Ghost: Therefore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Major or first Proposition contains the Bishops own Doctrine, the Minor or second Proposition</hi> (wherein you learnedly tell us, what the Major and Minor in Syllogisms are) <hi>you thus prove. All errours, specially opposite to the particular and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Procession of the Holy Ghost, are (according to all Divines) not only er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours concerning, but errours against the Holy Ghost: But the Greeks errour is opposite to the particular and personal Procession of the Holy Ghost, as is already proved:</hi> Ergo, <hi>their errour is not only concerning, but against the Holy Ghost; whose assistance therefore they have lost, not only according to the first, but even latter branch of the Bishops distinction: and consequently remain no true Church.</hi> Now who is there, that out of meer pitty can find in his heart not to yield this to you, when you have been at such pains to prove it? But things set out with the greatest formality have not alwayes the most solidity in them. All the force of this Argument, such as it is, lye's in this, that his Lordship had said, <hi>That the errour of the Greeks was rather about the Doctrine concerning the Holy Ghost, then against the Holy Ghost,</hi> which he after explains, by saying, <hi>It was not such an errour, as did destroy the equality or Consubstantiality of the Spirit with the other persons of the Trinity</hi>; I pray now take his Lordships explication of himself, and you must form your Argument after another way then you have done: but you saw well enough, that you could not make any shew of an Argument but meerly from words. If I thought it worth considering, it were easie to tell you, that what is only against the Procession from the Son, is not thereby against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> because it may be the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> i. e. <hi>the third person in the Trinity,</hi> though it proceed only from the <hi>Father.</hi> And as well you might say, that whatever Doctrine denies <hi>the Son to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Spirit,</hi> is not only <hi>concerning,</hi> but <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and urge the consequences upon as good terms as you do about the <hi>Spirit:</hi> But so
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101069:29"/>
trifling an Argument is too much honoured by any serious confutation. And, it seems, you were something sensible of it your self, when you say, <hi>His Lordship seemed to have provided against the force of it</hi> (as who would not?) <hi>by hinting a difference between errours fundamental and not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; which point I shall purposely examine in the following Chapter.</hi> When you therefore come to <hi>hold forth</hi> what is now but <hi>hinted at,</hi> I shall readily hearken to what you have to say.</p>
                  <p>Thus for any thing you have produced to the contrary, it sufficiently appears, that the <hi>Greek Church</hi> is very unjustly charged with <hi>Heresie</hi> by you, and that those testimonies which his Lordship produced, would as well hold for the <hi>Modern</hi> as <hi>Ancient Greeks</hi>: to which I might add the judgement of <hi>others</hi> of your own side, who speak as much concerning the <hi>Modern Greeks,</hi> as <hi>Thomas √† Jesu, Azorius</hi> and others; but I think not that way of arguing to have much force on either side, and therefore pass it over.</p>

                     <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> For what you say to this, <hi>of the Holy Ghost's having leave to assist the Church, in adding expressions for the better explication of any Article of Faith: and then the Pope hath leave and command too, to Anathematize all such, as shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the use of such expressions</hi>: I commend you, that when you must beg something, you would beg all that was to be had at once; but, before you perswade us to the digesting such crudities as these are, prove but these following things. 1. Where it is, that there is any promise of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>'s assistance, in adding any <hi>Articles</hi> to the <hi>Creed,</hi> under pretence of better expressions for explication of them? 2. Supposing such an assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, what ground is there to impose such additional <hi>expressions,</hi> so that those who admit them not, must be guilty of Heresie, and consequently (by your principles) incurr eternal damnation. 3. How those expressions can be accounted a better <hi>explication</hi> of an Article of Faith, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain something not implyed in, nor necessarily deduced from, any other Article of Faith? 4. If this <hi>assistance</hi> be promised to the <hi>Church,</hi> how any one part of that <hi>Church,</hi> as great a part stifly opposing such additional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, can claim that assistance to it self; the other parts of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> utterly denying it? 5. If an assistance as to such things be promised the <hi>Church,</hi> why may it not be more reasonably presumed to be in an <hi>Oecumenical Council,</hi> as that at <hi>Ephesus</hi> forbidding such additions, than in any part of the <hi>Church,</hi> which after such a Decree shall directly contradict it? 6. What right can the <hi>Church</hi> have to <hi>Anathematize</hi> any for the not using such expressions, which that <hi>Church</hi> which determins the use of them, doth acknowledge to be only expressions for better expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of an Article of Faith? and consequently the denyal of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amount to the denyal of an Article of <hi>Faith?</hi> but only of the better <hi>explication</hi> of it. 7. If all these things be granted, how comes the <hi>Pope, not only to have leave, but command too, to Anathematize all such as use not these expressions?</hi> Where is that Command extant? how comes it to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to him? Is he expressed in it? or doth it by necessary consequence follow from it? What good would it do us, to see but one of these proved,

                     <hi>Declarations</hi> into the <hi>Creed.</hi> 2. That if it did not forbid that, yet there is as little reason to say, this was a meer Declaration. 1. Because there is no reason to say, that the <hi>Council</hi> did not forbid the inserting Declarations into the <hi>Creed</hi>: For, as <hi>Bessarion</hi> well observes, it never was lawful to add new and distinct Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> from those which are contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Concil. Florent. sess.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 626.</note> but the <hi>Church</hi> only undertook the explication and declaration of the things therein contained; and this was only lawful. Therefore the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> had full liberty of explaining Articles of Faith, and using those explications, as they judged most expedient, and to place them where they thought good, so it were not in <hi>Scripture:</hi> thence they might insert them into the <hi>Creed,</hi> or elsewhere. But afterwards (<hi>i. e.</hi> after this decree of the <hi>Ephesine Council</hi>) this liberty was partly taken away, and partly continued. For, it never was, or will be, unlawful to explain or declare Articles of Faith; but to insert those explications into the <hi>Creed,</hi> is now unlawful, because forbidden by the decree of a <hi>General Council.</hi> For, saith he, the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>third Council,</hi> observing what great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies had followed in the <hi>Church,</hi> upon the inlargement of <hi>Creeds,</hi> and that no injury could at all come by the prohibition of any further Additions to be inserted (for by that means they should only be bound to believe no more than what those <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> believed; and who dare charge their Faith with imperfection) and they did therefore wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid all other expositions of Faith to be inserted into the <hi>Creed,</hi> as he there at large proves. And in the progress of that discourse, takes off that which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> looked on as the only satisfactory answer, <hi>viz. That the prohibition concerned only private persons</hi>; For, saith he, It cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the <hi>Council</hi> should take care about the Declarations of the <hi>Creed,</hi> made by particular persons (whereas it alwaies was, and is lawful for such to declare their Faith more particularly, as appears by the <hi>Creed</hi> of <hi>Charisius,</hi> received in this <hi>Council</hi>) but this they looked after, that the <hi>Creed,</hi> which was commonly received in the <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> and into which men are baptized, should receive no alteration at all. And to shew what their meaning was, though their <hi>Council</hi> was purposely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> yet they would not insert <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> into the <hi>Creed.</hi> And the same decree was observed in the 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Councils</hi>; which, by their actions, did declare this to be the meaning of the <hi>Ephesine Council,</hi> that no Declarations whatsoever, should hereafter be inserted into the <hi>Creed.</hi> For, if they were meer Declarations, there was much less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of inferting them into the <hi>Creed,</hi> which was supposed to be a Systeme of the necessary Articles of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There was as little reason to say, that this Article was a meer Declaration.</hi> For, the <hi>Latins</hi> pretended, that the Article of <hi>Filio<expan>

                     <hi>to make this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Creed?</hi> For, the <hi>Greeks</hi> said, whatever authority the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had, it received by the <hi>Canons,</hi> and its authority was therefore less then that of an <hi>Oecumenical Council,</hi> wherefore it could not justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, or act contrary to the decree of a <hi>General Council,</hi> as it did apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this case.

Here <hi>Anselm</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> think to secure themselves, and hither they are all driven at last. So that we plainly see, whatever else is pretended, <hi>the Pope's usurped Power</hi> was that which truly gave occasion to the <hi>Schism</hi>: For, it was not the <hi>Latins</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Procession from the Son, which made the separation between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches,</hi> but the <hi>Pope's pretending a Power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose an Article of Faith in the Creed against the decree of a former, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of a present Oecumenical Council.</hi> If you pretend, that there hath been since an <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> which hath declared it; by that very answer you justifie the <hi>Greeks</hi> before that <hi>Council,</hi> and so lay the guilt of the <hi>Schism</hi> wholly on the <hi>Pope,</hi> who did insert and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Article, before an <hi>Oecumenical Council.</hi> Thus still it appears, the cause of the <hi>Schism</hi> began at <hi>Rome</hi>; and by the same Argument with which you charge them with Heresie, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> you vindicate the <hi>Greek Church</hi> from <hi>Schism,</hi> in all the actions of it before that <hi>Council.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this might suffice to shew, that it was not <hi>the levity, vanity, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Greeks, which gave the great occasion of the Schism, but the Pride, Incroachments, and Vsurpations of the Church of</hi> Rome, as might largely be manifested from the history of those times, when the <hi>Schism</hi> began. The rise of which ought to be derived from the times of the <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon Councils</hi>; the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>fourth Oecumenical.</hi> For, the <hi>Canons</hi> of those <hi>Councils decreeing equal Priviledges to</hi> Constantinople, <hi>with those of</hi> Rome, <hi>made the Popes have a continual jealousie upon the Greek Church,</hi> and watch all opportunities to disgrace it, and infringe the liberties of it. Thence came the rage of <hi>Leo</hi> against <hi>Anatolius</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> in the time of <hi>Martianus</hi>; thence the feud between <hi>Simplicius</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> 3. of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Acacius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for defending the Priviledges of his <hi>See,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Pope's</hi>; insomuch that <hi>Felix</hi> fairly excommunicates him, because he would not submit to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s tryal in the case of the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; which continued so long, that <hi>Euphemius,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Acacius,</hi> though he excommunited <hi>Petrus Moggus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> yet could not be received into the Communion of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101069:33"/>
the <hi>Roman Church</hi> by <hi>Felix,</hi> because he would not expunge the name of <hi>Acacius</hi> out of the <hi>Diptychs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; and afterwards <hi>Gelasius</hi> refused it on the same grounds; which <hi>Euphemius</hi> still denying to do, the Schism continued. And, although afterwards the <hi>Emperour Anastasius,</hi> and the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> desired the making up of this difference; yet no other terms of communion would be accepted by <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> without the expunging the name of <hi>Acacius.</hi> So implacably were they bent against the very memory of <hi>Acacius,</hi> for defending the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of his <hi>See,</hi> that they would rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that lamentable <hi>Schism,</hi> than not avenge themselves upon him; and consequently, make all future <hi>Patriarchs</hi> fearful of opposing the <hi>Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> If we look yet further, we shall still find the ambition of the <hi>Popes</hi> to have caused all the disturbance in the <hi>Greek Churches,</hi> although some of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> cannot be excused from the same faults.

If not, to what purpose do you mention such things here; unless to let us see, that it is want of some thing else besides will, which makes you suffer any whom you call <hi>Hereticks</hi> to live. That S. <hi>Paul</hi> chastised his untoward <hi>Children,</hi> indeed you tell us, from 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. but if you bring this to any purpose, you must make the <hi>Greeks Errour,</hi> as bad as <hi>Incest,</hi> or a <hi>denying the Faith</hi>; and when you have done so, you may hear of a further answer.

But it is very certain, you are more impatient to have your Politicks,<note place="margin">P. 13. n. 1.</note> than your Errours discovered; and if you have any Curses more dreadful than others, they are sure to light on those who discover the intrigues of your Designs. For if once men come to discern how much more of Artifice and cunning, than of Truth and Religion, there is in the managing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of your Church, they would not easily think, the way to Heaven can lye among so many foldings of the old Serpent: And this is not to think as you tragically speak, <hi>That all the world is turn'd mad or Heathen</hi>: for, thanks be to God, as <hi>Catholique</hi> as your Church is, it must be a huge <hi>Catachresis</hi> to take it for all the world: neither do we think your Church mad, but very wise and <hi>Politick</hi> in these pretences; and that still you are resolved to shew, that though other <hi>Churches</hi> may be more <hi>Children of Light than yours</hi> (ignorance being so much in favour with you) yet <hi>yours is Wiser in its Generation.</hi> But how the pretending of your Church to Infallibility, and power to define Fundamentals, should make us imagine <hi>all the world Heathen,</hi> is not easie to conceive, unless you are conscious to your self, that such pretences as these are, are the way to make it so. But we must see still how your <hi>Cothurnus</hi> fits you. <hi>No truth left upon earth, but all become Juglers?</hi> See what it is to be true Catholiques, that if they juggle, all the world must do so too; as though <hi>totus mundus exercet histrioniam,</hi> were <hi>Latin</hi> for the <hi>Infallibility of the Church of</hi> Rome. But have you indeed such a <hi>Monopoly</hi> of Truth, that if your party prove Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, there will be no truth left upon earth? if you had said, none unso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticated, yet even that had been a great <hi>Truth</hi> left upon earth still. But I shall cut you short in what follows of your Declamation, by telling you, that though your Harangue were ten times longer than it is, and your exclamations louder, and your Authorities better than of <hi>your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Miracles, Doctors, Heads of Schools, austere and religious persons</hi> (in English Monks and Friers) yet all these would not one jot perswade us contrary to common sense, and the large experience of the world, That <hi>Religion</hi> is not made by you an Instrument to advance the <hi>Pope's Ambition,</hi> and that the <hi>Church</hi> is but a more plausible name, whereby to maintain the <hi>Court of Rome.</hi> And we need not go from our present subject, for a proof of it. I will not charge this upon all persons of your Communion, for all of them do not believe the State-Principles of your Church; and others are kept, as much as may be, from all waies of discovering the great Designs of it; and therefore there may be so much innocency and simplicity in some, as may keep them from <hi>prostituting their Salvation to the Pope's Greatness</hi>: but this is no plea on behalf of those who have the managery of those Designs; who if they do not see what things are fittest for the <hi>Pope</hi>'s temporal ends, will not long be thought fit for their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. But, is it not palpable how much you endeavour to shrivel Christianity into a Party and Faction, excluding all others that are not of your party out of the Church, and consequently from hopes of salvation, though never so pious and conscientious? Are not the far greatest part of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101069:35"/>
the opinions you contend for, against all the rest of the Christian world, such as are manifestly subservient to temporal ends? And are not such more zealously disputed for, than the plain Articles of Faith, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable precepts of the Christian Religion? Have you not found out all the Artifices imaginable, to enervate the force of Christian Piety, by your Doctrines about <hi>Repentance, Prayer, Indulgences, Probability, Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and such like? And instead of those rational acts of <hi>Devotion,</hi> which our <hi>Religion</hi> requires from us, have made choice of such fond, ludicrous, unintelligible pieces of Devotion (by the most who are concerned in them) as though you were resolved to see how much it was possible to <hi>debauch Christianity,</hi> and make it contemptible in the world? Add to these the Arts you have to violate Humane Societies, by dispensing with oaths, breaking Faith, dissolving Obedience to Civil Authority, when it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth your designs; and is it possible then for persons not blind-folded with the grossest sort of implicit Faith, to judge otherwise, but the design of your Chvrch is to determine, <hi>not what is truest, but what is fittest for your ends?</hi> And, although you scurrilously call his Lordship's discourse, <hi>stuff that might serve sometimes for Pulpit-babble, to deceive the giddy multitude, and cast a mist before their eyes</hi>; yet you see, he was not afraid of what any adversary could say against it, by writing it in a Polemical Discourse, in which we could be glad to see some of those famous <hi>Legends,</hi> and Seraphical Notions, which your Pulpit-entertainments consist so much of, especially where you are out of the reach of Hereticks, and then we should judge Which looks more like babling, and deceiving the giddy multitude. But, to let us see what men of reach and Politicians you are, you have found out a strange <hi>Fetch</hi> in his Lordships discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> that all this, is, <hi>That they might not see the impurity of their own English-Protestant Church,</hi>

                  <hi>even in its first rise under</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth, and the people-cheating Policies it was beholding to for its restauration under</hi> Queen Elizabeth, <hi>as may be seen in History.</hi> History is a large <hi>wood</hi> to bid us seek for these cheating <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies</hi> in; and if you had any other design, but meerly to shew your self a <hi>Politician</hi> in this, that you can <hi>fortit√®r calumniari, use your tongue manfully when reproaches are useful</hi>; you would have produced some evidence so clear of them, as his Lordship here insists on in reference to your Church. But, as long as you converse only in <hi>Generals,</hi> you will give us leave to think who those are which use to do so, <hi>viz. such grand Politicians</hi> as your self. For the Particulars of our Reformation, we shall have occasion to vindicate them in another place, and therein shall easily manifest what an <hi>Itch</hi> you had to calumniate here, though you were sure to <hi>smart</hi> for it afterwards. That which you call weakness of judgement, or want of Charity in his Lordship, will be found to lye at another door, by our making it appear, that what you call a groundless and impossible slander, is a real and undoubted truth. But when you tell us, That <hi>such Railleries do not become one that would be esteemed a grave Doctor of the English Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>an</hi> alterius orbis Patriarcha, <hi>as the antient Primates of</hi> England <hi>have been call'd:</hi> I know not whether you discover more judgment or reading in it; <hi>your judgement</hi> in calling that an unbecoming <hi>Raillery,</hi> which is a great and seasonable Truth; <hi>your reading,</hi> in mistaking <hi>Patriarcha</hi> for <hi>Papa,</hi> or else you were willing to dissemble it, because then by the advantage of his <hi>title,</hi> he might be fitter to discover the Artifices and Designs of his <hi>Fellow-Pope.</hi> The laying open of which is certainly vastly different from <hi>sporting with all that can be serious on earth (man's salvation)</hi> as you most

injuriously calumniate his Lordship in your next words, in affirming so of him, when his only design was, to clear the way to mans salvation, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the gins and traps which are laid in the way of silly men, by the pernicious subtilty of those of your party.</p>
               <p>The way being thus cleared, we come to the main question, <hi>viz. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Points, defined by the Church, are Fundamental</hi>; and here,<note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> because you tell us, <hi>His Lordship is like one</hi> that provides for a <hi>retreat or a subterfuge, by cutting out a number of ambiguous distinctions</hi>; you give us fair hopes what clear proceedings we may expect from you, who abhorr as much the clear stating of a question, as <hi>Foxes</hi> do running in beaten Roads. But, as well as you love <hi>them,</hi> you must be drawn out of your <hi>Holes,</hi> which will be much for the advantage of Truth, though very little for yours. To come therefore close to the business, that you may not think I seek subterfuges, or retreats, I shall wave all other acceptions of <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> and take the Question in your own sense, that is, <hi>for Points necessary to Salvation.</hi> The Question then in controversie between us, is this<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
                  <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ground or reason why any thing is fundamental or necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be, because it is defined by the Church to be so,</hi> and consequently, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Points, defined by the Church, be not fundamental or necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>? For the occasion of this Controversie was from the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> whether her errour, as to the Procession from the <hi>Son,</hi> be fundamental or no, <hi>i. e.</hi> such as excludes her from being a <hi>Church,</hi> and consequently from Salvation. The ground of your affirmation, is, because <hi>the Church hath defined it to be so</hi>; so that the ground and reason why any thing is supposed fundamental or necessary to Salvation, must be the Definition of the Church: But for our better understanding your meaning, <hi>you distinguish of two waies, whereby Points may be necessary to Salvation; the one absolutely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>by reason of the matter they contain; which,</hi> say you, <hi>is so fundamentally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in it self, that not only the disbelief of it, when propounded by the Church, but the meer want of an express knowledge, and belief of it, will hinder Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and those are such Points, without the express belief whereof, no man can be saved, which Divines call necessary</hi> necessitate medii; <hi>others of this kind they call necessary</hi> necessitate praecepti, <hi>which all men are commanded to seek after, and expresly believe; so that a culpable Ignorance of them hinders Salvation, although some may be saved with invincible Ignorance of them. And all these are absolutely necessary to be expresly believed, either</hi> necessitate praecepti, <hi>or</hi> medii, <hi>in regard of the matter which they contain. But the rest of the Points of Faith are necessary to be believed</hi> necessitate praecepti, <hi>only conditionally, that is, to all such to whom they are sufficiently propounded, as defined by the Church: which necessity proceeds not precisely from the material object, or matter contained in them; but from the formal object of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, declared to Christians by the Churches Definition. Whether therefore the Points in question be necessary in the first manner or no, by reason of their precise matter; yet if they be necessary, by reason of the Divine Authority, or Formal<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> object of Divine Revelation, sufficiently declared and propounded to us, they will be Points Fundamental, that is, necessary to Salvation to be believed, as we have shewed Fundamental must here be taken.</hi> These words of yours containing the full state of the question in your own terms, and being the substance of all you say on this Controversie, I have recited at large; that you may not complain, your meaning is mistaken in them. You assert then, that besides that <hi>necessity</hi> which ariseth from the <hi>matter</hi> of things to be believed, and from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> absolute <hi>Command</hi> of God; there is another ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101069:36"/>
                  <hi>conditionally</hi> upon the <hi>Churches Definition,</hi> but, supposing that <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> the thing so propounded becomes as necessary to Salvation, as what is necessary from the matter; for in all hypothetical propositions, the supposition being in act, the matter becomes necessary. For, unless you speak of such a necessity, as becomes as universally obligatory, on suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Churches Definition, as that which ariseth from the matter, or absolute command; you are guilty of the greatest tergiversation, and perverting the state of the Question. For, otherwise that cannot be said to be fundamental or necessary to Salvation, in the sense of this Question, which is not generally necessary to Salvation to all Christians. For no man was ever so silly, as to imagine, that the Question of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> with a respect to whole <hi>Churches,</hi> as it is here taken, can be understood in any other sense, than as the matter, call'd <hi>Fundamental</hi> or <hi>Necessary,</hi> must be equally fundamental and necessary to all persons. And that this must be your meaning, appears by the rise of the Controversie, which concerns the whole <hi>Greek Church,</hi> which you exclude from being a <hi>Church,</hi> because she erres fundamentally, and that she errres fundamentally, because the <hi>Church</hi> hath defined it to be an errour. So that what the <hi>Church</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines as matter of Faith, is as necessary to be believed in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as that which is necessary from the matter, or from an absolute Command. For, otherwise the <hi>Greek Church</hi> might not be in a <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Errour,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Churches Definition</hi>: the ground of this <hi>Errour</hi> being <hi>Fundamental,</hi> not being derived from the matter, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Command, but from the <hi>Churches Definition.</hi> If therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of what the Church defines, doth exclude from Salvation; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and obligation must be equal to that which ariseth from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be believed. And if the Church defines any particulars to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly believed as necessary to Salvation, not only the <hi>not disbelieving</hi> them, but the <hi>not explicit believing them,</hi> will be as destructive to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if the matter of the things themselves were necessary; or that it were absolutely commanded; for in those cases you say, the not explicit believing is that which damns, and so on your principles it will do here, when the explicit belief is the thing defined by the Church. This will be more plain by an Instance. It is notoriously known, that at the shutting up of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> a <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> was drawn up, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> 4. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1564. and that, <hi>ut unius &amp; ejusdem fidei professio uniformit√®r ab omnibus exhibeatur, That the Profession of one and the same Faith, may be made known to all, and declared uniformally by all.</hi> In which Confession, after the enumeration of the <hi>Articles</hi> contained in the <hi>Ancient Creed</hi>; there are many others added concerning <hi>Traditions, Seven Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>Decrees of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>as to Original sin and Justification; The Sacrifice of the Mass, Transubstantiation, Communion in one kind, Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, Worship of Images, Indulgences, the Pope's Supremacy,</hi> &amp;c. All which are required to be believed with an equal assent to the former, as <hi>absolutely necessary to Salvation,</hi> and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conditions of <hi>Catholick Communion,</hi> For thus it ends; <hi>Hanc veram Catholicam Fidem, extra quam nemo salvus esse potest, quam in praesenti spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te profiteor, &amp; veraciter teneo, eandem integram &amp; inviolatam us<expan>

This true Catholick Faith, without which none can be saved, which at present I profess, and truly hold, and will do whole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled to my lives end,</hi> &amp;c. Judge you now, whether an equal explicit Faith be not here required to the Definitions of the Church, as to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101069:36"/>
Articles of the Creed; and if so, there must be an equal necessity, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Salvation, of believing both of them, it being here so expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that these Definitions are <hi>Integral Parts</hi> of that <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> without which there is <hi>no Salvation.</hi> And what could be more said of those things, whose matter or absolute precept do make them necessary? This Confession of Faith therefore, gives us the truest state of the present Question, in these particulars. 1. That the <hi>Definitions</hi> of the Church are to be believed, to be as necessary to Salvation, as the Articles of the <hi>Ancient Creed,</hi> without the belief of which no Salvation is to be expected. 2. That the <hi>explicit Belief</hi> of these Definitions as necessary to Salvation<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> may be required in order to <hi>Catholick Communion,</hi> and that they are to be believed of all as such, <hi>because</hi> they are defined by the <hi>Church.</hi> So that the Question is not, <hi>What is so required by the Churches Definition, declared and propounded to us, that it ought not to be dis-believed without mortal and damnable sin, which unrepented destroyes Salvation,</hi> as you stated it; for this seems only to respect the Faith of particular persons, who are to believe according as the <hi>Proposition</hi> may be judged <hi>sufficient:</hi> but the true state of the Question, is, Whether any <hi>Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> may be believed as <hi>Necessary Articles of Faith</hi>; and whether <hi>they may be imposed on others to be believed as such,</hi> so that they may be excluded <hi>Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> if they do not. For this is really the true state of the Question, between your Church, and ours, ever since the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>; and as to it thus stated (as it ought to be) I do most readily joyn issue with you.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of which important <hi>Question,</hi> on which the main cause of our being separated from your Communion depends,<note place="margin">¬ß. 3<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </note> these three things will be necessary to be exactly discussed. 1. <hi>What the Grounds are on which any thing doth become necessary to Salvation?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether any thing, whose matter is not necessary, and is not required by an absolute Command, can by any means whatsoever afterwards become necessary?</hi> 3. <hi>Whether the Church hath power by any Proposition or Definition to make any thing become necessary to Salvation, and to be believed as such, which was not so before?</hi> These three I suppose you cannot deny but will take in all that is considerable in this Controversie. Which I shall with the more care examine, because nothing tends more to the peace of the Christian World, than a through and clear discussion of it; and nothing causeth more the <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions</hi> of it, than the want of a right and due conception of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What the Grounds are on which any thing doth become necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> For our better understanding of which, we must consider two things. 1. <hi>What things are necessary to the Salvation of men as such, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in their single and private capacities?</hi> 2. <hi>What things are necessary to be owned in order to Salvation, by Christian Societies, or as the bonds and conditions of Ecclesiastical Communion?</hi> The want of understanding this distinction of the necessity of things, hath caused most of the perplexities and confusion in this Controversie of <hi>Fundamentals.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>What the Ground or Foundation is, on which things become necessary to be believed by particular persons?</hi> And that which is the true ground of the necessity, why any thing is to be believed, is the proper <hi>ratio</hi> of a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101069:37"/>
Article. For, I suppose it a much clearer notion of <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> to understand them, not as <hi>Principles,</hi> from whence Deductions may be drawn of <hi>Theological Truths</hi>; but in regard of that immediate respect which they have to mens Salvation. Those things therefore which are necessary to be explicitly believed by particular persons, are <hi>Fundamentals</hi> in order to their Salvation. Now all belief in this case supposing Divine <hi>Revelation,</hi> nothing can be imagined to be necessary to be believed, but what may be certainly known to be of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> But when we consider, that besides the general reason of believing what God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; we must either suppose, that all things are of equal necessity, which are revealed in order to the general end of this <hi>Revelation</hi>; or, that some things therein contained, are expresly necessary to the end, and other things to be believed on the general account of Faith, so far as they are known to be of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> Now from hence ariseth a twofold necessity of things to be believed; the first more general and large, the second more particular and absolute. The first depends upon the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reason</hi> of Faith; the second, on the particular <hi>end</hi> of <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> That which depends on the <hi>formal reason</hi> of that <hi>Assent</hi> we call <hi>Faith,</hi> is that which supposeth <hi>Divine Veracity,</hi> or the impossibility of Gods deceiving us in any thing revealed by Him; now this extends to all things whatsoever, which are supposed by men to be of <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For, though men may mistake in the matter, yet the reason of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent holding, under that mistake, they are bound necessarily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve whatever is supposed by them to be Divine <hi>Revelation.</hi> Here lyes no difficulty in the ground of Faith, but all the care is to be used in the search into the matters which are to be believed on the account of this <hi>Revelation.</hi> But here we are to consider, that the only thing which is in general and absolutely necessary to Salvation, is, the general act of Faith, <hi>viz. Believing whatever God reveals to be true,</hi> else God's Veracity would be call'd in question; but particular objects can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said, on this account, to be absolutely and universally necessary, but only so far as there are sufficient convictions, that those particulars are of Divine Revelation. And, the more general and extensive the means of conviction are, the more large and universal is the obligation to Faith. As, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> contain in them the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is a matter of more universal obligation, than particular things therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; because the belief of the one depends upon the acknowledgement of the other. And withall, supposing it believed, that the matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>Scripture</hi> are of <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>; yet all things are not <hi>equally clear to all capacities,</hi> that they are therein contained. Which is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for us, to say, It was not <hi>God's intention,</hi> that all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his Word, should be believed with the same degree of necessity by all persons. And therefore, though the general reason of Faith depends on <hi>Gods Veracity,</hi> yet the particular obligation to the belief of particular things, as revealed by God, depends on the <hi>means,</hi> whereby we may be assured, that such things are revealed by him: which means admitting of so great <hi>Variety,</hi> as to the circumstances and capacities of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, there can be no general <hi>Rule</hi> set down what things are necessary to be believed by all particular persons. For, those who have greater means of knowledge, a larger capacity, and clearer proposal, are bound to believe more things explicitly, than those who want all these, or have a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of them. In which case, it is an unreasonable thing to say, that such a one, who dis-believes any thing propounded to him as a matter of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101069:37"/>
Faith, doth presently call in question <hi>God's Veracity</hi>; for he may as firmly believe that as any in general, and yet may have ground to question whether <hi>God's Veracity</hi> be at all <hi>concerned</hi> in that which is propounded to him as a matter of Faith; because he sees no reason to believe that this was ever <hi>revealed by God.</hi> And, by this,<note place="margin">P. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For to instance in any one of those new Articles of Faith, <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> or the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> &amp;c. you tell me, These are necessary to be believed, or at least cannot be dis-believed without sin (which is all one in this case, supposing clear conviction, for then what cannot be dis-believed without sin, must be explicitly believed.) I desire to know the <hi>grounds</hi> why they may not? you tell me, These are truths which are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proposed to me, as defined by the Church for matters of Faith. I deny the Churches Proposition to be sufficient to convince me, that these are matters of Faith; for I understand not what Power your <hi>Church</hi> hath to <hi>define</hi> any thing for <hi>matter of Faith:</hi> if I granted that, I must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what you mean by <hi>sufficient Proposition</hi>; whether that your <hi>Church</hi> hath so defined them, or that she hath power so to define them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am heartily willing to believe any thing that I have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is a matter of Faith; certainly it can be no sin in me, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that which I can see no ground at all to believe, either in it self, or because of your <hi>Churches Definition.</hi> And all this while, I have as <hi>high</hi> thoughts of <hi>God's Veracity,</hi> as you can have, and it may be <hi>higher</hi>; because I <hi>interest</hi> it not in the <hi>false</hi> and <hi>contradictory Definitions</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi> If therefore you will prove it to be a damnable sin not to believe whatever is proposed by your <hi>Church</hi> for a matter of Faith, you must first prove, that there is as universal an obligation to believe whatever is <hi>sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> as defined by the <hi>Church</hi> for matter of Faith, as there is to assent to whatever <hi>God reveals as true.</hi> And when you have done this, I will give you leave to state the Question as you do: for then you would offer something to the proof of it, which now you do not. The substance then of what concerns the obligation to Faith, as to particular objects, on the account of <hi>Diuine Revelation,</hi> lyes in the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>conviction</hi> concerning those particular objects being divinely revealed, which being various, the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Assent</hi> must be various too: but yet so, that the more men are negligent of the means of conviction, the more culpable their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is; but where men use all moral diligence to understand what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and what not, if they cannot be convinced, that some particular thing is of Divine Revelation; it is hard to prove them guilty of mortal and damnable sin, without first proving, that <hi>God</hi> absolutely requires from men an <hi>Assent</hi> to that, which it is <hi>impossible</hi> in their <hi>Circumstances</hi> they should believe. And this is the <hi>first sort</hi> of things necessary to be believed by particular persons; <hi>such as are believed on the general account of God's Veracity in revealing them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because there must be a more particular reason assigned of any such intention in <hi>God</hi> to reveal his mind to the world,<note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. Some peculiar end</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:101069:38"/>
which he had in it; therefore a further degree of the necessity of things to be believed, must be enquired after, <hi>viz.</hi> such as have an immediate and necessary respect to the prosecution of that end. Now the only end assignable of that great expression of <hi>Divine Goodness,</hi> in declaring to man the <hi>Will of God,</hi> is the <hi>Eternal Welfare</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> of mankind, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else can be imagined suitable and proportionable to the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; besides that, this is expresly mentioned in <hi>Scripture</hi> as God's great end in it. Now this being the great end of Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the necessity of things to be believed absolutely and in themselves, must be taken from the reference or respect which they have to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this end. And, although the distinction be commonly received, of <hi>necessity of the means,</hi> and <hi>of the command,</hi> as importing a <hi>different kind of necessity,</hi> yet in the sense I here take Necessity in, the members of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction do to me seem <hi>coincident.</hi> For I cannot see any reason to believe that <hi>God</hi> should make the <hi>belief</hi> of any thing <hi>necessary,</hi> by an <hi>absolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> but what hath an immediate tendency by way of <hi>means,</hi> for the <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment</hi> of this <hi>end</hi>: For otherwise, that which is call'd the <hi>Necessity of Precept,</hi> falls under the former degree of <hi>Necessity, viz.</hi> That which is to be believed on the general account of Divine Revelation. And, although these things which are necessary, as <hi>means,</hi> are to be believed on the same <hi>formal reason</hi> of Faith; yet since <hi>God</hi> had a different <hi>end</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of these from the other, therefore there is a necessity of putting a difference between them. For, supposing <hi>God</hi> to have such a design to bring the souls of men to Happiness; in order to this end, some means must be <hi>necessary,</hi> and these must consequently be revealed to men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so necessary in order to such an end: now it is apparent, All things contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> are not of that nature; some being at so great a remove from this end, that the only reason of believing them, is, because they are contained in that Book, which we have the greatest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, contains nothing false in it. Now the only way whereby we may judge of the nature of these things, is, from the consideration of what is made the most necessary condition in order to happiness; and the way by which we may come to it. And nothing being more evident, than that the <hi>Gospel</hi> contains in it a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or the conditions on which our Salvation depends; whatever is necessary in order to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the conditions required of us, must be necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by all. The <hi>Gospel</hi> therefore tendring Happiness upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our <hi>believing in Christ, and walking in him</hi>; these two things are indispensably necessary to Salvation (where the <hi>Gospel</hi> is known, for we have no reason to enquire into the method of <hi>God's proceeding</hi> with others) <hi>An hearty Assent to the Doctrine of Christ,</hi> and <hi>A conscientious walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to the Precepts of it.</hi> But to undertake to define <hi>what parts</hi> of that Doctrine <hi>are necessary</hi> to Salvation, and <hi>what not,</hi> seems to me wholly unnecessary; because the <hi>Assent</hi> to the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed <hi>from God,</hi> must necessarily carry in it so much as is sufficient in order to Salvation. Whatever therefore is necessary to a <hi>Spiritual Life,</hi> is necessary absolutely to Salvation, and no more; but what, and how much that is, must be gathered by every one as to himself from <hi>Scripture</hi>; but is impossible to be defined by others, as to all persons. But in all <hi>Faith towards God, and in our Lord Jesus Christ; and repentance from dead works,</hi> are absolutely and indispensably necessary to Salvation, which imply in them, both an universal readiness of mind to believe and obey God in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101069:38"/>
all things: And by this we see, what the Rule and Measure of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of things to be believed is, as to particular persons; which lyes in these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whatever God hath revealed, is undoubtedly and infallibly true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whatever appears to me, upon sufficient enquiry, to be revealed by God, I am bound to believe it by virtue of God's Veracity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>All things not equally appearing to all persons to be revealed of God, the same measure of necessity cannot be extended to all persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>An universal Assent to the Will of God, and universal Obedience to it, are absolutely and indispensably necessary to all persons, to whom God's Word is revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much may suffice concerning what is necessary to be believed by particular persons, considered as such.</p>
               <p>But this controversie never need break <hi>Christian Societies</hi> in that sense,<note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> but the great difficulty lyes in the other part of it, which is most commonly strangely confounded with the former, <hi>viz. What things are necessary to be owned, in order to Church-Societies, or Ecclesiastical Communion?</hi> For which, we must consider, that the combination of <hi>Christian Societies,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> that which we call the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> doth subsist upon the <hi>belief</hi> of what is necessary to Salvation. For the very notion of a <hi>Christian Church</hi> doth imply the belief of all those things, which are necessary in order to the end of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which is mens eternal Happiness. From whence three things must be taken notice of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the very being of a Church, doth suppose the necessity of what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be believed in order to Salvation.</hi> For else there could not be such a thing as a <hi>Church</hi> imagined, which is only a combination of men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon the belief of such a Doctrine as necessary to Salvation; and for the performance of those acts of Worship which are suitable thereto: Therefore to assert the <hi>Church</hi> to have power to make things necessary to Salvation, is not only absurd, but destructive to the <hi>Being</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> For when it offer'd to define any thing to be necessary, which was not so before, was it a <hi>Church</hi> or no? If it was a <hi>Church,</hi> it believed all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; if it believed <hi>all things</hi> necessary, before it <hi>Defined</hi>; how comes it to make <hi>more things</hi> necessary by its <hi>Definition?</hi> But of this more afterwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whatever Church owns those things which are antecedently necessary to the Being of a Church, cannot so long cease to be a true Church.</hi> Because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that which is the Foundation of the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Here we must distinguish those things in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which give its <hi>Being,</hi> from those things which are the proper <hi>Acts</hi> of it, as the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi> As to this latter, the solemn Worship of God in the way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by him, is necessary; in order to which there must be supposed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Officers</hi> set in the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> duly administred: but these, I say, are rather the <hi>Exercise</hi> of the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Catholick Church, than that which gives its <hi>Being,</hi> which is, the belief of that <hi>Religion</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its <hi>Subsistence</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> depends; and as long as a Church retains this, it keeps its Being, though the <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of it depends upon the due exercise of all acts of Communion in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Vnion of the Catholick Church depends upon the agreement of it, in making the Foundations of its Being, to be the grounds of its Communion.</hi> For the <hi>Vnity</hi> being intended to preserve the <hi>Being,</hi> there can be no reason given, why the bonds of <hi>Vnion</hi> should extend beyond the <hi>Foundation</hi> of its Being, which is, the owning the things necessary to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101069:39"/>
all. From whence it necessarily follows, that whatsoever <hi>Church</hi> impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the belief of other things <hi>as necessary to Salvation,</hi> which were not so antecedently necessary to the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> doth, as much as in it lyes, break the <hi>Vnity</hi> of it; and those <hi>Churches,</hi> who desire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve its <hi>Vnity,</hi> are bound thereby not to have communion with it so long as it doth so. Of what great consequence these principles are to the true understanding the Distance between our Church and yours, if you <hi>see</hi> not now, you may <hi>feel</hi> afterwards.</p>
               <p>These things being premised, I come to that which is the main subject of the present Dispute,<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> which is, <hi>What those things are which ought to be owned by all Christian-Societies as necessary to Salvation, on which the Being of the Catholick Church depends.</hi> If we can find any sure footing for the <hi>Definition</hi> of these, we shall thereby find what the necessary conditions of <hi>Ecclesiastical Communion</hi> are, and consequently where the proper cause of <hi>Schism</hi> lyes in transgressing those bounds, and what Foundations may be laid for the Peace of the Christian world. Which being of so vast impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, would require a larger discussion, than this place will admit of: but so far as is pertinent to our present subject, I shall enquire into it; and give an account of my thoughts, in these Propositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Nothing ought to be owned as necessary to Salvation by Christian-Societies, but such things, which, by the judgement of all those Societies, are antecedently necessary to the Being of the Catholick Church.</hi> For, no reason can be assigned (as I said before) why the <hi>Bonds</hi> of Union should be extended beyond that which is the <hi>Churches Foundation</hi>; neither can there any reason be given why any thing else should be judged necessary to the <hi>Churches Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> but what all those <hi>Churches</hi> (who do not manifestly dissent from the Catholick Church of the first Ages) are agreed in, as necessary to be believed by all; this will be further explained afterwards. Only I add here, when I speak of the necessary conditions of <hi>Ecclesiastical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> I speak of such things which must be owned as <hi>Necessary Articles of Faith,</hi> and not of any other <hi>Agreements</hi> for the <hi>Churches Peace.</hi> I deny not therefore, but that in case of great <hi>Divisions</hi> in the <hi>Christian world,</hi> and any <hi>National Churches reforming it self,</hi> that <hi>Church</hi> may declare its sense of those abuses in <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> and require of men a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> to them; but then we are to consider, that there is a great deal of difference between the owning some Propositions in order to Peace, and the believing of them as necessary Articles of Faith. And this is clearly the state of the difference between the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> imposeth new <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> to be believed as <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi>; as appears by the formerly cited <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> 4. Which Articles contain in them the Justification of those things which are most excepted against by other <hi>Churches</hi>; and by her imposing these as the conditions of her Communion, she makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for other <hi>Churches,</hi> who would preserve the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> upon her true <hi>Foundations,</hi> to forbear her Communion. But the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> makes no <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but such as have the <hi>Testimony</hi> and <hi>Approbation</hi> of the whole Christian world of all ages, and are acknowledged to be such by <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and in other things she requires <hi>Subscription</hi> to them not as <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> but as <hi>Inferiour Truths,</hi> which she expects a submission to, in order to her Peace and Tranquillity. So the late learned <hi>L. Primate</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> often expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as to her <hi>thirty nine Articles.

                  <hi>yet neither do we look upon them as Essentials of Saving Faith, or Legacies of Christ and his Apostles: but in a mean, as pious Opinions fitted for the preservation of Vnity; neither do we oblige any man to believe them, but only not to contradict them.</hi> By which we see, what a vast difference there is between those things which are required by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in order to Peace; and those which are imposed by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as part of that <hi>Faith, extra quam non est salus,</hi> without belief of which there is no Salvation. In which she hath as much violated the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by her <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> hath studied to preserve it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nothing ought to be imposed as a necessary Article of Faith to be believed by all, but what may be evidently propounded to all persons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 7<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>as a thing which God did require the explicit belief of.</hi> It being impossible to make any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a necessary Article of Faith, but what may not only be evidently proved to be revealed by <hi>God,</hi> but that <hi>God</hi> doth oblige all men to the belief of it in order to Salvation. And therefore none of those things, whose obligation doth depend on <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Circumstances,</hi> ought in reason be made the <hi>Bonds</hi> of that <hi>Communion</hi> which cannot take notice of that <hi>variety</hi> as to mens conditions and capacities. There are many things in <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which, whosoever believes the truth of it, cannot but easily discern to be necessary in order to the profession and practice of it, in most of which the common sense and reason of mankind is agreed. Not only the <hi>Existence of a Deity,</hi> the clear discovery of the <hi>Wisdom, Goodness</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of God, with his <hi>Providence</hi> over the world, and the <hi>Immortality</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> being therein most evidently revealed; but, the way and manner of the restitution of mens souls by <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> as our only <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Commands,</hi> is so fully laid down in the clearest terms, that no rational man, who considers the nature of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> but must assert the profession of all these things to be necessary to all such, who own Christian Religion to be true. But there are many other things in Christian Religion, which are neither so clearly revealed in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor unanimously assented to in any age of the <hi>Christian Church</hi>; and, why any such things should be made the conditions of that <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> whose very being depends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on necessary things, would puzzle a <hi>Philosopher</hi> to understand. As if none should be accounted <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> but such as could square circles; and none <hi>Naturalists,</hi> but such as could demonstrate whether quantity were infinitely divisible or no: much so it is, if none should be accounted members of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but such as own the truth and necessity of some at least as disputable Points, as any in Religion. Let therefore any <hi>Romanist</hi> tell me, whether the <hi>Pope's Supremacy</hi> be as clear in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as that <hi>Christ is Saviour of the world</hi>; whether <hi>Purgatory</hi> be as plain as <hi>Eternal Life; Transubstantiation</hi> as evident, as that the <hi>Eucharist ought to be administred</hi>; whether <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> be as manifest, as the <hi>Adoration of God</hi>; the Doctrine of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> as <hi>Repentance from dead works</hi>; and if there be so great a clearness in the Revelation of the one,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101069:40"/>
and so far from it as to the other; let them give any just account why the belief of the one is made as necessary to Salvation as the other is. Certainly, such who take in things at least so disputable as all these are, and enforce the belief of them in order to their Communion, cannot otherwise be thought but to have a design to exclude a great part of the Christian world from their Communion; and, to do so, and then cry out of them as <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> is the most unreasonable proceedings in the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Nothing ought to be required as a necessary Article of Faith, but what hath been believed and received for such by the Catholick Church of all Ages.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> For, since necessary Articles of Faith are supposed to be so antecedently to the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> since the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the continual acknowledgement of such things as are necessary to be believed, it is but just and reasonable to admit nothing as necessary, but what appears to have been so universally received. Thence it is, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, Vniversality,</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> are so much insisted on by <hi>Vincentius Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinensis,</hi> in order to the proving any thing to be a necessary Article of Faith. But the great difficulty of this lyes in finding out what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for a necessary Article of Faith, and what was not by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; which being a subject, as necessary, as seldom spoken to, I shall not leave it untouched, although I must premise, that Rule to be much more useful in discovering what was not looked on as a necessary Article of Faith, than what was; and therefore I begin with that first.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is sufficient evidence, that was not looked on as a necessary Article of Faith, <hi>which was not admitted into the Ancient Creeds.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all those Declarations which were inserted in the enlargements of the <hi>Apostolical Creed,</hi> by the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and in that <hi>Creed</hi> which goes under the name of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> were really judged by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of all <hi>Ages,</hi> to be necessary to Salvation, is not here my business to enquire; but there seems to be a great deal of reason for the <hi>Negative,</hi> that what was not inserted in the <hi>Ancient Creeds,</hi> was not by them judged necessary to be believed by all Christians. I know, it is said by some of your party, <hi>That the Apostolical Creed did only contain those Articles which were necessary to be believed, in opposition to the present Heresies which were then in the Church.</hi> As though the necessity of believing in Christians, came only by an <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> of the opposition of <hi>Hereticks</hi>; And if there had been no Hereticks to have denyed <hi>God's being the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and Christ's being the Saviour</hi>; it had not been necessary to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved either of them so explicitly as now we do. But when we speak of all things necessary to be believed by all; I mean not, that all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of things contained in those <hi>Creeds</hi> are necessary to be believed in order to Salvation; but, that all those things which were judged as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed by all, were therein inserted, will appear to any one who either considers the expressions of the <hi>Ancients</hi> concerning the <hi>Creeds</hi> then in Use; or the primary reason why such <hi>Summaries</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> were ever made in the Christian Church. The testimonies of the <hi>Fathers</hi> to this purpose are so well known in this subject, that it were a needless task to repeat them, who so unanimously assert the <hi>sufficiency,</hi>

sole Confession of Evangelical Doctrine.</hi> Of all which, and many more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions to the same purpose, produced not only by our Writers, but by yours too, no tolerable sense can be made, without asserting, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was judged necessary to be believed by all, by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of that <hi>Age</hi> they lived in, or before them, was therein contained. Besides, what account can be given why any such <hi>Summaries</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> should at all be made either by <hi>Apostles,</hi> or <hi>Apostolical persons</hi>; but only for that end, that necessary <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> might be reduced into such a compass, as might become portable to the weakest capacities? If the rise of <hi>Creeds</hi> were (as most probable it was) from the things propounded, to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens,</hi> to be believed in order to Baptism, can we reasonably think, that any thing judged necessary to be believed, should be left out? If the <hi>Apostolical Creed</hi> be a summary comprehension of that <hi>Form of sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which the <hi>Apostles</hi> delivered to all Christians at their first conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (as it is generally supposed) either we must think the <hi>Apostles</hi> unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their work, or the <hi>Creed</hi> an unfaithful account of their Doctrine, or that such things which were supposed universally necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, are therein comprehended. Which is sufficient for my purpose, that nothing ought to be looked on as a necessary Article of Faith, or was so esteemed by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which is not contained in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Creeds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nothing ought to be judged a necessary Article of Faith, but, <hi>what was universally believed by the Catholick Church, to be delivered as such by Christ, or his Apostles.</hi> So that it is not the judgement, but the testimony of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which must be relyed on, and that testimony on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when universal, as delivering what was once infallibly delivered by <hi>Christ,</hi> or his <hi>Apostles.</hi> From whence it follows, that any one who will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to make out any thing as a necessary Article of Faith, by <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tradition</hi> meerly, must do these things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He must make it appear to be universally embraced at all times, and in all places, by such who were members of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That none ever opposed it, but he was presently disowned as no member of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> because opposing something necessary to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it be delivered by all those Writers of the <hi>Church,</hi> who give an account of the <hi>Faith of Christians,</hi> or what was delivered by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That it was not barely looked on as necessary to be believed by such as might be convinced it was of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> but that it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a necessity of its being explicitly believed by all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That what is deliver'd by the consent of the <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> was undoubtedly the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of those ages.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That all those <hi>Writers</hi> agree not only in the <hi>Belief</hi> of the thing it self, but of the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it to all Christians.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That no <hi>Writers</hi> or <hi>Fathers</hi> of succeeding <hi>Ages,</hi> can be supposed to <hi>alter</hi> in the belief either of the matters believed before, or the necessity of them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That no oppositions of Hereticks, or heats of Contention, could make them judge any Article so opposed, to be <hi>more necessary,</hi> than it was judged before that Contention; or they themselves would have judged it, had it not been so opposed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That when they affirm many <hi>Traditions</hi> to be <hi>Apostolical,</hi> which yet
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101069:41"/>
varied in several Churches, they could not affirm any <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical,</hi> which they were not universally agreed in.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That when they so plainly assert the sufficiency of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as a Rule of Faith, they did yet believe something necessary to Salvation, which was not contained therein.</p>
               <p>When you, or any one else, will undertake to make good these condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I shall then begin to believe, that something may be made appear to be a necessary Article of Faith, which is not clearly revealed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but not before: but till then, this <hi>Negative</hi> will suffice, that nothing ought to be embraced, as the judgement of the Church concerning a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Article of Faith, but what appears to be clearly revealed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and universally embraced by the Catholick Church of all Ages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nothing ought to be looked on as a necessary Article of Faith, by the judgement of the Catholick Church, the <hi>denyal of which was not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally opposed, and condemned as Heresie.</hi> For otherwise the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> was very little sensible of the honour of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> if it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered dissenters in necessary things, without putting a mark of dishonour upon them. Therefore we may conclude, that whatever was patiently born with in such as dissented from the generality of Christians, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if considerable <hi>persons</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> were the authors or fomenters of such opinions, however true the contrary Doctrine was supposed to be, yet it was not supposed necessary, because then the opposers would have been condemned of Heresie, by some open act of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note>But if, beyond these <hi>Negatives,</hi> we would enquire what was positively believed as necessary to Salvation, by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; we shall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find any better way, than by the Articles of the <hi>Ancient Creeds,</hi> and the universal opposition of any new Doctrine on its firsts appearance, and the condemning the broachers of it for <hi>Heresie</hi> in <hi>Oecumenical Councils,</hi> with the continual disapprobation of those Doctrines by the <hi>Christian Churches of all Ages.</hi> As is clear in the cases of <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Pelagius.</hi> For it seems very reasonable to judge, that since the necessary Articles of Faith were all delivered by the <hi>Apostles</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> since the foundation of that <hi>Church</hi> lyes in the belief of those things, which are <hi>necessary,</hi> that nothing should be delivered contrary to any <hi>necessary Article of Faith</hi> but the <hi>Church,</hi> by some <hi>evident act,</hi> must declare its dislike of it, and its resolution thereby to adhere to that necessary Doctrine, which was <hi>once delivered to the Saints.</hi> And withall, it seems reasonable, that because Art and Subtilty may be used by such who seek to pervert the <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi> and to wrest the plain places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, so far from their proper meaning, that very few ordinary capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be able to clear themselves of such mists as are cast before their eyes; the sense of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in succeeding ages, may be a very useful way for us to embrace the true sense of Scripture, especially in the great Articles of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> As for instance, in the Doctrine of the <hi>Deity of Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Trinity</hi>; though the subtilty of such Modern Hereticks, who oppose either of these, may so far prevail on persons, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not of sufficient judgement, or not sufficiently versed in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as at present to make them acknowledge the places are not so clear as they imagined them to be; yet they being alwaies otherwise interpreted by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or the <hi>Christian Societies</hi> of all ages, layes this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent prejudice against all such attempts, as not to believe such interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <hi>true,</hi> till they give a just account, why, if the belief of these <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:101069:41"/>
were not <hi>necessary,</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> of all ages from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, did so unanimously agree in them, that when any began first to oppose them, they were declared and condemned for <hi>Hereticks</hi> for their pains. So that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth very piously declare her consent with the Ancient <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in not admitting any thing to be delivered as the sense of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is contrary to the consent of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> in the four first ages. Not as though the sense of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> were pretended to be any infallible Rule of interpreting <hi>Scripture</hi> in all things which concern the Rule of Faith; but that it is a sufficient <hi>Prescription</hi> against any thing which can be alledged out of Scripture, that if it appear contrary to the sense of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it ought not to be looked on as the true <hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> All this security is built upon this strong presumption, that nothing contrary to the necessary <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> should he held by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> whose very being depends upon the belief of those things which are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation. As long therefore as the <hi>Church</hi> might appear to be truly <hi>Catholick</hi> by those correspondencies which were maintained between the several parts of it, that what was refused by one, was so by all; so long this unanimous and uncontradicted sense of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> ought to have a great sway upon the minds of such who yet profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves members of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> From whence it follows, that such Doctrines may well be judged destructive to the Rule of Faith, which were so unanimously condemned by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> within that time. And thus much may suffice for the first Inquiry, <hi>viz. What things are to be esteemed necessary, either in order to Salvation, or in order to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether any thing which was not necessary to Salvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>may by any means whatsoever afterwards become necessary, so that the not believing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes damnable, and unrepented destroyes Salvation?</hi> We suppose the Question to proceed on such things as could not antecedently to such an act whereby they now become necessary, be esteemed to be so, either from the matter, or from any express command. For you in terms assert a necessity of believing distinct from the matter, and absolute command, and hath the <hi>Churches Definition</hi> for its <hi>formal object,</hi> which makes the necessity of our Faith continually to depend upon the Churches Definition; but this strange kind of <hi>Ambulatory Faith,</hi> I shall now shew to be repugnant, to the design of Christ and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> in making known Christian Religion, and to all evidence of Reason, and directly contrary to the plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicted sense of the <hi>Primitive and Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is contrary to the <hi>design of Christ and his Apostles,</hi> in making known the Christian Religion to the world. For, if the design of Christ was to declare whatever was necessary to the Salvation of mankind, if the <hi>Apostles</hi> were sent abroad for this very end, then either they were very <hi>unfaithful</hi> in discharge of their trust, or else they taught <hi>all things necessary</hi> for their Salvation; and, if they did so, how can any thing become <hi>necessary,</hi> which they did never teach? Was it not the great Promise concerning the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> that at his coming, <hi>the Earth should be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea</hi>; that then <hi>they shall all be taught of God?</hi> Was not this the just expectation of the people concerning him,<note place="margin">Isa. 11.9. Joh. 6.45. Joh. 4.25. Joh. 15.15.</note> 
                  <hi>That when he came he would tell them all things?</hi> Doth not he tell his Disciples, <hi>That all things I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you?</hi> And, for all this, is there something still remaining necessary to Salvation, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101069:42"/>
neither he, nor his Disciples, did ever make known to the world? Doth not he <hi>promise Life and Salvation to all such as believe and obey his Doctrine?</hi> And can any thing be necessary for eternal life, which he never declared? or did he only promise it to the men of that <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Generation,</hi> and leave others to the <hi>mercy</hi> of the <hi>Churches Definitions?</hi> If this be so, we have sad cause to lament our condition, upon whom these <hi>heavy loyns</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> are fallen: how happy had we been, if we had lived in <hi>Christs,</hi> or the <hi>Apostles times</hi>; for then we might have been saved, though we had never believed the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> or <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> or <hi>Worshipping Images</hi>; but now the case is altered; these <hi>Milstones</hi> are now hung about our necks, and how we shall swim to Heaven with them, who knows? How strangely mistaken was our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he said, <hi>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed</hi>; For, much more blessed certainly were they, who did see him, and believe in him; for then he would undertake for their Salvation; but now, it seems, we are out of his reach, and turned over to the <hi>Merciless Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>present Church.</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> told his Disciples, <hi>His yoke was easie, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light</hi>; he little thought, what <hi>Power</hi> he had left in the <hi>Church</hi> to lay on so much <hi>load,</hi> as might <hi>cripple</hi> mens belief; were it not for a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in a corner, call'd <hi>Implicit Faith.</hi> When he sent the <hi>Apostles to teach all that he commanded them,</hi> he must be understood so, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath power to teach <hi>more</hi> if she pleases; and though the <hi>Apostles,</hi> poor men, were bound up by this commission, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself too, yet his <hi>Infallible Successors</hi> have a <hi>Paramount Priviledge</hi> beyond them all. Though the <hi>Spirit</hi> was promised to the Apostles, <hi>to lead them into all Truth,</hi> yet there must be no incongruity, in saying, They understood not some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Truths (for how should they, when never revealed) as <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, Supremacy, &amp;c.</hi> Because, though they never dreamt of such things, yet the <hi>Infallible Church</hi> hath done it since for them; and, to say truth, though the <hi>Apostles</hi> names were put into the promise, yet they were but <hi>Feoffees</hi> in trust for the <hi>Church,</hi> and the benefit comes to the Church by them. For they were only <hi>Tutors</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> in its minority, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it some <hi>poor Rudiments of Christ and Heaven,</hi> of <hi>Faith and Obedience, &amp;c.</hi> But the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>Divine Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>seven Sacraments, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Worship of Images, Sacrifice of the Mass, &amp;c.</hi> were not fit to be made known till the <hi>Church</hi> were <hi>at age</hi> her self, and knew how to declare her own mind. When S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks so much of the <hi>great Mysteries hidden from Ages and Generations, but now made known,</hi> it must be understood with a reference to those <hi>silly people</hi> who lived in <hi>that Age</hi>; but there were <hi>greater Mysteries</hi> than these, which neither <hi>Christ,</hi> nor any <hi>of his Apostles</hi> were ever acquainted with, as <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and those before mentioned; for these were reserved as the <hi>Churches Portion,</hi> when her <hi>Infallibility-ship</hi> should come <hi>to Age.</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> honest man, spake as he thought, when he told not the common people, but the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Church, That he had not shunned to declare unto them all the Counsel of God</hi>;<note place="margin">Act. 20.27.</note> but if he had lived to our <hi>Age,</hi> he would have heard of this mistake with both ears; and if he had not sworn the contrary, he must have been contented to have been call'd <hi>Schismatick</hi> and <hi>Heretick</hi> a thousand times over. These are all the just and rare consequences of your <hi>Churches blessed Infallibility, and Power of Defining things necessary, which were not so in Christ, or his Apostles times.</hi> But, the greatest <hi>knack</hi> of all is yet behind; for men are bound to believe all the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Apostolical,</hi> and yet that your <hi>Church</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:101069:42"/>
hath power to make things necessary to be believed, which were not so in the <hi>Apostolical times.</hi> Yes, say you, <hi>They were Doctrines then, but not so necessary as now, because they had not the Churches Definition.</hi> It seems, at last, the <hi>Apostles</hi> knew them, but did not understand the worth of them; else, no doubt, they were such charitable souls, they would have declared them to the world. <hi>Blessed S. Paul,</hi> who was continually employed in teaching and instructing men in the way to Salvation, could he have held back any thing that had tended to it, when he sayes, <hi>He kept back nothing that was profitable to them, but shewed them, and taught them publickly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20.20, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>and from house to house, testifying to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> What, not one word of the necessary Points all this while? nothing of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor <hi>Christ's Vicar on Earth,</hi> and <hi>his Infallibility?</hi> How slily and cunningly did S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Apostles</hi> carrie it, if they had believed these things; never let one word drop from their mouths or pens concerning them? and instead of that, speak so, and write so, that one that believes them honest, would swear they never heard of them. In what another kind of strain would S. <hi>Paul</hi> have writ to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> if he had had but any inckling of the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> being placed there? How soon would he have blotted out the whole 14. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> if he had known his <hi>Holiness</hi> his pleasure about <hi>serving God in an unknown tongue?</hi> How well might he have spared saying, <hi>That a Bishop should be the Husband of one Wife,</hi> if he had known <hi>de jure divino</hi> he must have none at all? At what another rate would he have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> had he believed <hi>Transubstantiation, Sacrifice of the Mass, Communion under one kind?</hi> What course would he have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the <hi>Schismatical Corinthians,</hi> that were divided like other <hi>Churches,</hi> if he had known the <hi>Infallible Judge of Controversie?</hi> If he had but understood the danger of <hi>reading Scriptures,</hi> he might have spared his exhortations to the people <hi>of the Word of God dwelling richly in them,</hi> and filled his Epistles with <hi>Pater Nosters,</hi> and <hi>Ave Mary's,</hi> or given good directions about them. But he must be pardoned, he was ignorant of these things, as well as we: only S. <hi>Paul</hi> never heard of them, and we do not believe them; because neither he, nor his Brethren ever revealed them to us, though they were the <hi>Stewards of the Mysteries of God</hi>; and they tell us themselves, That <hi>it is requisite such should be faithful,</hi> which we cannot understand how they could be, if they knew these deep Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but never discovered them that we can learn. But, if they knew them not, I pray from whence is it your <hi>Church</hi> learns them? <hi>By imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inspiration? no,</hi> as bold as you are, you dare not challenge that: but whence then come you to know them to be necessary? <hi>infallibly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth:</hi> But whence comes this <hi>Infallibility?</hi> must there not be a <hi>peculiar Revelation,</hi> to discover that to be necessary, which was never discovered to be so before? But if discovered before, and declared before, the things were as necessary before your <hi>Churches Definition,</hi> as after; and therefore your <hi>Churches Definition</hi> adds nothing of <hi>necessity</hi> to them. If <hi>neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,</hi> nor <hi>declared,</hi> you must have particular <hi>Revelation</hi> for them, and then <hi>work miracles,</hi> and we will believe you, but not otherwise; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you do it, consider what S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath said concerning <hi>an Angel from Heaven preaching another Gospel, let him be accursed</hi>; and what can be more <hi>preaching another Gospel,</hi> than making other things <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> than <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> did; and think then what your <hi>Church</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101069:43"/>
for all her <hi>Definitions</hi> concerning <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> or things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be believed in order to Salvation. But yet further you say, <hi>That these things were declared by the Apostles, but they need a further Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration now:</hi> And why so? shew us the <hi>Apostle's Declaration,</hi> and it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth us; we shall not believe them one jot the more for your additional Definition. And it is surely a sign, you did not think the <hi>Apostles Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> sufficient, or else you would never pretend to new ones. Perhaps you will tell us, <hi>It was to their Age, but not to ours</hi>? why not, as well as the other necessary Articles of Faith contained in <hi>Scripture</hi>? I know your Answer is, <hi>We can know no necessary Article of Faith at all; but from your Church.</hi> So then, we have brought all into a narrow compass, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of new <hi>Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> concerning necessary things, we can know nothing at all to be <hi>necessary to be believed,</hi> but from your <hi>Church.</hi> This is <hi>high,</hi> but the <hi>higher</hi> it is, the <hi>better Foundation</hi> it had need stand on, which we shall throughly search into; in the Controversie of the resolution of Faith: to which we referr it, and return. If there were once a <hi>Declaration,</hi> but still there needs <hi>another,</hi> What is become of that <hi>Declaration?</hi> was it lost in its passage down to us? how then was that present <hi>Church infallible,</hi> which <hi>lost a Declaration</hi> in matter of Faith? was it necessary to be believed in the intermediate <hi>Age</hi> or no? if it was, then it was not <hi>lost,</hi> and then what need a new <hi>Declaration</hi>? if not, then a thing once <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> may be <hi>not necessary</hi> to Salvation, and become <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi> again. But still we have cause to envy their happiness, who lived in the Age when they might be saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out believing these things: for the case goes hard with us, for you tell us, Unless we believe them necessary, we cannot be saved; and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences tell us, that if we did profess to believe them necessary, when we do not, and cannot, we cannot be saved. What a case then were we in, if the <hi>Pope</hi> were <hi>Christ's Vicar</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as he pretends to <hi>be on Earth</hi>; but it is our comfort, he is neither so, nor so. Thus we see what repugnancy there is both to <hi>Scirpture</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> in this strange Doctrine of your <hi>Churches Definitions, making things necessary to Salvation, which were not so before.</hi>

               <p>And we are highly obliged to you, for the rare Divertisements you give us in your excellent way of managing Controversies.

In the first place, you charge his Lordship with a Fallacy, and that is, because, when he was to speak of Fundamentals, he did not speak of that which was not Fundamental.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>But,</hi> say you, <hi>He turns the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, which only proceeded upon a Fundamentality or Necessity, derived from the formal Object, that is, from the Divine Authority revealing that Point, to the Material Object, that is, to the importance of the Matter contained in the Point revealed; which is a plain Fallacy, in passing √† sensu formali ad materia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Men seldom suspect those faults in others, which they find not strong inclinations to in themselves; had you not been conscious of a notorious <hi>Fallacy</hi> in this distinction of <hi>Formal and Material Object,</hi> as here applyed by you; you would never have suspected any such <hi>Sophistry</hi> in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Discourse. I pray consider what kind of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> those are, which the <hi>Question</hi> proceeds on, <hi>viz.</hi> such as are necessary to be owned as such by <hi>all Churches,</hi> in order to their being <hi>true Churches,</hi> as is plain by the rise of this Controversie; for Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> was proving the <hi>Greek Church to be no true Church,</hi> and, in order to that, proves, that <hi>she erred Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally,</hi> for which he makes <hi>Vse</hi> of this <hi>Medium</hi>; That, <hi>whatever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Church is Fundamental.</hi> So that the whole Process of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute lyes thus. TWhat ever <hi>Church</hi> is guilty of a <hi>Fundamental Errour,</hi> ceaseth to be a <hi>true Church</hi>; but the <hi>Greek Church</hi> is guilty of a <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Errour; <hi>ergo.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> being denyed, he thus proves it: <hi>If what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is defined by the Church be Fundamental, then the Greek Church is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Fundamental errour, because she denyes something defined by the Church; but whatever is defined by the Church is Fundamental</hi>; which is the thing his Lordship denyes, and his adversary is bound to prove. So that any one who was not resolved to wink as hard as you do, might easily see, the state of the Controversie doth not concern what things are <hi>Fundamental,</hi> supposing men know them to be <hi>sufficiently propounded</hi>; but what things are so necessary to be owned for <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> that upon the denying them, a <hi>Church</hi> ceaseth to be a <hi>true Church.</hi> Yet this mistake as gross and palpable, as it is, runs through your whole Discourse of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> which, without it cannot hold together. If you will therefore prove, that, besides such things whose necessity ariseth from the matter, there are other from the Formal Object, which all <hi>Churches</hi> are equally bound to believe, in order to their being <hi>true Churches,</hi> you do something; but not before.</p>
               <p>But we must still attend your Motions, especially when they tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proofs, as yours do now. For, say you, <hi>Now I shew (the difficulty being understood, as it ought to be of the Formal Object, whereby Points of Faith are manifested to Christians) that all Points defined by the Church as matter of Faith, are Fundamental; that is, necessary to Salvation to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by all those to whom they are sufficiently propounded to be so
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101069:44"/>
defined by this Argument. Whosoever refuseth to believe any thing sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounded to him for a truth revealed from God, commits a sin damnable and destructive of Salvation: But, whosoever refuses to believe any Point suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propounded to him for defined by the Church as matter of Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses to believe a thing sufficiently propounded to him for a truth revealed from God.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Whosoever refuses to believe any Point sufficiently propounded to him for defined by the Church as matter of Faith, commits a sin damnable and destructive of Salvation.</hi> Before you proceed to the proof of your <hi>Minor,</hi> several things must here be considered, that we may better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand your meaning, and know what it is you intend to prove. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially what you intend by <hi>sufficient Proposition.</hi> Do you mean such a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition as carries evidence along with it, or not? in which case the very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the terms, is <hi>sufficient Proposition,</hi> as that, <hi>two and two make four</hi>; but, I suppose, you mean not this, therefore it must be the <hi>sufficient Proposition of something which wants natural evidence</hi>; and therefore some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else must be required, besides, the propounding the thing to make the Proposition be said to be sufficient. For <hi>Sufficiency</hi> relates to some <hi>end</hi>; so that a sufficient Proposition must be such a <hi>Proposition</hi> as is <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> for its end: now the end of the <hi>Proposition</hi> of <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> is, that they may be <hi>believed</hi>; and therefore the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Proposition</hi> lyes in the <hi>Arguments</hi> or <hi>Motives</hi> inducing men to believe. Now the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> being of a different nature, the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Proposition</hi> must be taken from a respect to them: for in things which are so clearly revealed, as necessary to Salvation, that none who acknowledge the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be God's Word,</hi> can doubt but such things are necessary; in this case the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Proposition</hi> lyes in the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and the clearness of it to all understandings who consider it, and the <hi>Reasons</hi> or <hi>Motives</hi> of Faith in that case, are the same with those which induce men to believe, that the <hi>Scripture it self is from Divine Revelation.</hi> But, there being other things in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which neither appear so clear, or so necessary to be believed by all, something else is required in order to a <hi>sufficient Proposition</hi> of them, and in order to the making any of these things universally obligatory to <hi>Christians</hi> on pain of damnation, for not believing them these things are necessary. 1. It must be <hi>much clearer</hi> than the thing which is propounded to be believed on the account of it; for, to propound a thing to be believed by something at least as dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as the matter it self, cannot certainly be call'd a <hi>sufficient Proposition.</hi> 2. It must be <hi>antecedently proved</hi> to be a true and certain Proposition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing can be believed on the account of it. For, if men cannot see any reason to believe that there is any <hi>necessary Connexion</hi> between that which you call a sufficient Proposition, and any matter of Faith; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be guilty of any sin at all in not believing what you think is sufficiently propounded. But, in this case, it is not your judgement, what <hi>Proposition</hi> is sufficient that makes it so, but the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> and the <hi>Evidence</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath appointed that way to reveal his Will to men, and that what is so propounded is necessary to be believed. As for instance, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you were told by the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> that to believe the <hi>Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, jure divino,</hi> were a damnable sin, and that whosoever did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this being sufficiently propounded to them as a matter of Faith, as defined by the <hi>Church,</hi> were guilty of a sin destructive to Salvation, what answer would you return in this case? Would you not say, That the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> though judged <hi>sufficient</hi> by them, is not judged so by you; and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101069:45"/>
that they must first prove, that whatever their <hi>Church defines</hi> as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith, is to be believed for such, before the other can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on the account of it. Just the same answer we return to you; prove first of all to us in a clear and evident manner, that <hi>God</hi> hath appointed the <hi>Definition</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> as the means whereby we may be infallibly <hi>assured,</hi> what is <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and what not; and then we may grant, that what your <hi>Church</hi> propounds as a matter of Faith, is sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as a matter revealed from God, but not before. For, while I see no reason to believe the <hi>Churches Proposition</hi> to be <hi>sufficient,</hi> I have no reason to believe, that what she propoundes, as defined for matter of Faith, is truly so: And, as long as I can see no reason to believe it, prove the disbelief of it to be a sin in me when you can. Thus we see, how far from being evident that <hi>Major</hi> of yours is, though you are pleased to tell us, it is so; but we do not believe your <hi>Defining</hi> it to be so, to be <hi>any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith,</hi> unless we had better reason for it, than we have. For, say you,<note place="margin">P. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>To refuse to believe God's Revelation, is either to give God the lye, or to doubt whether he speak truth or no?</hi> But, have you so little wit, as not to distinguish between <hi>not believing God's Revelation,</hi> and <hi>not believing what is propounded for God's Revelation?</hi> Must every one, who doth not believe every thing that is propounded for <hi>God's Revelation,</hi> presently give <hi>God the lye, and doubt whether he speak truth or no?</hi> And are not you then guilty of that fault every time a <hi>Quaker</hi> or <hi>Enthusiast</hi> tells you, That the <hi>Spirit of God within him told him this and that</hi>? But you said, <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propounded.</hi> But the Question is, What <hi>sufficient Proposition</hi> is, and who must be Judge whether the Proposition be sufficient or no, you, or the conscience of the person to whom the thing is proposed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? If any one indeed that judgeth a Proposition sufficient, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding question the <hi>truth</hi> of it, he doth interpretatively call <hi>God's Veracity</hi> into question; but not he certainly who thinks not <hi>God's Veracity</hi> at all concerned in that which <hi>you call</hi> a sufficient Proposition, but <hi>he judgeth not to be so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now see, how you prove your <hi>Assumption,</hi> which is very fairly done from a Supposition which his <hi>Lordship</hi> denies; which is, <hi>That General Councils cannot erre.</hi> But, say you, he adds, <hi>That though he should grant it, yet this cannot down with him, that all Points even so defined were Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 28. n. 3.</note> I grant, those are his words, and his reasons follow them. <hi>For, Deductions are not prime and native Principles; nor are Superstructures, Foundations. That which is a Foundation for all, cannot be one and another to different Christians, in regard of it self; for then it could be no common Rule for any, nor could the souls of men rest upon a shaking Foundation. No, if it be a true Foundation, it must be common to all, and firm under all; in which sense the Articles of Christian Faith are Fundamental.</hi> What now do you prove to destroy this? You very strenuously prove, That if men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, A <hi>General Council cannot erre,</hi> they believe it <hi>cannot erre so far,</hi> and <hi>no further</hi> than <hi>it cannot erre.</hi> But, if you mean any thing further, your meaning is better than your proof: for when you would prove that <hi>to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe the Churches Definition, is to dis-believe God's Revelation</hi>; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that confound the <hi>Church and General Councils together,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 16.</note> and from the <hi>General Council's not erring,</hi> inferr the former Proposition, <hi>because, what is testified by the Church, is testified by an Authority that cannot erre</hi>; you do not consider, that all this while you prove nothing against his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, unless you first prove, that whatever is testified to be revealed from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101069:45"/>
God, is presently <hi>Fundamental</hi> to all <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> which his Lordship utterly denies, by distinguishing even things which may be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified to be revealed from <hi>God,</hi> into such <hi>things</hi> as are common to all Christians to be believed by them, and such things as vary according to the different respects of Christians. But yet further, I add, that taking <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> in your sense, you prove not the thing you intended, but only to such as do acknowledge, and as far as they do acknowledge, that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils cannot erre.</hi> For, they who acknowledge them infallible only in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> do not judge any thing <hi>Fundamental</hi> by their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi> but judge their <hi>Decisions infallible,</hi> so long as they hold to <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi>; and so (for all that I can see) leave themselves <hi>Judges, when General Councils are infallible,</hi> and <hi>when not:</hi> and therefore if they go about to testifie any thing as revealed from <hi>God,</hi> which is not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, they do not believe that their testimony cannot erre, and so are not bound to believe that it is from God. They who believe <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils absolutely infallible,</hi> I do verily think do believe <hi>General Councils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in all they say</hi>; for that is the substance of all you say. But, what that is to those who neither do, nor can see any reason to believe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in all they say or testifie as revealed from God, I neither do, nor can possibly understand. And, if you hope such kind of Arguments <hi>can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your ingenuous Reader,</hi> you suppose him a <hi>good-natur'd man</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> sense of the phrase.</p>
               <p>But all of a sudden, we find you in a very generous strain, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to take Fundamentals for Fundamentals (which is a huge Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and his Lordship, were he living, would take it for a singular favour from you.) <hi>Yet to deal freely with the Bishop</hi> (say you) <hi>even taking Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals in a General way</hi> (as it ought to be taken only here) <hi>for a thing belonging to the Foundation of Religion</hi> (and it is a strange Fundamental which hath no respect to the Foundation, but they who build downwards, must have their <hi>Foundations</hi> on <hi>tops</hi> of their <hi>houses) It is also manifest, that all Points defined by the Church are Fundamental, by reason of that formal Object, or infallible Authority, propounding them, though not alwaies by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the matter which they contain.</hi> The main proof of which lyes in this, That <hi>he who doth not believe the Church infallible, can believe nothing at all infallibly, and therefore no Fundamental of Religion; but,</hi>

                  <hi>if he believe any thing upon the Churches Infallibility, he must believe all things on the same account of her Infallibility, and therefore must believe all equally; and so, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is propounded by the Church, is to be believed as Fundamental.</hi> This you cannot deny to be the force and strength of your verbose, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed way of arguing.

nothing but <hi>Sceptiscism,</hi> not to say <hi>Atheism</hi> in the world. These things I take upon me to make good in their proper place, and therefore shall not enter the discussion of them here: but since, this is the main, and, in truth, the only <hi>Foundation</hi> of your <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, falshood and absurdity of it, cannot be sufficiently understood, till we have gone through the <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>Grounds of Faith.</hi>

               <p>If S. <hi>Augustine</hi> make some <hi>no Catholick Christians, for holding obstinately some things of no great moment in his Book of Heresies</hi>; it was, because by <hi>Catholick Christians</hi> he understood all such, and only such, as were the members of the <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Church, in opposition to all kind of <hi>unnecessary separation</hi> from it upon matters of small moment, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he believed the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> in defining all matters of Faith; and that all such things were so defined, which men are call'd <hi>Hereticks</hi> for denying of: unless you will suppose, it was ever infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, that there were no <hi>Antipodes</hi>; for some were accounted <hi>Hereticks</hi> for believing them; and that by such whom you account greater than S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin.</hi> But, for S. <hi>Austin,</hi> how far it was from his meaning, to have all those accounted <hi>Fundamental Errours,</hi> which he recounts in his Book of <hi>Heresies,</hi> appears not only from the multitude of particulars mentioned in it, which no one in his senses can acknowledge <hi>Fundamental,</hi> or declared by the <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>necessary to be believed by all,</hi> but from his declared scope and design in the preface to that Book, wherein it appears, he was desired not only to write the greater errours concerning <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Trinity, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, Repentance, Christ,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> the <hi>Old and New Testament, Sed omnia omnino quibus √† veritate dissentiunt, i. e.</hi> all kind of errours what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; and do you think that there could then be no errour, but it must be against some thing then defined by the <hi>Church as necessary to Salvation?</hi> If not, then all truths were then <hi>defined by the Church,</hi> and consequently there could be no new <hi>Definitions</hi> ever since; if there might, then those errours mentioned by S. <hi>Austin,</hi> were not about matters necessary to be believed; and so S. <hi>Austin's</hi> Book of <hi>Heresies</hi> makes nothing for you; but very much against you, considering that in all that black list of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> there are none brought in for denying those grand <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> nor any of that new brood of <hi>necessary</hi> Articles, which were so prudently hatcht by the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> But if S. <hi>Austin</hi> do you no good, you hope S. <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> may, because he saith, <hi>That nothing can be more perillous than those Hereticks, who with a drop of poison do infect our Lord's sincere Faith.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things defined by the Church are <hi>Fundamental.</hi> What an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Art this <hi>Logick</hi> is, that can fetch out of things that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in them! What a rare consequence is this, <hi>If Heresie be dangerous,</hi> then, whatever is defined by the <hi>Church, is Fundamental</hi>: but it may be, the strength lyes in the <hi>drop of poison,</hi> as though S. <hi>Gregory</hi> thought a <hi>drop of poison</hi> as dangerous as a <hi>whole dose</hi> of it. But, were I your <hi>Physitian,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the least <hi>drop</hi> of <hi>poison,</hi> I should prescribe you good store of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore,</hi> and should hope to see the effect of it, in making better consequences than these are. But to see yet further, the strange effects that <hi>Logick</hi> hath upon some men; for, say you, in the prosecution of your proof, that all things defined by the Church are Fundamental. <hi>Hence it is, that Christ our Saviour</hi> saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.17. <hi>If he will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi> The Argument in form runs thus; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever deserves excommunication, is guilty of a Fundamental Errour; but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101069:46"/>
he that will not hear the Church, deserves Excommunication; <hi>ergo,</hi> Or else there may be more in it than so. For, no doubt, the <hi>Heathens and Publicans</hi> as such, were guilty of Fundamental Errours; therefore they who will not hear the Church, are guilty of as Fundamental Errours as <hi>Heathens and Publicans.</hi> But, before you urge us any more with this dreadful Argument, I pray tell us, What that <hi>Church</hi> is which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our speaks of; what the cases are, wherein the Church is to be heard; what the full importance is, of being as a <hi>Heathen and Publican</hi>; and you must prove this <hi>Church</hi> to be understood in your sense of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and that this Church hath hereby power to <hi>define matters of Faith,</hi> and that none can possibly in any other sense be accounted as <hi>Heathens and Publicans,</hi> but as guilty of as <hi>Fundamental Errours</hi> as they were.</p>
               <p>Your next Objection concerning <hi>giving God and the Church the lye, and preferring and opposing a man's private judgement and will before and against the Judgement and Will of God and the Church, if men deny or doubt of any thing made known by the Church to be a truth revealed by God</hi>; signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, unless it be antecedently proved, that the Church can never erre in declaring any thing to be a truth revealed by God, which none, who know what you mean by the <hi>Church,</hi> will easily assent to, till you have attempted a further proof of it, than yet we find. And, although the questioning Divine Veracity <hi>be destructive to that</hi> which you call <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Faith,</hi> yet I hope it is possible to believe <hi>God to be true,</hi> and yet that <hi>all men are lyars,</hi> or that there is no such inseparable Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God's Veracity,</hi> and the <hi>present Declarations of any Church,</hi> but that one may heartily assent to the former, and yet question the truth of the latter. If you think otherwise, shew your pity to the weakness of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, by something that may look like a proof of it, which we are still much to seek for.</p>
               <p>But, your greatest strength, like <hi>Sampson</hi>'s, seems to lye there <hi>where one would least suspect it,</hi> viz. <hi>in</hi> Athanasius <hi>his Creed.</hi> For thus you go on.<note place="margin">¬ß. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore it is said in S.</hi> Athanasius <hi>his Creed (which is approved in the thirty nine Articles of the pretended English Church) that,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Whosoever will be saved, it is necessary that he hold the Catholick Faith ‚Äîwhich unless every one hold whole and inviolate, without doubt he shall perish for ever: Neither can the Bishop reply, That all Points expressed therein are Fundamental in his sense; for (to omit the Article of our Saviours descent into Hell) he mentions expresly the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son, which his Lordship hath denyed to be a Fundamental Point, as we saw in the former Chapter.</hi> But, the better to comprehend the force of this Argument, we must first consider what it is you intend to prove by it, and then in what way and manner you prove it from this <hi>Creed.</hi> The matter which you are to prove, is, that all things defined by the <hi>Church,</hi> are Fundamental, <hi>i. e.</hi> in your sense <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi>; and, that the ground why such things, whose matter is not necessary, do become necessary, is, because the Church declares them to be revealed by <hi>God</hi>; now, in order to this, you insist on the <hi>Creed</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Athanasius</hi> his, wherein some things, acknowledged not to be <hi>Fundamental</hi> in the matter, are yet said to be <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> and that this is owned by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> This is the substance of the Argument, which being resolved into its parts, will consist of these Propositions. 1. That some things owned not to be Fundamental in the matter, are yet acknowledged in the <hi>Creed</hi> of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> to be necessary to Salvation. 2. That the reason why these
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101069:47"/>
things do become <hi>necessary,</hi> is, because the <hi>Church</hi> hath defined them to be so. 3. That this is acknowledged by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore, by parity of reason, whatever is defined by the Church, must be necessary to Salvation. But every one of these <hi>Propositions</hi> being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, the clear stating of them will be the best way of solving the difficulty, which seems to lye in the present Argument. And the main Ambiguity lyes in the meaning of that <hi>necessity to Salvation,</hi> which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> as to the Articles therein contained; for, there being different <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>reasons</hi> upon which things may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>necessary,</hi> there can be no just consequence made from the general owning a <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>belief</hi> of some things, to the making those things necessary to be believed upon one particular account of it. For the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of believing things to Salvation, may arise from one of these three grounds. 1. The <hi>Supposition,</hi> that the matter to be believed is in <hi>it self necessary</hi> this makes it <hi>necessary</hi> to all those persons who are of that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and on this ground it is plain, that the main Articles of the <hi>Athanasian Creed</hi> are generally supposed necessary, <hi>viz.</hi> those concerning the <hi>Trinity in Vnity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation, Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Life, &amp;c.</hi> Now these being supposed to be necessary from the <hi>Matter,</hi> any Church may own them under this degree of <hi>necessity,</hi> in that expression used in several places of the <hi>Athanasian Creed, Whosoever will be saved, it is necessary that he hold the Catholick Faith‚Äîwhich Catholick Faith is, &amp;c.</hi> But then we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this is only a Declaration of the sense of that <hi>Church,</hi> what things she owns as <hi>necessary,</hi> and what not. And this Declaration doth not oblige the conscience of particular persons any further, than as the Articles of that <hi>Church</hi> are required to be owned as the <hi>conditions</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> with her, <hi>i. e.</hi> where the <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>necessity</hi> is not declared, nor expresly owned by a Church, but left in general terms; no man is bound to <hi>believe</hi> the things judged as <hi>necessary,</hi> with any particular kind of <hi>necessity,</hi> exclusive of others, but only that the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>General</hi> may use that <hi>Creed</hi> supposed necessary, and that the Use of that <hi>Creed</hi> is a lawful condition of that <hi>Churches Communion.</hi> 2. The belief of a thing may be supposed <hi>necessary,</hi> because of the clear <hi>Conviction</hi> of mens understandings, that though the matters be not in themselves necessary, yet being <hi>revealed by God,</hi> they must be explicitly believed; but then the <hi>necessity</hi> of this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief doth extend no further than the <hi>clearness</hi> of that Conviction doth. As, suppose it inserted into a <hi>Creed,</hi> that the Article of the <hi>Descent</hi> must be understood according to the sense of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> this doth oblige no man to any further necessity of belief of the sense of the Article, then he is convinced, that it is the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; And the case is the same, when the Article is expressed only in general terms, which are known to be capable of very different <hi>senses,</hi> when none of which are expressed, no particular sense can be said to be <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> to particular persons, but only that <hi>sense</hi> in general, which all must agree in who own it, and the particulars are left to the <hi>Convictions</hi> of mens understandings upon the use of the best means of satisfaction. So that he that believes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the meaning of this Article from <hi>Scripture,</hi> is, that <hi>Christ's soul</hi> did locally descend to Hell, it is necessary for him to believe so, upon such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; but he that sees no more necessary to be believed by it, but that <hi>Christ's soul</hi> was, during his Body's lying in the Grave, in a <hi>state of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from it; how can you prove it necessary to Salvation for him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any more than this? And the case is the same as to all <hi>Modes</hi> of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101069:47"/>
                  <hi>Existence,</hi> and particular explications of Articles in themselves owned, as of the different <hi>Subsistencies in the Trinity,</hi> the manner of the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion</hi> of the <hi>two Natures in Christ's Person,</hi> supposing the Doctrines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves believed, what reason can there be to assert it necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all persons, to believe them under such a sense, if the Article may be it self believed without it, any further than as things under those explications, are manifested to such persons to be necessary to be believed. As <hi>Leo</hi> 3. defined in the Article of the <hi>Holy Ghost's Procession from the Son,</hi> To such, who, by reason of capacity and apprehension, could attain to the Knowledge of it, it was necessary to be believed, but not by others; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in our former Discourse on that Subject. Therefore from hence we see another account, why things may become necessary to be believed and owned as such, besides the matter and the Churches Definition. These things may be said to be necessary to be <hi>believed</hi> by such, who believe the Churches Proposition to be sufficient, though it be not; as, suppose any member of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> should believe their Church infallible, it is necessary, for such a one to believe whatever is propounded by that <hi>Church,</hi> though you suppose that judgement of his to be false in it self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you say, the <hi>Greek Church</hi> is not infallible. So that from hence it appears, that the <hi>necessity</hi> arising from the <hi>Churches</hi> Definition, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Conviction, that whatever the <hi>Church</hi> defines, is necessary to be believed. And, where that is not received as an antecedent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the other cannot be supposed. By this opening the several grounds of <hi>necessity,</hi> your difficulty concerning the <hi>Athanasian Creed</hi> comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For granting, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth own and approve the <hi>Creed,</hi> going under the name of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and supposing that her <hi>Vse</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> doth extend to the owning of those expressions, which import the <hi>necessity</hi> of believing the things therein contained in order to Salvation; yet this doth not reach to your purpose, unless you prove that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth own that <hi>necessity</hi> purely on the account of the <hi>Churches Definition</hi> of those things which are not <hi>Fundamental,</hi> which it is very unreasonable to imagine; it being directly contrary to her sense in her nineteenth and twentieth Articles. And thence, that supposed <hi>necessity</hi> of the belief of the Articles of the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> must, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> be resolved either into the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of the <hi>Matters,</hi> or into that <hi>necessity</hi> which supposeth <hi>clear Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> that the things therein contained are of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> From hence then it cannot at all follow, because the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> owns the <hi>Creed</hi> of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> therefore all things defined by the <hi>Church</hi> are, <hi>eo nomine, necessary to Salvation.</hi> Other particulars concerning that <hi>Creed,</hi> as to its <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> we may have occasion afterwards more at large to discuss; it sufficeth now, that nothing is thence produced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the present Controversie.</p>
               <p>His Lordship, in the progress of this Discourse, takes away that slight and poor evasion,<note place="margin">¬ß. 15.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">N. 8. P. 31, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Declaration of the Church makes any thing Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,</hi> quoad nos, <hi>because that no respect to us can vary the Foundation. And that the Churches Declaration can bind us only to peace and external obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, where there is not express letter of Scripture and sense agreed on: but it cannot make any thing Fundamental to us, that is not so in its own nature. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>if the Church can so add, that it can by a Declaration make a thing to be Fundamental in the Faith that was not, then it can take a thing away from the Foundation, and make it by declaring not to be Fundamental,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101069:48"/>
which all men grant no power of the Church can do. For the power of adding any thing contrary, and of detracting any thing necessary, are alike forbidden, and alike denyed.</hi> Now you say, <hi>That all this is satisfied by the foresaid distinction,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>of material and formal Object</hi>; and you desire the Reader, <hi>to carry along with him this distinction of</hi> objectum materiale &amp; formale, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria attestata; &amp; authoritas attestantis, <hi>and he will easily discover the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies of his Lordship's Discourse, in this main Point of Controversie, and solve all his difficulties supported by them.</hi> No doubt, an excellent <hi>Amulet</hi> to preserve from the infection of reason! But it is your great mishap, that where you commend it so much, it doth you so little service: For, let your distinction of <hi>formal and material Object,</hi> be supposed as sound and good, as I have shewed, it in your sense, to be false and fallacious; yet it doth not reach that part of his Lordship's Discourse, which you apply it to. For, still his reason is conclusive, though the necessity only be supposed to arise from the <hi>Churches Authority,</hi> yet if it be in the power of the <hi>Church,</hi> to make any thing necessary which was not, why may it not be equally in her power to make something not necessary which was? For, either the grounds of the necessity of things to Salvation, doth depend on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as at first declared to the world, or it doth not. If it doth, then it is not in the <hi>Churches Power</hi> to make any thing necessary, which was not made necessary by it; if it doth not, then the <hi>Church</hi> may as well pretend to a power to make something <hi>not necessary,</hi> which was; as to make something necessary, which was not. So that your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>Formal and Material Object,</hi> signifies nothing at all here; only this is observable, that you make the <hi>Churches Definition</hi> to be the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object of Faith</hi> here, which you very solemnly contradict afterwards. (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. ¬ß. 4.) And can any thing be more evident from this Discourse of yours, than that you make the last resolution of Faith, as to the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of things to be believed into the <hi>Churches Definition,</hi> as its Formal Object? But this distinction with the grounds of it being removed in our former Discourse, I shall ease my self and the Reader of any further la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in examining what follows in this Chapter, which depends wholly upon it; or else run out into <hi>the Churches Infallibility, the infallible Assent requisite to Faith, the Canon of Scripture, and our certainty</hi> of it, or <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of General Councils</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 19, 20, 21.</note> all which shall be fully and particularly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their proper places. There being nothing said here, but what either hath been answered already, or will be more at large in a more convenient place.</p>
               <p>The only things remaining then in this Chapter, which deserve a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discussion here,<note place="margin">¬ß. 16.</note> are the testimonies of <hi>Scotus</hi> and S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and the Discourses which depend thereon. For our better clearing the testimony of <hi>Scotus, in which you charge his Lordship with falsification,</hi> we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider on what account, and for what purposes that testimony is produced. His Lordship had said before,<note place="margin">P. 29. n. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That Fundamentals are a Rock immovable, and can never be varied; therefore what is Fundamental after the Church hath defined it, was Fundamental before the definition, and no Decrees of Councils, how general soever, can alter immovable Verities; wherefore, if the Church in a Council define any thing, the thing defined is not fundamental because the Church hath defined it; nor can be made so by the definition of the Church, if it be not so in it self. For if the Church hath this power, she might make a New Article of Faith, which the learned among themselves deny. For the Articles of Faith cannot increase in substance, but only in explication:

For which he appeals to</hi> Bellarmin. <hi>Nor,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Is this hard to be further proved out of your own School. For</hi> Scotus <hi>professeth it in this very particular of the Greek Church. If there be,</hi> saith he, <hi>a true real difference between the Greeks and Latins about the Point of the Procession of the Holy Ghost, then either they or we be,</hi> vere haeretici, <hi>truly and indeed Hereticks. Which he speaks of the old Greeks long before any decision of the Church in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie. For he instances in S.</hi> Basil, <hi>and</hi> Greg. Nazianzen, <hi>on one side; and S.</hi> Jerome, Augustine, <hi>and</hi> Ambrose, <hi>on the other. And who dares call any of these Hereticks is his challenge?</hi> That then which his Lordship proves by this testimony, is that the <hi>nature of Heresie</hi> doth not depend on the <hi>Churches Definition,</hi> but on the <hi>Nature of the things</hi>; for, according to <hi>Scotus,</hi> ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to the <hi>Churches Definition,</hi> if there had been any real difference between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> one side of them had been <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 22.</note> To this you answer, <hi>That hence it follows not, that</hi> Scotus <hi>thought they could be Hereticks, unless they denyed or doubted of that which they had reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was revealed by God, But it only follows, that if they knew this (as those learned Greeks had sufficient reason to know it) they might well be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hereticks, before any special Declaration of the Church; although it be more clear, that he is an Heretick, who denies to believe that Doctrine, after he confesses that it is defined by the Church.</hi> From which answer of yours, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things are to our purpose observable. 1. That the <hi>Formal Reason</hi> of <hi>Heresie,</hi> is, denying something supposed to be of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> 2. That none can reasonably be accused of <hi>Heresie,</hi> but such as have sufficient reason to believe that which they deny is <hi>revealed by God.</hi> 3. That none can be guilty of <hi>Heresie,</hi> for denying any thing <hi>declared by the Church</hi>; unless they have sufficient reason to believe, that whatever is declared by the <hi>Church,</hi> is <hi>revealed by God.</hi> Which unavoidably follows from the former, and therefore the <hi>Churches Definition</hi> cannot make any <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but such as have reason to believe that she cannot erre in her <hi>Definitions.</hi> From whence <hi>Protestants</hi> will be in less danger of <hi>Heresie</hi> than <hi>Papists,</hi> till you give us more sufficient reasons to prove, that whatever the <hi>Church declares,</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>revealed by God.</hi> And, although you tell us, <hi>Men may be accounted Hereticks before they are condemned as such by General Councils, if they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Doctrine clearly contained in Scripture, or generally received by the Church</hi>; yet you tell us not, what the measures are, whereby we ought to judge what things are thus clearly contained in Scripture, or universally received; whether the <hi>Churches judgement</hi> must be taken, or every man's own judgement: if the former, the ground of <hi>Heresie</hi> lyes still in the <hi>Churches Definition,</hi> contrary to what <hi>Scotus</hi> affirms; if the latter, then no one can be an <hi>Heretick,</hi> but he that opposeth that which he is or may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, is clearly contained in Scripture, or generally received by the Church. If <hi>that which he is convinced,</hi> then no man is an <hi>Heretick,</hi> but he that goes against his present judgement, and so there will be few <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> in the world; <hi>If that which he may be convinced of,</hi> it must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood either in <hi>his</hi> own judgement, or <hi>yours</hi>; if in <hi>his own</hi> judgement, then a <hi>Heretick</hi> is one who dissents to things <hi>rashly,</hi> without using means to inform himself: if in <hi>yours,</hi> why may not he say, You may as well be convinced of the <hi>truth</hi> of that which he believes, as he be convinced of the truth of that which you believe; and so you may be a <hi>Heretick</hi> to him by the same reason that he is to you. But you say further, <hi>That there are many things, which in themselves are matters of Faith; yet so obscure, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation especially to unlearned and particular persons, that before the decree of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101069:49"/>
the Church, we are not Hereticks, though we should either doubt of them, or deny them: because, as yet, there appears no sufficient reason that can oblige us to believe them; although, after the Definition of the Church, we ought as well to believe them as any other.</hi> But it is impossible to understand how there can be such things which men might safely not believe, but upon the Definition of the Church they are bound to believe them necessarily, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be clear to them, that the Church hath power to make obscure things plain, and unnecessary things to become necessary. For, suppose one of these <hi>obscure things</hi> be this very <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Church in defining</hi> such things, while this remains so <hi>obscure,</hi> you tell me, I may doubt or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe it without Heresie, and while I do so, I may certainly doubt or disbelieve all she declares. But, by what means shall this thing become <hi>clear?</hi> must it be by the <hi>Churches</hi> defining it? But that very <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> is the thing in question, and therefore cannot be cleared by it. And if there be any thing then so obscure, that men may without sin doubt of it, or disbelieve it, certainly the <hi>Churches Power in defining matters of Faith,</hi> is such; it being not capable, by any act of the <hi>Church,</hi> of being made so clear, as to oblige men to believe it.</p>
               <p>But we must see how his <hi>Lordship</hi> hath wronged the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: For first,</hi> say you, <hi>He would perswade his Reader, that this Author supposed a real difference between the Ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, about the Procession of the Holy Ghost; whereas</hi> Scotus <hi>declares, that there was no real difference between them:</hi> But doth his Lordship say, there was? doth he not expresly cite <hi>Scotus</hi> his testimony in an hypothetical manner; <hi>If there be a true real difference, &amp;c.</hi> and it is evident from <hi>Scotus</hi> his words, that he supposeth, <hi>If the difference had been real, that either the Greeks or Latins were truly Hereticks.</hi>

               <p>Upon <hi>Scotus</hi> his mentioning the <hi>Churches Declaration,</hi> his <hi>Lordship</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, <hi>What this Declaration is, and how far it extends.</hi> For which,<note place="margin">¬ß. 17.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 31. n. 7.</note> his Lordship saith, <hi>The Master teacheth, and his Scholars too, that every thing which belongs to the Exposition or Declaration of another,</hi> intus est, <hi>is not another contrary thing, but is contained within the bowels and nature of that which is interpreted: from which, if the Declaration depart, it is faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and erronious, because, instead of declaring, it gives another and contrary sense. Therefore when the Church declares any thing in Council, either that which she declares was</hi> intus, <hi>or</hi> extra; <hi>in the nature and verity of the thing, or out of it. If it were</hi> extra, <hi>without the nature of the thing declared, then the Declaration of the thing is false; and so, far from being Fundamental in the Faith. If it were</hi> intus, <hi>within the nature and compass of the thing, though not open and apparent to every eye; then the Declaration is true, but not otherwise Fundamental then the thing is which is declared: for that which is</hi> intus, <hi>cannot be larger or deeper, than that in which it is; if it were, it could not be</hi> intus. <hi>Therefore nothing is simply Fundamental, because the Church declares it; but because it is so, in the nature of the thing which the Church declares.</hi> In answer to this, you seem more ingenuous than usual; for you acknowledge, <hi>that his expression is learnedly solid and good:</hi> but yet you would seem to return some answer to this Argument, <hi>viz. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no alteration in the nature of the Articles by the Churches De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>yet this doth not hinder them from becoming Fundamental in that sense in which we dispute,</hi> i. e. <hi>such as cannot be denyed or doubted of under pain of damnation, although they were not thus Fundamental before the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as not being so clearly proposed to us, as that we were bound to believe them. Neither doth this take away any thing from their</hi> intus, <hi>or that Being which they had of themselves; but only gives a certainty of their being so, and declares that they ought to be so</hi> quoad nos, <hi>as well as</hi> quoad se, <hi>and internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And it is no evasion, but a solid distinction,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Declaration of the Church varies not the thing in it self, but</hi> quoad nos <hi>in its respect to us.</hi> The substance of your Answer lyes in this, That though the <hi>Church</hi> by her Declaration, doth not alter the nature of things, yet she may, and doth, our <hi>Obligation to believe</hi> them; so that such things which men might have been saved without believing before, when once the Church hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, become necessary to be believed in order to Salvation. And yet you would not have this called <hi>making new Articles of Faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 20. n. 8.</note> But I pray tell us, what you mean by <hi>Articles of Faith</hi>; are not those properly Articles of Faith, as distinct from <hi>Theological Verities,</hi> which are necessary to be believed by all? If therefore those things which the Church declares, were before not necessary, and by the <hi>Churches Declaration</hi> do become necessary; than certainly those things which were not <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:101069:50"/>
do become Articles of Faith, and what then doth the Church by her Declaration, but make New Articles of Faith? But, though you assert the thing, you like not the terms, because they do not sound so pleasantly to the ears of Christians, who believe all <hi>Obligation to Faith</hi> doth depend upon immediate Divine Revelation. Setting aside therefore the terms, let us examine the thing, to see upon what grounds the <hi>Church</hi> can make that necessary to us, which was not in it self. In which case the <hi>Obligation</hi> not arising from the necessity of the <hi>Matter</hi> in it self to be believed, it is no otherwise intelligible, but that it must result from the supposition of some <hi>Immediate Revelation.</hi> For nothing else can bind us to an <hi>Internal Assent,</hi> which you require as necessary to the Churches De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions but that, unless you can shew how any Society of men considered as such, have power to <hi>oblige</hi> all other men to believe what they declare on pain of damnation for not doing it. I pray tell me, whether the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves had power to bind all <hi>Christians</hi> to the belief of something as necessary, which the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> did not immediately reveal to them to be so? If not, what power can any <hi>Church</hi> have to do it, without a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter measure of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> than the <hi>Apostles</hi> ever pretended to? For, they never attempted to define any thing as necessary, which was suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unnecessary to be believed after the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the world. Before then you can perswade us to believe that your <hi>Church</hi> can make any thing <hi>necessary,</hi> which was <hi>not so,</hi> you must prove an <hi>Absolute Infallible Divine Assistance of God's Spirit</hi> with your <hi>Church,</hi> in whatever she shall attempt to declare or define as matter of Faith. As for instance, Supposing it not necessary to Salvation in it self to believe the <hi>Immaculate Conception</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> how is it possible to conceive, after your <hi>Churches Definition</hi> of it, it should become necessary, unless it be supposed that there was an <hi>Immediate Divine Revelation,</hi> in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition. For, nothing but <hi>Divine Authority</hi> commanding our Assent, the ground of Faith must be resolved into that; now in this case, besides the Immediate Assent to the thing declared as a truth, there is a distinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to be <hi>believed,</hi> which is, That <hi>what was not before necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, doth now become necessary to be believed by all</hi>; and shew us, either that there is <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> for this, or else excuse us, that we cannot give an <hi>Internal Assent</hi> to it. For, we have not learnt to give an Assent of Faith to a meer humane Proposition, or, in our <hi>Saviour's</hi> words, we call no man, <hi>Master upon Earth,</hi> so as to promise to believe it in the power of any Church whatsoever, to make any thing necessary to be believed, which was not so before. Hence it appears, that your Distinction of, <hi>in se, &amp; quoad nos,</hi> is as insignificant, as your pretence of the Churches Power to define matters of Faith is presumptuous and arrogant, being the highest degree of <hi>Lording it over the Christian world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why your Church may not as well declare something not to be of <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 24.</note> which before was of Faith, as declare something to be of Faith, which before was not of Faith, it is not easie to apprehend, if that thing might be supposed of Faith before, without the Churches explicit Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For in that case the Church would not so apparently contradict her self; for that <hi>Contradiction</hi> doth not lye in varying the respects of things, but in one Declaration contradicting another. For otherwise, it is as great a contradiction to say, That something which was not necessary, is become necessary; as that a thing which was necessary, is become not necessary. Therefore if there be a contradiction in one, there is in the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101069:50"/>
other. If the Contradiction lyes in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> you must say, That nothing could be supposed necessary to be <hi>believed,</hi> but what was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Church</hi> to be so, and as declared by the <hi>Church:</hi> which is a Province as difficult as necessary to be undertaken, to rid your hands of this difficulty. For otherwise, that Answer of yours cannot reach the Objection.</p>

                  <hi>For few lines before, he tells us, There was a Question moved to S.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Baptism was concluded to the eighth day, as well as Circumcision? and no doubt was made then of the beginning of sin; and that out of this thing, about which no Question was moved, that Question that was made was answered.

Therefore S.</hi> Augustine <hi>goes on in the same sense, that the Disputer is not to be born any longer, that shall endeavour to shake the Foundation it self, upon which the whole Church is grounded.</hi> 2. His Lordship answers, <hi>That, granting that the Churches Definition, was meant by S.</hi> Austin, <hi>yet it can never follow out of any, or all these Circumstances, that all Points defined by the Church are Fundamental, because this Foundation may be upon Humane Authority; and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, only is, That things are not to be opposed, which are made firm by full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church; but it cannot be thence concluded, They are therefore Fundamental in the Faith.</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> This is the substance of his Lordships Answer to this place; which we must consider what you reply to. First, you say, <hi>That it cannot be doubted but that S.</hi> Austin<hi>'s judgement was, that all our Faith depended on the Authority of the Church, and therefore that he that opposeth himself against this, endeavoureth to shake and destroy the very ground-work of all Divine and Supernatural Faith.</hi> This is a rare way of silencing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, by telling them, <hi>That cannot be doubted,</hi> which others can see no reason at all to believe. As in this present case you, tell me, that cannot be doubted, which I utterly deny, <hi>viz.</hi> That S. <hi>Austins</hi> judgement was, that all our <hi>Faith</hi> depended on the <hi>Authority of the Church</hi>; and if all the proof you have for it, be only that well-known place, <hi>Ego ver√≤ Evangelio non crederem, &amp;c.</hi> You shall in time see, what an ill choice you made of fixing your proof wholly upon that. But whoever is never so little conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in S. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s way of disputing either against the <hi>Donatists, Pelagians,</hi> or <hi>Manichees,</hi> will find very little reason to doubt, but that he made the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101069:51"/>
                  <hi>Foundation of Faith,</hi> to be <hi>God's Word,</hi> and not the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Indeed S. <hi>Austin,</hi> by way of <hi>Prescription,</hi> often makes use of the <hi>Churches Authority,</hi> not where there hath been particular <hi>Definitions,</hi> but <hi>Vniversal Consent,</hi> which he understands by the settlement, by <hi>full Authority of the Church</hi>; but this he insists not on as the ground of Faith, but to shew the unreasonableness of mens opposing those things which the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> was agreed in, as in this Controversie here disputed by him concerning <hi>Original Sin in Infants.</hi> Therefore if I understand S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> in this place, he doth not at all speak concerning what is to be owned as a matter of Faith simply in it self, but what the <hi>Churches Carriage</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dissenters is. For after that <hi>Citation</hi> of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> at the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Sermon, he addresseth himself to the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as his dissenting Brethren; Therefore, saith he, <hi>Let us, if possible, intreat this of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, That they would no longer call us Hereticks; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we might as well call them so if we would,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Impetremus ergo, si possumus, √† fratribus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris, n√® nos insuper appellent Haereticos; quod eos talia dispurantes nos appellare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus sorsitan, si vellemus, nec tamen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellamus.</hi> Id. ib.</note> 
                  <hi>but we do not.</hi> Why was S. <hi>Austin</hi> so scrupulous of calling the <hi>Pelagians Hereticks,</hi> if he made the <hi>Definition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> the Foundation of Faith, and looked on this Controversie as defined by full Authority of the <hi>Church?</hi> And after, speakes of the <hi>Churches</hi> bearing with them still, in order to their instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though they were gone so far, that they were scarce to be born with; and that the <hi>Church</hi> exercised great patience towards them; therefore intreats them not to abuse this <hi>patience</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but to be <hi>reformed,</hi> since they did exhort as <hi>Friends,</hi> and not contend as enemies. And so brings in the former words, which I thus paraphrase; <hi>It is a thing to be taken for granted, that in disputable Points, and such as the Church hath not alwaies been agreed in, dissenters may be born with: but if direct and full opposition to the clear sense of the Church should still be suffered, it would overthrow the very Foundation of the Church it self.</hi> And that this, and no other, is the plain and genuine meaning of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> is evident to any one who impartially considers antecedents and consequents, and the natural sense of the words themselves. Before, he spake how far the Church had born with them: in the words themselves, he tells them, They must not expect the <hi>Church</hi> would alwaies bear with them, if they joyned <hi>Obstinacy</hi> with their <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> for that would ruine the <hi>Church,</hi> if she continually suffered such as violently opposed things contrary to her clearest sense: and after tells them, <hi>This is not expedient: for hitherto, it may be, our patience is not to be found fault withall;</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. The Absurdities of the <hi>Romanists</hi> Doctrine of Fundamentals.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Churches Authority must be Divine, if whatever she defines be Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. His Lordship, and not the Testimony of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> shamefully abused, three several wayes. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> not mis-cited; the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the General Council at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The Pope's Authority not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in that of Councils. The gross Absurdities of the distinction of the Church teaching and representative, from the Church taught and dissusive, in the Question of Fundamentals. The Churches Authority and Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in matters of Faith, distinguished. The Testimonies of <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis</hi> explained, and shewed to be directly contrary to the <hi>Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Fundamentals. <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> not reconciled by the vain endeavours used to that end.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe main Doctrine of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> being in the foregoing Chapter setled and cleared,<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> what remains of that subject will be capable of a quicker dispatch. The scope of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> is, to assoil those difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which your doctrine of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> is subject to. What little footing that hath in the place of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> was the last thing discussed in the preceding Chapter; and therefore must not be repeated here. His Lordship urgeth this reason why S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> or any other reasonable man could not believe,<note place="margin">P. 34. n. 11.</note> that whatever is defined by the Church is <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the Faith; because full Church-Authority (alwaies the time that inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Holy Apostles being past by, and not comprehended in it) is but Church-Authority; and Church-Authority, when it is at full Sea, is not simply divine; therefore the sentence of it not Fundamentall in the Faith.</hi> To this you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wisely and learnedly answer; <hi>I will not dispute with his Lordship, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, or no; because it is sufficient that such Authority be infallible.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 28. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>For if it be infallible, it cannot propose to us any thing as revealed by God, but what is so revealed. So that to dispute against this Authority, is in effect to take away all Authority from divine Revelation; we having no other absolute certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that this or that is revealed by God, but only the Infallibility of the Church proposing, or attesting it unto us as revealed. Whence also it follows, that to doubt, dispute against, or deny any thing that is proposed by the Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, is to doubt, dispute against, and deny that which is Fundamental in Faith.</hi> His Lordship denies the sentence of the Church to be Fundamental in the Faith, because <hi>not Divine</hi>; you dare not say, It is <hi>Divine,</hi> but contend that it is <hi>Infallible,</hi> and from that Infallibility inferr, That <hi>Whosoever denies the Churches Infallibility, must deny some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Fundamental in the Faith, because we can have no other absolute certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that any thing is revealed by God, but only from the Churches Infallibility,</hi> So that your whole proof rests upon a very rotten and uncertain Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>viz.</hi> that all <hi>certainty</hi> in matters of Faith, doth depend upon the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>; the falshood and unreasonableness of which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101069:52"/>
will at large be discovered in the succeeding Controversie. And if this fails, then the denial of the Churches Infallibility doth not inferr the denial of any thing <hi>Fundamental</hi> in the Faith, because men may be certain of all <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> without believing this Infallibility. But yet, say you, <hi>There is no necessity of asserting Church-Authority to be Divine, but only to be infallible, in order to the making what she defines to be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</hi> A rare and excellent piece of your old <hi>Theological Reason</hi>; as though any thing could be any further <hi>Infallible</hi> than it is <hi>Divine,</hi> or any further owned to be <hi>Divine,</hi> than as it is <hi>Infallible.</hi> I pray, acquaint us with these rare Arts of distinguishing between an Authority <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> when the ground of that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> is the supposition of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing properly and simply <hi>Divine,</hi> which is the <hi>Infallible Assistance</hi> of <hi>God's Spirit.</hi> Is that Assistance <hi>Infallible</hi> too, but not <hi>Divine?</hi> If it be <hi>Divine,</hi> as well as <hi>Infallible,</hi> how comes that <hi>Infallibility</hi> which flows from it not to be <hi>Divine,</hi> when the cause of it was simply and absolutely so? Besides, what <hi>Infallible Authority</hi> is that which makes all its <hi>Definitions Fundamental,</hi> and yet is not in it self <hi>Divine?</hi> From whence comes any thing to be <hi>Fundamental?</hi> You tell us your self, <hi>as it is known to be revealed by God.</hi> And can any thing be known to be revealed by God, but by an <hi>Authority Divine?</hi> especially on your principles, who make all certainty of knowing it to depend on that Churches Authority? If so, then since the Churches sentence makes things become matters of Faith, some things may become matters of Faith, which have no <hi>Divine Authority</hi> for them. But this excellent and subtle distinction between <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible Authority,</hi> we shall have occasion to examine afterwards. And therefore it is well you tell us, <hi>Notwithstanding that Infallible and Divine, seem to many great Divines to be terms convertible,</hi> which only acquaints us with thus much, that there are some men who understand things better than you do; and that to do so, is to be a <hi>great Divine.</hi> And if <hi>Stapleton</hi> be one of these, we are not much offended at it; and so far we will take the Testimonies which you produce out of him.‚ÄîThat which next follows depends upon the proof of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> which when you have sufficiently cleared, we will believe, that there can be no plain <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Evident Reason</hi> against any of their <hi>Definitions,</hi> but till then we must believe there may be room for both.</p>
               <p>Your next <hi>Section</hi> promiseth to shew us <hi>a shameful abuse of S.</hi> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine<hi>'s Testimony,</hi>

                  <hi>three several waies</hi>; But, if it appears, that not one of those waies will hold, then it only follows, that so many waies <hi>you</hi> have abused his <hi>Lordship,</hi> and not <hi>he</hi> S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> His <hi>Lordship</hi> having affirmed, <hi>That plain Scripture with evident sense,</hi>

                  <hi>or of a full demonstrative Argument; but addressing his speech to the</hi> Manicheans, <hi>he writes thus,</hi> Apud vos autem ubi nihil horum est quod me invitet ac teneat, sola personat veritatis pollicitatio (<hi>and then follow
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101069:52"/>
the words cited by the Bishop</hi>) quae quidem si tam manifesta monstratur; <hi>where it is plain</hi> quae, <hi>which is relative only to Truth, and not to Scripture, or any thing else.</hi> A wonderful abuse of S. <hi>Austin</hi> to make him parallel <hi>plain Scripture, evident sense,</hi> or a <hi>full Demonstrative Argument</hi> with <hi>Truth!</hi> As though if <hi>evident Truth</hi> were more prevalent with him than all those Arguments which held him in the <hi>Catholick Church, plain Scripture, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Sense,</hi> or <hi>Demonstrations</hi> would not be so too. What Truth can be evident, if it be not one of these three? Do you think, there is any other way of manifesting <hi>Truth,</hi> but by <hi>Scripture, Sense</hi> or <hi>Demonstration?</hi> if you have found out other waies, oblige the world by communicating them; but till then, give us leave to think, that it is all one to say, <hi>Manifest Truth,</hi> as plain Scripture, evident Sense, or clear Demonstrations. But, say you, <hi>He speaks only of that Truth which the</hi> Manichees <hi>bragged of, and promised<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </hi> As though S. <hi>Austin</hi> would have been perswaded sooner as it came from them, than as it was <hi>Truth</hi> in it self. I suppose, S. <hi>Austin</hi> did not think their Testimony sufficient, and therefore sayes, <hi>Quae quidem si tam manifesta monstratur, &amp;c. i. e.</hi> If they could make that which they said, evident to be Truth, he would quit the <hi>Church,</hi> and adhere to them: and if this holds against the <hi>Manichees,</hi> will it not on the same reason hold every where else, <hi>viz.</hi> That manifest Truth is not to be quitted on any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whatsoever? which is all his <hi>Lordship</hi> asserts.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>You offer to prove, that S.</hi> Austin, <hi>by</hi> Truth, <hi>could not mean</hi> plain Scripture; But can you prove, that by <hi>Truth,</hi> he did not mean <hi>Truth,</hi> whereever he found it, whether in Scripture, or elsewhere? <hi>No,</hi> say you, <hi>It cannot be meant, that by Truth, he should mean plain Scripture, in opposition to the Definitions of the Catholick Church, or General Councils</hi>; For which, you give this Reason, <hi>because he supposes it impossible, that the Doctrine of the Catholick Church, should be contrary to Scripture; for then men, according to S.</hi> Austin, <hi>should not believe infallibly, either the one or the other. Not the Scriptures, because they are received only upon the Authority of the Church; nor the Church, whose Authority is infringed by the plain Scripture which is brought against her.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C. ep. Fund. c.</hi> 5.</note> For which you produce a large citation out of S. <hi>Austin.</hi> to that purpose. But the Answer to that is easie. For, S. <hi>Austin,</hi> when he speaks of <hi>Church-Authority, qu√¢ infirmat√¢ jam nec Evangelio credere potero</hi>; he doth not in the least understand it of any <hi>Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; but of the <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> concerning the <hi>Scriptures</hi> from the time of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> And what plain <hi>Scriptures</hi> those are supposable, which should contradict such a <hi>Tradition</hi> as this is, is not easie to understand. But the case is quite otherwise as to the <hi>Churches Definitions</hi>; for neither doth the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> at all rest upon them; and there may be very well supposed some plain <hi>Scriptures</hi> contrary to the <hi>Churches Definitions,</hi> unless it be proved, that the <hi>Church</hi> is absolutely Infallible, and the very proof of that depending on <hi>Scripture,</hi> there must be an appeal made to plain <hi>Scripture,</hi> whether the Churches Definitions may not be contradicted by <hi>Scripture.</hi> When therefore you say, <hi>This is an impossible Supposition, that Scripture should contradict the Churches Definitions, like that of the Apostle; If an Angel from Heaven teach otherwise, let him be accursed,</hi> Gal. 1. You must prove it as impossible for the Church to deviate from <hi>Scripture</hi> in any of her Definitions, <hi>as for an Angel to preach another Gospel</hi>; which will be the braver attempt, because it seems so little befriended either by sense or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But, say you, <hi>If the Church may be an erring Definer, I would gladly know,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101069:53"/>
why an erring Disputer may not oppugn her.</hi> That which you would so gladly know, is not very difficult to be resolved, by any one who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the great difference between yielding an <hi>Internal Assent</hi> to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>open opposing</hi> them; for it only follows from the possibility of the <hi>Churches</hi> Errour in defining, that therefore we ought not to yield an <hi>absolute Internal Assent</hi> to all her determinations, but must examine them by the best measures of Truth, in order to our full Assent to them: but, though the <hi>Church may erre,</hi> it doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that it is lawful in all cases, or for all persons, to oppugn her Definitions, especially if those Definitions be only in order to the <hi>Churches Peace</hi>: but if they be such as require Internal Assent to them, then plain Scripture, evidence of Sense, or clear Reason, may be sufficient cause to hinder the submitting to those Definitions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You tell us, <hi>That his Lordship hath abused S.</hi> Austin<hi>'s Testimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he speaks not of the Definitions of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>in matters not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, according to the matter they contain; but the Truth mentioned by him was Fundamental in its matter.</hi> This is the substance of your second Answer, which is very rational and prudent, being built on this substantial Evidence. If S. <hi>Austin</hi> doth preferr manifest Truth before things suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Fundamental in the matter,</hi> then no doubt S. <hi>Austin</hi> would not preferr manifest Truth, before things supposed not-Fundamental in the matter. And do not you think this enough to charge his Lordship with shamefully abusing S. <hi>Austin?</hi> But certainly, if S. <hi>Austin</hi> preferred manifest Truth before that which was greater, would he not do it before that which was incomparably less? If he did it before, all those things which kept him in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> such as the consent of Nations, Miracles, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition, which he mentions before; do you think he would have scrupled to have done it, as to any particular <hi>Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> These are therefore very excellent waies of vindicating the <hi>Fathers</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, from having any thing of sense or reason in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You say, <hi>He hath abused</hi> S. <hi>Austin, by putting in a wrangling Disputer</hi>: But I wonder where his Lordship ever sayes,<note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> that S. <hi>Austin</hi> mentions any such in the Testimony cited. For his words are these. <hi>But plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, with evident Sense, or a full Demonstrative Argument must have room, where a wrangling and erring Disputer may not be allowed it. And there's neither of these</hi> (over against these words, he referrs to S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and not the foregoing) <hi>but may convince the Definition of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, if it be ill founded.</hi> When you therefore ask, <hi>Where the wrangling Disputer is to be found</hi>; had it not been for the help of this Cavil, we might have been to seek for him. But when you have been enquiring for him, at last you cry out, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Oh! I see now:</hi> And you are the fittest man to find him out that I know. You say, <hi>This is done to distinguish him from such a Disputer as proceeds solidly and demonstratively against the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>when they are ill founded; which S.</hi> Austin <hi>is so far from supposing that one may do, that he judges him a mad man, who disputes against any thing</hi> quod universa Ecclesia sentit; <hi>and that they have hearts, not only of Stone, but even of Devils, who resist so great a manifestation of Truth, as is made by an Oecumenical Council, for of that he speaks.</hi> Your design is, to prove, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> doth not admit of any plea from <hi>Scripture, Sense,</hi> or <hi>Reason,</hi> against any Definitions of the <hi>Church,</hi> for which you first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that known place in which S. <hi>Austin</hi> accounts it madness to oppose the universal practices of the Church, which will hold for your purpose,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101069:53"/>
as far as rites and matters of Faith have any Analogy with each other; your latter Testimony seems more to the purpose to all persons who do not examine it, and to none else. For, although you seemed very careful to prevent any examination of the place by a false citation of <hi>Epist.</hi> 153. for 152. yet that hath not hindered my discovering your <hi>fraud,</hi> in asserting, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> there speaks of an <hi>Oecumenical Council.</hi> For there is not so much as any thing like it in that <hi>Epistle.</hi> I acknowledge those words to be found there which you produce, <hi>Nulla excusatio jam remansit: nimium dura, nimium diabolica sunt hominum corda, quae adhuc tantae manifestationi veritatis obsistunt.</hi> But there needs no more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the most of your Testimonies out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> but to mention the occasion of their being produced, or the scope and design of the <hi>Authors,</hi> as is most evident in this place. For this <hi>Epistle</hi> is written in the name of <hi>Silvanus, Valentinus, Aurelius, Innocentius, Maximinus, Optatus, Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Donatus,</hi> and other <hi>Bishops,</hi> for satisfaction of the <hi>Donatists</hi> concerning the proceedings at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi>; For the <hi>Donatist Bishops</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein baffled, had dispersed among their <hi>Proselytes</hi> many false ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of that <hi>Council,</hi> and of their being circumvented by their <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Adversaries. To disprove which in this Epistle, they first shew the fraud and falsitie of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and then the <hi>Integrity</hi> of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, by the choice of seven persons on either side, who should speak in behalf of the rest; and seven others as Counsellors to them; and four Notaries on either side, and four other persons who should keep the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> to prevent all fraud. Besides all this, every one was to subscribe in his own words, that no man might complain that any thing was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted afterwards; which things being dispersed, while the persons themselves lived, there was no probability Posterity should be deceived in the report of them. And then follow those words; <hi>That no excuse hath now been left, but that their hearts are too hard and diabolical, who could gainsay so clear a manifestation of Truth.</hi> Is it not now a rare consequence from hence to inferr, That it is not lawful upon any ground of <hi>Scripture, Sense</hi> or <hi>Reason,</hi> to dispute the <hi>Definitions</hi> of <hi>General Councils?</hi> Whereas no such thing was ever mentioned as a <hi>General Council,</hi> as appears by the very next words, where he sayes expresly, it was only a <hi>Council of</hi> Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can <hi>Bishops</hi>; and elsewhere S. <hi>Austin</hi> tells the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that they never durst appeal to a <hi>General Council.</hi> And supposing the <hi>Council</hi> never so <hi>Oecumenical,</hi>

                  <hi>and defining it in a National Council confirmed by the Pope. For this was</hi> plena authoritas Ecclesiae, <hi>though not</hi> plenissima; <hi>and to dispute against what was so practised and defined, is, in S.</hi> Augustine's <hi>sense, to shake the Foundation of the Church, if not wholly to destroy it.</hi> It seems a little hard to understand what you mean by <hi>the Churches being (not unproperly) said to practise this Doctrine:</hi> What, did the <hi>Church</hi> practise the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>remission of Original Sin in Infants?</hi> That a <hi>Church</hi> should practise a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> seems a little wonderful; but that it should do this and that <hi>not unproperly,</hi> increaseth the admiration. And we might think it a peculiar priviledge belonging to your <hi>Church,</hi> but that she is not so much used to <hi>practise</hi> things more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it. And can you think it enough to run us down, by telling us, <hi>That the Pope, with a National Council, hath defined it,</hi> unless you first prove, that the <hi>Pope, and a National Council,</hi> have as much authority as a <hi>General Council,</hi> which you pretend to be infallible; and if a <hi>National Council with the Pope</hi> be so too, I wonder to what end <hi>General Councils</hi> are ever call'd, since the Infallibility may be had at a much cheaper rate.</p>
               <p>And by the same reason you make <hi>National Councils Infallible,</hi> you may do <hi>Provincial,</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi> concurrs with them; and, by the same reason, the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Cardinals</hi> may be Infallible without any of them, because of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s concurrence with them. And so, all this business of <hi>Councils,</hi> is but a formal piece of <hi>Pageantry,</hi> since all the <hi>Infallibility</hi> they have by this pretence, is conferred by the <hi>Pope</hi> in his concurrence; whose Infallibility doth not depend on the presence of a <hi>Council</hi>; and therefore he must be as Infallible without a <hi>Council,</hi> as with it. So that at last this Discourse comes to this issue, <hi>He that shakes the Pope's Infallibility, shakes the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church:</hi> and prove but this to have been S. <hi>Augustine's</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you will highly advance the interest of your cause.</p>

The short account whereof is this. After that <hi>Julianus, Florus, Orontius, Fabius</hi> and others, had been deposed and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in the <hi>Western Churches,</hi> for the <hi>Pelagian Heresie,</hi> they fly to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and shroud themselves under the protection of <hi>Nestorius</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> there, who secretly favoured them, and writ several Letters to

                  <hi>Pope Celestine</hi> in behalf of them: who is supposed to have received his Doctrine of the person of <hi>Christ</hi> from the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> But when he saw that no good was to be done by these Letters, but by the daily spreading of <hi>Nestorianism,</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> was forced to summon a <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, A.

The <hi>Pelagians</hi> accompany <hi>Nestorius</hi> thither, and joyn with <hi>Johannes Antiochenus,</hi> and his party, in opposition to the <hi>Synod.</hi> But the <hi>Council</hi> understanding the proceedings which had been in the <hi>Western Churches</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> ratifies and confirms their deposition, as appears by the Synodal Epistle of the <hi>Council</hi> to <hi>Pope Celestine,</hi> which is extant in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Ephesine Council:</hi> and in the Epistles of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And besides this, some of the <hi>Canons</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> do equally concern <hi>Celestius</hi> and <hi>Nestorius</hi>; the first <hi>Canon</hi> decreeing as well the favourers of <hi>Celestius</hi> as <hi>Nestorius</hi> to be excommunicate; and the fourth dereeing the <hi>Deposition</hi> of all such who should embrace either of them.

You will say, Yes: if that Council be confirmed by the Pope. And then I must ever wonder, why S.</hi> Augustine <hi>should say, The full Authority of the Church; and not bestow one word upon the Pope, by whose Authority only that Council, as all other, have their fulness of Authority in your judgement.

                  <hi>in speaking of the Authority of the Church; because his Authority is alwaies chiefly supposed, as being Head of the whole Church.</hi> But by whom was this supposed? <hi>by you,</hi> or by S. <hi>Augustine?</hi> Can you prove that S. <hi>Austin,</hi> or any of the <hi>African Fathers</hi> did ever sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any such thing, that the <hi>Pope</hi> being Head of the Church, his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is chiefly supposed in the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>National Councils?</hi> Where was the supposal of this Authority in the Dispute between the <hi>African Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Popes,</hi> in the case of <hi>Appeals?</hi> These are suppositions, only to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon ignorant <hi>Novices</hi>; and such, who look no further into <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> than the Implicit Faith in their <hi>Priests</hi> will give them leave.

Yet granting the Supposition true (than which nothing can be more false) when the main strength lyes not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101069:55"/>
in the bare Definition of a <hi>National Council,</hi> which you grant of it self hath not full <hi>Authority,</hi> but in the confirmation of that Decision by the <hi>Pope</hi> which makes that <hi>Authority full,</hi> which was not so before; Was it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to declare, that the <hi>Pope</hi> did concurr to the giving it <hi>full Authority,</hi> which without it could not be had? You do not say, That <hi>all National Councils</hi> have this <hi>full Authority,</hi> not being confirmed by the <hi>Pope</hi>; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Augustine</hi> designed to shew that <hi>Council</hi> to have <hi>full Authority,</hi> the only way, to prove it, was to produce the <hi>Pope's Confirmation</hi> of it; which cannot therefore be otherwise looked on, than as an <hi>inexpiable Omission,</hi> if your Doctrine be true; for he left out that which was only pertinent and material to the business. Your parallel between S. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>your self</hi> (which is a very worthy one) <hi>in leaving out the mention of the Pope's Authority when it is understood,</hi> will then hold when you produce as great evidence that S. <hi>Austin</hi> was a <hi>Jesuit,</hi> as we have from your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that you are. When you give as manifest proof, that the <hi>Pope's Power</hi> is necessary to all <hi>Definitions</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> as there is in our <hi>Laws</hi> for our <hi>Kings</hi> assenting to <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi>; we may give you leave to <hi>parallel the Omission of the express mention of one with the other.</hi> If the Definitions of Ancient <hi>Councils</hi> did run in the name of <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> as our <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in the name of the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>both Houses,</hi> we might easily say, the Authority of them came from the <hi>Pope,</hi> as of these from the <hi>King</hi>; but there is nothing of that nature, but much of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as will appear in due time. When you therefore prove that the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power is implied, though it be not mentioned, you must prove it by some evident Confession, that no Authority of a <hi>Council</hi> was <hi>full,</hi> unless the <hi>Pope</hi> concurred with it: else you may as well say, That the great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul</hi> hath no full Authority to decree any thing without the <hi>Pope</hi>'s consent; for I dare say, There is no denial of it in any of his <hi>Laws.</hi> And yet, that is more than can be said here, for we have sufficient testimony from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that age, That the <hi>Pope's Authority</hi> was not supposed necessary to Councils, from his being <hi>Head of the Church.</hi> What follows p. 34. n. 5, 6. depends wholly upon the often-mention'd distinction of the <hi>Formal and Material Object</hi> of Faith; the foundation of which, having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready removed, whatever you offer to build upon it, must of necessity fall to the ground; but I shall not follow your ill example, <hi>in making te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Repetitions,</hi> and then cry out, <hi>You are forced to it.</hi>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101069:55"/>
                  <hi>Church,</hi> is, I suppose, to be believed as necessary, <hi>i. e. Fundamental,</hi> by the <hi>Church teaching and representing,</hi> as well as <hi>taught and diffusive.</hi> Unless you think those who decree things, to be believed by all in order to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, do exclude themselves out of that number; and therefore, though it be necessary for all others to believe it, it is still <hi>indifferent</hi> for them, whether they will believe it or no. And therefore, were I of your <hi>Church,</hi> I should heartily wish my self of the <hi>teaching and representative Church</hi>; for then others might go to <hi>Hell</hi> for not believing that, which I might chuse whether I would or no. What an excellent invention this is, to make the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals</hi> go to <hi>Heaven,</hi> though they be <hi>Atheists</hi> and <hi>Infidels?</hi> For, you tell us, we can have no assurance of any matter of Faith, but from the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi>; this Infallibility lyes not in the <hi>taught and diffusive,</hi> but in the <hi>teaching and representative Church</hi>; and this distinction here supposes, that what is made the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Church taught,</hi> is not the Foundation of the <hi>Church teaching, i. e.</hi> what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation for one, is not so for the other; for that is your meaning of <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> Now, since all things become necessary to be believed by the <hi>Church diffusive,</hi> upon the Authority of the <hi>Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative</hi>; it necessarily follows, from this distinction, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all is necessary to be believed <hi>by the Church representative.</hi> And is not this a rare Church the mean while? but what is it which makes it a <hi>Church?</hi> for though it <hi>represents</hi> and <hi>teaches,</hi> yet it is still call'd a <hi>Church teaching and representative</hi>: If it be a <hi>Church,</hi> something must make it so: What can make it so, if not the belief of what is <hi>necessary to Salvation?</hi> And if it doth not believe all that is necessary to Salvation, the <hi>Church dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusive</hi> is much more truly a <hi>Church,</hi> than the <hi>representative:</hi> If it doth believe all that is necessary, then it must believe its own <hi>Definitions,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those are supposed to be so; and consequently, if those be <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, the Church must still lay her own Foundation.</hi> Or else these conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences follow. 1. That may be a true <hi>Church,</hi> which doth not believe all things necessary to Salvation. 2. The <hi>Church teaching</hi> is not bound to believe that which she <hi>teaches,</hi> but only the <hi>Church taught.</hi> 3. That may be the same <hi>Church</hi> which <hi>Fundamentally differs</hi> from it self. 4. When the <hi>Church</hi> defines a thing to be <hi>necessary,</hi> she doth not <hi>believe</hi> it to be <hi>necessary,</hi> but it becomes necessary after her Definition. For, I pray, satisfie us as to this <hi>Teaching Church,</hi> when she defines something necessary to be believed in order to Salvation, which was not so defined before; Doth she at that <hi>Instant</hi> of her <hi>Definition</hi> believe that to be necessary to Salvation, or doth she not? If she doth, then it is necessary before her Definition; and so the belief of it as necessary, cannot depend upon it: But if she believes it only to be necessary, because she defines it to be so; then she cannot believe it to be necessary, till she hath defined it, and consequently defines that to be necessary, which she believes not to be necessary: and so defines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her own judgement and belief. Let me therefore ask here some more Questions, which I doubt you will think troublesome, If the <hi>Church representative</hi> believed that <hi>not to be necessary</hi> to Salvation, which she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <hi>to be necessary to Salvation,</hi> was she infallible in that belief or no? If she was not infallible, then at that time what assurance could men have, of any matter of Faith, since you tell us, That must be had from the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>? If she were infallible, then either in <hi>some things only,</hi> or in <hi>all</hi> she believed? if only in <hi>some things</hi> we ought to know what she is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in, and what not, lest we deceive our selves in believing her infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101069:56"/>
in that in which she is not infallible? If <hi>in all things,</hi> then she is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in believing that <hi>not to be necessary</hi> to Salvation, which yet she infallibly defines to <hi>be necessary</hi> to Salvation: And so the <hi>Church</hi> may infallibly define that to be <hi>true,</hi> which at the very moment of that <hi>Definition,</hi> she infallibly believes to be false. All these are the just and excellent Consequences of this useful Distinction of <hi>yours,</hi> which you look on as the only happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, whereby to free your self from asserting, that the <hi>Church,</hi> by making things <hi>Fundamental,</hi> by her <hi>Definitions, doth thereby lay her own Foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as absurd and unreasonable as this is, you would seem to have something to say for it:<note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> for you tell us, <hi>That the Pastors, in all Ages pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Christian People from being carried away with every wind of Doctrine,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>are a Foundation to them of constancy in Doctrine.</hi> Wonderfully subtle! it is pity such excellent reasoning should want the ornaments of <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure:</hi> but thus it is in them. If the Pastors of the Church may be the means of preserving men from errours, then the Definition of the <hi>Church teaching,</hi> is the Foundation of the <hi>Church taught:</hi> which in short amounts to this; If the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> may be a Foundation of mens <hi>constancy in Doctrine,</hi> then they may be a Foundation of mens <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in Doctrine.</hi> If this be not that you mean, I can make no sense of what you say; and if it be, let any one else make <hi>Sense</hi> of it, that hath a gift for it. For, by <hi>constancy in Doctrine,</hi> is meant, the adhering to that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which <hi>God hath revealed</hi> as necessary in his Word, but by the Definitions of the <hi>teaching Church,</hi> you understand a Power to make more things necessary to the Salvation of all than <hi>Christ</hi> hath made; so that, joyn these two together, the Consequence is this: If the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> may, and ought to keep men from believing any other <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> then they have power to impose <hi>another Doctrine</hi>; which things are so contradictious to each other, that none but one of your <hi>faculty</hi> would have ventured to have set one to prove the other. Therefore when you would prove any thing by this Argument, your <hi>Medium</hi> must be this, That the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> are a <hi>Foundation of constancy in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> by laying <hi>New Foundations of Doctrines</hi> by her Definitions, which is just as if you would prove, That the best way to keep a House entire, without any additions, is to build another house adjoyning to it.</p>
               <p>But, say you further, <hi>Were not the Apostles in their times (who were</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia docens) <hi>by their Doctrine and Decrees, a Foundation to the Church which was taught by them? Doth not S.</hi> Paul <hi>expresly affirm it,</hi> superaedificati supra Fundamentum Apostolorum, &amp;c. To which I answer. 1. That the <hi>Apostles</hi> were not therefore said to be the <hi>Foundation</hi> on which they were built who believed on that Doctrine, because, by virtue of their <hi>Power,</hi> they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine or decree any thing to be necessary to Salvation, which was not so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but, because they were the <hi>Instruments</hi> whereby the things which were necessary to Salvation, were conveyed to them. And because their Authority, by virtue of their <hi>Mission,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> accompanying it, was the means whereby they were brought to believe the Doctrin of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as in it self true. But there is a great deal of difference between <hi>teaching</hi> what is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation, and making any thing necessary to Salvation, which was before, meerly because it is taught by them. 2. I grant, that those things did become necessary to be believed, which the <hi>Apostles</hi> taught; but, it was either because the things were in themselves necessary, in order to the end declared, <hi>viz. Man's Salvation,</hi> or else it was on the account of that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101069:56"/>
evidence which the <hi>Apostles</hi> gave, that they were persons immediately imployed by <hi>God,</hi> to deliver those Doctrines to them. But still here is nothing becoming necessary, by virtue of a Decree or Definition, but by virtue of a <hi>Testimony,</hi> that what they delivered, came from <hi>God.</hi> 3. When the <hi>Apostles</hi> delivered these things, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> was not made known to the world; but they were chosen by <hi>God,</hi> and infallibly assisted for that end, that they might reveal it to the world: And this is certainly a very different case from that, when the Doctrine of Salvation is fully revealed and delivered down to us in unquestionable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. And therefore, if you will prove any thing to your purpose, you must prove as great and as divine assistance of the Spirit in the <hi>Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative</hi> of all Ages, as was in the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the first Age of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church. 4. When you say from hence, That the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as the <hi>teaching Church,</hi> laid the <hi>Foundation of the Church taught</hi>; that can only be understood of those <hi>Christians</hi> who became a <hi>Church,</hi> by the <hi>Apostles</hi> preaching the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> to them: but this is quite a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing from laying the <hi>Foundation</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> already in being as your <hi>Church,</hi> taught, and diffusive, is supposed to be. Can you tell us, where the Apostles are said to lay further Foundations for <hi>Churches</hi> already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted; that they made or declared more things necessary to Salvation, than were so antecedently to their being a <hi>Church?</hi> But this is your case, you pretend a power in your <hi>Church representative,</hi> to make more things necessary to Salvation, than were before to a <hi>Church</hi> already in <hi>Being,</hi> and therefore supposed to believe all things necessary to Salvation. You see therefore, what a vast disparity there is in the case, and how far the <hi>Apostles</hi> declaring the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> and thereby founding <hi>Churches,</hi> is from being an Argument that the <hi>representative Church,</hi> may lay the Foundation of the <hi>Church diffusive,</hi> which being a <hi>Church</hi> already, must have its <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> laid before all new Decrees and Definitions of the <hi>teaching Church.</hi> So that still it unavoidably follows upon your principles, That the <hi>Church must lay her own Foundation,</hi> and then the <hi>Church</hi> must have been in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and perfect <hi>Being,</hi> before so much as her <hi>Foundation</hi> is laid. Your weak endeavour of retorting this upon the <hi>Bishop,</hi> because of the <hi>Apostles teaching the Church</hi> of their Age, only shews, that you have a good will to say something in behalf of so bad a cause, but that you want ability to do it: as appears by the Answers already given, as to the difference of the <hi>Apostles</hi> case and yours.

                  <note place="margin">P. 38. n. 15.</note> To which his Lordship answers, 1. <hi>That this is understood only of Catholick Maxims, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Fundamental, by</hi> Vincentius Lirinensis, <hi>from whom this Argument is derived.</hi> 2. <hi>He denies, that all Determinations of the Church are made firm to us by one and the same Divine Revelation.</hi> 3. <hi>He denies,</hi>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101069:57"/>
of the Church are sufficiently applied by one and the same full Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church.</hi> Of each of these he gives his reasons; the examination and defence of which, is all that remains of this Chapter. To the first, you answer three things (for I must digest your Answers for you.<note place="margin">P. 37.</note>) 1. <hi>That there is no evidence, that</hi> A. C. <hi>borrowed this from</hi> Vincentius, and you give an excellent reason for it, <hi>because good wits may both hit on the same thing,</hi> or at least come near it; which, had it been said of your self, had been more unquestionable: but, to let that pass, 2. You tell us, <hi>That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is true, whosoever said it.</hi> For which, you give this reason. <hi>For the same reason which permits not our questioning, or denying the prime Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of Faith, permits not our questioning, or denying any other Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Church; because it is not the greatness or smalness of the matter, that moves us to give firm Assent in Points of Faith; but the Authority of God speaking by the Church.</hi> To which I answer, that all this runs upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position false in it self, which is, <hi>That all our Assurance in matters of Faith, depends upon the Infallible Authority of the present Church</hi>; which being granted, I would not deny; but, supposing that <hi>Infallibility</hi> absolute, on the same reason I believe one thing on the <hi>Churches Authority,</hi> I must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all. For the case were the same then, as to the <hi>Church,</hi> which we say, it is as to the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; he that believes any thing, on the account of its being contained in that <hi>Book</hi> as the <hi>Word of God,</hi> must believe every thing he is convinced to be therein contained, whether the matter be in it self small or great; because the ground of his belief, is the <hi>Authority of God,</hi> revealing those things to us. And if therefore you could prove such a <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> constantly resident in the <hi>Church,</hi> for determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all matters of Faith, I grant your consequence would hold: but that is too great a <hi>boon</hi> to be had for <hi>begging,</hi> and that is all the way you use for it here. If you offer to prove it afterwards, our Answers shall be ready to attend you. But at present, let it suffice to tell you, That we believe no Article of Faith at all upon the <hi>Churches Infallible Authority</hi>; and therefore, though we deny what the <hi>Church</hi> proposeth, it follows not that we are any more liable to question the truth of any Article any further than the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> reaches in it; <hi>i. e.</hi> we deny that any thing becomes an Article meerly upon her <hi>account.</hi> But now, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Argument from the <hi>present Churches Infallible Authority,</hi> to the <hi>Vniversal Churches Testimony,</hi> we then tell you, That he who questions a clear, full, universal Tradition of the whole <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Christ's time</hi> to this, will, by the same reason, doubt of all matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> which are conveyed by this <hi>Testimony</hi> to us. But then we must further consider, That we are bound by virtue of the <hi>Churches Testimony,</hi> to believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing any further, than it appears to have been the constant, full, <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> from the time of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> Whatever therefore you can make appear to have been received as a necessary Article of Faith in this manner, we embrace it, but nothing else; and on the other side, we say, That whoever doubts, or denies this Testimony, will doubt of all matters of Faith, because the ground and rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> is conveyed to us only through this Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Tradition.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Dogma according to our English Lexicons, Rider, and others, signifies a Decree, or common received Opinion, whether in prime, or less principal matters.</hi> What a learned dispute are we now fallen into? But I see you were resolved to put all, but <hi>Boys</hi> and <hi>Paedagogues</hi> out of all likelyhood of confuting you; For those are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the persons among us, who deal in <hi>Rider</hi> and <hi>English Lexicons.</hi> I see now, there is some hopes, that the orders of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> may have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Latin,</hi> then that against Mr. <hi>White</hi> had; since our old <hi>Jesuites</hi> begin to be so well versed in such Masters of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue. How low is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> fallen, that we must appeal for knowing what <hi>dogma fidei</hi> is, to the definition not of <hi>Popes and Councils,</hi> but of <hi>Rider</hi> and <hi>English Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons?</hi> But it is ill jesting with our <hi>Orbilius</hi> in so severe a humour, that his <hi>Grace of Canterbury</hi> cannot scape his <hi>lash</hi> for not consulting <hi>Riders Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionary</hi> for the signification of <hi>Dogma.</hi> But our Authour passeth, and we must attend him, out of his <hi>Grammatical into the Theological School</hi>; and there tells us, <hi>That the Ecclesiastical signification of Dogma, extends it self to all things established in the Church, as matters of Faith, whether Fundamentals or Superstructures; and for this, Scotus is cited</hi> (somewhat a better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour than <hi>Rider) who calls Transubstantiation, Dogma fidei.</hi> I begin to believe now, that <hi>Dogma</hi> is a very large word, and <hi>Fides</hi> much larger, that can hold so prodigious a thing as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> within them. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what <hi>Rider</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> say, None so able to explain <hi>Vincentius</hi> his meaning, as <hi>Vincentius</hi> himself. To him therefore at last our Authour appeals and tells us, <hi>That he declares in other places, that he means by Dogma such things as in general belong to Christian Faith without distinction.</hi> But doth <hi>Vincentius</hi> any where by <hi>Dogma</hi> mean any such things which were not judged necessary by the ancient and Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> but become necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed upon the <hi>Churches Definitions?</hi> Nothing can possibly be imagined more directly contrary to the design of his whole <hi>Book</hi> then that is, when he appeals still for matters to be believed to <hi>Antiquity, Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi>; and to be sure, all these are required to whatever he means by a <hi>Dogma fidei:</hi> if you therefore can produce any testimonies out of his Book, which can be supposed in the least to favour the power of the <hi>Church</hi> in her new <hi>Definitions</hi> of matters of Faith, you may justly challenge to your self the name of an excellent Invention, who can find that in his Book, which all other persons find the directly contrary to.

So that still <hi>Vincentius,</hi> where-ever he speaks of this <hi>Dogma fidei,</hi> speaks in direct opposition to your sense of it, for new definitions of the Church in matters of Faith.

which as yet you have failed in.

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 39.</note> is somewhat hard to conceive; and yet both these you assert together. Is that which is necessary to be believed by all, the same with that which was not necessary to be so believed? if the same measure of Faith will not serve after, which would have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is there not an alteration made: <hi>Yes,</hi> you grant, <hi>as to our believing, but not as to the thing, for that is the same it was.</hi> But do you in the mean time consider what kind of <hi>thing</hi> that is which you speak of, which is a thing <hi>propounded to be believed,</hi> and considered in no other respect, but as it is revealed <hi>by God</hi> in order to our believing it; now when the same thing which was required only to be believed implicitely, <hi>i. e.</hi> not at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, is now propounded to be believed expresly and necessarily; the <hi>Fundamental</hi> nature of it, as an <hi>object of Faith,</hi> is altered. For that which you call <hi>implicite Faith,</hi> doth really imply as to all those things to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved implicitely, that there is an indifferency, whether they be believed or no; nothing being necessary to be believed, but what is propounded to be expresly believed: Which being so, Can it be imagined there should be a greater alteration in a matter of Faith, then from its being indifferent whether it were believed or no, to become necessary to be expresly believed by all in order to Salvation? And where there is such an alteration as this in the thing to be believed, who can without the help of a very commodious implicite Faith believe, that still this is <hi>hoc idem quod antea,</hi> the very same as a matter of Faith, which it was before. Though <hi>the Church were careful to preserve every Iota and tittle of Sacred Doctrines</hi>; yet I hope it follows not, that every <hi>Iota</hi> and <hi>tittle</hi> is of as much consequence, and as necessary to be believed, as the main substance of <hi>Christian Doctrine.</hi> Although <hi>when any Doctrine was violently opposed in the Church she might declare her owning it by some overt act</hi>; yet thence it doth not follow, that the <hi>internal assent</hi> to every thing so declared is as necessary, as to that <hi>proposition,</hi> that <hi>Jesus is the Son of God,</hi> the belief of which the Scripture tells us was the main design of the writing of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> That <hi>General Councils, rightly proceeding, may be great helps to the Faith of Christians,</hi> I know none that deny; but that by vertue of their

                  <hi>but the whole Church? in which,</hi> he saith, <hi>we are to adhere to antiquity.</hi> If you answer, he speaks only of <hi>an endeavour:</hi> it is soon replyed, That he speaks of <hi>such an endeavour</hi> as puts men to dispute a question, what they are to do in such a Case, and he resolves at that time, they are not to adhere to the judgement of the <hi>present Church,</hi> but to that of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which is all we desire in that Case, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>present Church</hi> may so far add to matters of Faith, that we can in no reason be obliged to rely only upon her judgement. Wherein we are to consider, the <hi>Question</hi> is not of that you call the <hi>diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi> but the <hi>representative Church,</hi> all which may be overspread, and yet but a part of the other; but yet if that <hi>Church,</hi> whose judgement you say only is to be relyed on may be so infected, it is all one as to those who are to be guided by her <hi>judgement,</hi> whether the <hi>other</hi> be or no. For here <hi>eadem est ratio non entis &amp; non apparentis,</hi> because it is not the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the manifestation which is the ground of mens relying on the <hi>Churches</hi> judgement. So that if as to all outward <hi>appearance</hi> and all <hi>judicial acts</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> she may recede from the ancient Faith, and add <hi>novitia veteribus,</hi> (whether all particular persons in it do so or no) all ground of relying on the judgement of that <hi>Church,</hi> is thereby taken away. Whether it be <hi>the Church her self, or Hereticks in the Church which make these additions,</hi> is very little material, if these <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who add these <hi>new articles of Faith,</hi> may carry themselves so cunningly as to get to themselves the reputation of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> and so that which ought to have been <hi>Sacrarium veritatis,</hi> may become <hi>impiorum &amp; turpium errorum Lupanar:</hi> which your Church is concerned not to have <hi>Englished</hi>; but by the help of <hi>Rider,</hi> and other good <hi>Authours</hi> of yours, it is no hard matter to come to understand it.

                  <hi>That all determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church are not made firm to us by one and the same Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; because some are made by Scripture, and others, as</hi> Stapleton <hi>saith,</hi>

                  <hi>without any evident or probable testimony of Holy writ: though therein</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine <hi>falls quite off, and confesses in express terms, that nothing can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by certainty of Faith, unless it be contained immediately in the Word of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101069:60"/>
God: or be deduced thence by evident consequence.</hi> Your only design here, is, to vindicate your two great Champions from contradicting each other,<note place="margin">P. 42 n. 9.</note> which though it be of little consequence to the main Assertion of his Lordship, which you knew well enough, and therefore carefully avoid the main Charge of your enemy, to part two of your quarrelling friends: yet since you intend this for a tryal of your <hi>skill,</hi> we must see how well you play your <hi>Prize.</hi> Stapleton, <hi>you say, means that we must submit to the determinations of the Church and the traditions she approves, though they be not expresly contained in Scripture.</hi> Excellently well guessed at <hi>Stapletons</hi> meaning! when the very words you cite out of him are, <hi>We ought not to deny our assent in matters of Faith, though we have them only by tradition, or the decisions of the Church against Hereticks, and not confirmed with evident or probable testimony of Scripture.</hi> What a rare Interpreter are you grown since your acquaintance with <hi>Rider,</hi> and other <hi>English Lexicons?</hi> Who make <hi>not denying assent</hi> in matters of Faith, to be the same with <hi>submitting to the Churches Determinations,</hi> when you know well enough, we plead for submission to the <hi>Churches Determinations,</hi> where there may be a liberty as to <hi>internal assent:</hi> and it is as good to make <hi>no evident or probable testimony of Scripture the same with not being expresly contained in Scripture</hi>; as though nothing which was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> could have any probable testimony from thence. And from this we may guess what an easie matter it is for you to accommodate all persons who differ, if one sayes <hi>Yes,</hi> and the other <hi>No,</hi> you will tell them they do not differ, but that one of them by <hi>Yes,</hi> means <hi>No</hi>; and the other by <hi>No,</hi> means <hi>Yes.</hi> Just so here you reconcile <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>; for you say, <hi>Stapleton</hi> by [no probable testimony] means some kind of probable testimony, <hi>viz.</hi> such as though not express, may be yet deduced from <hi>Scripture</hi>; and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when he speaks of <hi>Gods written Word,</hi> as the <hi>ground of certainty,</hi> means that which is neither <hi>Gods Word,</hi> nor yet <hi>written,</hi> viz. <hi>Tradition.</hi> I never met with one who had a better faculty of reconciling than you seem to have by this attempt. But his Lordship had prevented this subterfuge as to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and <hi>Stapleton, as if</hi> Stapleton <hi>spake of the Word of God written, and</hi> Bellarmine <hi>of the Word of God unwritten</hi> (as he calls <hi>Tradition</hi>). For <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 40.</note> saith he, <hi>there treats of the knowledge which a man hath of the certainty of his own Salvation. And I hope</hi> A. C. <hi>will not tell us, there's any Tradition extant unwritten, by which particular men may have assurance of their several Salvations. Therefore</hi> Bellarmine<hi>'s whole Disputation there, is quite beside the matter: Or else, he must speak of the written Word, and so lye cross to</hi> Stapleton <hi>as is mentioned.</hi> You tell us, This <hi>Reason is very strange:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag 43.</note> but I dare say, yours exceeds it in strangeness, which is, <hi>because</hi> Bellarmines <hi>design was to shew, there was no such unwritten Tradition to be found.</hi> But doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dispute against any body or no body? If he disputes against any body upon your principles, those whom he disputes against must be such, who assert that men may have certainty of <hi>Faith</hi> concerning their Salvation from <hi>Tradition</hi>; and you would do well to tell us, Who those were that pretended that there was a Tradition or unwritten word delivered down from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that they should be saved. And though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was not to affirm this, yet those he disputed against, upon your Principles must be supposed to do it. But certainly you thought none of your Readers did ever intend to look into <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for the place in Controversie; for if they did, nothing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101069:60"/>
could be more plain, than that <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reason against <hi>Catharinus</hi> and others, proceeds wholly and only upon the <hi>written Word.</hi> For, 1. When he saith, that <hi>Nothing can be certain with the certainty of Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. de justific. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>sect.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>but what is either immediately contained in the Word of God, or may be deduced thence by evident consequence, because Faith can rest on nothing, but the authority of Gods Word</hi>; he adds, <hi>That of this Principle, neither the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks nor the Hereticks doubt.</hi> But I pray, do those whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> there calls <hi>Hereticks,</hi> acknowledge the unwritten Word as a foundation for certainty of Faith in the Case Disputed? therefore it is plain, he speaks exclusively of a written Word. 2. When he mentions the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, he evidently explains himself of the <hi>written Word</hi>; for, saith he, <hi>There is no such Proposition contained in the Word of God, that such and such a particular person is justified; for there are none mentioned therein save</hi> Mary Magdalen, <hi>and a certain Paralytick of whom it is said, their sins are forgiven them. Caeteri homines in sacris literis n√® nominantur quidem.</hi> And will <hi>Rider,</hi> and your other good friends <hi>the English Lexicons,</hi> help you to interpret <hi>Sacrae literae</hi> by <hi>unwritten Traditions?</hi> Could any one that had either any <hi>common sense</hi> left in him, or else had not a design most grosly to impose on his Readers, offer to perswade men, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could here understand the <hi>Word of God</hi> in a sense common to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition.</hi> If you can prove that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith otherwise elsewhere, you are so far from reconciling <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> and <hi>Stapleton,</hi> that you will not easily reconcile <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to himself.</p>

The Question was, <hi>What Points the Bishop would account Fundamental</hi>; and that you may shew how necessary this Question was,<note place="margin">P. 45. n. 1.</note> you add; <hi>For if he will have some Fundamental, which we are bound to believe under pain of damnation; and others not Fundamental, which we may, without sin, question, or deny; it behoves us much to know, what they are. I have ever desired,</hi> say you, <hi>a satisfactory Answer from Protestants to this Question, but could never yet have it in the sense demanded.</hi> An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man you are, who, it seems, have in your time propounded more foolish Questions, than a great many wise men were never able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. But, is it not every jot as reasonable, That since your <hi>Church</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the power of making things necessary to the Salvation of all, which were not so before, we should have from you an exact <hi>Catalogue</hi> of all <hi>your Churches</hi> Definitions? If for that, you referr us to the <hi>Confession</hi> of Faith, at the end of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi>; so, may not we, with far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason, send you back to the <hi>Apostolical Creed?</hi> there being no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which will hold against this, being a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of our <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> but will hold against that <hi>Being a Catalogue of yours.</hi> Nay, you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert such things your self concerning the necessity of believing things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the <hi>Church,</hi> as make it impossible for you to assign the definite number of such things, as are necessary for all persons, and therefore it is very unreasonable to demand it of us. For still, when you speak, that the things defined by the <hi>Church,</hi> are necessary to the Salvation of all, you add, <hi>Where they are sufficiently propounded</hi>; so that the measure of <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> depends on the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Proposition.</hi> Now, will you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to assign what number of things are sufficiently propounded to the belief of all persons? Can you set down the exact bounds, as to all individuals, when their ignorance is inexcusable, and when not? Can you tell what the measure of their capacity was? what allowance <hi>God</hi> makes for the prejudices of Education, where there is a mind desirous of instruction? Will you say, <hi>God</hi> accounts all those things sufficiently proposed to mens belief, which you judge to be so? or, that all men are bound to think those things necessary to Salvation, which you think so? by what means shall the <hi>Churches</hi> Power of defining matters of Faith, be sufficiently proposed to men as an Article of Faith? Either by its own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101069:61"/>
or without? If by its; the thing is proposed to be believed, which is supposed to be believed already, before that Proposition; or else the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry returns with as great force, Why should I believe that Definition more than any other? if without it; then the sufficiency of Proposition, and the necessity of believing depends not on the <hi>Churches</hi> Definition. These Questions I am apt to think <hi>as pertinent</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> as yours was: and, now you know my sense, and are so discontented you could never meet with a satisfactory Answer from <hi>Protestants,</hi> prevent the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction in me, by giving a punctual Answer to such necessary Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions. But, if you think the demands <hi>unreasonable,</hi> because they depend on such things, which none can know but <hi>God</hi> himself; I pray accept of that as a satisfactory Answer to your own <hi>very pertinent Question.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Question be propounded not concerning <hi>what things are Fundamental and necessary to particular persons,</hi>

                  <hi>Since the Fathers make the Creed the Rule of Faith; since the agreeing sense of Scripture, with those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, are the two Regular Precepts, by which a Divine is governed about the Faith; since your own Council of</hi> Trent <hi>decrees, That it is that principle of Faith, in which all that profess Christ, do necessarily agree,</hi> &amp; Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum firmum &amp; unicum, <hi>not the firm only, but the only Foundation; since it is Excommunication</hi> ipso jure, <hi>for any man to contradict the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Creed; since the whole body of Faith is so contained in the Creed, as that the substance of it was believed even before the coming of Christ; though not so expresly as since, in the number of the Articles: Since</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin <hi>confesses, That all things simply necessary for all mens Salvation, are in the Creed and Decalogue, What reason can you have to except?</hi> Thus far his Lordship: though from hence it appears, what <hi>little reason</hi> you have to except; yet because <hi>of that,</hi> I expect your Exceptions the sooner: and therefore very fairly passing by the sense of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> you ask con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent; What if, that call the Creed the only Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Are you come to a <hi>What if,</hi> with the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi> But, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it is not from <hi>disputing its Authority,</hi> but <hi>its meaning</hi>; for you would seem to understand it only <hi>of prime Articles of Faith, and not of such as all are bound upon sufficient Proposition expresly to believe</hi>; for that is all the sense I can make of your words. But, whoever was so silly, as to say, That all such things which are to be believed on <hi>sufficient Proposition</hi> that they are revealed by <hi>God,</hi> are contained in the Creed? When you seem to imply, That this was the sense the Question was propounded in, it is a sign you little attend to the Consequence of things: when it is most evident, that the <hi>Question</hi> was started concerning the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and therefore must referr only to such <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> as are necessary to be owned in order to the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>true Church.</hi> And when you can prove, that any other Articles are necessary to that, besides those contained in the <hi>Creed,</hi> you will do something to purpose, but not before. But, you suppose <hi>them to take the Creed in a very large sense, who would lap up in the folds of it all particular Points of Faith whatever:</hi> and I am sure, this is not the sense it is to be taken in here, nor that in which his Lordship took it. He saith indeed, <hi>That if he had said, that those Articles only which are
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101069:62"/>
expressed in the Creed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>are Fundamental, it would have been hard to have excluded the Scripture, upon which the Creed it self in every Point is grounded. For nothing is supposed to shut out its own Foundation.</hi> And this is built on very good reason. For the things contained in the <hi>Creed</hi> are proposed as matters to be believed; all <hi>Faith</hi> must suppose a <hi>Divine Testimony</hi> reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those things to us, as the <hi>ground</hi> on which we believe them; this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Testimor</hi> is never pretended to be contained in the <hi>Creed</hi>; but that it is only a <hi>summary Collection</hi> of the most necessary Points which <hi>God</hi> hath revealed; and therefore something else must be supposed as the ground and formal reason why we assent to the truth of those things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. So that the <hi>Creed</hi> must suppose the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the main and only Foundation of believing the matters of Faith therein contained. But say you, <hi>If all the Scripture be included in the Creed, there appears no great reason of scruple,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 42. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>why the same should not be said of Traditions, and other Points; especially of that for which we admit Scripture it self.</hi> But, do you make no difference between the <hi>Scripture</hi> being supposed as the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and all <hi>Scripture</hi> being contained in the <hi>Creed?</hi> And doth not his Lordship tell you, <hi>That though some Articles may be Fundamental, which are infolded in the Creed, it would not follow, that therefore some unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were Fundamental; for, though they may have Authority, and use, in the Church, as Apostolical, yet are they not Fundamental in the Faith.</hi> And as for that Tradition, <hi>That the Books of Holy Scripture are Divine, and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in every part</hi>; he promises to handle it, when he comes to the proper place for it. And there we shall readily attend what you have to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to what his Lordship saith about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note>But yet you say, <hi>His Lordship doth not answer the Question, as far as it was necessary to be answered</hi>; we say, he doth. <hi>No,</hi> say you: <hi>For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion arising concerning the Greek Churches errour, whether it were Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental or no</hi>; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher demanded of the Bishop, What Points he would account Fundamental:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>to which he answers, That all Points contained in the Creed, are such, but yet not only they; and therefore this was no direct Answer to the Question; for, though the Greeks errour was not against the Creed, yet it may be against some other Fundamental Article not contained in the Creed.</hi> This you call <hi>fine shuffling.</hi> To which I answer, That when his Lordship speaks of its not being <hi>Fundamentum unicum</hi> in that sense, to exclude all things not contained in the <hi>Creed</hi> from being Fundamental; he spake it with an immediate respect to the belief of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as an <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 43. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>The truth is, I said, and say still, That all the Points of the Apostles Creed, as they are there expressed, are Fundamental. And herein I say no more than some of your best learned have said before me. But, I never said, or meant, that they only are Fundamental; that they are</hi> Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum unicum, <hi>is the Council of</hi> Trent's, <hi>'tis not mine. Mine is, That the belief of Scripture to be the Word of God and Infallible, is an equal, or rather a preceding Principle of Faith, with, or to, the whole body of the Creed.</hi> Now, what reason can you have to call this, shuffling, unless you will rank the Greeks errour equal with the denying <hi>the Scripture to be the Word of God?</hi> otherwise, his Lordship's Answer is as full and pertinent, as your cavil is vain and trifling. His Lordship adds, <hi>That this agrees with one of your own great Masters,</hi> Albertus Magnus, <hi>who is not far from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> in terminis. To which your Exceptions are so pitiful, that I shall answer them, without reciting them; for he that supposeth the sense of Scripture, joyned with the Articles of Faith, to be the Rule of Faith, as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101069:62"/>
                  <hi>Albertus</hi> doth, must certainly suppose the belief of the Scripture as the <hi>Word of God,</hi> else how is it possible its sense should be the Rule of Faith? Again, it is not enough for you to say, That he believed other Articles of Faith, besides these in the <hi>Creed</hi>; but, that he made them a Rule of Faith together with the sense of Scripture. 3. All this while here is not one word of Tradition, as the ground on which these Articles of Faith were to be believed. If this therefore be your way of answering, I know none will contend with you for <hi>fine shuffling.</hi> What follows concerning the right sense of the Article of the <hi>Descent of Christ into Hell</hi>; since you say,<note place="margin">P. 46. n. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>You will not much trouble your self about it, as being not Fundamental either in his Lordships sense, or ours</hi>; I look on that expression as sufficient to excuse me from undertaking so needless a trouble, as the examining the several sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of it; since you acknowledge, <hi>That no one determinate sense is Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> and therefore not pertinent to our business. Much less is that which follows concerning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Rogers his Book and Authority</hi>; in which, and that which depends upon it, I shall only give you your own words for an Answer, <hi>That truly I conceive it of small importance to spend much time upon this subject</hi>; and shall not so far contradict my judgement as to do that, which, I think, when it is done, is to very little purpose. Of the same nature is that of <hi>Catharinus</hi>; for it signifies nothing to us, whether you account him an <hi>Heretick</hi> or no, who know, Men are not one jot more or less Heretick, for your accounting them to be so or not.</p>
               <p>You call the <hi>Bishop, your good friend, in saying, That all Protestants do agree with the Church of</hi> England <hi>in the main Exceptions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>which they joyntly take against the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, as appears by their several Confessions.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 48. n. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>For</hi> (say you) <hi>by their agreeing in this, but in little or nothing else, they sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew themselves enemies to the true Church, which is one, and only one, by Vnity of Doctrine; from whence they must needs be judged to depart, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Divisions.</hi> As <hi>good a friend</hi> as you say his Lordship was to you, in that saying of his, I am sure you ill requite him for his <hi>Kindness,</hi> by so palpable a falsification of his words, and abuse of his meaning. And all that <hi>Friendship</hi> you pretend, lyes only in your leaving out that part of the <hi>Sentence,</hi> which takes away all that you build on the rest. For where doth his <hi>Lordship</hi> say, That the <hi>Protestants only agree in their main Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and not in their Doctrines?</hi> Nay, doth he not expresly say, <hi>That they agree in the chiefest Doctrines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 50. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>as well as main Exceptions, which they take against the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as appears by their several Confessions.</hi> But you, very conveniently to your purpose, and with a <hi>fraud</hi> suitable to your <hi>Cause,</hi> leave out the first part of <hi>agreement in the chiefest Doctrines,</hi> and mention only the latter, lest your Declamation should be spoiled as to your Unity, and our Disagreements. But we see by this, by what means you would perswade men of both, by Arts and Devices, fit only to deceive such, who look only on the appearance and outside of things; and yet even there, he that sees not your growing <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,</hi> is a great stranger to the Christian world.

                  <hi>they are ready to submit their judgements to the censure and determination of the Church</hi>; if it be good, will hold as well (or better) for our Unity, as yours, because all men are willing to submit their judgements to <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which is agreed on all sides to be <hi>Infallible.</hi> If you say, <hi>That it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known what Scripture determines, but it may be easily what the Church defines:</hi> It is easily answered, that the event shews it to be far otherwise;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101069:63"/>
for how many Disputes are there, concerning the <hi>Power</hi> of determining matters of Faith? to whom it belongs, in what way it must be managed, whether parties ought to be heard in matters of Doctrine, what the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Decrees</hi> are, when they are made, which raise as many Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as were before them, as appears by the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the latter of <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> relating to the <hi>five Propositions:</hi> So that upon the whole it appears, setting aside force and fraud (which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent principles of <hi>Christian Vnity</hi>) we are upon as fair terms of <hi>Vnion</hi> as you are among your selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note>You tell us, <hi>That your Church doth Anathematize only such persons as are obstinate</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 48<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> n. 6.</note> but who are they whom she accounts obstinate? even all who dissent from her in any <hi>punctilio.</hi> And therefore this is a singular piece of Moderation in your <hi>Church. And, you believe the troubles of Christendom rather come from too great freedom taken in matters of Faith, than from any severity in the Church of</hi> Rome. The truth is, you have excellent waies of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Controversies, much like perswading men to put out their <hi>Eyes,</hi> to end the Disputes about the nature of <hi>Colours</hi>; and if they will not hearken to such prudent counsel, they are pronounced <hi>obstinate</hi> and <hi>perverse,</hi> for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to keep their <hi>Eyes</hi> in their <hi>Heads.</hi> And if men will not say, that <hi>White</hi> is <hi>Black,</hi> when your Church bids them do it, these men are the <hi>troublers of Israel,</hi> and the fomenters of the <hi>Discords</hi> of the <hi>Christian world.</hi> But if your <hi>Church</hi> had kept to the primitive simplicity and moderation, and not offered to define matters of Faith; the occasion of most of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of the <hi>Christian world,</hi> had been taken away. Believe what you will, and speak what you list; there are none who consider what they believe or speak, but easily discover whence the great Dissentions of the Christian world have risen, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Vsurpation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath not been contented to have introduced many silly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions into the publick exercise of Devotion; but, when any of these came to be discovered, thought it her best course to defend her corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with greater; by inforcing men to the <hi>belief</hi> of them, and thereby rendring a <hi>Separation</hi> from her Communion unavoidable by all those who sought to retrieve the Piety and Devotion of the Primitive <hi>Church.</hi> And yet this must be call'd <hi>Schism,</hi> and the persons attempting it <hi>Hereticks,</hi> by that same <hi>Pious and tender-hearted Mother of yours,</hi> who loves her <hi>Children</hi> so dearly, that if they do but desire any reformation of abuses, she takes all possible care they shall complain no more. As though the only way to prevent quarrelling in the world, were to cut out peoples <hi>Tongues,</hi> and cut off their <hi>Arms</hi>; Such a kind of <hi>Vnity</hi> hath your <hi>Church</hi> shewed her self very desirous of, where ever power and conveniency have met for the carrying it on. But, I hope, you will give us leave, not to envy the <hi>Vnity</hi> of those, who therefore agree in the <hi>Church,</hi> because, as soon as they do in the least differ from it, they are pronounced not to be of it, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the determinations of it. And yet, notwithstanding, the violence and fraud used in your <hi>Church</hi> to preserve its <hi>Vnity,</hi> the world is alarm'd with the noise of its Dissentions, and the increase of the differing parties, who manage their Contests with great heats and animosities against each other, under all the great pretences of your <hi>Vnity.</hi> I cannot but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judge it a very prudent expression of his Lordship, <hi>That as the Church of</hi> England <hi>is not such a Shrew to her Children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 50 n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>as to deny her blessing, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an</hi> Anathema <hi>against them, if some peaceably dissent in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars remoter from the Foundation: So, if the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>since she
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101069:63"/>
grew to her greatness, had not been so fierce in this course, and too particular in determining too many things, and making them matters of necessary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which had gone for many hundred of years before, only for things of pious Opinion; Christendom (I perswade my self) had been in happier Peace at this day, then, I doubt, we shall ever live to see it.</hi> And it is an excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son you give,<note place="margin">P. 49,</note> why the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth impose her Doctrine on the whole world, under pain of damnation; <hi>because it is not in her power to do otherwise.</hi> There is little hopes then of amendment in her, if she thinks so. But, you tell us, <hi>Christ hath commanded her to do it.</hi> What hath he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to do? to add to his Doctrine by making things necessary, which he never made to be so? Is it in that place, where he bids the <hi>Apostles, to teach all that he commanded them,</hi> that he gives power to the Church, <hi>to teach more than he commanded:</hi> But this is a new kind of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation,</hi> to make more Articles of Faith, than ever men required to make. Where still is this <hi>Command</hi> extant in <hi>Scripture?</hi> Not sure any where, but in that most apposite place produced to that, and all other good purposes which have nothing else to prove them; even <hi>Dic Ecclesiae, If he will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen and a Publican</hi>; therefore the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is commanded by <hi>Christ,</hi> to impose her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine on the whole <hi>Church,</hi> upon pain of damnation. Sure you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce men <hi>obstinate,</hi> that dare in the least question this, after so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable a demonstration of it.

               <p>His Lordship shews the Moderation of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> even in that <hi>Canon</hi> which <hi>A. C.</hi> looks on as the most severe,<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> where she pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Excommunication on such as affirm,<note place="margin">P. 51. n. 2.</note> that the Articles are in any part superstitious or erronious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by these things. 1. <hi>That it is not meant of mens private judgements, but of what they boldly and publickly affirm.</hi> 2. <hi>That it is one thing to hold contrary to some part of an Article; and anotherp, ositive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to affirm, That the Articles in any part are superstitious or erronious.</hi> 3. <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>doth this only for thirty nine Articles; but the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>doth it, for above a hundred in matter of Doctrine.</hi> 4. <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>never declared, That every one of her Articles are Fundamental in the Faith; but the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>requires, that all be believed as Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, when once the Church hath determined them.</hi> 5. <hi>The Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>prescribes only to her own Children, and by those Articles provides but for her own peaceable consent in those Doctrines of Truth. But the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>severely imposes her Doctrine upon the whole world, under pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> To all these very considerable Instances of our <hi>Churches</hi> Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your Answer is, <hi>The Question is not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 49. n. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether the</hi> English <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the</hi> Roman <hi>Church be more severe; but, Whether the</hi> English <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants Severity be not unreasonable; supposing she be subject to errour, in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those Articles.</hi> For after many words, to the same, <hi>i. e.</hi> little purpose, the reason you give for it, is, <hi>That every just Excommunication inflicted for opposing of Doctrine, must necessarily suppose the Doctrine opposed to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly true, and absolutely exempt from errour; otherwise the Sentence it self would be unreasonable and unjust, as wanting sufficient ground.</hi> From whence you charge Protestants with greater <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi> towards their people, than they can with any colour or pretence of reason, charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which excommunicates no man, but for denying such Doctrine <hi>as is both infallibly True, and also Fundamental, at least as to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101069:64"/>
its formal Object.</hi> This is the strength of all you say, which will be reduced to this short Question, Whether the proceedings of that <hi>Church</hi> be more unreasonable, which excommunicates such as openly oppose her Doctrine, supposing her <hi>Fallible</hi>; or of that <hi>Church,</hi> which excommunicates all who will not believe whatever she defines to be <hi>Infallibly true.</hi> This is the true State of the <hi>Controversie,</hi> which must be judged by the resolving another Question, Whether it be not a more unreasonable <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> to bind men upon pain of <hi>damnation</hi> hereafter, and excommunication here, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every thing <hi>Infallible</hi> which a <hi>Church</hi> defines, or to bind men to peace to a <hi>Churches Determinations,</hi> reserving to men the liberty of their judgements, on pain of Excommunication, if they violate that peace. For it is plain on the one side, where a <hi>Church pretends Infallibility,</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is directed against the persons for refusing to give <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Assent</hi> to what she defines: But, where a <hi>Church</hi> doth not pretend to that, the Excommunication respects wholly that <hi>Overt Act,</hi> whereby the <hi>Churches Peace</hi> is broken. And if a <hi>Church</hi> be bound to look to her own Peace, no doubt she hath power to <hi>excommunicate</hi> such as openly violate the bonds of it; which is only an Act of Caution in a <hi>Church,</hi> to preserve her self in <hi>Vnity</hi>; but where it is given out, that the <hi>Church is Infallible,</hi> the Excommunication must be so much the more unreasonable, because it is against those <hi>Internal Acts</hi> of the mind, over which the <hi>Church,</hi> as such, hath no direct power. And thus, I hope, you see how much more just and reasonable the proceedings of our <hi>Church</hi> are then of yours; and that, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because she pretends to be infallible, and ours doth not.</p>
               <p>His Lordship shews further in <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi> England, <hi>and her grounds of Faith,</hi>

For these latter are no further <hi>expresly</hi> affirmed there, than as there is <hi>evidence,</hi> that the meaning of such words doth contain such a <hi>Doctiine</hi> in them. As to take your own Instance, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> we grant the words to be <hi>express</hi>; but we deny, that which he had then in his hands was his <hi>real Body</hi>; (for his hands were part of his real Body) Now, we do not say, That the <hi>Doctrine of Transubstantiation</hi> is <hi>expresly,</hi> but not <hi>evidently</hi> contained here; for, we say, The <hi>Doctrine</hi> is not there at all, but only that those are the <hi>express words; This is my Body</hi>; as it is in other figurative expressions in <hi>Scripture.</hi> But that which causeth this litigation about words, is, That you look upon that which is <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>undeniable</hi> to be all one, whereas there may be <hi>sufficient evidence,</hi> where all men are not perswaded by it. And so you would put his Lordship to prove out of <hi>Scripture, Infant-Baptism evidently and demonstratively,</hi> i. e. <hi>undeniably</hi>; whereas his Lordship supposeth it enough for his purpose, to prove it by such sufficient evidence, as may convince any reasonable man. And this was all his Lordship meant, when he said, <hi>That our Negative Articles do refute, where the thing is not affirmed in Scripture, or not directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of it.</hi> And, if you will stand to the strict sense of these words, you will be forced to prove all those Doctrines of your <hi>Church,</hi> which ours denies to be true, so <hi>evidently and demonstratively,</hi> i. e. <hi>undeniably,</hi> as you would put him upon for the proof of <hi>Infant-Baptism.</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101069:65"/>
of <hi>Baptism.</hi> For the main Question between us and the <hi>Antipaedobaptists,</hi> is not, concerning an absolute and express <hi>command</hi> for <hi>Baptizing Infants</hi>; but whether our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> hath not by a positive <hi>Precept</hi> so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the subject of Baptism; <hi>viz. adult persons</hi> professing the Faith, that the alteration of the subject, <hi>viz. in Baptizing Infants,</hi> be not a deviation from, and perversion of the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in a <hi>substantial part</hi> of it; or in short thus, whether our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath so determined the subject of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, as to exclude <hi>Infants.</hi> And although, the question being thus stated, the proof ought to lye on those who affirm it, yet taking in only the help of <hi>Scripture</hi> and reason, it were no difficult matter to prove directly and evidently, that <hi>Infants</hi> are so far from being excluded <hi>Baptism</hi> by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> that there are as many grounds as are necessary to a matter of that nature, to prove that the Baptizing them is suitable to the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and agreeable to the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> under the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For, if there were any ground to exclude them, it must be either the <hi>incapacity</hi> of the <hi>subject,</hi> or some express precept and <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>our Saviour.</hi> But neither of these can be supposed to do it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not incapacity as to the ends of <hi>Baptism:</hi> for clearing which, these two things must be premised: 1. <hi>That the rule and measure, as to the use and capacity of Divine Institutions, is to be fetched from the end of them.</hi> For, this was the ground of the Circumcision of the <hi>Proselytes</hi> under the <hi>Law:</hi> and this was the way the <hi>Apostles</hi> did interpret <hi>Christs Commission</hi> for Baptizing all Nations, as to the capacity of the subjects of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be Baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost, as well as we:</hi> where the question was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>subject of Baptism.</hi> For it might be made evident, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> at first did interpret their Commission of <hi>Baptizing all Nations,</hi> only of the <hi>Jews of all Nations:</hi> for after that, St. <hi>Peter</hi> looked on the <hi>Gentiles as unclean:</hi> and the Disciples at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> charged St. <hi>Peter</hi> with it, as a great fault, <hi>for going in to men uncircumcised,</hi> Acts 11.3. Therefore we see when the question was concerning the <hi>subject</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi>; the only Argument is drawn from the <hi>design</hi> and <hi>ends</hi> of it; that they who were capable of the thing signified ought not to be denyed the use of the sign. And thus by a parity of reason built on equal grounds, those who are capable of the great things represented in <hi>Baptism</hi> and confirmed by it, <hi>viz. Gods pardoning grace, and acceptation to eternal life,</hi> ought not to be denyed the external sign, which is Baptism it self. And therefore, 2. <hi>Where there is a capacity as to the main ends of an Institution, an incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as to some ends doth not exclude from it.</hi> As is most evident in the Baptism of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> in whom was a greater incapacity as to the main ends of Baptism, then possibly can be in <hi>Infants</hi>; for his <hi>Baptism</hi> could not at all be <hi>for the remission of sins.</hi> Now we see, although there were but one end, and that a very general one mentioned, <hi>That he might fulfill all righteousness,</hi> Matth. 3.15. yet we see, that was sufficient to perswade <hi>John</hi> to Baptize him. Whereby we see evidently in this practise of our <hi>Saviour</hi> built on a general and common ground, that a capacity as to one end of a positive <hi>Institution,</hi> is sufficient to make such a practice lawful, and in some cases a duty.</p>
               <p>These two general <hi>Principles</hi> being laid down; it were easie to shew, 1. That what incapacity there is in <hi>Infants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note> is not destructive of the main ends of Baptism; which is chiefly thought to be the incapacity of understanding the nature or ends of the <hi>Institution</hi>; and if that exclude,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101069:65"/>
it must either be, that it is a thing repugnant to reason, that any Divine <hi>Institution</hi> should be applyed to persons uncapable of understanding the nature and ends of it, which would highly reflect on the wisdome of <hi>God</hi> in appointing Circumcision for Children eight dayes old, who were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as uncapable of understanding the ends of that, as our <hi>Children</hi> are of Baptism; or else, that there is some peculiarity in the <hi>Institution</hi> of Baptism, which must exclude them from it under the Gospel: which that there is not, will appear presently.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>there is a capacity in Infants as to the main ends of Baptism,</hi> which have either an aspect from <hi>God</hi> to us, in regard of its <hi>Institution,</hi> or from us to <hi>God,</hi> in regard of our <hi>undertaking</hi> it. Now the chief ends of a Divine Institution as such, are <hi>such</hi> as respect <hi>Gods</hi> Intention in it towards us, in which respect it is properly a <hi>sign</hi>; but as it respects <hi>God</hi> from us, it is properly a <hi>Ceremony</hi> betokening our profession and restipulation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God.</hi> Now the ends of it as a <hi>sign,</hi> are to represent and exhibit to us the nature of the <hi>grace</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> as it cleanseth and purifieth, and to confirm the truth of the <hi>Covenant</hi> on <hi>Gods part,</hi> and to enstate the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it in the priviledges of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; now as to all these ends, there is no incapacity in <hi>Infants</hi> to exclude them from Baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of them. So that nothing can seem wanting of the <hi>ends</hi> of Baptism, but that which seems most <hi>Ceremonial</hi> in it, which is the personal <hi>restipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> which yet may reasonably be supplyed by <hi>Sponsors,</hi> so far as to make it of the nature of a solemn <hi>Contract</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> in sight of the Congregation. Thus far it appears from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> that no incapacity in <hi>Infants</hi> doth exclude them from Baptism.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is no direct or consequential prohibition made by our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> to exclude them. For granting that he had the power to limit and determine the subject of <hi>Baptism,</hi> the question is, Whether he hath so far done it as to exclude <hi>Infants?</hi> And nothing of that nature is pretended, before the last Commission given to the <hi>Apostles, of Teaching and Baptizing all Nations,</hi> Matth. 28.19. And that by this expression there is no exclusion of <hi>Infants</hi> will appear; 1. If our <hi>Saviour</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the gathering of <hi>Churches</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> according to the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> he could hardly have expressed it after another manner then thus, <hi>Go Proselyte all Nations, Circumcising them.</hi> Now I appeal to any mans judgement and reason, whether in such words it could be imagined, that the <hi>Infants</hi> of such <hi>Gentile-Proselytes</hi> should be excluded Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and what reason can there be then from these words to imagine, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> did intend to exclude the Infants of <hi>Gentile-Converts</hi> from Baptism? 2. We must consider, what apprehensions those whom our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> directed these words to, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Apostles,</hi> had concerning the <hi>Church-state</hi> of such as were in an external Covenant with God, which they measured by the general reason of that <hi>Covenant</hi> which <hi>God</hi> made with the <hi>Jews</hi>; Can we then think, that when our <hi>Saviour</hi> bid the <hi>Apostles</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whole Nations into <hi>Churches,</hi> they should imagine the <hi>Infants</hi> were excluded out of it, when they were so solemnly admitted into it, in that dispensation which was in use among them? 3. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> being now to be first <hi>Proselyted</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> the order of the words was necessary: for whoever imagined, but that such as were wholly strangers to <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> as those were whom <hi>Christ</hi> there speaks of, were to be <hi>first taught,</hi> or discipled, before they were to be Baptized? For suppose, it should be said to such persons among whom <hi>Infant Baptism</hi> is the most used, <hi>Go and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101069:66"/>
Disciple the Indians, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. Could any one conceive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of such a Commission was to exclude the <hi>Infants</hi> of all those <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Baptism,</hi> when it was well known that <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> was used among those who came with that Commission? And therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these words here, nor those <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized,</hi> &amp;c. can in reason be so interpreted as to exclude <hi>Infants,</hi> when the meer order of nature, and necessity of the thing, requires that those who first own <hi>Christianity</hi> by being Baptized, ought, before such <hi>Baptism,</hi> not only to believe, but to make profession of that Faith; but this reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not at all to the case of such <hi>Infants</hi> as are born of those persons. For if any one had said to <hi>Abraham, He that believes, and is circumcised, shall be saved,</hi> Could it have been so interpreted, that the intention was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his <hi>Children</hi> from <hi>Circumcision?</hi> No more ought these words of our <hi>Saviour</hi> be strained to a greater prejudice of the right of <hi>Infants</hi> to Baptism, then those other to their right of Circumcision. And thus far we see there is no ground from <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or <hi>Reason,</hi> why Infants should be excluded.</p>
               <p>And, were it not too large a Digression, I might further shew how suitable the Baptism of <hi>Infants</hi> is to the administration of <hi>things</hi> under the <hi>Gospel</hi>;<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> but I shall only propound some considerations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. 1. That if it had been <hi>Christs intention</hi> to exclude <hi>Infants,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>here had been far greater reason for an express prohibition; then of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press command, if his intention were to admit them: because this was suitable to the general grounds of <hi>Gods dispensation</hi> among them before. 2. It is very hard to conceive that the <hi>Apostles</hi> thought Infants excluded by <hi>Christ,</hi> when after <hi>Christs Ascension</hi> they looked on themselves as bound to observe the <hi>Jewish customes,</hi> even when they had Baptized many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand people. 3. If admission of <hi>Infants</hi> to Baptism were a meer Relick of Judaism, it seems strange that none of the <hi>Judaizing Christians</hi> should be charged with it, who yet are charged with the observation of other <hi>Judaical</hi> rites. 4. Since the <hi>Jewish Christians</hi> were so much offended at the neglect of Circumcision, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21. Can we in reason think they should quietly bear their <hi>Childrens</hi> being wholly thrown out of the <hi>Church</hi>; as they would have been, if neither admitted to Circumcision nor Baptism? 5. Had it been contrary to <hi>Christs Institution,</hi> we should not have had such evidence of its early practice in the <hi>Church</hi> as we have. And here I acknowledge the use of <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> to manifest this to us; In which sense I acknowledge what St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>That the custom of our mother the Church is not to be contemned or thought superfluous, neither is it to be believed but as an Apostolical Tradition.</hi> For that the words are to be read so, (and not, as you translate them, <hi>nor at all to be believed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it had been an Apostolical Tradition,</hi> from thence inferring, that <hi>Infant-Baptism were not to be believed at all, but for Tradition</hi>) appears by three <hi>ancient Manuscripts at Oxford,</hi> as well as the course of the sentence, and St. <hi>Austins</hi> judgement in other places, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ought to be read, <hi>Nec omnin√≤ credenda nisi Apostolica traditio esse,</hi> and not <hi>esset.</hi> But we grant that the practice of the <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Apostolical times</hi> is a great confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was never <hi>Christs intention</hi> to have <hi>Infants</hi> excluded from <hi>Baptism.</hi> And thus much may suffice to shew, what evidence we have from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> without recourse wholly to <hi>Tradition,</hi> or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon any more controverted <hi>places,</hi> to justifie the <hi>Churches practice in Infant-Baptism,</hi> which is as much as is necessary for us to do.

For there cannot possibly be any greater <hi>prejudice</hi> done to a weighty and important truth, then to perswade men to believe it on such <hi>grounds,</hi> which are, if not absolutely false, yet much more disputable then the thing it self. For hereby the minds of men are taken off from the native evidence, which the <hi>truth</hi> enquired after offers to them, and build their assent upon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the <hi>medium</hi>'s suggested as the only grounds to establish a firm assent upon. By which means, when upon severe enquiry, the falsity and insufficiency of those grounds is discovered, the person so discovering lyes under a dangerous temptation of calling into <hi>question</hi> the truth of that, which he finds he assented to upon <hi>grounds</hi> apparently weak and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. And the more refined and subtle the <hi>speculations</hi> are, the more sublime and mysterious the matters believed; the greater still the danger of <hi>Scepticism</hi> is, upon a discovery of the unsoundness of those principles which such things were believed upon. Especially, if the more confident and Magisterial party of those who profess the belief of such things, do with the greatest heat decry all other wayes as uncertain, and obtrude these principles upon the world, as the only sure <hi>foundation</hi> for the belief of them. It was anciently a great question among the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any certainty in the principles of knowledge; or, supposing certainty in things, whether there were any undoubted <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101069:67"/>
made it much more lyable to question then before. Because every <hi>errour</hi> discovered in that <hi>Sect,</hi> would not only prove the fondness and arrogance of their pretence of being <hi>Infallible</hi>; but would, to all such as believed the certainty of things on the <hi>authority</hi> of their <hi>Sect,</hi> be an argument to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all certainty of knowledge, when they once discovered the <hi>errours</hi> of those whose authority they relyed upon. Just such is the case of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in this present Controversie concerning the <hi>Resolution of Faith.</hi> The question is, <hi>What the certain grounds of our assent are to the principles and rule of Christian Religion?</hi> the <hi>Romanists</hi> pretend, that there can be no ground of <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Divine Faith</hi> at all, but the Infallible testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Their <hi>Church</hi>; let then any rational man judge, whether this be not the most compendious way to overthrow the belief of <hi>Christianity</hi> in the world? For our assent must be wholly suspended upon that supposed <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which when once it falls (as it unavoidably, doth upon the discovery of the least errour in the doctrine of that <hi>Church</hi>) what becomes then of the belief of Christianity which was built upon that, as its only sure foundation?

The true reason then, why the <hi>Archbishop</hi> declared any unwillingness to enter upon this dispute, was not the least apprehension <hi>how insuperably hard the resolution of this question was,</hi> (as you pretend) but because of the great mischief your Party had done in start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such questions you could not resolve with any satisfaction to the common reason of mankind;<note place="margin">Pag. 55.</note> and that you run your selves into such a <hi>Circle</hi> in which you <hi>conjure</hi> up more <hi>Spirits</hi> then ever you are able to <hi>lay,</hi> by giving those advantages to Infidelity, which all your <hi>Sophistry</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver answer on those principles you go upon. That this was the true ground of his Lordship's seeming averseness from this Controversie, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his plain words, where he tells you at first, <hi>of the danger of mens being disputed into infidelity by the Circle between Scripture and Tradition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sect. 16. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and by his expressing his sense of the great harm you have done by the starting of that question among Christians, How we know the Scriptures to be the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101069:67"/>
Word of God.</hi> But although in this respect he might be said <hi>to be drawn into it,</hi> yet lest you should think his averseness argued any consciousness of his own inability to answer it, you may see how closely he follows it; with what care and accuracy he handles it, with what strength of reason and evidence he hath discovered the weakness of your way, which he hath done with that success, that he hath put you to miserable shifts to avoid the force of his arguments, as will appear afterwards. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fully of his mind, <hi>that it is a matter of such consequence it deserves to be sifted,</hi> were it for no other end, but to lay open the juglings and impostures of your way of resolving Faith.</p>
               <p>Which we now come more closely to the discovery of; for,<note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> as you tell us, <hi>The Bishop propounding diverse wayes of resolving the Question, first falls to the attaquing your way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>who prove it by Tradition and authority of the Church.</hi> And his first onset is so successful that it makes you visibly <hi>recoyle,</hi> and withdraw your self into so untenable a Shelter as exposeth you to all the attempts which any adversary would desire to make upon you. For, whereas you are charged by his <hi>Lordship with running into the most absurd kind of argumentation,</hi> viz. <hi>by proving the Scriptures infallible by Tradition, and that Tradition infallible by Scripture</hi>; you think to escape that <hi>Circle</hi> by telling us, <hi>That you prove not the Churches Infallibility by the Scripture, but by the motives of credibility belonging to the Church.</hi> This then being your main principle which your following discourse is built upon, and in your judgement the <hi>only probable way to avoid the Circle,</hi> that you may not think I am afraid of encountering you in your greatest strength, I dare put the issue of the cause upon this Promise, that (besides the weak proofs you bring for the thing it self, which shall after be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) if this way of yours be not chargeable with all the absurdities such an attempt is capable of, I will be content to acknowledge what you say to be true, which is, <hi>That your way of resolving Faith hath no difficulty at all, and that ours is insuperably hard,</hi> which I think are as hard terms as can be imposed upon me. Now there are two grand Absurdities, which any vindication of an Opinion are subject to; first, <hi>If it be manifestly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,</hi> and, 2. <hi>If supposing it true, it doth not effect what it was intended for</hi>: now these <hi>two</hi> I undertake to make good against this <hi>way of your resolving Faith,</hi> that it is guilty of the highest unreasonableness; and that, supposing it true, you are in a <hi>circle</hi> as much as before.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, I begin with the <hi>unreasonableness</hi> of it, which is so great, that I know not, whether I may abstain from calling it <hi>ridiculous</hi>; but, that I may not seem to follow you, in asserting confidently, and proving weakly, it will be necessary throughly to examine the <hi>grounds</hi> on which your opinion stands, and then raise our <hi>batteries</hi> against it. Three grand <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> your discourse relyes upon, which are your <hi>postulata</hi> in order to the resolving Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is necessary to the believing the <hi>Scriptures to be the Word of God with a Divine Faith,</hi> that it be built on the infallible testimony of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That your <hi>Church</hi> is that <hi>Catholick Church</hi> whose testimony is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this <hi>Infallibility</hi> is to be known and assented to upon the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of credibility.</hi> These three, I suppose, if your confused discourse were reduced to method, would be freely acknowledged by your self to be the Principles on which <hi>your resolution of Faith</hi> depends. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101069:68"/>
I am sufficiently assured of the falseness of your two first <hi>Principles</hi> (as will appear in the sequel of this discourse) yet that which I have now particularly undertaken, is, the <hi>unreasonableness of resolving Faith</hi> upon these Principles taken together, <hi>viz. That the Infallible Testimony of your Church, is the only Foundation for Divine Faith; and that this Infallibility can be known only by the Motives of Credibility.</hi> If then in this <hi>way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving Faith,</hi> you require <hi>Assent beyond all proportion of evidence,</hi> if you <hi>run into the same Absurdities you would seem to avoid,</hi> if you <hi>leave men more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain in their Religion than you found them</hi>; you cannot certainly excuse this way from <hi>unreasonableness,</hi> and each of these I undertake to make good against this <hi>way</hi> of yours, whereby you would assure men of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>An Assent is hereby required beyond all proportion or degree of evidence</hi>; for you require an <hi>Infallible Assent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> only upon <hi>Probable grounds</hi>; which is as much as requiring Infallibility in the conclusion, where the premises are only probable. Now that you require an Assent <hi>Infallible</hi> to the nature of Faith, appears by the whole <hi>series</hi> of your Discourse: for, to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end you require <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> because otherwise, you say <hi>Our Faith would be uncertain</hi>; it is plain then, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an <hi>Infallible Assent</hi> in Faith; and, it is as plain, that this <hi>Assent,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, can be built only upon <hi>probable grounds,</hi> for you acknowledge the <hi>motives of Credibility,</hi> to be no more than such; yet those are all the grounds you give, why the <hi>Church</hi> should be believed Infallible. If you say, <hi>That which makes the Assent Infallible, is, that Infallibility which is in the Churches Testimony</hi>; I reply, That this is a most unreasonable thing, to go about to establish an <hi>Infallible Assent,</hi> meerly because the <hi>Testimony</hi> is supposed to be in it self <hi>Infallible:</hi> For, <hi>Assent</hi> is not according to the <hi>Objective Certitude</hi> of things, but the <hi>evidence</hi> of them to our <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> For, is it possible to assent to the truth of a Demonstration in a demonstrative manner, because any <hi>Mathematician</hi> tells one, The thing is demonstrable? for in that case the <hi>Assent</hi> is not according to the <hi>Evidence</hi> of the thing, but according to the opinion such a person hath of him, who tells him, It is demonstrable. Nay, supposing that person <hi>infallible</hi> in saying so, yet if the other hath no means to be <hi>infallibly assured,</hi> that he is so; such a ones <hi>Assent</hi> is as <hi>doubtful,</hi> as if he were not infallible: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, supposing the <hi>Testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> to be really infallible, yet since the Means of believing it are but <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>prudential,</hi> the Assent cannot be according to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Testimony,</hi> considered in it self, but according to the <hi>reasons</hi> which induce me to believe such a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infallible. And, in all such cases, where I believe one thing for the sake of another, my <hi>Assent</hi> to the <hi>Object</hi> believed, is according to my As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the <hi>Medium</hi> on which I believe it; for by the means of that, the other is conveyed to our minds. As our sight is not according to the light in the body of the <hi>Sun,</hi> but that which presseth upon our Organs of sense: So that, supposing your <hi>Churches</hi> Testimony to be in it self <hi>infallible,</hi> if one may be deceived in judging whether your <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>infallible</hi> or no, one may be deceived in such things which he believes upon that supposed <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi> It being an impossibility, that the <hi>Assent</hi> to the <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> should rise higher, or stand firmer, than the Assent to the <hi>Testimony</hi> is, upon which those things are believed. Now, that one may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived according to your own principles, in judging whether the <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>Infallible,</hi> appears by this, That you have no other means to prove
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101069:68"/>
the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> but only <hi>probable</hi> and <hi>prudential Motives.</hi> For, I desire to know, whether an <hi>Infallible Assent</hi> to the Infallibility of your <hi>Church,</hi> can be grounded on those <hi>Motives of Credibility?</hi> If you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, then there can be no imaginable necessity, to make the <hi>Testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church infallible,</hi> in order to <hi>Divine Faith</hi>; for you will not, I hope, deny, but that there are at least equal <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> to prove the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi>; and if so, why may not an <hi>Infallible Assent</hi> be given to the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> upon those <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> as well as to your <hi>Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility?</hi> If you deny the Assent built upon the <hi>Motives of Credibility</hi> to be <hi>Infallible</hi>; how can you make the Assent to your Churches Testimony to be <hi>infallible,</hi> when that Infallibility is attempted to be proved only by the <hi>Motives of Credibility</hi>? And therefore it necessarily follows, That notwithstanding your bearing it so high under the pretence of Infallibility, you leave mens minds much more wavering in their Assent than before; in that, as shall afterwards appear, these very <hi>Motives of Credibility</hi> do not at all prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> which undoubtedly prove the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> Thus, while by this device, you seek to avoid the <hi>Circle,</hi> you destroy the Foundation of your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>That there must be an Infallible Assent to the truth of that Proposition, That the Scriptures are the Word of God</hi> (which you call <hi>Divine Faith</hi>) which, how can it be <hi>infallible,</hi> when that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> at the highest, by your own confession, is but <hi>evidently credible,</hi> and so, I suppose the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> is, without your <hi>Churches Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus <hi>you run into the same Absurdities which you would seem to avoid,</hi> which is the second thing, to manifest the unreasonableness of this way;<note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> for whatever <hi>Absurdity</hi> you charge us with, for believing the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi> upon the <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> unavoidably falls upon your selves for believing the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> on the same grounds: for if we leave the <hi>Foundation of Faith uncertain,</hi> you do so too; if we build a <hi>Divine Faith upon Motives of Credibility,</hi> so do you; if we make <hi>every ones reason the Judge in the choice of his Religion,</hi> so must you be forced to do, if you understand the consequence of your own principles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is impossible for you to give <hi>a better account of Faith by the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of your Church, than we can do without it</hi>; for, if <hi>Divine Faith</hi> cannot be built upon the <hi>Motives</hi> proving the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> what sense or reason is there, that it should be built on those <hi>Motives</hi> which prove your <hi>Churches Infallibility?</hi> so that, if we leave <hi>the Foundation of Faith uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> you much more; and that I prove by a Rule of much Authority with you, by which you use to pervert the weak judgements of such, who in your case do not discern the <hi>Sophistry</hi> of it: Which is; when you come to deal with persons, whom you hope to <hi>Proselyte,</hi> you urge them with this great <hi>Principle,</hi> That <hi>Prudence is to be our Guide in the choice of our Religion, and that Prudence directs us to chuse the safest way, and that it is much safer to make choice of that way, which both sides agree Salvation is to be obtained in, than of that which the other side utterly denies men can be saved in.</hi> How far this Rule will hold in the choice of Religion, will be examined afterwads: but if we take your word, that it is a sure Rule; I know nothing will be more certainly advantagious to us, in on present case. For both sides, I hope, are agreed, that there are <hi>sufficient Motives of Credibility,</hi> as to the belief of the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; but we utterly deny that there are any such <hi>Motives</hi> as to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi>; it then
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101069:69"/>
certainly follows, That our way is the more eligible and certain, and that we lay a surer <hi>Foundation for Faith,</hi> than you do upon your principles for resolving Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Either you must deny <hi>any such thing as that you call Divine Faith</hi>; or you must assert, that it may have no other <hi>Foundation</hi> than the <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> which yet is that, you would seem most to avoid by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Infallibility of your Church, that the Foundation of Faith may not be uncertain:</hi> whereas, supposing what you desire, you must of necessity do that you would seem most fearful of, which is making a <hi>Divine Faith to rest upon prudential Motives.</hi> Which I thus prove: It is an undoubted <hi>Axiom</hi> among the great men of your side, That <hi>whatever is a Foundation for a Divine Faith, must itself be believed with a firm, certain, and infallible Assent:</hi> Now, according to your principles, the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is the Foundation for Divine Faith; and therefore that must be believed with an <hi>Assent Infallible.</hi> It is apparent then, an <hi>Assent Infallible</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is that which in other terms you call <hi>Divine Faith</hi>; now when you make it your business to prove the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> upon your <hi>prudential Motives,</hi> I suppose your design is by those proofs, to induce men to believe it; and if men then do believe it upon those <hi>Motives,</hi> do you not found an <hi>Assent Infallible,</hi> or a <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> upon the <hi>Motives of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?</hi> And by the same reason that you urge against us the necessity of believing <hi>the Scriptures to be the Word of God by Divine Faith,</hi> because it is the <hi>ground</hi> why we <hi>believe the things contained in the Scripture,</hi> we press on your side the necessity of believing the <hi>Infallibility of the Church by a Faith equally Divine,</hi> because that is to you the only sufficient Foundation of believing the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or any thing contained in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You make by this way of resolving Faith, <hi>every man's Reason the only Judge in the choice of his Religion:</hi> which you are pleased to charge on us as a great <hi>Absurdity</hi>: yet, you who have deserved so <hi>very ill</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> are fain to call in her best assistance in a case of the greatest moment, <hi>viz. On what ground we must believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God.</hi> You say, <hi>Because the Church is infallible, which delivers them to us</hi>; but how should we come to know that she is infallible? you tell us, <hi>By the Motives of Credibility</hi>; very good: But must not every ones reason judge whether these <hi>Motives</hi> be <hi>credible</hi> or no? and whether they belong peculiarly to your <hi>Church,</hi> so as to prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of it, as it is distinct from all other societies of <hi>Christians</hi> in the world? You tell us indeed, That these <hi>Motives</hi> make it <hi>evidently credible</hi>; but must we believe it to be so, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you say so?</hi> If so; then the ground of <hi>believing</hi> is not the <hi>Credibility</hi> of the <hi>Motives,</hi> but of <hi>your Testimony,</hi> and therefore you ought to make it <hi>evidently true,</hi> that whatever you speak is undoubtedly true, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever reads your Book, will hardly be perswaded to. So that of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity every <hi>mans reason</hi> must be <hi>Judge,</hi> whether your <hi>Church be infallible</hi> or no; and thus at last you give Reason the <hi>Vmpirage</hi> in the choice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And what is there more than this that we contend for? If there be then any danger of <hi>Scepticism,</hi> a <hi>private spirit,</hi> or what other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies you object against our way of judging the truth of <hi>Religion</hi> by <hi>the Vse of Reason,</hi> it will fall much more heavily upon your selves, in this way of believing the <hi>Infallibility of the Church</hi> on the <hi>Motives of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> Therefore I assure you, it were much more consonant to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of your party, to tell men, <hi>The Infallibility of your Church ought to be taken for granted, and that men are damned for not believing it, though no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101069:69"/>
reason be given for it, but only because you say it</hi> (which is as much as to say, the reason of the Point is, It must needs be so) then thus to expose it to the scorn and contempt of the world, by offering to prove it by your <hi>Motives of Credibility.</hi> For unawares you thereby give away the main of your Cause; for by the very offer of proving it, you make <hi>him</hi> whom you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to prove it to, <hi>judge</hi> whether these <hi>proofs be sufficient or no?</hi> and if he be capable to <hi>judge</hi> of his <hi>Guide,</hi> certainly he may be of his <hi>Way</hi> too, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that he hath, according to us, an <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> to judge of his Way; whereas, according to you, he hath but <hi>Prudential Motives</hi> in the choice of his Guide. Thus, by this Opinion of yours, you have gained thus much, That there is nothing so <hi>absurd,</hi> which you charge upon us, but it falls unavoidably upon your own head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this way of resolving Faith, you undermine it</hi>;<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> and leave a sure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for nothing but <hi>Scepticism</hi>; which is the last thing to shew the great <hi>unreasonableness</hi> of this way of yours, that when you are making us believe you are taking the greatest care to make our <hi>Religion sure,</hi> you <hi>cancel</hi> our best <hi>evidences,</hi> and produce nothing but <hi>crackt and broken titles,</hi> which will not stand any fair tryal at the <hi>bar</hi> of <hi>Reason.</hi> And that you make the Foundations of Religion uncertain, I offer to prove <hi>by the reason of the thing</hi>; for, if you require that as necessary for Faith, which was never believed to be so, when the Doctrine of Faith was revealed; if upon the pretence of <hi>Infallibility</hi> you assert such things, which destroy all the <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> evidence of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and if at last you are far from giving the least satisfactory account concerning this <hi>Infallibility of your Church</hi>; then certainly we may justly charge you with <hi>unsetling the Foundations of Religion,</hi> instead of giving us a <hi>certain resolution of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>You make that necessary to Faith, which was not looked on as such, when the Doctrine of the Gospel was revealed</hi>; and what other design can such a pretence seem to have, than to expose to contempt that <hi>Religion</hi> which was not received by a <hi>true Divine Faith,</hi> because it wanted that, which is now thought to be the only <hi>sure Foundation of Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>the Infallibility of the Church of</hi> Rome? What then will become of the <hi>Faith</hi> of all those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Divine Revelations,</hi> without the <hi>infallible Testimony of any Church at all?</hi> With what <hi>Faith</hi> did the <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> at the time of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, believe the <hi>Divine Authority of the Old Testament?</hi> was it a <hi>true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith</hi> or not? If it <hi>was,</hi> whereon was it built? not certainly on the <hi>Infallible Testimony of the Jewish Church,</hi> which at that time consented to the <hi>death of the Messias,</hi> condemning him as a malefactor and deceiver: Or did they believe it because of that great <hi>Rational Evidence</hi> they had to convince them, that those <hi>Prophecies</hi> came from <hi>God?</hi> If so, why may not we believe the <hi>Divinity</hi> of all the <hi>Scriptures</hi> on the same grounds, and with a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> too? With what <hi>Faith</hi> did those believe in the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> who were not personally present at the <hi>Miracles</hi> which our <hi>Saviour</hi> wrought, but had them conveyed to them by such reports as the <hi>woman of Samaria</hi> was to the <hi>Samaritans</hi>? Or were all such persons excused from believing, meerly because they were not <hi>Spectators?</hi> But by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son all those would be excused, who never saw our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s miracles, or heard his Doctrine, or his <hi>Apostles:</hi> But if such persons then were bound to believe, I ask, On what Testimony was their <hi>Faith</hi> founded? Was the <hi>woman of Samaria infallible,</hi> in reporting the discourse between <hi>Christ</hi> and her? Were all the persons <hi>infallible,</hi> who gave an account to others of what <hi>Christ</hi> did? yet, I suppose, had it been your own case, you would have
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101069:70"/>
thought your self bound to have believed <hi>Christ</hi> to have been the <hi>Messias,</hi> if you had lived at that time, and a certain account had been given you of our <hi>Saviour's Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> by men faithful and honest, though you had no reason to have believed them <hi>infallible:</hi> I pray, Sir, answer me, would you have thought your self bound to have believed, or no? If you affirm it (as I will suppose you so much a Christian as to say so) I pray then tell me, Whether persons in those circumstances might not have a <hi>true and Divine Faith,</hi> where there was no <hi>infallible Testimony,</hi> but only <hi>Rational Evidence</hi> to build it self upon? And if those persons might have a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> upon such evidence as that was, may not we much more, who have evidence of the <hi>same nature</hi> indeed, but much more <hi>extensive, universal,</hi> and <hi>convincing</hi> than that was? And how then can you still assert an <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> of the conveyers of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a <hi>Divine Faith?</hi> Nay further yet, How very few were there in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, in the first <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> who received the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Gospel</hi> from the mouths of persons infallible? And of those who did so, what certain evidence have men, That all those persons did receive the Doctrine upon the account of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders, and not rather upon the <hi>Rational Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Truth of the Doctrine</hi> delivered; and whether the belief of their <hi>Infallibility</hi> was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to Faith, when the report of the <hi>Evidences</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Doctrine might raise in them an obligation to believe, supposing them not <hi>infallible</hi> in that delivery of it; but that they looked on them as honest men, who faithfully related, <hi>What they had seen and heard.</hi> And this seems the more probable, in that the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly divine writings, do so often appeal to their own <hi>sufficiency</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the judgement of Sense is not to be relyed on, in matters of Faith:</hi> This is the great Principle upon which the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> stands in your <hi>Church</hi>; and this is all, the most considerative men among you have to say, when all those <hi>Contradictions</hi> are offered to them, which that Doctrine is so <hi>big</hi> of, both to the judgement of sense and reason, <hi>viz. That though it seem so contradictory; yet because the Church, which is infallible, delivers it, they are bound not to question it.</hi> If this Principle then be true, That the judgement of sense is not to be relyed on, in matters which sense is capable of judging of; it will be impossible for any one to give any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account of the grand <hi>Foundations of Christian Faith.</hi> For if we carefully examine the <hi>grounds of Certainty in Christian Religion,</hi> we find the great appeal made to the <hi>judgement</hi> of <hi>Sense, (That which we have seen, and heard, and handled.)</hi> If then the judgement of <hi>Sense</hi> must not be taken in a <hi>proper object,</hi> at <hi>due distance,</hi> and in such a thing wherein <hi>all mens Senses</hi> are equally Judges; I pray, tell me what assurance the <hi>Apostles</hi> could have, or any from them, of any <hi>miracles</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> wrought, of any <hi>Doctrine</hi> which he preached; especially because in his <hi>miracles</hi> there was something above nature, in which case men are more apt to suspect <hi>Impostures,</hi> than in things which are the continual <hi>Objects of Sense,</hi> as in the case of <hi>Transubstantiation?</hi> Wherein, if men are not bound to rely on the judgement of Sense, you must say, that <hi>our Faculties are so made,</hi> that they may be imposed upon, in the proper <hi>Objects</hi> of them; and if so, farewell all <hi>Certainty,</hi> not only in <hi>Religion,</hi> but in all things else in the world.

What waies did he use to convince them, that he was not a <hi>Spectre</hi> or <hi>Apparition,</hi> but by an appeal to their <hi>Senses?</hi> by what means did he reclaim <hi>Thomas</hi> from his Infidelity, but by bidding him make use of his <hi>Senses?</hi> If <hi>Thomas</hi> had believed <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> he would easily have answered our <hi>Saviours</hi> Argument, and told him, If there were not a <hi>productive,</hi> yet there might be an <hi>Adductive Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of some other person into him: And the Disciples might all have said, It was <hi>true,</hi> there were <hi>the accidents of Christ's Body,</hi> the <hi>external shape and figure</hi> of it; but, for all they could discern, there might be some <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Spirit</hi> under those <hi>external accidents of shape:</hi> and therefore they must desire to be excused from believing it <hi>to be his Body</hi>; for, <hi>Hoc est cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum,</hi> had told them already, <hi>That the external accidents might remain, where the substance was changed.</hi> Now therefore, when the Assurance of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> came from the judgement of the Senses of those who were <hi>Eye-witnesses</hi> of the <hi>Miracles</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection of Christ</hi>; if the Senses of men may be so grosly deceived in the proper <hi>Objects</hi> of them in the case of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> what assurance could they themselves have, who were <hi>Eye-witnesses</hi> of them? and how much less assurance can we have, who have all our <hi>Evidence</hi> from the certainty of their report? So that it appears upon the whole, that, take away the certainty of the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sense,</hi> you destroy all <hi>Certainty in Religion</hi>; for, Tradition only conveys to us now, what was originally grounded upon the <hi>judgement of Sense,</hi> and delivers to us in an undoubted manner, that which the <hi>Apostles saw and heard.</hi> And do not you then give a very good account of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the Infallibility of your <hi>Church</hi>; when, if I believe your <hi>Church</hi> to be infallible, I must by vertue of that Infallibility, believe something to be <hi>true,</hi> which if it be <hi>true,</hi> there can be no <hi>certainty</hi> at all of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>

seems we can have no assurance of these things if the <hi>present Church</hi> be not Infallible. And if we can have no assurance of them, what <hi>obligation</hi> can lye upon us to believe them? for, <hi>assurance</hi> of the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> which are the <hi>foundations</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> is necessary in order to the obligation to believe; I mean such an assurance as matters of fact are capable of; for no higher can be required then the nature of things will bear. And what a strange assertion then is this, that <hi>matters of fact</hi> cannot be conveyed to us in an unquestionable manner, unless the present <hi>Church</hi> stamp her Infallibility upon them? Cannot we have an unquestionable assurance that there were such persons as <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and that they did such and such things, without some infallible testimony? if we may in such things, why not in other <hi>matters of fact</hi> which infinitely more concern the world to know then whatever <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>Pompey</hi> did? But this will be more at large examined afterwards; I only now take notice of the consequence of this principle, and how fairly it destroyes all <hi>rational evidence</hi> of the truth of our Religion; which whosoever takes away will be by force of reason, a <hi>Sceptick</hi> in the first place, and an <hi>Infidel</hi> in the second. Neither is the danger meerly in destroying the rational evidence of Religion; but, 2. In putting the whole weight of Religion upon the proofs of the <hi>present Churches</hi> infallibility, which whosoever considers how silly and weak they are, cannot sufficiently wonder at the design of those men, who put the <hi>most excellent Religion</hi> in the world, and which is built upon the highest and truest <hi>reason</hi> to such a strange kind of <hi>Ordeal tryal,</hi> that if she pass not through this St. <hi>Winifreds needle,</hi> her innocency must be suspected, and her truth condemned. So that whosoever questions the truth of this kind of <hi>Purgation,</hi> will have a greater suspition of a juggle and <hi>imposture</hi> if she be acquitted, then if she had never submitted to such a tryal. And when we come to examine the proofs brought for this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> it will then further appear, what <hi>uncertainty</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> men are betrayed to, under this confident pretext of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Thus we see what <hi>Scepticism</hi> in Religion the principles owned upon the account of Infallibility, do bring men to.</p>

with wonderful care and industry avoid any intimation of what you mean by that <hi>Church</hi> which you would prove Infallible.

                  <hi>The universal Church never erres, because the whole Church is never deceived.</hi> Or, do you mean by your <hi>Catholick Church</hi> some particular <hi>part</hi> of it, to which you apply the name of <hi>Catholick</hi> not for <hi>Vniversality</hi> of extent, but <hi>soundness of Doctrine?</hi> then it will be necessary yet further, to shew what part of the <hi>Church</hi> that is, by what <hi>right</hi> and <hi>title</hi> that hath <hi>engrossed</hi> the name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> so as to exclude other Societies of <hi>Christians</hi> from it; and whether you must not first prove the absolute integrity and soundness of her Doctrine, before you can attribute this title to it.

               <p n="2">2. Supposing you had shewn what the <hi>Church</hi> is, yet you never tell us what the <hi>subject of Infallibility is in that Church.</hi> For, when in this case you speak of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> you must remember you are not to shew what that <hi>Church</hi> is, which is not deceived in judging concerning things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation, but what that <hi>Church</hi> is, which is infallible in her <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of others to Salvation: For, you speak of such an Infallibility as must be a <hi>Guide</hi> to others, and whose infallible <hi>judgement</hi> must be known to all such who must <hi>resolve their Faith into her Testimony</hi>: You would have done then no more than was absolutely necessary to have precisely shewn us where this infallibility is lodged in your <hi>Church</hi>; whether in <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> or both together.

And are we not at a fine <hi>pass</hi> for the certainty of our Faith, if it must rely upon the infallible Testimony of your <hi>Church</hi>; and yet you your selves not at all agreed to whom this <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> doth belong? Think not that we will be put off with that silly evasion, <hi>That these differences among you hinder not the certainty of Faith, because it is not</hi> de fide <hi>either way.</hi> For 1. How shall we come to know among you what is <hi>de fide,</hi> and what not, till you are agreed to whom this <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> belongs? And if it belongs to a <hi>general Council,</hi> then it is <hi>de fide</hi>; for it was determined at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Council,</hi> and therefore if one of the opinions be true, it must be <hi>de fide</hi>; for, I suppose you make that to be so, which is determined by the infallible Testimony of your <hi>Church.</hi> 2. How shall a man believe, that any thing at all is <hi>de fide</hi> among you, if that on which your <hi>Faith</hi> is to rest, be not <hi>de fide?</hi> For, supposing a difference to happen, which hath often done between the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> and they decree contrary things to each other, if it be not <hi>de fide,</hi> to believe either the one or the other distinctly to be infallible, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

what Testimony at such a time must that which supposeth the infallible <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>your Church</hi> rely? 3. If it be said not to be <hi>de fide,</hi> because not determined; by the same reason your <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> cannot be <hi>de fide,</hi> because not determined neither: For, if the Determination of the <hi>Church</hi> be necessary to make any thing <hi>de fide,</hi> it must by the same reason be necessary to make your <hi>Churches Infallibility de fide</hi>; and, I suppose, you will not readily instance in any decree of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> where the Testimony of your <hi>Church</hi> is determined to be <hi>infallible.</hi> And yet one would imagine, that if there were such a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity in order to <hi>Faith,</hi> of the <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> there would be an equal necessity of believing this <hi>Infallibility</hi> on the same Testimony: or if one may believe one Article especially so important a one as that, without any precedent <hi>infallible Testimony,</hi> why not any other, nay, why not all the rest? Thus you still see, how <hi>uncertainties</hi> grow upon us, when we search into your account of Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You are not certain neither, <hi>What kind of Infallibility this is</hi>; For you offer to prove the Church <hi>infallible,</hi> by the same way that <hi>Moses, Christ, and his Apostles were proved infallible:</hi>

                  <note place="margin">P. 58. n. 4.</note> but <hi>not Divine</hi>; that it is <hi>precise Infallibility,</hi> but <hi>not absolute</hi>; that it is not by <hi>immediate Revelation,</hi> but by <hi>immediate Assistance of the Holy Ghost</hi>: Something you would have, but you cannot tell what; an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> without any in the <hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>means</hi>; an Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by <hi>immediate Assistance of the Holy Ghost,</hi> yet but in a <hi>sort Divine</hi>; an Infallibility yielding nothing to <hi>Scripture</hi> in point of <hi>Supernaturality</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi> yet nothing so <hi>infallible</hi> as <hi>Scripture.</hi> Are not these brave things to make wise men certain in their Religion with! that they are to believe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> upon a Testimony <hi>infallible,</hi> yet not <hi>infallible; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> yet not <hi>divine</hi>; and therefore <hi>certain,</hi> but not <hi>certain; true,</hi> but not <hi>true.</hi> But of the silliness of these Distinctions, afterwards. But, can you think to perswade wise or rational men to believe their <hi>Religion</hi> on such terms as these are? Had they no other evidence than what you give them, would they not be shrewdly tempted to reject all Religion, as a meer <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,</hi> as no doubt your Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility</hi> is? A strange kind of <hi>Talisman,</hi> which secures your <hi>Pope</hi> from a possibility of erring, but still he must be under the <hi>certain direction of his Stars</hi>; for, if he be not <hi>in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dr√¢,</hi> this <hi>Telesm</hi> doth him no good at all. It were heartily to be wished, if he should once happen to be <hi>in Cathedr√¢,</hi> he would infallibly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what it was to be <hi>in Cathedr√¢</hi> for ever after; for it would ease mens minds of a great many troublesome scruples, which they cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some infallible Determination, get themselves quit of. But still <hi>we are bound to believe your Church infallible:</hi> But, I pray, whence comes this Infallibility? <hi>Comes it from Heaven, or is it of Men? From Heaven,</hi> no doubt, you say; for it is <hi>by a promise of the Holy Ghost.</hi> This were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if it were proved; but yet you maintain this <hi>Infallibility</hi> in such a manner, that none that read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> could ever think, it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised there. For there they alwaies read, <hi>That the Spirit of Truth is a Spirit of Holiness, and never dwells in those who are carnal or wicked men</hi>; but, you tell us, That let the lives of <hi>Popes</hi> be what they will, they have no <hi>promise</hi> to secure them from being <hi>wicked,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth by <hi>immediate Assistance</hi> secure them from being <hi>fallible.</hi> But, I

pray, Which of these two is not only more contrary to <hi>Scripture,</hi> but to <hi>Humane Nature; Wickedness</hi> or <hi>Fallibility?</hi> This latter, so consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the imperfection of our understandings, that, till we put off the one, we can hardly be freed from the other; but <hi>Wickedness</hi> is that which the whole design of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is against, and administers the highest <hi>Motives,</hi> and the greatest <hi>Assistance</hi> for the conquest of; and can it then be thought suitable to such a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> should, like <hi>Mahomet's Dove,</hi> be alwaies ready to <hi>whisper</hi> in the ear of the most <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate person,</hi> if it be but his fortune to sit <hi>in Cathedr√°?</hi> Such a kind of <hi>Infallibility</hi> as this, I assure you, will never prevail with any such persons, who understand <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> to believe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it upon such pretences as yours are.</p>

               <p n="1">1. How many things in <hi>Christian Religion</hi> are to be believed, before we can imagine any such thing as an <hi>infallible Testimony of your Church?</hi> And if the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of that be the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> on what account must those things be <hi>believed,</hi> which are antecedent to the belief of such an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Testimony?</hi> Now, that many things, and some of them far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear, are to be believed antecedently to an <hi>infallible Testimony,</hi> will appear; if we do but consider what they commonly mean by that <hi>Church,</hi> which they suppose <hi>infallible,</hi> and what must be supposed, that this <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> be the <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith. By the <hi>Church,</hi> they tell you, they mean the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> but lest you should think them too honest in saying so, at next word it is, the <hi>Roman-Catholick Church</hi> (just as if one should say, the <hi>German-Vniversal Emperour.</hi>) But lest you should think at least they meant the <hi>Roman Church of all Ages,</hi> and think you might have some relief from the <hi>Primitive Roman Church,</hi> they will soon rectifie your mistakes, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you, it is the <hi>present Roman-Church</hi> they mean; but if it be the <hi>present Roman-Church,</hi> it may be you would be willing to hear the judgement of <hi>all the honest men in that Church,</hi> and that you hope many of the people and learned men (not in <hi>Orders</hi>) may speak their minds freely. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that, they tell you they mean only <hi>the representative Church.</hi> But still the <hi>Bishops,</hi> who make up this <hi>representative Church,</hi> may in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Synods</hi> complain of abuses, and rectifie miscarriages; therefore they understand not <hi>Bishops by themselves,</hi> or <hi>particular Synods,</hi> but met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>General Councils.</hi> But yet, if the <hi>Councils</hi> were truly <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> there might be some hopes of redress. But for that they are sure; for they allow none to be members of the <hi>General Councils,</hi> which are in <hi>Schism</hi> or <hi>Heresie</hi>; and their own <hi>Church</hi> is to be Judge, what <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Heresie</hi> is; and they are hugely to blame then, if they admit any but those of their own party. But yet, some <hi>Councils</hi> have stood upon their priviledges in opposition to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as those of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil.</hi> Therefore, to make all sure, no <hi>Council</hi> is lawful in it self, or its decrees bind the <hi>Church,</hi> but such as is <hi>call'd</hi> and <hi>confirmed by the Pope:</hi> who is strangely to blame then, if he suffers any thing to pass to his own prejudice: So that this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:101069:74"/>
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> is the <hi>last resort</hi> in the <hi>resolution of Faith</hi>; for all the rest, we see, are uncertain. And what a vast measure of <hi>Faith</hi> (greater than that which our <hi>Saviour</hi> said, would remove mountains) is necessary to <hi>believe</hi> this <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope?</hi> for in the first place, unless he believes the particular <hi>Roman-Church</hi> to be the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> he spoils all the <hi>Conjuring</hi> afterwards, with not having <hi>Faith</hi> enough <hi>about him.</hi> Again, he must <hi>believe,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> hath promised an <hi>Infallible Assistance to the Pastors of the Church as distinct from the People</hi>; but this avails little still, unless he believes these <hi>Credentials</hi> must not be opened, but in <hi>full Council</hi>; and that <hi>Council</hi> such a one as the <hi>Pope</hi> calls, and in which <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self presides,</hi> either in <hi>Person,</hi> or by his <hi>Legates,</hi> and that the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> oblige not the <hi>Church,</hi> without the <hi>Pope's Confirmation</hi>; and to that end you must believe, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was made <hi>Monarch of the Church by Christ</hi>; that this <hi>Monarchy</hi> was to be derived to all his <hi>Successors</hi> in all places; but as to this (where-ever he was besides) he never had any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor any where but at <hi>Rome:</hi> And these Successors of his at <hi>Rome,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for their <hi>lives</hi> err, if they do but sit <hi>in Cathedr√¢.</hi> Certainly he that hath <hi>Faith</hi> to swallow all these things, is hugely to blame if he <hi>stick</hi> at any thing; and by that time a man's understanding is <hi>debauched</hi> sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by these Principles, I make no question but such a one will believe <hi>Infallibility, Transubstantiation,</hi> or any thing in the world. But beside these things, in order to the making the <hi>Churches Testimony the Rule of Faith</hi> to any one, there must another <hi>dose</hi> of <hi>Principles</hi> be taken, which have <hi>Opium</hi> enough in them to lay <hi>asleep</hi> all the remainders of reason: For he must infallibly believe the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>infallible,</hi> though no <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Argument</hi> be brought for the proof of it; That this <hi>Church</hi> doth judicially and authoritatively <hi>pronounce</hi> her <hi>Sentence</hi> in matters of Faith, though we know not what that <hi>Church</hi> is, which must so pronounce; That he infallibly know that this particular <hi>Sentence</hi> was <hi>so pronounced,</hi> though he can have no other than <hi>Moral Means</hi> of knowing it; And lastly, That the <hi>Infallibility</hi> must be the first <hi>thing believed,</hi> although all <hi>these things</hi> must of necessity be <hi>believed</hi> before it. And if after this <hi>second Purgation,</hi> he be not a true <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he deserves to be <hi>Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> as an obstinate person, for having any thing of <hi>reason</hi> in him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wonder not that the Doctrine of <hi>Infallibility</hi> seems no strange thing to you; for a man must devour such <hi>Giant-like Absurdities,</hi> before he comes to it, that when he comes at it, he finds it <hi>nothing.</hi> But still, one would think it a little strange, that this <hi>Infallibility</hi> should be the only <hi>Foundation</hi> of believing all things in <hi>Religion</hi>; and yet <hi>so many things,</hi> and some of them very <hi>strange ones,</hi> must of necessity be certainly believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Supposing a man not only believes all these things before it, but doth <hi>really believe your Church infallible,</hi> yet he is <hi>uncertain</hi> still how he should know <hi>When your Church defines infallibly.</hi> For so many things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in reference to the <hi>Person defining,</hi> so many for the <hi>definition it self,</hi> that it will be no easie matter to remove those difficulties which lye in the way of his Assent to such a Definition. As to the <hi>Person,</hi> if he be not a <hi>Christian,</hi> if he be not a <hi>Priest,</hi> if not a <hi>Lawful Pope,</hi> all his <hi>Definitions</hi> are far from being <hi>infallible</hi>; yet none of all these can any one be assured of according to your Principles of <hi>the intention of the Priest being necessary in the administration of Sacraments, in order to the effect of them.</hi> (But the large train of Consequences following from hence, I forbear to urge you
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101069:74"/>
with, because they have been so often urged by <hi>abler Pens.</hi>) But, What will you say, when we are so far from assurance, as to the <hi>Pope's</hi> being <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally chosen,</hi> that we have, if not <hi>great Evidence,</hi> yet very <hi>high Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the contrary, what becomes then of your <hi>Pope</hi>'s Infallibility? Nay, from the <hi>illegality</hi> of one, follows the <hi>illegality</hi> of all his Successors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were chosen by <hi>Cardinals,</hi> made by him; who could be no lawful <hi>Cardinals,</hi> because he was no <hi>legal Pope,</hi> and consequently not they who were made by them. The case is this; There is a <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Pope Julius the second,</hi> against the <hi>Simoniacal Election</hi> of any <hi>Pope,</hi> which the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> upon their first entrance into the <hi>Conclave,</hi> swear solemnly to observe. In which <hi>Bull</hi> it is expresly said, That <hi>if any Pope be Simoniacally chosen by any of the Cardinals, upon any gift or promise whatsoever, that such an Election is</hi> ipso facto <hi>null; and the Cardinals may oppose one so chosen, as if guilty of manifest Heresie; and that none ought to receive or look on such a one as Pope; neither can this Simoniacal Election be made good by inthronisation, course of time, submission of Cardinals,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that they ought all to avoid him as a Magician, Heathen, Publican, or the Founder of Heresie.</hi> This is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that <hi>Bull.</hi> Now it is notoriously known, that <hi>Sixtus the fifth,</hi> was <hi>Simoniacally chosen Pope.</hi> For, that he might be chosen, he did under his hand promise to <hi>Cardinal d'Este,</hi> who had a great interest in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,</hi> that in the time of his <hi>Popedome,</hi> he would never create <hi>Jerome Matthew,</hi> the <hi>Cardinals</hi> great enemy, a <hi>Cardinal:</hi> upon which promise he was through his interest chosen <hi>Pope.</hi> But, when afterwards the <hi>Pope</hi> violated his <hi>Faith</hi> to him, by creating his enemy <hi>Cardinal; d'Este,</hi> being highly incensed against him for it, sent the very instrument subscribed by the <hi>Pope's</hi> own hand, to <hi>Philip the second King of</hi> Spain, who in the year 1589. sent the <hi>Duke of Suisse</hi> extraordinary <hi>Embassador</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>

But, suppose all the assurance that may be of the person
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101069:75"/>
who is to deliver this <hi>infallible Testimony</hi>; yet at the utmost, the most men in the world can have no more than a <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Definition it self.</hi> If we can imagine, that any one should know that great mystery, when the <hi>Pope should define ex Cathedr√¢</hi>; yet, can he have any greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of such a Definition, than we have concerning the things revealed in Scripture? I cannot think that you will suppose any greater evidence of it, than if one <hi>sees and hears it</hi>; and, what do we desire less in reference to the <hi>Doctrine of Christ?</hi> But how few in the world are there, who stand by, when the <hi>Pope</hi> defines? May others be certain of such a <hi>Definition</hi> or no, so as to be obliged to believe it? If not, What good can this <hi>Infallibility</hi> do them? if they may, Why do you quarrel with our way as <hi>uncertain?</hi> when if you grant your <hi>Infallibility,</hi> you cannot prescribe any more <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way,</hi> but one much more liable to question and dispute than ours is. Thus you see what little advantage you get by all these <hi>bravado's</hi> about <hi>Infallibility</hi>; and that you are so far from giving a satisfactory <hi>account of Faith,</hi> that you expose <hi>Christian Religion</hi> to more <hi>doubts, scruples,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties,</hi> than ever before. Which may abundantly shew to all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced minds, the great <hi>unreasonableness</hi> of your way of resolving Faith, which was the thing to be proved.</p>

But, suppose your way to be never so <hi>reasonable,</hi> yet <hi>if it effect not that it was brought for,</hi> it deserves little favour from inquisitive persons, and that I now come to evince, <hi>viz. That supposing your Church infallible, and that Infallibility proved by the Motives of Credibility, you do not escape the circle objected against your way.</hi> And really, whosoever considers your way of management of things, will find, that though you give out <hi>great words,</hi> and pretend to prove the <hi>Churches Infallibility, as Moses and Christ's was proved</hi>; yet your eye was all the while on nothing but the <hi>circle,</hi> and thought, if you could get rid of that, you should do well enough with any thing else. For, as though this <hi>circle</hi> had ridden you like an <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> you <hi>tumble,</hi> and <hi>groan,</hi> and <hi>toss</hi> this way and that, and when you think your self freed from it, it sits as close upon you as ever. When you come so miserably off with the proofs of your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> you satisfie your self with this; <hi>'Tis sufficient for the present to have declared how the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks fall not into a circle, as his Lordship here pretends they do.</hi> Though this could not be sufficient for your design, who had promised in the page foregoing, to prove at large the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; yet you had done somewhat, if you had done this, which, if I much mistake not, you are as much to seek in, as in the proofs of your <hi>Churches Infallibility.</hi> And that I prove by three things, from the <hi>nature of that Faith</hi> whose resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you promise, from <hi>the persons you prove it to,</hi> from the <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>Infallibility</hi> which you attempt to prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From <hi>the nature of that Faith,</hi> you are enquiring a resolution for, which is not that which you call a <hi>Humane Faith,</hi> but a <hi>Divine Faith.</hi> When you go about to prove the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> by the <hi>Motives of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> is it a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> or no, which may be built on these <hi>Motives?</hi> chuse which part you please. If it be, then by your own Confession, a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith</hi> may be built on <hi>Prudential Motives</hi>; if it be not, then what is all this to the purpose? For the Question is not, Whether by any other <hi>kind of Assent</hi> you cannot avoid the <hi>circle</hi>; but, Whether in the resolution of <hi>Divine Faith</hi> you can or no? For, I hope, you deny not, but the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> and the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> are both to be believed with the <hi>same kind of Assent,</hi> built upon an <hi>infallible Testimony</hi>; in this case I then ask,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101069:75"/>
                  <hi>Why, with a Divine Faith, you believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God?</hi> You answer, <hi>Because the Church, which is infallible, delivers them so to us.</hi> If I then ask, <hi>Why with a Divine Faith you believe the Churches Infallibility?</hi> Answer me if you can, any other way, than <hi>because the Scriptures, which are infallible, say so.</hi> And thus you see, it is only your running away from the <hi>Question,</hi> makes you think your self out of the <hi>circle,</hi> and not any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Answer to it. Will you, or dare you say, That is an <hi>Assent</hi> of the same <hi>nature,</hi> which is built on the <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> with that which is grounded on an <hi>infallible Testimony?</hi> If it be not, bethink your self of a new Answer: if it be, bethink your self of a new <hi>Way</hi> to oppose us, and not to think it sufficient to charge us with building <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> on <hi>Prudential Motives,</hi> when you do it your self. But, if you should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that to be a <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is built on the <hi>Motives of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> you not only contradict your self, but the great Ones of your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Thus you see, how insufficient your attempt is, because you speak not of the same <hi>kind of Assent</hi> as to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You avoid not the <hi>Circle</hi> by the <hi>different considerations of the persons</hi> you offer to prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> to. You tell us, <hi>That when you prove the Infallibility of the Church by Scripture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 55. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>you make use only of Arguments</hi> ad hominem, <hi>and argue</hi> ex principiis concessis <hi>against Sectaries, who deny the Infallibility of your Church, but admit the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scriptures, and therefore you may justly use Scripture-arguments against them.</hi> I grant it: but still I say, you avoid not the <hi>Circle</hi> by this <hi>subterfuge</hi> neither. For, 1. The question is not, Which way you will prove the <hi>Infallibility of the Church</hi> against those who deny it; but which way you resolve your <hi>own faith</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> Infallibility? therefore this signifies nothing at all as to your <hi>Question</hi> about the <hi>resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; for I suppose you build not <hi>that</hi> on any thing which your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary <hi>grants</hi> or <hi>denyes.</hi> Is there no difference between the way of proving a thing to an adversary, and the resolving <hi>ones own Faith?</hi> I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not, but you may dispute with him upon <hi>Principles</hi> he grants and you deny; but, I should think you no wise man to build <hi>your Faith</hi> upon such <hi>Principles.</hi> So that this evasion comes not near the business. 2. Even in disputing against your <hi>Adversaries</hi> you cannot avoid the <hi>circle,</hi> which I thus prove. You offer to prove to them the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Infallible</hi> out of <hi>Scripture</hi>; for this you bring them particular places, and think presently to vanquish them with, <hi>Super hanc Petram, Pasce oves, &amp; Dabo tibi claves</hi>; but hence ariseth another Question, How you come infallibly to know, that this is <hi>the sense</hi> of those places? You know, your <hi>Adversaries</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny any such thing as <hi>Infallibility</hi> to be proved out of them. And, what way have you to assure them, this is the <hi>sense</hi> of them, but because your <hi>Church,</hi> which is <hi>infallible,</hi> delivers this to be the sense of them. And is not this then a plain <hi>circle? You are to believe the Church infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Scripture saith so; and you are to believe the Scripture saith so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church is infallible.</hi> If this be not still a plain <hi>circle,</hi> you may
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101069:76"/>
question whether there be any such figure in <hi>Mathematicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I prove you cannot avoid the <hi>Circle</hi> from your own Confession of the <hi>nature of that Infallibility, which you say is in the Church.</hi> For you tell us, <hi>That the Churches Testimony doth not suppose any new Revelation from God, but only a supernatural Assistance of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 58. n. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>preserving her from all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in defining the Points of Christian Faith.</hi> By this Assertion, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all possibility of avoiding the <hi>Circle by the Motives of Credibility</hi>; for if these had proved an <hi>immediate Divine Revelation in the Church,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess you had proved the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> independently on <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>; but, when you offer to prove only a <hi>Divine Assistance</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> in delivering former <hi>Revelations,</hi> you cannot: and the reason is, because you can bring no ground at all why such an <hi>Assistance</hi> should be necessary in the <hi>Church</hi>; or why it should be expected but from the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made in Scripture</hi> concerning such an <hi>Assistance of God's Spirit</hi> to be with the <hi>Church:</hi> and therefore the utmost your <hi>Motives of Credibility</hi> can pretend to, is only to notifie that <hi>Church</hi> from others, which you suppose <hi>infallible:</hi> but still the <hi>formal reason</hi> of your beleeving this <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> cannot be from those <hi>Motives,</hi> but upon those <hi>Promises</hi> which you suppose to import such an <hi>Assistance of the Holy Ghost</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> which shall secure her from errour: So that still the <hi>Circle</hi> returns upon you: For, <hi>you believe the Scriptures infallible, because of the Churches Testimony; and you believe the Church infallible, because of the Promises in Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Assistance of the Holy Ghost with the Church, so as to secure her from all errour.</hi> And thus, I hope, I have made good this <hi>general At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> upon your <hi>way of resolving Faith,</hi> by manifesting the great <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,</hi> and manifest <hi>insufficiency</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>I now come to handle the particulars of this Chapter, which consists of two things,<note place="margin">¬ß. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Proofs</hi> and <hi>Evasions,</hi> the <hi>Proofs</hi> you produce for your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> and your <hi>Evasions</hi> as to those <hi>Arguments</hi> which are objected by his Lordship. Both of these will deserve our <hi>Consideration</hi>; and if it appear, that your <hi>Proofs</hi> are <hi>weak,</hi> and your <hi>Evasions silly,</hi> you will have no great cause to triumph in this <hi>Attempt</hi> of yours. As to your <hi>Proofs,</hi> two things are considerable, <hi>your Method of proving,</hi> and the <hi>Proofs themselves.</hi> I begin with the <hi>first,</hi> which you deliver in these words.<note place="margin">P. 55. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore, as to the last demand (in which only there is difficulty</hi> viz. <hi>How we know the Church to be infallibly governed by the Holy Ghost; we answer, that we prove it first in general, not by the Scripture, but by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility, which belong to the Church, in the same manner as the Infallibity of</hi> Moses, <hi>and other Prophets, of Christ and his Apostles was proved, which was by the Miracles they wrought, and by other signs of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit, direction, and guidance from God, which appeared in them. Whence it is clear, that we incurr no circle.</hi> That, <hi>supposing all that true</hi> which you said before, yet thereby you avoid not the <hi>circle,</hi> I shall take it for granted, I have already proved, till you better inform me: Our business now therefore is, to consider, which <hi>way</hi> you prove this <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> which you tell us, <hi>is not by Scripture</hi> (for which I commend your ingenuity) but by the <hi>Motives of Credibility.</hi> But, lest any should think this a weak way of probation, you tell us, <hi>It is in the same manner that the Infallibility of all persons divinely inspired was proved,</hi> not excepting <hi>Christ himself.</hi> A most heroical and generous Attempt! For which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is infinitely obliged to you, if you make it good: For then it necessarily follows, that there is as great danger in not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101069:76"/>
believing the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> as in not believing <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets, Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> For, where there is an <hi>equal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> to believe, there is an <hi>equal sin</hi> in not believing; and where the sin is equal, it stands to reason that the <hi>punishment</hi> should be so too. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you deny not, but, Where there are <hi>equal Motives</hi> inducing to believe, there results an <hi>equal Obligation</hi> to Faith, because the <hi>Grounds</hi> obliging to assent, can be no other than the <hi>Motives inducing</hi> to it; and if these <hi>Motives</hi> be as strong and evident for your <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as for that of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> men must be as much obliged now to believe your <hi>Church infallible,</hi> as, that <hi>Moses and Christ were so.</hi> So that the denial of your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> must needs be accounted by you to be as high a piece of <hi>Infidelity,</hi> as if one should call in question the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> himself. For you assert, That you have the same <hi>Proofs</hi> for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of your <hi>Church,</hi> which there were to prove him infallible. I do not therefore wonder at your sharpness and severity in your censures of all out of your <hi>Church,</hi> when upon your Principles the denying your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> must needs be an offence of as high a nature, as if one denied the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Scriptures.</hi> But, lest you should not think these any <hi>Absurdities</hi> at all, we must come yet closer to the examination of your <hi>Proofs:</hi> For which we must enquire into these two things. 1. Whether <hi>the same Motives of Credibility belong to your Church, by which</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, shewed their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be infallible.</hi> 2. Whether, on supposition you had the same <hi>Motives,</hi> there were the same reason to believe the Testimony of your <hi>Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> as there was to believe Them to be so.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether <hi>the same Motives of Credibility belong to your Church or no.</hi> And here again, these things offer themselves to consideration. 1. By what means their <hi>Testimony</hi> was proved <hi>infallible.</hi> 2. Whether your <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> can be proved by the <hi>same Motives</hi> or no. For the <hi>first,</hi> you are pleased to give us this account, <hi>Why</hi> Moses <hi>was accounted infallible;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 56. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Israelites seeing</hi> Moses <hi>to be a person very devout, mild, charitable, and chaste, and endowed with the gift of working miracles, were upon that ground obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to receive him for a true Prophet; and to believe him infallible, by acknowledging as true and certain, whatever he proposed to them from God.</hi> All which I acknowledge to be very true; but am much to seek, how you will apply it to the proving your <hi>Churches Infallibility.</hi> What kind of <hi>Miracles</hi> those are which your <hi>Church</hi> pretends to, will be examined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; the other <hi>Motives of Credibility</hi> mentioned, are <hi>Devotion, Mildness, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Chastity</hi>; and these, I suppose, you look on as those <hi>Motives,</hi> which must induce men to believe the <hi>Infallibility of your Church.</hi> But, do you really think, that every person who is <hi>devout, mild, charitable,</hi> and <hi>chast,</hi> is therefore <hi>infallible?</hi> If not, to what purpose do you produce them here? if you do, some out of <hi>your Church</hi> may be as <hi>infallible</hi> as those in it. Especially, if your <hi>superstitious Ceremonies</hi> be the greatest part of your <hi>devotion</hi>; and your <hi>burning of Hereticks,</hi> the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your <hi>mildness</hi>; and your <hi>damning all out of your Church,</hi> be the best evidence of your <hi>Charity</hi>; and the <hi>lives of your Popes,</hi> the most <hi>preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Instances</hi> of your <hi>Churches Chastity.</hi> The rest of your discourse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you endeavour after your way, to <hi>prove tha there were sufficient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility, to believe the Testimony of Christ and his Apostles,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose no Christian will deny; and <hi>that the Miracles wrought by them, were Proofs that their Testimony was infallible,</hi> I am so far from questioning, that all your other <hi>Motives</hi> signifie nothing without them. Which, because it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101069:77"/>
hath so great an influence on the present dispute, I think it necessary to be a little further cleared, than it is by you, and chiefly for this <hi>end,</hi> to let you see, <hi>how much you have befooled your self in attempting to prove the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of your Church, in the same manner that Christ and his Apostles Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility was proved in,</hi> and yet insisting on that of <hi>Miracles,</hi> as the great evidence of their <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which your <hi>Church</hi> cannot with any face pretend to. I acknowledge it then as a great <hi>Truth,</hi> that it was necessary, that the <hi>Testimony</hi> of all such who pretend to be <hi>infallible,</hi> must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by such <hi>Miracles,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> wrought; Nay, that it is impossible, without such <hi>Evidence,</hi> to prove any Testimony infallible, where that <hi>Infallibility</hi> is pretended to, <hi>independently upon Scripture,</hi> as it is in your present case. Which will be thus made evident: <hi>Absolute In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> is not consistent with the <hi>shortness</hi> of the <hi>Humane Vnderstanding,</hi> for such an <hi>Infallibility</hi> must suppose an <hi>infinity</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi>; for, where there is a <hi>defect</hi> in the <hi>Apprehension,</hi> there is a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>deception</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only an <hi>Infinite Being</hi> can be <hi>absolutely infallible.</hi> Now, man's <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> being so <hi>finite,</hi> and limited in its Conceptions, it is on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count apt to be imposed upon, and to form <hi>false Notions</hi> of things; so that supposing no Being in the world of greater <hi>Perfections</hi> than <hi>man</hi> is, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be any such thing as <hi>Infallibility</hi> among men. For, though some mens <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> might <hi>outstrip</hi> others in the quickness of Conception, and solidity of Judgement; yet the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> being thus <hi>finite,</hi> that presumption would lye against all pretence of Infallibility. It being then impossible, that mans understanding should be <hi>in it self infallible,</hi> we must consider, whether there be a <hi>possibility</hi> it should receive any <hi>Infallibility</hi> from that <hi>Infinite Being,</hi> which is above it. This then must be taken for granted, that as an <hi>Infinite Vnderstanding</hi> cannot be <hi>deceived,</hi> so <hi>Infinite Goodness</hi> cannot <hi>deceive.</hi> And therefore, whatever doth immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a <hi>Being infinitely Wise and Good,</hi> cannot but be <hi>infallibly True.</hi> And there is no repugnancy at all, in the nature of the thing, but that this <hi>Infinite Being</hi> may, in a way certain, but imperceptible by us, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the <hi>Minds</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> such <hi>Notions</hi> of things, which are the effects of his own <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Counsel:</hi> and this is that we call <hi>Divine Inspiration.</hi> But then we are still to consider, That the understanding of a <hi>finite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> cannot be any further <hi>infallible,</hi> than as it receives those <hi>Notions</hi> which are imprinted upon it by the <hi>Infinite and Supreme Intellect</hi> of the world; and such a person is no further <hi>infallible</hi> in what he speaks, than as he delivers to the world those <hi>very Conceptions,</hi> which are thus formed in his mind. And this is that which the <hi>Apostle</hi> means when he sayes, That <hi>Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.21.</note> And so far as they were thus moved, so far they were infallible, and no further. But this <hi>Infallibility</hi> being not intended meerly for the satisfaction of the <hi>mind</hi> of <hi>him</hi> that hath it, but for the general <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that there be some way whereby men may come to understand who are <hi>infallibly assisted,</hi> and who not. For otherwise the world would be more exposed to <hi>delusions</hi> under this <hi>pretext</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi>; than if there were never any such thing in the world. Either therefore every man must be <hi>infallibly assured</hi> in his <hi>mind,</hi> that such a person is infallible in what he is to deliver, which is a needless piece of <hi>Enthusiasm</hi>; or else such <hi>external Evidences</hi> of it are to be used, which may induce all rational and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derative persons to the belief of it. Which is the way that <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom</hi> hath made choice of; by making those very persons, whose
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101069:77"/>
understandings are thus assisted by him to be the <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>doing some things above the power of nature.</hi> And nothing can be more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, than to believe their Testimony <hi>True,</hi> who are imployed as such immediate <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Divine Power</hi>; and if their Testimony be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved True, their <hi>Doctrine</hi> must be <hi>Infallible</hi>; for the greatest part of their <hi>Testimony</hi> is this, That they deliver not their <hi>Doctrines</hi> from <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> but immediately from <hi>God.</hi> And consequently their <hi>Testimony</hi> must be owned as <hi>infallible,</hi> in whatever they deliver as from <hi>God</hi>; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very unreasonable to think, that <hi>God</hi> would favour such persons with so extraordinary a <hi>Power,</hi> who should falsifie their message, and deceive the world. Thus you see, That whatever <hi>Motives of Credibility</hi> you would blind the world with, there can be no <hi>Motive</hi> independent on <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is sufficient to prove <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but such a power of <hi>working Miracles, which</hi> Moses, <hi>and the Prophets, and Christ, and his Apostles had,</hi> which last, as you truly say,<note place="margin">P. 56. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>received their Commission from Christ to preach every where, and to confirm their words with signs that followed; by which signs, all their hearers were bound to submit themselves unto them, and to acknowledge their words for infallible Oracles of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, What reasonable man could otherwise expect,<note place="margin">¬ß. 13.</note> but that after you had so solemnly promised <hi>to prove the Infallibility of your Church, in the very same manner that</hi> Moses, <hi>with other Prophets, Christ and his Apostles were first proved to be infallible,</hi> which are twice your words;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 55. n. 1. P. 56. n. 2.</note> and your at large shewing, <hi>That the main ground why they were believed infallible, was, because of the Miracles wrought by them, whence they needed not the Testimony of Scripture:</hi> You should have shewed us what kind of parallel <hi>Miracles</hi> are wrought in your <hi>Church,</hi> to prove its <hi>infallibility.</hi> But, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of that, when you come to the purpose, you shuffle us off, in a most ridiculous and impertinent manner: For, you tell us,<note place="margin">P. 57.</note> That <hi>as therefore</hi> Moses, <hi>our blessed Saviour, and his Apostles, were proved infallible by their works, signs, and miracles, without Scripture; so is the Church without help of the same sufficiently proved to be infallible by the Motives of Credibility.</hi> Well, but <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> are these <hi>Motives of Credibility?</hi> Are they of the same kind and nature with the <hi>signs</hi> and <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by them or not? If not, How can the way and manner be the same, which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to prove the <hi>Churches Infallibility?</hi> If not, What assurance can you give us, that those will prove Infallibility, as well as their <hi>works and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles?</hi> This should have been demonstrated, and those <hi>motives</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the view of the world, if you had designed any other than <hi>jugling</hi> with your Readers. Instead of this, you tell us, That <hi>Hereticks, though they have the Scripture, yet being out of the true Church, they do wholly want these signs of Infallibility: of which, see</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>and other Catholick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors discoursing more at large,</hi> de notis Ecclesiae. <hi>'Tis sufficient for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to have declared how Catholicks fall not into a Circle, as his Lordship pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends they do.</hi> These are excellent waies of proof, and fit only for a Church that pretends to be infallible, and then most of all, when her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility was to be proved. What did you lead us this long dance for, if you never intended to prove your <hi>Church infallible?</hi> Could you not have referred us to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> at first, as well as at last? Nay, and now you do turn us off to him, you bid us, go seek the <hi>Notes of the Church,</hi> and not the <hi>Proofs of Infallibility</hi>; which, sure, are different things, unless you suppose no <hi>Church True,</hi> but what is <hi>Infallible.</hi> But however, you are sure not to miss the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> they must have a blow at parting, <hi>They are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101069:78"/>
out of the Church, and do wholly want these signs of Infallibility.</hi> What <hi>signs of Infallibility?</hi> speak out, and tell us, <hi>What they are,</hi> and <hi>where they lye,</hi> and <hi>how they may be known?</hi> for otherwise we may mistake in the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomy</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> and instead of <hi>signs</hi> of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> we may see shrewd <hi>signs</hi> of <hi>imposture</hi> and <hi>delusion</hi> in her. And it is the more suspicious, because you are so afraid of producing them after so solemn a promise to do it. However, you tell us, <hi>'Tis sufficient for the present to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how Catholicks fall not into a Circle:</hi> Well, I see, though we miss of of the <hi>Coals S.</hi> Laurence <hi>was broyled on,</hi> we shall have a <hi>Feather from the wing of a Seraphim</hi>; Though you fail of your promise, we shall have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as good; and as great a feat of activity as that had been, <hi>viz.</hi> to let us see, <hi>How the Papists dance in a round, and yet make no Circle.</hi> Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations are so good in this kind, it is pity you do not imploy your excellent wit in squaring <hi>Mathematical Circles,</hi> as well as <hi>this</hi>; and I shall as soon hope to see you perform the one, as the other. But, Can you, without smiling at our simplicity, tell us, (after such a wide-mouthed promise; as you made in the page foregoing; <hi>But, because we have often promised to prove the Infallibility of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 56. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>it will be necessary to insist somewhat longer upon this Point, and declare the matter at large) That it is enough to vindicate your selves from the Circle?</hi> Was this the thing you promised, or the proofs of your <hi>Churches Infallibility?</hi> I confess <hi>Quid fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret hic tanto dignum promissor hiatu?</hi> came into my mind at first reading those words, and it proves accordingly. You really meant no such thing, as proving your <hi>Church infallible:</hi> and you are very excusable in it, though you had promised it; for no <hi>Promise can bind to impossibilities.</hi> But it may be yet, though these <hi>Proofs</hi> do not come after the Promise, they may have gone before it; For I find before a large <hi>Catalogue</hi> mentioned of such <hi>signs and motives,</hi> which may prove the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> as <hi>sanctity of life, miracles, efficacy, purity and excellency of doctrine, fulfilling of Prophecies, succession of lawfully sent Pastors, Vnity, Antiquity, and the very name of Catholick,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 55. n 1.</note> &amp;c. Number enough, if that would do it. But we shall see, what force these <hi>Motives</hi> are of, by these following Queries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it all one with you, <hi>To know a Church to be true, and to make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?</hi> These you call the <hi>Motives of Credibility</hi> for your <hi>Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> were wont to be esteemed only the <hi>Notes of Distinction</hi> of the True <hi>Church</hi> from all others. The Question, I suppose, concerning <hi>these,</hi> had this rise. There being, after the Reformation, several distinct Societies of men, pretending to be the True <hi>Christian Church,</hi> to which every <hi>Christian</hi> ought to associate himself; there was a necessity of pitching on some way, whereby the True <hi>Christian Church</hi> might be distinguished from other Communions; which begat a new Controversie, What were the proper <hi>Notes</hi> of this Society. Those of your party, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells you, differed much in the number of them: Some of which are those by you mentioned; but whether they be the True <hi>Notes</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> or no, which hath been largely examined by others, What are these to the proof of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> setting aside that of <hi>Miracles?</hi> Is it not possible that there should be a Society of Men joyning together in the Profession of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> but these Men must presently be <hi>infallible</hi> in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they deliver as the Sense of their Society? Their visible Profession of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> makes them a <hi>True Church:</hi> but cannot men seem to profess our Religion, unless they have a visible <hi>Infallible Head</hi> to guide them? Is <hi>Infallibility</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> which gives it its Being, I

mean, a <hi>present Infallibility</hi> continually actuating and informing the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of it? Cannot a man be known to be a <hi>True Man,</hi> unless he be <hi>inspired?</hi> Nor a <hi>Church</hi> distinguished from other <hi>Societies,</hi> but by a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility?</hi> The truth is, Let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> multiply his <hi>fifteen Notes of the Church</hi> to <hi>fifteen hundred,</hi> if he please; nay, let it pretend to what <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> it please: if any Society of men challenging the name of <hi>Church</hi> to it self, do destroy the <hi>end</hi> of its <hi>Constitution,</hi> or hold any thing directly contrary to the <hi>Foundation</hi> of its <hi>Institution</hi>; all other <hi>Notes</hi> in the world can never make it a <hi>True Church.</hi> So that the only certain <hi>Note</hi> of a True <hi>Church,</hi> is its <hi>Agreement</hi> with the primary <hi>Foundation</hi> of it in that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> which was <hi>Infallible,</hi> and attested by <hi>Miracles</hi> undoubtedly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: That which holds the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> is the <hi>Christian Church</hi>; and the nearer any <hi>Society</hi> comes to <hi>that,</hi> the <hi>purer</hi> it is; the more it is distant from it, the more <hi>impure</hi>: and no man who honours the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> can be bound to communicate with the <hi>Impurities</hi> of such a <hi>Church,</hi> let it bear it never so high under the pretence of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> If you boast never so much of your <hi>Vnity, Succession, Antiquity,</hi> the <hi>name of Catholick,</hi> &amp;c. if your <hi>Doctrine</hi> be <hi>repugnant</hi> to what was originally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Founder of the <hi>Christian Church</hi>; your Society is not the True <hi>Christian Church.</hi> But, suppose it were, and that it were known so to be by such <hi>Notes</hi> as these are; Can you not conceive a <hi>Church</hi> should be consonant to the Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> but it must be it self <hi>infallible</hi> in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding Controversies?</hi> Cannot you imagine a <hi>Society</hi> consisting of all True <hi>Christians</hi> in the world, should be made up of such persons who all firmly believe that <hi>Doctrine infallible</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> delivered, but yet judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves all fallible, and dare not usurp that <hi>royal prerogative</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> in prescribing <hi>infallibly</hi> in matters questioned, but leave all to judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Pandects</hi> of the <hi>Divine Laws,</hi> because each member of this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> is bound to take care of his soul, and of all things that tend thereto? Is such an <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> a thing unreasonable, inconsistent, or contrary to any <hi>Law</hi> of its Foundation; or rather, is it not a very true and just representation of that <hi>Society</hi> of men, which our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> instituted as a <hi>Church</hi> in the world?</p>
               <p n="2">2.

If you do (as you must, if you speak to the purpose) shew us what <hi>miracles, efficacy, purity and excellency of Doctrine</hi> there are in your <hi>Church</hi> beyond and beside all other <hi>Churches</hi> in the world: What <hi>fulfilling of Prophecies</hi> among you, which makes your <hi>Church infallible?</hi> Is it the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> That <hi>your Church shall be infallible</hi> that is fulfilled?

                  <hi>motive of credibility</hi> to them to prove your <hi>Church to be Infallible.</hi> Unless it be meant that <hi>the state of your Church is an infallible evidence that those Prophesies are fulfilled.</hi> But I pray, why should <hi>fulfilling of Prophesies,</hi> make your <hi>Church Infallible?</hi> I had rather thought, if you could have proved <hi>your Church to have been Prophetical,</hi> it had been more to your purpose. And if your <hi>Popes in Cathedr√¢</hi> had foretold <hi>future events,</hi> which by their coming to pass, had evidenced to the world they had a <hi>true spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,</hi> then indeed you had said something towards <hi>Infallibility.</hi> But that the <hi>meer fulfilling of Prophesies,</hi> owned Divine by all <hi>Christians,</hi> should prove <hi>your Church Infallible,</hi> is such <hi>a motive of Credibility</hi> concerning that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> that it proves nothing, but by this consequence, <hi>If Christ were Infallible, then your Church is.</hi> Or do you mean, <hi>because some Prophesies concerning your Church are fulfilled, therefore your Church is Infallible</hi>; by the same reason I hope you will not deny, but <hi>that Antichrist is Infallible,</hi> for when ever he did, doth, or shall appear, no doubt there will be <hi>fulfilling of Prophesies,</hi> and those very clear ones too. And therefore <hi>Antichrist</hi> and <hi>your Pope</hi> may go together for <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be yet you have some <hi>other motives</hi> besides <hi>fulfilling Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,</hi> and those are <hi>miracles</hi>; now you speak indeed to the purpose. But yet still we poor Infidels (<hi>because out of your Church</hi>) desire a little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction concerning them too. 1. We very reasonably desire, <hi>That he in your Church who pretends most to infallibility, should do these miracles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> For that was alwayes the <hi>way</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> for them whose <hi>testimony</hi> was to be believed <hi>Infallible,</hi> to be the <hi>workers</hi> of those <hi>miracles</hi> which should induce men to believe such an <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Do you think the <hi>Israelites</hi> would have believed <hi>Moses Infallible,</hi> if any ordinary <hi>Israelite</hi> had wrought those <hi>miracles</hi> which he did? unless you would suppose that those <hi>miracles</hi> were purposely wrought to have attested that <hi>Moses was Infallible.</hi> But yet <hi>God</hi> thought it much more fit, that <hi>Moses himself</hi> should be the <hi>instrument</hi> of doing them, and so it was with our <hi>Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> Let then your <hi>Church</hi> produce the several <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by your <hi>Popes</hi> to attest their Infallibility; or, if you believe <hi>Pope and Council</hi> the subject of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> produce the <hi>miracles</hi> to prove that. <hi>God</hi> was alwayes so just and reasonable, as not to expect the belief of any <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> without such evidences given for it as might perswade men to believe it: and you acknowledge, <hi>That independently on Scripture there can be no such proof of Infallibility as Miracles,</hi> and you require it from us to believe the <hi>present Church Infallible,</hi> where then are your <hi>present miracles</hi> wrought to attest this Infallibility? For as long as you require such an assent to the <hi>present Churches Infallibility,</hi> it is necessary on your own grounds, that the <hi>present Church</hi> should alwayes work <hi>miracles</hi> in order to the proving this <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We desire <hi>such miracles as may sufficiently convince the Infidels as to this point of your Infallibility.</hi> For that was alwayes the <hi>way</hi> used in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>; The intention of <hi>miracles</hi> was to perswade those who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Would <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> have believed <hi>Moses,</hi> if all his <hi>miracles had been wrought in a corner,</hi> where none but <hi>Israelites</hi> had been present? Would the <hi>Jews</hi> have believed <hi>in Christ,</hi> if he had not come in publick among them, and wrought such frequent, publick, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled miracles, that his greatest <hi>enemies</hi> durst not deny them? If you would then have us believe your <hi>present Churches Infallibility,</hi> let your <hi>Pope,</hi> or at least your <hi>Priests</hi> come and do such kind of <hi>miracles</hi> among
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101069:79"/>
us which may bear the examination of inquisitive men, and then try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will not believe your <hi>Infallibility</hi>; but till then, excuse us. Think not we are of such easie Faith, that the pretended growing out of a <hi>Leg</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> or any of your famous <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by your <hi>Priests</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> will perswade us to believe your <hi>Church Infallible.</hi> It is alwayes observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, your <hi>miracles</hi> are most talked on, where people are most <hi>ignorant,</hi> and therefore most apt to be deceived. Your <hi>Priests,</hi> like the <hi>Devils</hi> in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> can do no <hi>feats</hi> when their <hi>opposers</hi> are by; It is an easie thing for a <hi>stump</hi> to grow a <hi>Leg</hi> in its passage from <hi>Spain</hi> hither; for <hi>Fama crescit eundo</hi>; such things are most believed where <hi>circumstances</hi> are least capable of examination. And the <hi>juglings</hi> and impostures of your <hi>Priests</hi> have been so notorious in this kind, that their <hi>pretences</hi> to <hi>miracles</hi> have made more <hi>Infidels</hi> then <hi>Catholicks,</hi> by making men more apt to question, whether ever there were any <hi>real miracles</hi> done, then believe the <hi>truth</hi> of yours. Very likely then it is, that you should perswade the world your <hi>Church is Infallible,</hi> because of the <hi>miracles</hi> wrought in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What discrimination do you put between those <hi>lying wonders</hi> which you are foretold shall be wrought at the <hi>coming of Antichrist,</hi> and those <hi>pretended miracles</hi> which are wrought among you? Convince us by suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence, that the things which seem most confirmed by your <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> viz. <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> is a thing consonant to the doctrine esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the undoubted <hi>miracles</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles?</hi> If it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, either you must prove that <hi>doctrine</hi> false; or, if you admit it true, you prove your <hi>miracles</hi> to be <hi>false:</hi> because contrary to a <hi>doctrine</hi> established by <hi>miracles</hi> undoubtedly Divine. And God can never be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to attest with <hi>miracles</hi> the truth of <hi>doctrines</hi> contrary to each other. And thence the wisest of your <hi>Church</hi> are so far from insisting on this of <hi>miracles</hi> for a <hi>motive of credibility</hi> concerning your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> that they leave it out from being a <hi>note</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; because <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as they say, may as to all outward appearance work as great <hi>miracles</hi> as the best <hi>Catholicks.</hi> And therefore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>No man can have an absolute certainty concerning the truth of miracles, because the Devil, though he cannot work true miracles, can work, as to appearance, the greatest.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since the confirmation of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> by <hi>miracles undoubtedly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> there can be no relyance on the tryal of <hi>miracles</hi> for the <hi>truth</hi> of any <hi>doctrine:</hi> for those very <hi>miracles</hi> and <hi>doctrine</hi> must be judged according to that rule of Faith which was confirmed by Divine miracles. Thus we have examined those <hi>motives</hi> which seem most to prove Infallibility, and shewn how little they agree to the <hi>present Churches Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

Now these motives are, <hi>Sanctity of life, Succession, Vnity, Antiquity, and the very name of Catholick,</hi> &amp;c. How hard is it to conceive the connexion between these and <hi>infallibility!</hi> Nay, they are so far from it, that it hath been abundantly proved against your party, that these are no certain <hi>notes</hi> of the <hi>true Church,</hi> (which is a Controversie I shall not now discuss). And if the <hi>Church</hi> cannot be proved to be <hi>true</hi> by them, much less certainly will it be proved to be <hi>Infallible.</hi> But suppose all this, is your <hi>Church</hi> so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for <hi>Sanctity of life,</hi> that it should be a <hi>motive</hi> for your <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> Have your <hi>Popes</hi> been indeed such <hi>Holy men,</hi> that we may not question but they were moved by the <hi>Holy Ghost when they spake?</hi> Certainly, you

have some other way to know it then all <hi>Histories</hi> both of <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>enemies,</hi> and the constant <hi>fame</hi> of the world, which hath then much abused us with stories quite of another nature. Or, is the <hi>state of your Church</hi> so <hi>pure and holy,</hi> that it must shew it self <hi>Infallible</hi> by that? But whom will you be judged by in this case? I desire you not to stand to the <hi>verdict</hi> of your <hi>Adversaries.</hi> Will you believe men of your <hi>own Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> pray read what sad complaints are made of the <hi>degenerate state</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Petrarch, Mantuan, Clemangis, Espencaeus, Erasmus, Cassander,</hi> and several others, and judge you whether we have not reason to cry up the <hi>Sanctity of your Church. But these,</hi> (it may be you will say) <hi>were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented persons.</hi> Will you believe then your <hi>Cardinals?</hi> And if ever you will believe them, it should certainly be, when they meet to advise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>state</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi>; and was not this the expression of the <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>chosen Cardinals</hi> for reformation of the <hi>Church,</hi> under <hi>Paul</hi> 3. <hi>Per nos, inquimus, per nos, nomen Christi blasphematur apud gentes.</hi> Is not this a great evidence of your <hi>Sanctity?</hi> If you will not believe the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> you will not certainly question the judgement of him whom you would fain have to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> himself. And these are the words of <hi>Adrian</hi> 6. in his <hi>Instructions</hi> to his <hi>Legat</hi> at the diet of <hi>Norimberg A.

You see then what evidence you have from your selves concerning that <hi>Sanctity of life</hi> which is in your <hi>Church.</hi> But it may be still, you do not mean <hi>real Sanctity,</hi> but that the <hi>doctrine of your Church</hi> tends more to promote it, then that of any <hi>other Church.</hi> I heartily wish, the quite contrary could not be too truly said of it, and it is well known, that one of your great <hi>Artifices</hi> whereby you perswade great Persons to your <hi>Religion,</hi> is, the <hi>liberty</hi> it indulgeth them in <hi>sin</hi> here, and yet the <hi>hopes</hi> it gives them of <hi>heaven</hi> hereafter. Our doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>indispensable obedience to all the precepts of Christ:</hi> Yours tells them, <hi>those which are the most strict and severe, are not precepts, but counsels of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> Ours, <hi>That there is no hope of Salvation without hearty amendment of life:</hi> Yours, <hi>That Pennance is requisite and external satisfaction to the Church; and for internals, that Contrition is very commendable, but if there be not that, Attrition will serve the turn.</hi> Ours, <hi>Charges men to look to their Salvation in this life, because when life is ended their estate is irrecoverable:</hi> Yours, <hi>That though men dye in their sins, yet they may be relieved by the prayers of the living, and that there is hope they may get through Purgatory to Heaven at last.</hi> So that supposing any <hi>persons</hi> to own <hi>Christianity</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> it is hard to conceive there should be more Artifices imagined to reconcile the <hi>Love of the pleasures of sin</hi> here with the <hi>hopes of Heaven</hi> at last, than are used by those of your Profession.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101069:80"/>
those of your <hi>Religion</hi> who were the Authours of these things, were so far from believing your <hi>Church Infallible,</hi> that they really believed neither <hi>Christian</hi> nor any other <hi>Religion</hi> in the world. So much for that <hi>Sanctity of life</hi> which is in your <hi>Chuch.</hi> As for your other motives of <hi>Vnity, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, Antiquity, and the name of Catholick,</hi> &amp;c. they have so little affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with any pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and do equally agree to those <hi>Churches,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Abyssine,</hi> which you are so far from acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infallible, that you will not grant them to be <hi>true Churches</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these <hi>Motives</hi>) that I cannot easily imagine to what <hi>end</hi> you produced them, unless to let us see, you had the gift of <hi>saying something,</hi> though <hi>nothing</hi> to the purpose.</p>
               <p>When you have thus apparently failed in producing any <hi>shadow</hi> of <hi>proof</hi> for your <hi>Churches Infallibility by these motives of credibility,</hi>

Therefore we must consider what <hi>arts</hi> you use in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the force of those <hi>arguments</hi> which are produced against you by his <hi>Lordship.</hi> After he had urged that question against you, <hi>How it may appear that your Church is infallibly governed by the Holy Ghost,</hi> to which we have seen how impossible it is for you to give any satisfactory answer, he proceeds to another Argument which lies in these words; <hi>Besides,</hi>

                  <hi>this is an inviolable ground of reason, That the principles of any conclusion must be of more credit then the conclusion it self. Therefore if the Articles of Faith, the Trinity, the Resurrection, and the rest, be the conclusions, and the Principles by which they are proved be only Ecclesiastical Tradition; it must needs follow, that the tradition of the Church is more infallible then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, if the Faith which we have of the Articles should be finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into the veracity of the Churches Testimony.</hi> To this your Answer is very considerable. 1. You tell us, <hi>That the ground of all this discourse is the authority of</hi> Aristotle <hi>cited in the Margent, which you repeat after him.</hi> But I pray, Whence learn'd you that this was all the <hi>ground</hi> of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course? For his <hi>Lordship</hi> doth not say, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith so, and therefore it is so; but saies, <hi>That it is an inviolable ground of reason,</hi> (which words you prudently left out, that there might appear some shadow for such a cavil) and cites only the concurrent testimony of <hi>Aristotle</hi> with that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reason which is in it. And will you deny this to be an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principle in reason, that, <hi>That which is assumed as the ground and reason why I assent to any thing, must be more certain and evident, then that is which I assent to on that ground?</hi> Certainly you must have an <hi>art</hi> above all other men to make the <hi>superstructure</hi> stronger then the <hi>foundation</hi>; the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Problems</hi> in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> more <hi>evident</hi> then the <hi>Postulata</hi>; the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi> surer then the <hi>Premisses.</hi> But you think to come off this absurdity. 2. <hi>By distinguishing between Science and Faith,</hi> or, as you express it, <hi>between the proceeding of the understanding when it works naturally and necessarily, by and from the evidence and clearness of its object: and when it works su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally and produceth supernatural and free acts,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That all assent of the <hi>understanding</hi> is grounded upon <hi>evidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That however that <hi>evidence</hi> proceeds, yet the <hi>Foundation of assent</hi> must be more evident then the thing assented to. And these two I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose will fully reach the scope of your Answer, by shewing that your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction <hi>of acts natural and supernatural, is both untrue and impertinent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all assent is grounded upon evidence, i. e.</hi> that no man can assent to any thing <hi>meerly because he will,</hi> but there must be sufficient reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and perswading to that <hi>assent.</hi> You acknowledge <hi>this to be true in acts of Knowledge, but not of Faith</hi>; but, What do you make to be the <hi>genus</hi> in your definition of <hi>Faith?</hi> I suppose you will say, it is <hi>an assent of the mind.</hi> If it be so, the mind cannot be supposed to elicite an act of the same nature in so repugnant a manner to it self, that it should assent to any thing without <hi>evidence.</hi> I know what discourses those of your party have, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>obscurity</hi> which is necessary to <hi>Faith.</hi> If you mean <hi>obscurity</hi> as to the <hi>object</hi> believed, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the matters to be believed are not so <hi>clear</hi> to us as <hi>demonstrations,</hi> I will not gainsay it: but if you mean <hi>obscurity</hi> or want of <hi>evidence,</hi> as to the <hi>reason</hi> inducing me to believe, I utterly deny any such <hi>obscurity</hi> to belong to <hi>Faith,</hi> or to be consistent with it. For <hi>God</hi> doth not require us to believe any thing without <hi>sufficient grounds</hi> for our believing it, and those <hi>grounds</hi> do bear a proportionable evidence to the nature of that <hi>assent</hi> which he requires. If he requires an <hi>Infallible assent</hi> he gives <hi>Infallible grounds</hi>; if he requires a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>certain assent,</hi> he gives <hi>firm and certain grounds</hi>; if he requires only a <hi>probable assent,</hi> he gives only <hi>probable evidence.</hi> But still, such as the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>assent</hi> is, such is the <hi>evidence</hi> he gives for it. To make this plainer by an Instance. <hi>That Christ was the true Messias,</hi> he requires an <hi>assent</hi> built upon <hi>Infallible grounds,</hi> and therefore God gave such <hi>Infallible evidence</hi> of it by the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> which he wrought. That these <hi>Miracles</hi> were once really done, he requires our <hi>firm assent,</hi> and therefore gives <hi>certain evidence</hi> by an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and uncontrouled tradition; but whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> or any other <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical person</hi> were Authour of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he requires only an <hi>assent</hi> built on the most <hi>probable grounds,</hi> and therefore he hath given us no more for it. But still as the <hi>assent</hi> is, so the <hi>evidence</hi> must be. For <hi>Faith</hi> being an act of the <hi>mind,</hi> whose nature is to judge according to <hi>reason,</hi> we cannot suppose any act of it to proceed in a <hi>brutish manner</hi> by a meer <hi>impulse</hi> of the <hi>will.</hi> I deny not, but the <hi>will</hi> may be said to have some kind of influence upon the understanding, both in furthering and hindering <hi>assent</hi>: but it is not by any command it hath over the <hi>mind</hi> in its <hi>acts,</hi> but as it can <hi>divert</hi> the mind from, or incline it to, the searching into the <hi>evidence</hi> of the things. Therefore when we commonly say, <hi>Facile cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus quae volumus,</hi> and so on the contrary; it is not because of the <hi>wills immediate power</hi> upon the understanding, but, as the <hi>desire</hi> of a thing makes us <hi>inquisitive</hi> after it, so the dislike of it makes us unwilling to hear the <hi>reasons</hi> for it, and ready to entertain any pretence against it. Thus, I grant, the <hi>will</hi> may have <hi>power</hi> upon the <hi>mind as to the eliciting the act of Faith,</hi> not that I can <hi>assent</hi> to a thing as <hi>true,</hi> because I desire it to be <hi>true</hi>; but this <hi>inclination</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> removes those <hi>impediments</hi> which would obstruct my discovery of the evidence which is in it. You havs certainly a <hi>mind</hi> of another <hi>mould</hi> then others have that can believe thing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101069:81"/>
which do not appear <hi>credible</hi> to you; yet such a kind of <hi>Faith</hi> as this, is very necessary for your <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>; and for that, your discourse of believing by the impulse of the will, is very proper and seasonable. But other persons may think it an <hi>Imperfection</hi> in their minds, that they cannot believe any thing any further than it appears <hi>credible</hi>; that is, that they can <hi>go</hi> no further than they have <hi>legs</hi>; nor <hi>see</hi> when their <hi>eyes</hi> are shut, or the <hi>room dark.</hi> But, it may be, you will tell me, <hi>All this discourse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds on supposition, that Faith were a natural act of the mind; but you speak of a supernatural Faith.</hi> It may be so; but, I hope, you speak not of an <hi>irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Faith,</hi> which must believe things beyond the <hi>evidence</hi> of their <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Faith,</hi> whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>supernatural, acquired</hi> or <hi>infused,</hi> is still an <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi>; and let it have but what belongs to it as such, and call it what you will. I deny not a peculiar <hi>Operation</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> in the elici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Divine Faith</hi>; but still I say, The manner whereby it is wrought, must be agreeable to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and by discovering the <hi>Credibility</hi> which is in the <hi>Objects of Faith.</hi> If you say, The <hi>Assent</hi> is <hi>infused,</hi> I must say, The <hi>Evidence</hi> is first <hi>infused</hi>; for as <hi>Christ,</hi> when he healed the <hi>blind,</hi> did not make them see <hi>Objects</hi> which did not <hi>appear visible</hi>; so neither doth the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in planting <hi>Faith</hi> make men discern <hi>Objects</hi> which do not appear <hi>credible</hi>; and the stronger the <hi>Assent</hi> is, the greater is the <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Credibility</hi> of the Object. And can you call then that <hi>any free inevident Assent,</hi> which goes no further than the <hi>Object</hi> appears <hi>credible?</hi> It cannot be then any <hi>Act of the Will,</hi> but meerly of the <hi>Mind,</hi> which yields assent to any <hi>Object</hi> propounded as <hi>credible</hi> to it. So that in what way and manner <hi>Assent</hi> is required, in that same manner doth <hi>God</hi> give proportionable evidence: I deny not but that <hi>Assent</hi> is required to Objects <hi>inevident to sense</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but then I say, The <hi>Assent</hi> is not required to what is <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident</hi>; but to what is <hi>evident</hi> to us, and therefore <hi>credible.</hi> In the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Son of God,</hi> the manner of the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion</hi> is to us <hi>inevident,</hi> but then <hi>God</hi> doth not require our Assent to the <hi>Manner,</hi> but to the <hi>Truth</hi> of the thing it self. Where-ever <hi>God</hi> requires us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing as <hi>True,</hi> he gives us <hi>evidence</hi> that it is so: where-ever it appears the thing is <hi>inevident,</hi> we may lawfully <hi>suspend</hi> our <hi>Assent,</hi> and, for all that I know, it is our <hi>duty</hi> so to do.</p>
               <p>But yet you have not done with this profound discourse; <hi>For you very learnedly distinguish a double proceeding in probations; the one is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 17.</note> per prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia intrinseca, which you very well English (<hi>by intrinsecal Principles</hi>) i. e. <hi>such as have a necessary, natural connexion with the things proved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>and do manifest and lay open the objects themselves; the other is,</hi> per principia ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseca <hi>(by extrinsecal Principles) that is, such as have no natural or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary connexion with, nor do produce any such evident manifestation of the things proved, but their efficacy,</hi> (viz. <hi>whereby they determine the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to assent) doth wholly depend on the worth and vertue of that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principle, whereby such probations are made. This</hi> you apply <hi>to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith, that as Knowledge proceeds in the former way, so Faith doth in the latter, which depends purely upon extrinsecal Principles,</hi> viz. <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Veracity, Goodness, and Knowledge of God affirming it; which was immediately known to the Prophets and Apostles, but mediately to us, which how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ver, must be infallibly conveyed to us, which can only be by the testimony of the Church.</hi> This is the substance of your third Section; to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1. That all <hi>Certainty</hi> in the acts of the <hi>Mind,</hi> whether in <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:101069:82"/>
or <hi>Faith,</hi> must equally suppose the <hi>Truth</hi> of some <hi>extrinsecal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> viz. <hi>the veracity and goodness of God:</hi> for otherwise we cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly judge of those you call <hi>Principia intrinseca,</hi> to know what things have necessary and natural connexion with the things proved. For, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I suppose that <hi>God</hi> is so <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> as not to suffer me to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the proper <hi>actings</hi> of my <hi>Faculties,</hi> I may judge such things to have connexions and dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ndencies one upon another, which really have nothing so. And therefore, so far your distinction concerning <hi>Science and Faith,</hi> will not hold. But 2. If the meaning of this distinction be only this, That there is a different proceeding in a <hi>demonstration,</hi> from what there is in <hi>an act of Faith,</hi> I deny it not; but suppose it nothing to your purpose. For, though the <hi>evidence</hi> be discovered in a <hi>different way,</hi> yet there is in both proportionable <hi>evidence</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Assent.</hi> When I <hi>assent,</hi> because I know that the thing is <hi>true,</hi> the <hi>evidence</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> it self, is the <hi>ground</hi> of that Assent; but, when I <hi>assent</hi> upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of any <hi>person,</hi> the <hi>Credibility</hi> of his <hi>Testimony,</hi> is the <hi>evidence</hi> on which that <hi>Assent</hi> is grounded. Though this latter <hi>evidence</hi> be of another <hi>kind,</hi> yet it is sufficient for that <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>mind,</hi> which is built upon it; and that Testimony which I establish a firm <hi>Assent</hi> upon, must be as <hi>evident</hi> in its kind, <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Credibility,</hi> as the <hi>evidence</hi> of a thing <hi>demonstrable</hi> in the nature of a <hi>Demonstration.</hi> 3. The main strength of your <hi>Answer</hi> seems to lye in this, <hi>That in such an Assent as is built upon Authority; as in the case of Faith, when we do not immediately hear God speaking, but it is conveyed to us by the Testimony of others, it is necessary that this Testimony be infallible.</hi>
But, good Sir, this is not our present Question, Whether it be necessary that this Testimony be <hi>infallibly conveyed</hi> to us, but, supposing such an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Conveyance,</hi> Whether that <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> must not be more <hi>credible</hi> than the <hi>matters</hi> which are believed upon it? But, as though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any such thing had been started: You give us a long discourse of the <hi>different proceeding of Science and Faith,</hi> but never offer to apply it to the business in hand. I must therefore ingenuously commend you for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Art of <hi>gliding insensibly</hi> away from a business you cannot answer, and casting out a great many words not to the purpose, that you may seem to touch the matter, when you are far enough from it.</p>
               <p>And therefore I say, Secondly, <hi>That however the evidence proceeds in matters of Faith, yet whatever is the Foundation of Assent, must be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than the thing assented to.</hi> Especially where you suppose the <hi>Assent</hi> to be <hi>infallible,</hi> and the <hi>Testimony infallible,</hi> which must ascertain it to us. This will be plainer by an instance. If I ask you, Why you believe <hi>the Resurrection of the dead,</hi> your Answer is, because of the <hi>Authority</hi> of him that reveals it: The next Question then is, Why you believe <hi>that God hath revealed it</hi>; your Answer is, <hi>Because the Testimony of the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible which delivers it.</hi> Whereby it is plain, That though your first Answer be from <hi>God's Authority,</hi> yet the last resolution of your <hi>Faith,</hi> is, the <hi>Infallibility of your Churches Testimony</hi>; and that being the <hi>last resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that <hi>Infallibility</hi> must be the <hi>Principle</hi> on which the belief of the rest depends. For, according to your Principles, <hi>though God had revealed it,</hi> yet if this <hi>Revelation</hi> were not attested by the <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> we should not have sufficient ground to believe it. And if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, we can have no sufficient ground to believe, then this <hi>Principle The Church is infallible,</hi> must be more <hi>credible</hi> than <hi>the Resurrection of the dead.</hi> Which was the Absurdity his Lordship charged upon you, and you are far from being able to quit your self of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:101069:82"/>The next thing which you busie your self much in answering of, is, <hi>That according to these Principles of resolution of Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>you make the Churches Testimony the formal Object of Faith, which you acknowledge your self to be a great Absurdity, and therefore make use of many shifts to avoid.</hi> I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the substance of your verbose,<note place="margin">P. 58. n. 4.</note> and immethodical Answer into as narrow a compass as I can, without defalking any thing of the strength of it. You tell us then, <hi>That our Faith is resolved into God's Revelations, whether written, or unwritten, as its Formal Object; and our Infallible Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that the things we believe as God's Revelations are revealed from him, is resolved into the Infallibility of the Churches Definitions, teaching us, that they are his Revelations; And that the Formal Cause of our Assent in Divine Faith, is God's Revelation delivered to the Church without writing; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is as it were at distance from us, it is approximated, or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to us by the infallible Declaration of the present Church. Hence it appears, our Faith rests only upon God's Revelation as its Formal Object, though the Churches Voice be a condition so necessary for its resting thereon, that it can never attain that Formal Object without it. And lastly,</hi> you tell us, <hi>The Churches Authority then being more known to us than the Scriptures, may well be some reason of our admitting them, yet the Scriptures still retain their prerogative above the Church: and thence you distinguish of the certainty of the Object and Subject; from all which you conclude, That the Churches Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the Formal Object of Faith, but that our Faith relyes upon it as an Infallible Witness both of the written and unwritten Word of God, which is the Formal Object.</hi> This is the substance, in your long Answer, of what hath the face of reason and pertinency: Which I come to a close and particular examination of. And that you may not say, I pass over this important Controversie, without a through discussion of it; I shall first prove, that it necessarily follows from your Principles, That the Churches Infallible Testimony must be the Formal Object of Faith. And 2. That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers you give are far from being satisfactory that it is not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it necessarily follows from your Principles, That the Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Testimony must be the Formal Object of Faith.</hi> In order to which, we must consider, what the scope and design of this Discourse is, concerning the <hi>Resolution of Faith.</hi> The Question started by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fisher,</hi> in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> was, <hi>How his Lordship knew Scripture to be Scripture, or, How the Divine Authority of the Scriptures was to be proved.</hi> To this his Lordship returns a large Answer, to which you attempt a Reply in this Chapter, and mention this to be the main Question, <hi>How Scriptures may be known to be the Word of God. To this,</hi> you tell us, <hi>No satisfactory Answer can be given, but from the infallible Testimony of the Church, and the great reason given by you in all your discourse, is this, That this is an Article to be believed with Divine Faith, and Divine Faith must be built on an Infallible Testimony.</hi> The Question then resulting hence, is, Whether on these <hi>Principles</hi> you do not make the <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Formal Object</hi> of <hi>Faith?</hi> You deny, and we affirm it; but before I come to the particular Evidences of the Cause, some generall <hi>postulata</hi> must be laid down, which by the very <hi>state</hi> of the Controversie, must be acknowledged by you, which are;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Question in dispute is not concerning the <hi>Formal</hi> Object of all things <hi>divinely revealed,</hi> but concerning the believing this to be a <hi>particular Divine Revelation.</hi> For, it is obvious to any one that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, what vast difference there is between those two Questions, <hi>Why you
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101069:83"/>
believe that to be True which God hath revealed</hi>; the plain and easie resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, is, into the <hi>veracity and infallibility of God,</hi> in all his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But it is quite another Question, when I ask, <hi>Why you believe this to have been a True Divine Revelation?</hi> Or that such particular Books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Word of <hi>God.</hi> And it is apparent, by the whole process of the the Dispute, that the Question is not concerning the <hi>first,</hi> but the <hi>second</hi> of these two.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Question is not concerning any <hi>kind of perswasion,</hi> as to this Divine Revelation, but concerning that which you call <hi>Divine Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this <hi>Divine Faith must be resolved into some Testimony supposed infallible.</hi> These three are things agreed on between both parties, as appears by the whole management of this Controversie. Only you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> to be the <hi>Church,</hi> which your Adversary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and saith, It will follow from thence, that you make your <hi>Churches Testimony the Formal Object of Faith,</hi> which I thus prove:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is the only <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> whereon a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> is built, must be the <hi>Formal Object of Faith:</hi> but the Infallible Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your <hi>Church,</hi> is the only <hi>Foundation</hi> whereon <hi>Faith</hi> is built. By the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> I suppose you and I mean the same thing, which is the <hi>Foundation</hi> whereon the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Assent</hi> is grounded, or the principal <hi>Objective Cause of Faith, viz.</hi> not every account that may be given <hi>Why men believe,</hi> but that which is the only <hi>Certain Foundation</hi> to establish a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> upon. Now, let any one but consider what the <hi>Question</hi> is, and what your resolution is, and then judge, Whether you make not the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> the <hi>Formal Object.</hi> The Question is, How we know the <hi>Scriptures to be the Word of God</hi>; which in other terms is, <hi>What the ground is why I assent to the Doctrine contained in Scripture as a Divine Revelation?</hi> You say, <hi>The Testimony of the Scripture it self</hi> cannot be that <hi>ground</hi>; You say, <hi>The Testimony of the Spirit cannot be it</hi>; You say, A <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> cannot be it, because then it is not <hi>Divine Faith:</hi> What then is the reason why you believe it? Do you not over and over say, It is <hi>because of the infallible Testimony of the Church, which gives us unquestionable assurance that this was a Divine Revelation</hi>; and yet for all this, this Testimony is not <hi>the Formal Object</hi> of this <hi>Divine Faith.</hi> The most charitable apprehension I can have of you, when you write things so inconsistent, is, either that you understand not, or consider not what you write of, but take what hath been said in such cases by men of your own <hi>party,</hi> and right or wrong that serves for an Answer. But for all this,<note place="margin">4.</note> you tell us confidently, <hi>That your Faith is not resolved into the voice of the Church, as into its Formal Object; but it is enough to say, Our Faith is resolved into God's Revelations (whether written or unwritten) as its For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object: and our infallible assurance, that the things we believe are Divine Revelations, is resolved into the Infallibility of the Churches Definitions.</hi> These are excellent Notions if they would hang together. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We enquire not what is <hi>enough to say</hi> in such a case, but what <hi>ground</hi> you have for <hi>saying</hi> what you do. You have <hi>enough to say</hi> upon many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in this Book (or else your Book would never have swell'd to the bulk it hath) but you have generally very <hi>little reason</hi> for <hi>what you say.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Is that <hi>infallible Assurance,</hi> that the <hi>things</hi> we believe as <hi>God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> are revealed from him, a thing call'd <hi>Faith</hi> or no? If it be, as I hope you will not deny it, then by your own Confession, <hi>Faith</hi> is resolved into the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> as its Formal Object; for, you say, This <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101069:83"/>
Assurance</hi> is resolved into the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> Definitions, teaching us, that they are his <hi>Revelations.</hi> These are your own words. And, do you yet deny this Testimony of the <hi>Church</hi> to be the <hi>Formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this infallible Assurance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. What is it you mean, when you say, That <hi>Faith is resolved into God's Revelations as its Formal Object?</hi> Is it, that the <hi>reason</hi> why we believe, is, <hi>Because God hath revealed these things to us?</hi> But that, you know, is not the <hi>matter</hi> at all in question, but, How we come to assent to such a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> as a <hi>Divine Revelation?</hi> Answer me punctually to it; Can you pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly resolve your Faith into any thing else, as its <hi>Formal Object?</hi> If you can, I pray do us the favour to name it. If you resolve this <hi>Faith,</hi> as you seem to express your mind, <hi>into Divine Revelation,</hi> as its Formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; Shew us where that <hi>Revelation</hi> is extant, for which you believe <hi>Scripture to be the Word of God.</hi> Is it the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self, or a <hi>Revelation</hi> distinct from it? If you say, It is the <hi>Scripture it self,</hi> then you must make the <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> needless; for then we may have <hi>infallible Assurance,</hi> that the things we believe are <hi>Divine Revelations,</hi> without your <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> or Definitions: Then, what is become of the <hi>unwritten Tradition</hi> you mention in these words, If then it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,<note place="margin">P. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>Why we believe such Books as are contained in the Bible to be the Word of God; we answer, Because it is a divine unwritten Tradition, that they are his Word; and this Divine Tradition is the Formal Object, whereon our Faith relyes.</hi> Well then, our last resolution of Faith is into this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine unwritten Tradition: But, whence come you to know, that this <hi>Tradition is Divine?</hi> Into what <hi>Revelation</hi> is the belief of that finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved? Doth it appear to be so by <hi>it self,</hi> and then why may not the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>? or hath it some other <hi>Revelation,</hi> and <hi>Divine Tradition</hi> to attest it? And then the same Question returns concerning that, and so <hi>in infinitum,</hi> or else of necessity you must acknowledge one of these two things; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that some <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> may sufficiently manifest it self, without any <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church:</hi> Or else, that this <hi>infallible Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> must be the <hi>Formal Object of Faith.</hi> Of these two, chuse which you please.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I prove that you must make the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> the <hi>Formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith,</hi> because either you must make it so, or you must deny <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> to be the <hi>Formal Object</hi> of Faith; because the reason is equal for both. I demand then, How you resolve your <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> you tell me, into <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> as its <hi>Formal Object?</hi> I ask yet further, Why you believe the <hi>Revelation made by Christ to be Divine.</hi> Your Answer must be, either that your <hi>Churches</hi> Testimony gives you <hi>infallible Assurance</hi> of it, and then the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment returns: or else that <hi>Christ manifested his Testimony to be infallible,</hi> and therefore his <hi>Revelation Divine,</hi> because of the <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> which accompanied his preaching. If this be your Answer, as it must be by your former discourse, then by the same reason I prove your <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> to be the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> because you have endeavoured to prove the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> by the same <hi>Motives of Credibility that Moses and Christ proved theirs.</hi> Either therefore retract all your former discourse, or else confess, that by the same reason that the <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made by Christ, is the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> the <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> of your Church must be so too. For according to your own supposition, there are <hi>equal Motives of Credibility,</hi> and therefore equal obligation to believe the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of one as of the other.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:101069:84"/>3. If the only reason which makes any thing be the <hi>Formal Object</hi> agrees to the <hi>Testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> then that Testimony must be the <hi>Formal Object of Faith</hi> to them that believe it. Now, that which is the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which makes any thing to be the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> is the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition that it is <hi>infallible.</hi> For, why do you resolve your Faith finally into <hi>Divine Revelation?</hi> Is it not because you suppose <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>infallible</hi> in all Revelations of himself; and therefore if your <hi>Church be infallible,</hi> as you say it is, by the same reason that must be the <hi>Formal Object of Faith</hi>; as if it were by the revelation of <hi>God</hi> himself? But here you think to obviate this objection by some strange distinctions concerning your <hi>Infallibility.</hi> You tell us therefore, <hi>The Churches Infallibility is not absolutely and simply Divine; or that God speaks immediately by her Definitions: but only that she is supernaturally infallible,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 58, 59.</note> 
                  <hi>by the assistance of the Holy Ghost preserving her from all errour, in defining any thing as a point of Christian Faith, that is, as a Truth revealed from God, which is not truly and really so revealed.</hi> A rare Distinction this! You say afterwards, <hi>The Churches Definition is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infallible, but yet this Infallibility is not absolutely and simply Divine</hi>: I pray tell us, What is it then? You say, It is <hi>Supernatural,</hi> but not <hi>Divine,</hi> and this <hi>Supernatural Infallibility, by the Assistance of the Holy Ghost securing from all errour,</hi> but yet not <hi>absolutely and precisely Divine:</hi> I pray tell us, What <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> that was which the <hi>Apostles</hi> had in delivering the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> was that any more than such a <hi>Supernatural Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> as you fondly arrogate to your <hi>Church, viz.</hi> such a one as might secure them from all errour in defining any thing as a point of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> which was not so, that is, as a <hi>Truth revealed from God,</hi> which was not truly and really so revealed. And yet, I suppose, you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but those who lived in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, might resolve their <hi>Faith</hi> into that <hi>Infallibility</hi> which they had as its <hi>Formal Object,</hi> and therefore why not as well into your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> since you pretend to as great Infallibility in your <hi>Church</hi> as ever was in the <hi>Apostles.</hi> Thus, I hope, I have shewn it impossible for you, not to make the Churches Testimony the Formal Object of Faith, since you make it infallible as you do.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Your next <hi>Section</hi> affords us some more words, but not one drachm more of reason. For, How do you prove, <hi>that the Churches Authority is more known to us than the Scriptures?</hi> or, How can you make it appear, that there is any <hi>Authority,</hi> but what is <hi>relative</hi> to us, and therefore the distinction is in it self silly, of <hi>Authority in se, &amp; quoad nos.</hi> For, whatever hath <hi>Authority,</hi> hath thereby a respect <hi>to some</hi> it hath its <hi>Authority</hi> over. And, Can any thing be a ground of Faith <hi>simply and in it self,</hi> which is not so <hi>towards us:</hi> For the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> is that for whose sake we believe, and therefore, if <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> be, as you say, the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> then it must be more <hi>known to us,</hi> than the Testimony of the Church: For, that must be more <hi>known to us,</hi> which is the main cause of <hi>Believing.</hi> But, if all your meaning be, that we must first know what the <hi>Church delivers for Scripture,</hi> before we can judge whether it were <hi>divinely revealed</hi> or no: I grant it to be true; but what is this to your Infallibility? Will you prove the <hi>Infallibility of your Church</hi> to be more <hi>known to us,</hi> than that of the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; and, on supposition that were true, can you then prove that the Scriptures should still retain their prerogative above the Church? What your Authors distinguish concerning <hi>objective and subjective Certainty,</hi> pertains not to this place; for the worth and dignity of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> may exceed that of Tradition, yet, when the knowledge of that worth, relyes on that Tradition, your esteem of the one, must be according to your esteem of the other. I will not here enquire, <hi>Whether the adhesion of the Will, can exceed the clearness of the Vnderstanding</hi>; nor, <hi>Whether</hi> Aristotle <hi>was unacquainted with subjective Certainty</hi>; nor <hi>Whether our adhesion to Articles of Faith, be stronger than to any Principles evident to natural Reason:</hi> For, I look upon all these Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to serve you in no other capacity, than as excursions from the matter in hand; and therefore I shall not gratifie you so far as particularly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them. For all then that hath been yet produced by you, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Argument remains good, that, according to your Principles, <hi>the Churches Testimony must be made the Formal Object of Faith,</hi> and I am the more confirmed in it by the weakness of your evasions; and, I hope, I have now made good those words which you challenge his Lordship for, <hi>That it were no hard thing to prove it.</hi>

                  <hi>must be finally resolved into the Authority of the present</hi> Roman <hi>Church: And, though they would seem to have us believe the Fathers, and the Church of old; yet they will not have us take their Doctrine from their own writings, or the Decrees of Councils, because, as they say, We cannot know by reading them, what their meaning was, but from the infallible Testimony of the present</hi> Roman <hi>Church teaching by Tradition. And this, he tells you, is, the cunning of this devise.</hi> To which you answer; <hi>By what hath been said, it appears, That there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or cunning at all, either in taking away any thing due to the Fathers,</hi>

                  <hi>Councils, or Scripture; or in giving too much to the Tradition of the present Church. For we acknowledge all due respect to the Fathers, and as much (to speak modestly) as any of our adversaries party. But, they must pardon us, if we prefer the general interpretation of the present Church, before the result of any mans particular Phansie.

of the Church, yet affirm it to be in many places so obscure, that we cannot be certain of its true sense, without the help of a living, infallible Judge, to determine and declare it, which can be no other than the present Church. And what we say of Scripture, may, with proportion, be applied to Ancient General Councils. For, though we willingly submit to them all, yet where they happen to be obscure in matters requiring Determination, we seek the assistance and direction of the same living Infallible Rule,</hi> viz. <hi>the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or the Sentence of the present Church.</hi> The Question is, <hi>Supposing your Churches Testimony to be infallible, without which we can have no As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of what Fathers, Scriptures, and Councils say, What Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains among you, to any, or all of these?</hi> And it is not, what respect, <hi>you tell us,</hi> you give them; (for you may as easily speak, as believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions) but what is <hi>really</hi> left to them, if your Opinion concerning the present Churches Infallibility be true. And he that cannot see the <hi>cunning of this Device</hi> of resolving all into the Authority of the <hi>present Roman Church,</hi> will never understand the interest of your <hi>Church</hi>; but, it seems, you apprehend it so much, as not to seem to do it, and have too much <hi>cunning</hi> to confess it. But, this must not be so easily passed over, this being one of the grand <hi>Artifices</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> to make a great noise with <hi>Fathers, Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> among those most, who understand them least, when your selves resolve them all into the <hi>present Churches Testimony.</hi> Which is first to <hi>gagge them,</hi> and then <hi>bid them speak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, For the <hi>Fathers,</hi> you say, <hi>You acknowledge all due respect to them</hi>; but the Question is, What kind of <hi>respect</hi> that is which <hi>can be due</hi> to them, when, let them speak their minds never so plainly, and agree in what they please, and deliver what they will as the <hi>Judgement</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; yet all this can give us no <hi>Assurance</hi> at all on your Principles, unless your <hi>Church</hi> doth infallibly determine the same way. What then do the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> signifie with you? Doth the Infallibility of your <hi>Churches Definition</hi> depend on the consent of the <hi>Fathers? No,</hi> you tell us, <hi>She is superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally assisted by the Holy Ghost</hi>; and if so, I suppose the judgement of the <hi>Fathers</hi> is not that which she relyes on. But, it may be, you will say, <hi>This supernatural Assistance directs the Church to that which was the Judgement of the Fathers in all Ages.</hi> This were something indeed, if it could be proved: But then I would never read the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to know what their mind is, but aske your <hi>Church</hi> what they meant: And, though your <hi>Church</hi> delivers that as their sense, which is as opposite as may be, both to their words and judgements; yet this is part of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> due to them, not to believe whatever <hi>they say themselves,</hi> but what <hi>your Church</hi> tells us <hi>they say.</hi> A most compendious way for interpreting <hi>Fathers,</hi> and making them sure not to speak any thing against your <hi>Church.</hi> Therefore I cannot but commend the ingenuity of <hi>Cornelius Mussus,</hi> the <hi>Bishop of Bitonto,</hi> who spake that out, which more wary men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented onely to think. <hi>Ego, ut ingenu√® fatear, plus uni summo Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifici crediderim in his quae mysteria fidei tangunt, qu√†m mille Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinis, Hieronymis, Gregoriis.

               </p>
               <p>But still you extol the Scripture above the Definitions of the <hi>Church:</hi> How is that possible, when you tell us, <hi>The only Authority it hath, is from the Churches Testimony?</hi> For the <hi>Authority</hi> of it supposeth it to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and that, you tell us, we can have no As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of, but from your <hi>Churches Definition:</hi> And we had thought, that which gave <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> had been greater than that which <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> it. There can be then little reason to take your word in a case of this nature, when your very next words give so palpable a reason to the contrary. For you suppose <hi>the Scripture unable to express it self to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or purpose, unless your Church be the Interpreter. For the Scripture,</hi> say you, <hi>being in many places obscure, we cannot be certain of its true sense, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101069:86"/>
the help of a living and infallible Judge, to determine and declare it; which can be no other than the present Church.</hi> I answer. 1. Your meaning is not so plain, but that it wants the interpretation of your <hi>Church</hi> too. For what do you understand by the <hi>Scriptures being in many places obscure?</hi> Is it only, that there are some passages which have their <hi>difficulties</hi> in them? But what is this to the purpose, unless you could prove, that this <hi>obscurity</hi> is such as hinders it from being a <hi>Rule of Faith and Manners?</hi> If you prove that, you do something. The <hi>Scripture</hi> we acknowledge hath its <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> in it, but not such as hinder the great design <hi>God</hi> intended it for; no more than the <hi>maculae</hi> which are in the <hi>Sun,</hi> hinder it from giving light to the world; or some <hi>crabbed pieces</hi> in our <hi>Laws</hi> hinder them from being owned as the <hi>Laws of the Land.</hi> 2. Are those places <hi>obscure</hi> or no, which speak of the <hi>Churches Infallibility?</hi> at least such as you produce for it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards? This is evident, that there are no places whose sense is more <hi>controverted</hi> than theirs: Can these then be understood without a <hi>living</hi> and <hi>infallible Judge,</hi> or no? If they may, so as we may be certain of their true sense, then why not all others which concern the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> and manners, whose sense is far less disputed than of these? If not, then we must suppose a <hi>living and infallible Judge,</hi> before we know whether there is such <hi>a one</hi> or no: For that is the thing enquired after in the meaning of these <hi>places,</hi> and you say, We cannot be certain of their <hi>sense</hi> without him, so that we must first suppose the thing to be <hi>true,</hi> and then <hi>prove it</hi>; or else you run back again into your old <hi>Labyrinth. How know you that God hath promised, there shall be such an infallible Judge? By such places</hi> (say you) <hi>as you produce for it.</hi> Well, but the <hi>Scripture being in many places obscure,</hi> How shall I be certain this is the true sense of them? You say, because the <hi>present Church is the living and infallible Judge to determine and declare it.</hi> Do not you herein argue like a man, that can <hi>square Circles?</hi> 3. In those places whose <hi>sense,</hi> you say, is so <hi>obscure,</hi> Where hath <hi>God</hi> made it necessary for us to have the certain <hi>sense</hi> of them? You can have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for all this for an infallible Judge, unless you could make it evident, that <hi>God</hi> hath left no mysteries in his Word, but he hath left your <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>Key</hi> to unlock them; and therefore, I hope, there is a <hi>Clavis Apocalypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> too hanging at your <hi>Churches Girdle.</hi> It is true indeed, your <hi>Church</hi> is happily instrumental in explaining a <hi>mystery</hi> spoken of in Scripture, but not much for your comfort, it is a <hi>mystery of Iniquity.</hi> But in good earnest, do you think <hi>That God hath promised a living and infallible Judge to make us certain of the sense of obscure places in Scripture?</hi> Then two things will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow from thence. 1. That it must be necessary, that all those that believe this <hi>infallible Judge</hi> must know the certain <hi>sense</hi> of these <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure places.</hi> 2. That this infallible <hi>Judge</hi> must give the certain sense of these places. But then, Why hath your <hi>present Church</hi> so neglected her <hi>Talent</hi> this way, that she hath not decided all the Controversies concerning the <hi>difficiliora loca.</hi> Such a <hi>Commentary</hi> as this were worth inquiring after. But yet, supposing your <hi>Church</hi> had done this, Could we be more certain of the <hi>sense</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> then we are now of the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your <hi>Church</hi> so charitable, as to put so useful a thing in writing, for the general good of the world: But <hi>all Writings</hi> (you tell us) <hi>are obscure, and want a living Judge to interpret them</hi>; and so consequently must that, and so in <hi>infinitum.</hi> But 4. All this while it is worth understanding, how you preferr the <hi>Scripture before the Church,</hi> when you make the <hi>Church the living and infallible Judge,</hi> to interpret the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> You make the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

               <p>It is next to be considered, what <hi>respect</hi> remains <hi>due</hi> to <hi>general Councils,</hi> if the <hi>present Church</hi> be supposed infallible.<note place="margin">¬ß. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>For</hi> (say you) <hi>though you willingly submit to them all,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 61.</note> 
                  <hi>yet where they happen to be obscure in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Determination, we seek the assistance and direction of the same living infallible Rule,</hi> viz. <hi>the Tradition, or the Sentence of the present Church.</hi> But 1. You say, <hi>You submit to them all:</hi> but, Do you submit to them all as <hi>infallible,</hi> or no? which you must of necessity do, or else apparently contradict your self (which yet is no novelty for you to do) for you spend a great deal of pains to prove <hi>general Councils infallible</hi>; and therefore I hope you own them as <hi>infallible</hi> your self. If you own them to be <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> what need of the sentence of the <hi>present Church,</hi> as to those <hi>Decrees</hi> which you already acknowledge infallible. Or, do you really own them no further to be <hi>infallible,</hi> than as they agree with the sentence of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church?</hi> and then, I pray, What doth the pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>general Councils</hi> signifie, if your <hi>Church</hi> give all the Authority to them? And what consents with your <hi>Church</hi> is infallible, and what doth not, is far from being so. 2. You say, <hi>General Councils may happen to be obscure in matters requiring Determination</hi>; Do you mean, in <hi>things decreed</hi> by them or not? If not, it is no wonder if they be obscure in matters they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meddle with; therefore, I suppose, you mean in <hi>things determined</hi> by them. Then I further ask, Whether these <hi>Decrees of general Councils,</hi> were the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>present Church,</hi> to those who lived in the time of those <hi>Councils?</hi> If they were, How could the Sentence of the <hi>present Church</hi> declare and determine the sense of what is <hi>obscure in Scripture,</hi> if, notwithstanding this Determination, the Sentence of the <hi>Church</hi> remains as <hi>obscure,</hi> as the <hi>sense of the Scripture? If it was not obscure then, but is so now,</hi> Whence comes that <hi>obscurity?</hi> the Sentence of the <hi>Council</hi> is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be written then, that those who were not present at it might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Decree</hi> of it; and it is supposed we have the very same <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical Decrees of Councils,</hi> which they had who lived in the several <hi>Ages</hi> of them. How come they then to be more obscure to us, than they were to them? 3. What do you mean by matters <hi>requiring Determination?</hi> Is it not enough that things be infallibly determined once, but they must be determined over again. If the former <hi>Determination</hi> were <hi>infallible,</hi> what need any more? or doth the <hi>Infallibility</hi> cease as soon as the <hi>Church</hi> ceaseth to be the <hi>present Church,</hi> and then that which comes to be the <hi>present
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101069:87"/>
Church,</hi> must convey an <hi>Infallibility</hi> into it; but how comes any thing which was once infallible, to <hi>lose</hi> its <hi>Infallibility?</hi> which is a thing really so <hi>obscure,</hi> that your present Church would do well to help us out in it. But if, notwithstanding all your pretence of the Infallibility of <hi>general Councils,</hi> nothing is truly to be owned as such, but what agrees with the Sentence of the <hi>present Church,</hi> then we plainly see, what reverence you shew to all <hi>general Councils,</hi> even as much as the <hi>present Church</hi> will let you, and no more, which, supposing it never so great, is not shewed to the <hi>Councils,</hi> but to your <hi>Church.</hi> For, the reason of that <hi>Reverence</hi> cannot be resolved into the <hi>Councils,</hi> but into that <hi>Church</hi> for whose sake you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence them. And thus it evidently appears, That <hi>the cunning of this device</hi> is wholly your own, and notwithstanding these miserable shifts, you do finally resolve all Authorities of the <hi>Fathers, Councils,</hi> and <hi>Scriptures,</hi> into the Authority of the <hi>present Roman-Church</hi>; which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Absurdity</hi> consequent from hence,<note place="margin">¬ß. 22.</note> which the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> chargeth your party with, is, <hi>That by this means they ascribe as great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (if not greater) to a part of the Catholick Church, as to the whole, which we believe in our Creed; and which is the Societie of all Christians. And this is full of Absurdity in nature, in reason, in all things, that any part should be of equal worth, power, credit, or authority with the whole.</hi> Here you deny the Consequence, which, you say, <hi>depends upon his Lordships wilfully mistaken Notion of the Catholick Church; which he saith, Is the Church we believe in our Creed, and is the Society of all Christians; which (you call) a most desperate extension of the Church</hi>; because thereby (forsooth) it will appear, that a part is not so great as the whole, <hi>viz. that the Roman-Church, in her full latitude, is but a piece or parcel of the Catholick Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in our Creed.</hi> Is this all the desperate <hi>Absurdity,</hi> which follows from his Lordships Answer? I pray, shew it to have any thing tending to an <hi>Absurdity</hi> in it? And though you confidently tell us, <hi>That the Roman-Church, taken as comprizing all Christians that are in her Communion, is the sole and whole Catholick Church</hi>; yet I will contentedly put the whole issue of the cause upon the proof of this one Proposition, that the <hi>Roman-Church</hi> in its largest sense, <hi>is the sole and whole Catholick Church</hi>; or that the <hi>present Roman-Church</hi> is a sound member of <hi>the Catholick Church.</hi> Your evidence from <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> is such as I fear not to follow you in; but, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, have a care of treading too near the <hi>Apostles heels:</hi> That <hi>any were accounted Catholicks meerly for their Communion with the Roman-Church</hi>; or <hi>that any were condemned for Heresie or Schism purely for their dissent from it</hi>; prove it when you please, I shall be ready (God willing) to attend your Motions. But it is alwaies your faculty, when a thing needs proving most, to tell us what you <hi>could have done</hi>: This, you say, <hi>You would have proved at large, if his Lordship had any more than supposed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>: But your Readers will think, that his Supposition, being grounded on such a Maxim of Reason, as that, mentioned by him, it had been your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent business to have proved it: but I commend your prudence in adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and, I suppose, you will do it, as the <hi>Court of Areopagus</hi> used to do hard causes, <hi>in diem longissimum.</hi> It is apparent, <hi>the Bishop speaks not of a part of the Church by representation of the whole,</hi> which is an objection no body but your self would here have fancied; and therefore your Instance of a <hi>Parliament</hi> is nothing to the purpose, unless you will suppose, that <hi>Councils in the Church</hi> do represent in such a manner as <hi>Parliaments in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101069:88"/>
England</hi> do; and that their decision is obligatory in the same way as <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> are: if you believe this to be good <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I will be content to take the Objecters place, and make the <hi>Application.</hi>

You tell us, <hi>You use all these helps:</hi> but to what purpose do you use them? Do you by them prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church?</hi> If not, the same Absurdity lyes at your door still, of proving <hi>idem per idem.</hi> No, <hi>that you do not,</hi> you say?

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 23.</note>But yet we have two Auxiliaries more in the field, call'd <hi>Instances.</hi> The design of your first <hi>Instance,</hi> is, to shew, <hi>That if your Church be guilty of proving</hi> idem per idem, <hi>the Apostolical Church was so too.</hi> For you tell us, <hi>That a Sectary might, in the Apostles times, have argued against the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church, by the very same method his Lordship here uses against the present Catholick Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 62, 63 n. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>For, if you ask the Christians then, Why they believe the whole Doctrine of the Apostles, to be the sole true Catholick Faith, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, Because it is agreeable to the Doctrine of Christ. If you ask them, How they know it to be so, they will produce the words, sentences, and works of Christ, who taught it. But, if you ask a third time, By what means they are assured, that those Testimonies do indeed make for them or their cause, or are really the Testimonies and Doctrine of Christ, they will not then have recourse to those Testimonies or Doctrine, but their Answer is, They know it to be so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the present Apostolick Church doth witness it. And so by consequence prove</hi> idem per idem. <hi>Thus the Sectary.</hi> I know not whether your facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be better at framing Questions or Answers to them; I am sure it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary at both. Is it not enough to be in a <hi>Circle</hi> your selves, but you must needs bring the <hi>Apostles</hi> into it too? at least, if you may have the management of their Doctrine, you would do it. The short Answer to all this, is, That the ground why the <hi>Christians</hi> did assent to the <hi>Apostles Doctrine,</hi> as true, was, because <hi>God</hi> gave sufficient evidence, that their <hi>Testimony was infallible</hi>; in such things where such <hi>Infallibility</hi> was requisite. For you had told us before, That the <hi>Apostles did confirm their words with signs that followed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>by which signs all their hearers were bound to submit themselves unto them, and to acknowledge their words for infallible Oracles of Truth.</hi> Was not here then sufficient ground for assent in the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> to the <hi>Apostles Doctrine?</hi> Not as you weakly imagine, because the <hi>Doctrine of the Apostles</hi> was suitable to the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi>;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:101069:88"/>
for the ground why they assented to the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> was, because of the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And therefore, to say, They believed the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> because it was agreeable to the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> and then that they believed the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> because it was suitable to the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> is a <hi>Circle</hi> fit for none but your self, and that silly person of your own moulding, whom you call the <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It were worth considering too, <hi>How the works of Christ could prove the Doctrine of the Apostles suitable to his own.</hi> I had thought <hi>Christs works</hi> had proved his own <hi>Testimony</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> and not the <hi>Apostles Doctrine</hi> to be consonant to his: The <hi>works of Christ</hi> shew us the reason, why he was to be believed in what he delivered; and did not the <hi>works of the Apostles</hi> do so too? What need then any rational person enquire further, why the <hi>Apostles Doctrine</hi> was to be believed? Was it not on the same account that the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi> was to be believed? But, say you, <hi>How should you know their Doctrine was the same.</hi> What, do you want an infallible Testimony for this too? or, do you believe that <hi>God</hi> can contradict himself; or that <hi>Christ</hi> should send such to deliver his <hi>Doctrine</hi> to the world, and attest it with <hi>miracles</hi> who should falsifie and corrupt it? Now, you will say, <hi>I am come over to you, and answer as you do, that the Apostles Testimony was to be believed, because of the pregnant and convincing Motives of Credibility.</hi> This, I grant; but must be excused as to what follows, That <hi>these same Motives moved the Primitive Christians, and us, in our respective times, to believe the Church.</hi> Prove but that, and I yield the cause. But till then, I pray, give us leave to believe that still you prove <hi>idem per idem</hi>; and your Answers are like your Proofs; for this we have had often already, and have sufficiently examined before: as likewise your other <hi>Coccysm</hi> about the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> and <hi>certain inducements</hi> to accept the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>; which I shall not think worth repeating, till you think what I have said against it before, worth answering.</p>
               <p>Your second Instance is, <hi>ad hominem</hi>; whereby you would prove, <hi>That if he acknowledge the Church infallible in Fundamentals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>he must prove</hi> idem per idem, <hi>as much as you do. For</hi> (say you) <hi>if he be demanded a reason why he believes such Points as he calls Fundamental, his Answer is, because they are agreeable to the Doctrine of Christ. If he be asked, How he knows them to be so, he will, no doubt, produce the words, sentences and works of Christ, who taught the said Fundamental Points. But, if he be asked a third time, By what means he is assured, that these Testimonies do make for him, then he will not have recourse to the words themselves,</hi> i. e. <hi>to the Bible, but his final Answer will be, He knows them to be so, and that they do make for him, because the present Church doth infallibly witness so much from Tradition, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Tradition, which is</hi> (say you) <hi>to prove</hi> idem per idem, <hi>as much as we.</hi> Things are not alwaies just as you would have them: If we allow you to make both Objections and Answers for us, no doubt you are guilty of no Absurdity so great, but we shall be equally guilty of it. But, it is the nature both of your <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> not to be able to stand a <hi>Tryal</hi>: but however, they must undergo it. I say then, that granting the <hi>Church infallible</hi> in the belief of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> it doth not follow that we must prove <hi>idem per idem,</hi> as you do. For, when we ask you, Why you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your Doctrine to be the <hi>sole Catholick Faith,</hi> your final Answer is, because <hi>your Church is infallible</hi>; which is answering by the very <hi>thing</hi> in Question, for you have no other way to judge of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> but by the <hi>Infallibility of your Church</hi>; but when you ask us, Why we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve such an Article to be <hi>Fundamental</hi>; as for Instance, <hi>That Christ will
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101069:89"/>
give Eternal Life to them that obey him,</hi> we answer, not because the <hi>Church,</hi> which is infallible in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> delivers it to be so, which were answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>idem per idem</hi>; but we appeal to that common reason which is in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, Whether, if the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> be true, this can be other than a <hi>Fundamental Article</hi> of it; it being that, without which the whole design of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> comes to nothing. Therefore you much mistake, when you think we resolve our Faith of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>infallible Witness</hi> of them; for, though the <hi>Church</hi> may be <hi>infallible</hi> in the belief of all things <hi>Fundamental</hi> (for otherwise it were not a <hi>Church,</hi> if it did not believe them) it doth not thence necessarily follow, That the <hi>Church</hi> must <hi>infallibly witness</hi> what is <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and what not. It is sufficient that the <hi>Church</hi> doth deliver from the consent of universal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that <hi>infallible Rule of Faith</hi> (which, to be sure, contains all things Fundamental in it) though she never meddle with the deciding what Points are <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and what not. If you therefore ask me, Why I believe any Point supposed <hi>Fundamental,</hi> I answer, By all the evidence which assures me, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> containing that Point, is of <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>; If you aske me, How I know that this <hi>Point</hi> is part of that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> I appeal to the <hi>common sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of the world, as to things plainly <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and therefore by this means your third Question is prevented, <hi>How I know this to be the meaning of those words</hi>; for, I suppose, no one that can tell, that two and two make four, can question but if the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi> be true, the belief of it is necessary to Salvation, which is it we mean by <hi>Fundamental.</hi> Either therefore prove it necessary, that the <hi>Church</hi> must <hi>infallibly witness</hi> what is <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and what not; and that we must rely on such a Testimony in the <hi>belief</hi> of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> or you prove nothing at all to your purpose, no more than your convincing <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility,</hi> which, were they made into a <hi>grand Sallad,</hi> would know the way to the <hi>Table,</hi> they are served so often up: But, I have found them so dry, and insipid already, I have no encouragement to venture on them any more.</p>
               <p>But, still you are deservedly afraid we should not think worthily enough of your Churches Infallibility.<note place="margin">¬ß. 24.</note> You therefore tell us very wisely, that this Infallibility is not a thing,<note place="margin">P. 63. l. 50.</note> that is not infallible; <hi>For,</hi> say you, <hi>Which Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility must come from the Holy Ghost, and be more than humane or moral, and therefore must be truly supernatural, &amp;c.</hi> It is well you tell us of such a rare distinction of Infallibility; for else, I assure you, we had never thought of it, <hi>viz.</hi> of an <hi>Infallibility that may be deceived,</hi> and an <hi>Infallibility that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived,</hi> or, in your words, a <hi>humane and moral Infallibility,</hi> and a <hi>supernatural divine Infallibility.</hi> To ease you therefore of your fears, I so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promise you, that when I believe your <hi>Church infallible,</hi> I will not believe it to have a <hi>humane, moral Infallibility,</hi> but <hi>supernatural and divine.</hi> That is, when I believe her infallible, I believe her infallible. Your mind being eased of this grand fear, you think all the difficulty is over, and that you are out of any possibility of a <hi>Circle</hi>; but, I have endeavoured before to shew, you are not infallible in that: For the charge you exhibit against the <hi>Bishop, as though you had left him tumbling in the Circle you had so easily got out of</hi>; I shall consider it in its due time and place; but, if one may guess at being in a <hi>Circle</hi> by <hi>tumbling,</hi> you will not seem very free from it, who seem to be at very little ease by your impatience of being held to the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> in hand.</p>
               <p>Well, but yet our Conceptions must once more be rectified as to the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101069:89"/>
nature of this Infallibility; before our danger was least, we should have believed it <hi>to be only a humane, moral, and not supernatural Infallibility,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 64. n. 6.</note> and now <hi>we are bid have a care lest we think it to be any more, than in a sort, and in some manner divine.</hi> But, what kind of transcendental thing is this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility? It is not <hi>humane,</hi> nor yet <hi>divine,</hi> and yet it is <hi>supernatural</hi>; which is scarce <hi>in some sort,</hi> or <hi>in a manner</hi> sense. How comes it to be <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural,</hi> if it be not <hi>divine?</hi> Or, is it <hi>naturally supernatural,</hi> and <hi>humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divine?</hi> It must not then be called <hi>divine,</hi> but, <hi>in a manner,</hi> and <hi>after a sort: But yet</hi> (say you) <hi>so far as concerns precise Infallibility, or certain Connexion with Truth, it is so truly supernatural and certain, that in this respect it yields nothing to the Scripture it self.</hi> These are your own words: And if you did not believe <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> I should think this the greatest <hi>non-sense</hi> in the world. But, What doth that <hi>Infallibility</hi> which is more than <hi>in a sort divine,</hi> import beyond what you assert doth belong to the Church? Is that any more than <hi>precise Infallibility,</hi> and <hi>certain Connexion with Truth,</hi> and such as is in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and all this your <hi>Church</hi> hath, and yet, when we say so, she drops a <hi>Court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sie,</hi> and cryes, <hi>No, forsooth, though she be infallible,</hi> yet she desires to be excused, <hi>she is not infallible, but only as if one should say in a manner, and after a sort, and so forth.</hi> Just as if one should ask a new married woman, Whether she were <hi>certainly</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to such a man, and she should answer <hi>as to what concerns marrying, she was certainly married,</hi> but yet she was not <hi>absolutely married,</hi> but only <hi>in a manner, and after a sort.</hi> This is so great a mystery, you will oblige the world much to inform it a little more fully in these following Questions, What kind of <hi>Infallibility</hi> that is, which is <hi>supernatural,</hi> and <hi>by the assistance of the Holy Ghost, which is equal to the Scripture it self in point of Certainty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> (your own words) and yet is <hi>divine,</hi> but <hi>in a manner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 64. l. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>and after a sort:</hi> And what way we should come to understand <hi>that manner and sort,</hi> and what <hi>degrees</hi> and <hi>sorts</hi> there are in <hi>Infallibility?</hi> Whether any thing, so far as it is <hi>infallible,</hi> be not <hi>absolutely,</hi> as well as <hi>precisely infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi>; and whether that which is but <hi>in a sort divine,</hi> be not <hi>in a sort not divine</hi>; Whether that which is <hi>in a sort not divine,</hi> be not likewise in the <hi>same sort not infallible</hi> (since all this Infallibility, by your own Confession, is from the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>) and whether this be not an excellent way <hi>in a manner,</hi> and <hi>after a sort,</hi> to reconcile Contradictions. For, if a man should ask you, Whether one might be, and not be, at the same time; you might easily tell him, That <hi>absolutely</hi> and <hi>precisely</hi> he cannot be, and not be; but <hi>in a manner,</hi> and <hi>after a sort,</hi> he may be, and not be, together. You have cause therefore to make much of this distinction, and you never need fear baffling, as long as you carry it about with you; it is a most excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative against all the <hi>batteries of sense and reason.</hi> But lest yet, for all this, we should apprehend something by this <hi>in a manner,</hi> and <hi>after a sort,</hi> as though they were some odd diminishing terms: You tell us, <hi>No; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Divines, by this manner of speaking, do not intend to deny the Church to be equal even to Scripture it self in point of Certainty and Infallibility.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> What is now become of our <hi>manner and sort,</hi> when the <hi>Church</hi> dares <hi>justle</hi> with the <hi>Scripture</hi> for the <hi>upper hand,</hi> at least for an equal place as to <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> What then is the intent of this distinction? <hi>It is to shew the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Scripture above the Definitions of the Church.</hi> This doth well how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to follow the rest, it comes so near to a contradiction, for if the <hi>Church</hi> be equal to <hi>Scripture</hi> in point of Certainty and Infallibility, What prerogative can be left to the <hi>Scripture</hi> above the <hi>Church?</hi> when that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101069:90"/>
which makes it Scripture, and the Rule of Faith is only its <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility?</hi> Yes, you tell us, <hi>The Scripture doth much exceed the Church in regard of its larger extent of Truth: because there not only every reason, but every word and tittle is matter of Faith; but in the Definitions of the Church, neither the arguments, reasons, nor words, are absolutely speaking matters of Faith, but only the thing declared to be such.</hi> Excellent good still, and all of a piece! I commend you, that you would not offer to mix any thing of <hi>sense</hi> in so good a discourse: For 1. How comes the <hi>Scripture</hi> to have a larger <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> than the <hi>Church,</hi> if we cannot know what <hi>Truth</hi> is in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but from the <hi>Church?</hi> 2. How <hi>every word and tittle</hi> comes to be <hi>matter of Faith in Scripture,</hi> and not in the <hi>Church,</hi> when you say, The <hi>Church</hi> is equal to the <hi>Scripture</hi> in point of <hi>Certainty and Infallibility?</hi> 3. How any <hi>word and tittle</hi> can be any where a <hi>matter of Faith?</hi> I had thought, it had been the <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>thing</hi> understood by those <hi>words,</hi> had been <hi>matters of Faith</hi>; and then it is all one with the <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> for you say, as to the <hi>Church,</hi> the thing declared is a <hi>matter of Faith?</hi> 4. What that thing is, which is declared by the <hi>Church,</hi> which is neither <hi>arguments, reasons nor words</hi>; and if it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of these, how one can be believed, and not the other: Doth your <hi>Church</hi> declare things so <hi>nakedly</hi> as to do it <hi>without arguments, reasons or words? That she can do it without words,</hi> it is hard to believe, but very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, that she can do it without <hi>arguments or reasons.</hi> 5. Are men bound to believe what she so declares, <hi>without arguments and reasons</hi> too? If they be, shew whence that <hi>Obligation</hi> comes; and when you attempt that, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shew some <hi>argument and reason</hi> why they should believe it. 6. What do you mean, that <hi>these arguments, reasons and words, are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely speaking matters of Faith,</hi> it should seem then, that <hi>conditionally</hi> they may be so, and then shew the difference between them, and those in <hi>Scripture.</hi> 7. How is it possible for us to assent to any thing as <hi>a matter of Faith,</hi> if we do not first <hi>assent</hi> to the <hi>arguments, reasons and words,</hi> by which you would perswade us to believe the thing to be declared by the <hi>Church,</hi> and what is declared by the <hi>Church</hi> is true. 8. Whether, when you say, <hi>That in the Scripture every word and tittle is matter of Faith, at least implicitely, and necessarily to be believed by all that knew it to be a part of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>; this will not equally hold as to the <hi>Church</hi> too, that <hi>every word and tittle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>is matter of Faith, at least implicitely to all that know it to be a part of the Churches Definition?</hi> And where then lyes the prerogative of <hi>Scripture</hi> above the <hi>Church?</hi> Besides, you tell us, <hi>The Church hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limits, and can define nothing, but what was either revealed before, or hath such connexion with it, as it may be rationally and logically deduced from it, as appertaining to the Declaration and Defence of that which was before revealed.</hi> That herein you consult much for the honour of the <hi>Scripture</hi> above the <hi>Church,</hi> will appear when you have answered these <hi>Queries.</hi> 1. When the belief and sense of <hi>Scripture</hi> depend according to you, upon the <hi>Churches</hi> Testimony, Whether hath more limits, the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Scripture?</hi> For, whatever is in <hi>Scripture,</hi> must as to us ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e its <hi>Authority</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi>; and therefore your <hi>Church</hi> sets what bounds she please as to things revealed in Scripture. 2. Who shall be Judge, whether your <hi>Church</hi> define nothing but what was revealed before, when, according to you, we can have no assurance as to any <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> but from the <hi>Judgement</hi> of your <hi>Church?</hi> 3. When your <hi>Church</hi> defines things to be <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> which we think are not only <hi>not logically and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101069:90"/>
rationally deduced from Scripture, but plainly repugnant to it.</hi> How can we believe that she doth not pretend to reveal something which was not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi> before? 4. Is that <hi>rational and logical deduction from Scripture</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to perswade any rational man or no? If not, Why use you those terms? if it be, What need your <hi>Churches Definition,</hi> in a thing that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to any ones reason? 5. Must we believe your <hi>Church absolutely,</hi> as to what is <hi>rationally and logically deduced</hi> from Scripture? If so, then, when she declares her own <hi>Infallibility,</hi> we must believe that to be <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deduced,</hi> because she declares it. 6. Doth your <hi>Church</hi> make use of <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> in her deductions? then, Why may not every one else, unless she hath only the gift of <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> which, I suppose, you will say, is but <hi>in a manner, and after a sort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, say you, <hi>The Church hath the receiving and interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for its end; and consequently is in that respect inferiour to it.</hi> But, for <hi>whose end</hi> do you mean? the <hi>Churches,</hi> or the <hi>Scriptures end?</hi> If the <hi>latter</hi>; Shew us how any <hi>end</hi> of Scripture is attained by your <hi>Churches interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; if you mean the <hi>Churches end,</hi> I verily believe you; that your <hi>Church</hi> pretends to the receiving and interpreting <hi>Scripture</hi> for <hi>her own ends,</hi> and consequently, in that respect,<note place="margin">P. 64<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </note> she makes the <hi>Scripture</hi> inferiour to <hi>her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here again we meet with another piece of your <hi>Errantry,</hi> in attempting to vindicate your Doctrine from the <hi>enchantment</hi> of another <hi>contradiction. You say, You hold it necessary, that we are to believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God upon Divine Authority</hi>; and yet, you tell us<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
                  <hi>That the Churches Authority, on which we are to believe the Scriptures is but in some sort, and after a manner Divine.</hi> This seems to have a huge resemblance to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; or else you must say, That it is not necessary that we believe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> on a <hi>simply Divine Authority,</hi> but only on such a one as is <hi>in some sort,</hi> and <hi>after a manner Divine:</hi> For, if you make the same Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be <hi>Divine absolutely</hi> in your pretence, and only <hi>after a sort</hi> in your Application you reach not the thing you promised. If there be not, as you say, <hi>any necessity of defending the Churches Authority to be simply Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, in answering that Question, How we know Scripture to be Scripture,</hi> then there can be no necessity of asserting, that we are bound to believe the <hi>Scriptures to be the Word of God upon Divine Authority?</hi> Which yet is your assertion before; but yet you would fain distinguish <hi>between<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that which is absolutely infallible and divine, the Churches Authority</hi> (you say) <hi>must be the former, but cannot be the latter</hi>; when yet this Infallibility is, as you again tell us, <hi>By the promised assistance of the Holy Ghost.</hi> These are fit hedges to keep in <hi>Cuckows,</hi> but none else.<note place="margin">¬ß. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But, as you are still off and on, sometimes seeming to go forward, and then stepping back again; sometimes answering, sometimes proving, which are great arguments of a disturbed mind, or a being in a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> which you take many steps in, but can find no way out of, lest you should seem not sufficiently to contradict your self: You go about to prove, <hi>That the Authority, teaching Scripture to be the Word of God, must be absolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>; If you prove that, I will undertake to prove it must <hi>be simply Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:</hi> But, let us see however, how irrefragably you prove it.<note place="margin">P. 65 l. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>And the immediate Reason, Why the Authority teaching Scripture to be the Word of God, must be absolutely infallible, is, because it is an Article of Christian Faith, that all those Books which the Church hath defined for Canonical Scripture, are the Word of God; and seeing every Article of Faith must be revealed, or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101069:91"/>
taught by Divine Authority, this also must be revealed, and consequently no Authority less than Divine, is sufficient to move us to believe it as an Article of Faith.</hi> But 1. Is it not possible for you to utter so many words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a contradiction? Were you not just before distinguishing that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is <hi>Divine,</hi> from that which is <hi>absolutely infallible</hi>; and but <hi>in a manner, and after a sort Divine?</hi> And yet here, that <hi>Authority</hi> which you call <hi>absolutely infallible,</hi> in the former part of your Argument; in the last you explain it, <hi>No Authority less than Divine</hi>; Doth it not then follow, that an Authority <hi>absolutely infallible,</hi> is an Authority <hi>no less than Divine.</hi> But to let that pass among the rest of his Brethren. 2. Why take you this needless pains to prove that which you say before, <hi>You and your Adversary are agreed in.</hi> 3. Supposing you should meet with some who should que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion this, as it is probable you may do before we part; I think it no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing to answer this Argument of yours, which, in short, is, <hi>Every Article of Faith must be believed upon Divine Authority, but that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the Word of God, is an Article of Faith.</hi> To which I answer, If by <hi>an Article of Faith,</hi> you mean, that we must give an <hi>undoubted assent</hi> to, then I grant, that this is <hi>an Article of Faith,</hi> but deny, that every such <hi>Article</hi> must be believed upon <hi>Divine Authority</hi>; if by an <hi>Article of Faith</hi> you mean something to be believed upon <hi>Divine Testimony,</hi> then I grant, that every such <hi>Article</hi> must be built on <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> but shall desire you to prove, that that <hi>Faith</hi> whereby I believe <hi>Scripture to be Scripture,</hi> must be built on a <hi>Divine Testimony.</hi> For, I cannot see, how any, who say so, can free themselves from a <hi>Circle</hi>: and of all persons, you have the least reason to say so; for you deny the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> to be properly <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> and withall the Argument is very easily retorted upon your self. For, say you, <hi>Whatsoever is an Article of Faith, must be believed on Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but that the Church is infallible, I suppose, to you is an Article of Faith:</hi> Name therefore what Divine Authority the belief of that is built upon? But, Do not you say, the belief of that is built on the <hi>Motives of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and, I suppose, you distinguish them from <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> or else they can do you no service for avoiding the <hi>Circle:</hi> Either therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that <hi>your Churches Infallibility</hi> is <hi>an Article of Faith,</hi> or else deny it to be necessary, that <hi>every Article of Faith,</hi> must be built on <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> and then farewell your <hi>old friends</hi> the <hi>Motives</hi> of Credibility; or else, you see, how necessary it is for you, if you will vindicate your self from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to answer this Argument, and when you have done so, you will believe I did not much dread the force of it. The rest of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, is a bare Repetition, the fourth or fifth time of your distinction about the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>infallible Assurance</hi> of it, which is a thing in it self so incongruous, and unreasonable, that I had thoughts mean enough of you,<note place="margin">P. 64 n. 6.</note> when I met with it first; but have much meaner, now I meet with it so often, for I see, as pitiful a shift as it is, you have no other to make use of on all occasions.</p>
               <p>His Lordship goes on to prove that, since it is confessed between him and his Adversary, <hi>That we must be able to prove the Scriptures to be the Word of God, by some Authority that is absolutely Divine; this Authority cannot be that of the Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 65.</note> 
                  <hi>For the Church consists of men subject to errour; and all the parts being all liable to mistaking, and fallible, the whole cannot possibly be infallible in and of it self, and priviledged from being deceived in some things or other.</hi> To this you answer, <hi>His Lordship's Argument (that the whole may erre, because every part may erre) is disproved by himself; because in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101069:91"/>
he grants the whole Church cannot erre, and yet that any particular man may erre even in those points.</hi> But, is it not plain, that his Lordship's design is to prove, that if all the <hi>parts are fallible,</hi> the Authority of the <hi>whole</hi> cannot be <hi>simply Divine</hi>; and therefore he saith himself, that in <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,</hi> in which the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> cannot erre, her Authority is <hi>not Divine,</hi> because the <hi>Church</hi> is tyed to the use of means. You must therefore prove, that when every <hi>part</hi> is acknowledged <hi>fallible,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>whole</hi> in propounding any thing to be believed, can be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> in and of it self: I cannot therefore understand, how the perfection of Infallibility in the proposition of any Object to be believed, can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the whole Church, when every particular member of it in such a <hi>Proposition</hi> is supposed to be fallible. <hi>The Arch-Bishop therefore tells you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 65.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is special immediate Revelation requisite to the very least degree of Divine Authority</hi>; to avoid which, <hi>you would fain prove, that there may be absolute Infallibility, without Divine Authority, and immediate Assistance of the Holy Ghost, in delivering Objects of Faith, without immediate Revelation.</hi> You tell us therefore, <hi>Though the Church use means, yet she receives not her Infallibility from them, but from the Assistance of the Holy Ghost, which makes her Definitions truly infallible, though they be not new Revelations.</hi> But, How do you prove, that any thing but an <hi>immediate Divine Revelation,</hi> can make such a <hi>Divine Testimony</hi> which is supposed necessary for the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Scripture to be Scripture?</hi> How can you make it appear, that there can be <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> where there was not <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> in judging of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Premises?</hi> You say, <hi>By the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Holy Ghost.</hi> But why should you not believe such an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siance in the <hi>one,</hi> as well as the <hi>other?</hi> If therefore you assert, that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth not assist infallibly in the <hi>use of the means,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>conclusion,</hi> then it must be an <hi>immediate Revelation</hi>; for what else it should be, is not intelligible. For, I had thought the <hi>Revelation</hi> had been <hi>immediate,</hi> when somewhat more was discovered than all <hi>use of means</hi> could attain to: therefore the Churches <hi>Infallibility</hi> must be a meer <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> No, say you, <hi>Because it only declares what was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly revealed.</hi> Though that be a Question among some of your selves; yet, supposing it to be so, it clears not the business. For, suppose that <hi>God</hi> had <hi>supernaturally assisted</hi> the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> of any <hi>Prophet</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring a Prophecy which had been revealed before, Would not this have been as immediate a <hi>Revelation</hi> to that <hi>Prophet,</hi> as if it had been a <hi>New Prophecy:</hi> And the case is the same here; for, though you say, the <hi>Material Objects of Faith</hi> be revealed before, yet we cannot know the <hi>Formal Object of Faith,</hi> without your <hi>Churches</hi> declaration, so that on your Principles there cannot lye an Obligation to Faith on us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your <hi>Churches Definition</hi>; and therefore that is as necessary <hi>to us,</hi> as immediate Revelation; and to the <hi>Church it self,</hi> when you say, <hi>The Infallibility proceeds so immediately from God, that if the Church should fall into errour, that would be ascribed to God as much as in case of Divine Revelation,</hi> What difference can you make between them? For, it is not, Whether the <hi>Object</hi> be new or old, which makes an <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation</hi>; but the <hi>immediate Impression</hi> of it on the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? For if the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth immediately discover to any one, a thing knowable by natural causes, is it any thing the less an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Divine Revelation? So it must be in things already revealed, if the same <hi>things</hi> be discovered in an <hi>immediate infallible manner</hi> to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101069:92"/>
the mind of any, the Revelation is as immediate as if they had never been revealed before.</p>
               <p>Your last <hi>Paragraph</hi> affords us still more evidence of your <hi>self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting</hi> faculty; for which we need no more than lay your words together. Your words next before were, <hi>If the Church should fall into errour, it would be as much ascribed to God himself, as in case of immediate Divine Revelation</hi>; but here you add; <hi>Neither is it necessary for us to affirm, that the Definition of the Church, is God's immediate Revelation; as, if the Definition were false, God's Revelation must be also such: It is enough for us to averr, that God's Promise would be infringed, as truly it would in that Supposition.</hi> From which we may learn very useful instructions. 1. That <hi>God's Promise</hi> may he <hi>infringed,</hi> and yet <hi>God's Revelation</hi> not proved to be <hi>false</hi>: But whence came that Promise? Was it not a <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> if it was undoubtedly such, Can such a Promise be false, and not <hi>God's Revelation?</hi> 2. That though if the <hi>Church erre, God</hi> must be <hi>fallible,</hi> yet for all this, all <hi>God's Revelations</hi> may remain <hi>infallible.</hi> 3. That though the only ground of <hi>Infallibility be the immediate As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Holy Ghost,</hi> which gives as great an <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as ever was in <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi>; yet we must not say, That such an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility doth suppose an <hi>immediate Revelation.</hi> 4. That though <hi>God's Veracity</hi> would be destroyed, if the <hi>Church</hi> should define any thing for a point of <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> which were not revealed from <hi>God,</hi> which are your next words; yet we are not to think, if her Definition be false, <hi>God's Revelation</hi> must be also such, which are your words fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going. Those are excellent <hi>Corollaries</hi> to conclude so profound a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with. And, <hi>if the Bishop</hi> (as you say) <hi>had little reason to accuse you for maintaining a party</hi>; I am sure, I have less to admire you, for <hi>your seeking Truth; and what ever animosity you are led by,</hi> I hope I have made it evident, <hi>you are led by very little reason.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the unwritten Word, and the necessary Ingredients of it. The Instances for it particularly examined and disproved. The Fathers Rule for examining Traditions. No unwritten Word the Foundation of Divine Faith. In what sense Faith may be said to be Divine. Of Tradition being known by its own light, and the Canon of the Scripture. The Testimony of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, how far pertinent to this Controversie. Of the use of reason in the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Faith. <hi>T.C'<hi rend="sup">s.</hi>
                     </hi> Dialogue answered, with another between himself and a Sceptick. A twofold resolution of Faith into the Doctrine, and into the Books. Several Objections answered from the Supposition made of a Child brought up without sight of Scripture. Christ no Ignoramus nor Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor though the Church be not infallible. <hi>T.C'<hi rend="sup">s.</hi>
                     </hi> Blasphemy in saying otherwise. The Testimonies of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin</hi> examined and retorted. Of the nature of infallible Certainty, as to the Canon of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and whereon it is grounded. The Testimonies produced by his Lordship vindicated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu begin this <hi>Chapter</hi> with as much confidence,<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> as if you had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nothing but <hi>Oracles</hi> in the foregoing. <hi>Whether the Bishop or you were more hardly put to it,</hi> let any indifferent Reader judge: If he did, as you say, <hi>tread on the brink of a Circle</hi>; we have made it appear, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all your evasions, that you are left in the middle of it. The reason of his falling on the unwritten Word, <hi>is not his fear of stooping to the Church, to shew it him, and finally depend on her Authority</hi>; but to shew the unreasonableness of your proceedings, who talk much of an unwritten Word, and are not able to prove any such thing. <hi>If he will not believe any unwritten Word, but what is shewn him delivered by the Prophets and Apostles,</hi> I think he hath a great deal of reason for such incredulity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you could shew him some assurance of any unwritten Word, that did not come from the <hi>Apostles.</hi> Though he desired <hi>not to read unwritten Words in their Books,</hi> which is a wise Question you ask; yet he reasonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested some certain evidence of what you pretend to be so, that he might not have so big a Faith as to swallow into his belief, that every thing which his adversary saies is the <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> is so indeed. <hi>If it be not your desire he should,</hi> we have the greater hopes of satisfaction from you; but if you crave <hi>the indifferent Reader's Patience, till he hear reason from you,</hi> I am afraid his patience will be tyred, before you come to it. But, whatever it is, it must be examined.</p>
               <p>Though your discourse concerning this <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> be as the rest are, very confused and immethodical, yet I conceive the design and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it lyes in these particulars, as will appear in the examination of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an unwritten Word, which must be believed by us, containing such doctrinal Traditions, as are warranted by the <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>Apostolical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ground of believing this unwritten Word, is from the Infallibility of the <hi>Church,</hi> which defines it to be so.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That our belief of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> must be grounded on such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101069:93"/>
Word, which is warranted by the Church: under each of these I shall examine faithfully what belongs to them in your indigested dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>The first of these is taken from your own words; where you tell us, <hi>That our Ensurancer in the main Principle of Faith concerning the Scriptures being the Word of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 66 ch. 6. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>is Apostolical Tradition; and well may it be so, for such Tradition declared by the Church, is the unwritten Word of God.</hi> And you after tell us, <hi>That every Doctrine, which any particular person may please to call Tradition, is not therefore to be received as God's unwritten Word, but such doctrinal Traditions only, as are warranted to us by the Church for truly Apostolical, which are consequently God's unwritten Word.</hi> So that these three things are necessary ingredients of this unwritten Word. 1. That it must be <hi>originally Apostolical,</hi> and not only so, but it must be of <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to the Apostles</hi> too. For otherwise it cannot be <hi>God's Word</hi> at all, and therefore not his <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> I quarrel not at all with you for speaking of an <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> if you could prove it; for it is evident to me, that <hi>God's Word</hi> is no more so, by being written or printed, than if it were not so: for the writing adds no Authority to the <hi>Word,</hi> but only is a more certain means of conveying it to us. It is therefore <hi>God's Word,</hi> as it proceeds from him; and that which is now his <hi>written Word,</hi> was once his <hi>unwritten Word</hi>: but however, whatever is <hi>God's Word,</hi> must come from him, and since you derive the source of the <hi>unwritten Word</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> whatever you call an <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> you must be sure to derive its pedegree down from them. So that insisting on that point of time, when this was declared and owned for an <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> you must be able to shew, that it came from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> otherwise it cannot be owned as an <hi>Apostolical Tradition.</hi> 2. That what you call an <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> must be something <hi>doctrinal</hi>; so you call <hi>them</hi> your self <hi>doctrinal Traditions, i. e.</hi> such as contain in them somewhat <hi>dogmatical</hi> or necessary to be believed by us: and thence it was, this Controversie rose from the Dispute concerning the sufficiency of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> Whether that contained all <hi>God's Word,</hi> or all matters to be believed or no; or, Whether there were not some Objects of Faith, which were never written, but conveyed by Tradition? 3. That what is thus <hi>doctrinal,</hi> must be declared by the Church to be an <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi>; which you in terms assert.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note>According then to these Rules we come to examine the Evidences by you produced for such an <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> For which, you first produce several Instances out of S. <hi>Austin, of such things which were in his time judged to be such,</hi> i. e. <hi>doctrinal Traditions derived from the Apostles, and have ever since been conserved and esteemed such in the whole Church of Christ.</hi> The first you instance in,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C. ep. fund. c.</hi> 5.</note> is that we now treat, <hi>That Scripture is the Word of God,</hi> for which you propose the known place wherein he affirms <hi>he should not believe the Gospel, but for the Authority of the Church moving him thereto.</hi> But this proves nothing to your purpose, unless you make it appear, that the <hi>Authority of the Church</hi> could not move him <hi>to believe the Gospel,</hi> unless that Authority be supposed to be an <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> For, I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that S. <hi>Austin,</hi> or any other rational man might be sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe the <hi>Gospel,</hi> on the account of the <hi>Churches</hi> Authority, not as delivering any <hi>doctrinal Tradition</hi> in the nature of an unwritten Word, but as attesting that <hi>Vniversal Tradition,</hi> which had been among all <hi>Christians</hi> concerning it. Which Universal Tradition is nothing else
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101069:93"/>
but a conveying down to us the judgement of <hi>sense and reason</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case. For the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> being best able to judge as to what Authentick Writings came from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> not by any unwritten Word, but by the use of all moral means, it cannot reasonably be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that the successive Christians should imbezzle these Authentick Records, and substitute others in the place of them. When therefore <hi>Manichaeus</hi> pretended the Authenticalness of some other writings, besides those then owned by the <hi>Church,</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> did no more than any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man would do in the like case, <hi>viz.</hi> appeal to the <hi>Vniversal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; upon the account of which, he saies, He was induced to believe the Gospel it self, <hi>i. e.</hi> not so much the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as the <hi>Books</hi> containing it. But of this more largely elsewhere. I can hardly excuse you from a falsification of S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s meaning, in the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, which you thus render: <hi>If any clear Testimony were brought out of Scripture against the Church, he would neither believe the Scripture, nor the Church</hi>; whereas it appears by the words cited in your own Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, his meaning is only this,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>If you can find</hi> (saith he) <hi>something very plain in the Gospel concerning the Apostleship of</hi> Manichaeus, <hi>you will thereby weaken the Authority of those Catholicks, who bid me, that I should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you; whose Authority being weakned, neither can I believe the Gospel, because, through them, I believed it.</hi> Is here any like what you said, or at least would seem to have apprehended to be his meaning? which is plainly this. <hi>If against the consent of all those Copies which the Catholick Christians received, those Copies should be found truer, which have in them something of the Apostleship of</hi> Manichaeus; <hi>this must needs weaken much the Authority of the Catholick Church in its Tradition, whom he adhered to against the</hi> Manichees; <hi>and their Authority being thus weakned, his Faith, as to the Scriptures delivered by them, must needs be much weakned too.</hi> To give you an Instance of a like nature; The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> pretend, that in the Scripture there was anciently express mention of their Prophet <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> but that the <hi>Christians,</hi> out of hatred of their Religion, have erased all those places which spake of him: Suppose now, a <hi>Christian</hi> should say, If he should find in the <hi>Gospel</hi> express mention of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, it would much weaken the Authority of the whole <hi>Christian Church</hi>; which being so weakned, it must of necessity weaken the Faith of all those who have believed our present Copies Authentick, upon the account of the Christian Churches Authority. Is not this plainly the case S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks of; and, Is it any more than any man's reason will tell him? Not that the Churches Authority is to be relyed on as judicially or infallibly, but as rationally, delivering such an Universal Tradition to us. And, might not S. <hi>Austin,</hi> on the same reason, <hi>as well believe the Acts of the Apostles as the Gospel,</hi> when they were both equally delivered by the same Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition? What you have gained then to your purpose from these three citations out of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> in your first Instance, I cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily imagine.</p>
               <p>Your second Tradition is, That the Father is not begotten of any other person. S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s words are,<note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note>

We never read in the Scriptures, that the Father is unbegotten; and yet it is defended, that we must say so.</hi> And had they not good reason with them to say so, who believed that he was the <hi>Father</hi> by way of exclusion of such a kind of <hi>Generation</hi> as the Eternal <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is supposed to have?

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101069:94"/>
of a doctrinal Tradition, containing some <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> distinct from Scripture? Could any one, whoever believed the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> as revealed in Scripture, believe or imagine any other? that though it be not in express terms set down in Scripture, yet no one that hath any conceptions of the Father, but this is implied in them.

               <p>Your third is, <hi>Of the perpetual Virginity of the Virgin</hi> Mary: This indeed, S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, is to be believed <hi>fide integra,</hi> but he saith not, <hi>divin√¢</hi>; but, Do you therefore make this a <hi>doctrinal Tradition,</hi> and an <hi>unwritten Word?</hi> If you make it a <hi>doctrinal Tradition,</hi> you must shew us, what <hi>Article of Faith</hi> is contained in it; that it was not looked on as an <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the disputations of those <hi>Fathers,</hi> who writ most eagerly about it, who make it their design to prove it out of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Those who did most zealously appear against the Opinion of <hi>Helvidius,</hi> were S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> of the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> only mentions it in the places by you cited: Of the <hi>Greek Church Epiphanius,</hi> and S. <hi>Basil.</hi> And yet every one of these contends to have it proved out of Scripture.

As for his evasion of this Testimony, it is so imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, that I shall not repeat it, although he voucheth <hi>Vasquez</hi> for the Authour of it.

But, we may guess at the credit of this Tradition, by what S. <hi>Hierom</hi> saith of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Comment. in Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>Tom.</hi> 9.</note> that it came <hi>ex Apocryphorum somniis</hi> and withall, gives a sufficient lash at all Traditions, by reason of this in the next words. <hi>Hoc quia de Scripturis non habet auctoritatem, e√¢<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem facilitate contemnitur, qu√¢ probatur. Which having no Authority from the Scriptures, it is as easily contemned as produced.</hi> And, think you not then, that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> was a great friend to your doctrinal Traditions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word? But, say you still, <hi>The Virginity of</hi> Mary <hi>must be an Article of Faith, because, those who denied it are called Hereticks; and S.</hi> Augustine <hi>calls</hi> Helvidius <hi>his Opinion, blasphemy.</hi> But, though <hi>Helvidius</hi> be listed among the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> yet, I suppose, you will not say that all who are listed in those <hi>Catalogues</hi> are defined to be <hi>Hereticks</hi> by the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> It is very apparent, that any one who seemed to broach any new fancies, and thereby disturbed the <hi>Churches Peace,</hi> were called <hi>Hereticks</hi> by them.<note place="margin">

One would therefore think, that one so near the <hi>Apostles</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> was, might easily have learned such a Tradition, and so great a friend to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity</hi> as he was (while a <hi>Montanist</hi>) should not have been apt to believe the contrary. That which was accounted <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in <hi>Helvidius,</hi> was the rashness of his assertion, which seemed dishonourable to the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and not as though he did thereby overthrow any Article of Faith. For the other part of your Tradition, that she was a <hi>Virgin</hi> in the <hi>Birth</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> you will find it a greater difficulty to make it out to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as a <hi>Tradition,</hi> much less as an unwritten Word. For not only <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, Origen, Epiphanius, Ambrose, Theophylact</hi> oppose you in it; and judge you then, whether this were owned as a constant Tradition or no. But it is not worth while to insist upon it.</p>
               <p>Your fourth Instance is, concerning <hi>the Rebaptization of Hereticks.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, two things are to be considered, <hi>The Custome it self,</hi>

                  <hi>which Custome, he believed, did come from Apostolical Tradition; as many other things which are not found in the writings of the Apostles, nor in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Councils, yet because they are observed by the Vniversal Church, are
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101069:95"/>
believed to be delivered, and commended by them.</hi> To the same purpose is the other Testimony. But what is this to <hi>doctrinal Traditions, concerning matters of Faith?</hi> That there were many <hi>Ecclesiastical Customes</hi> observed in the <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>Apostolical Traditions,</hi> I deny not, but that is not our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Question. If you therefore enquire into that which is only <hi>doctrinal</hi> in this case concerning the <hi>right</hi> and lawfulness of Practice in this case, that he fixeth wholly upon the Scriptures. The Practice of the <hi>Church</hi> in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Hereticks</hi> without baptizing them again, might be known by <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but whether the Church did well or ill in it, must be by S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s own confession determined out of <hi>Scripture.</hi> And in that latter place by you cited, there is mentioned no such thing as an unwritten Word, or that the <hi>Apostles</hi> had left any command that <hi>Hereticks</hi> should not be baptized again. <hi>Nihil quidem exinde praeceperunt Apostoli,</hi> are his own words; there being then neither written nor unwritten <hi>Word</hi> for it, S. <hi>Austin</hi> takes the likeliest course he could think of, which was, from the Custome of the <hi>Church,</hi> to judge most probably what was most agreeable to the <hi>Apostles</hi> minds.

               <p>Your fifth concerning <hi>Infants Baptism,</hi> you have given us occasion to consider largely already; your sixth depends upon that; your seventh is only a rite of the Church.

Or else that might be accounted an <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> in one <hi>age,</hi> which may not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and then, since, according to your judgement, the <hi>present Church is infallible in every age,</hi> that was <hi>infallibly</hi> an <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> in one age, which infallibly is <hi>not so</hi> in another.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101069:95"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> in several ages doth so much differ concerning them.</p>
               <p>After you have, in your way, attempted to prove such <hi>unwritten Words,</hi> or <hi>doctrinal Traditions,</hi> you fall upon a high charge against his Lordship,<note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> and not without a severe reflection on all <hi>Protestants,</hi> in these words. <hi>It is so natural to Protestants to build upon false grounds, that they cannot enter into a Question, without supposing a falshood; so his Lordship here feeds his humour, and obtrudes many.</hi> It is well yet,<note place="margin">P. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> his Lordship meets with no worse enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment than all <hi>Protestants</hi> do: You think all <hi>Protestants</hi> still build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on false grounds, because not <hi>super hanc Petram,</hi> and that they still suppose falshoods, because they suppose your <hi>Church fallible,</hi> whether she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to explain written, or define unwritten Words. But, whether his Lordship feeds his humour in obtruding falshoods, or you yours in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating, will appear upon examination. You say, <hi>He makes</hi> Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>and all Catholick Doctors, maintain, that whatever they please to call Tradition, must presently be received by all as God's unwritten Word.</hi> Upon which you go about to vindicate <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by repeating his distinctions concerning Traditions, <hi>viz. That some are Divine, others Apostolical, and others Ecclesiastical, and that some belong to Faith, others to Manners.</hi> But all this doth not serve your turn. For 1. His Lordship doth not deny, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> useth these distinctions, but reduceth all these several Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions under the same common title <hi>de Verbo Dei non scripto</hi>; and that his design therein, is to impose upon unwary Readers, that all the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions mentioned by him, are <hi>God's unwritten Word.</hi> Upon which, his Lordship had good reason to go about to undeceive them, and to make it appear so evidently as he hath done, that <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>God's unwritten Word,</hi> are not convertible terms; both because there may be justly suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have been many <hi>unwritten Words,</hi> which were never delivered over to the <hi>Church</hi>; and that there are many things which go for <hi>Traditions</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> which have no shadow of pretence from an <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> 2. There may be yet further cunning in all this; for, although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and you distinguish of <hi>Traditions, Divine, Apostolical,</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi>; yet when you come to put the difference between these, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you would not leave it to every particular <hi>person,</hi> to judge which of these <hi>Traditions</hi> is of these several natures, but the <hi>Church</hi> must be judge of them. So that a Tradition is <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> when your <hi>Church</hi> will have it so, that is, when it is disused among you, as the <hi>three dippings in Baptism,</hi> the <hi>participation of Eucharists by Infants, &amp;c.</hi> But when any Tradition is still in <hi>use</hi> by your <hi>Church,</hi> then your <hi>Churches Practice</hi> being in this case a sufficient Definition as to all those things so used by your <hi>Church,</hi> they must be accounted <hi>Apostolical,</hi> if not <hi>Divine.</hi> 3. Of what kind or nature soever these <hi>Traditions</hi> are supposed to be, whether <hi>Divine, Apostolical,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> prove any of them to contain any thing <hi>necessary for Faith</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and you will then come near an <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> Your <hi>Ecclesiastical Traditions</hi> you discard your self from being such, inform us then what <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Apostolical Traditions</hi> those are which are founded on such an unwritten Word? Whether any of your <hi>Ecclesiastical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> contradict <hi>God's Word,</hi> or no, is not here a place to examine; we are now enquiring, Whether there be any such thing as an <hi>unwritten Word</hi> at all, which contains any matter necessary for us to believe, or practise. The only pretence you have here for it, is, <hi>That we believe by Divine Faith, that Scripture is God's VVord, and that there is no other VVord of God to assure us of this Point, but the Tradition delivered to us by the Church, and that such
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101069:96"/>
Tradition so delivered, must be the unwritten VVord of God.</hi> How far we are to believe <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>VVord of God,</hi> with <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> will be throughly examined in its due time; and likewise how far any <hi>VVord of God</hi> is necessary for the Foundation of this <hi>Faith:</hi> only I cannot here but take notice, what it is which makes a Tradition be the <hi>unwritten VVord of God</hi>; and what becomes then of your former distinction concerning <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions?</hi> for we see, that which makes them the <hi>VVord of God,</hi> is their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered by the <hi>Church</hi>; so that let their Authour, Nature, or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be what it will, according to this Principle any <hi>Tradition</hi> being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by your <hi>Church,</hi> becomes an <hi>unwritten VVord.</hi> So I come to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Proposition.</p>

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note>2. <hi>That the ground of believing any unwritten word, is the Infallibility of your Church defining it to be so.</hi> For you say, <hi>As the Church was Infallible in defining what was written,</hi>

                  <hi>so is she also infallible in defining what was not written.

And I assure you, I am so far convinced of the reasonableness of this proposal, that if you will make out any of those things controverted between us, such as <hi>Invocation of Saints, VVorship of Images, Transubstantiation, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eucharist, Purgatory, Indulgences,</hi> the <hi>Pope's Supremacy, &amp;c.</hi> by these Rules, and make it appear to me, that these were held by all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches, at all times,</hi> or have <hi>Antiquity, Vniversality,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi>; I shall be very inclinable to embrace what your <hi>Church</hi> would impose upon me. But when I know how impossible a task this is, I do not at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that you should quit this formerly magnified saying of <hi>Vincentius,</hi> and resolve all into the Infallibility of the present <hi>Church.</hi> But hereby we see,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101069:96"/>
how far you are from the judgement of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as to this very point of the tryal of <hi>doctrinal Traditions,</hi> since you can see no security any where but in your selves, and your <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>; I will therefore reduce the Controversie yet shorter: prove but this <hi>Infallibility of your Church in defining the written and unwritten VVord</hi> by these Rules of <hi>Vincentius, Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality, Antiquity and Consent,</hi> and I will yield you all the rest. But what unreasonable men are you, if you must be Parties and Judges too; or if we must believe an <hi>unwritten VVord,</hi> because your <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>infallible</hi>; and believe your <hi>Church infallible,</hi> because that is an <hi>unwritten VVord.</hi> And well may you call it so; for, search the whole Book of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and all the Records of the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> and you find nothing at all of it. We see plainly then, you are resolved to be tryed by none but your selves, and so you are <hi>Catholicks,</hi> because you say, You are so; and, your <hi>Church infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> because she pretends to be so.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That our belief of the Scriptures must be resolved into an unwritten VVord, which is defined by your Church to be such.</hi> This is that,<note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> for whose sake all your other discourse is brought in, and is the main thing to the purpose: Although you pretend likewise to a power in your <hi>Church,</hi> to declare <hi>what Christ said when he held his peace.</hi> (But, Are you sure your <hi>Church</hi> will be infallible in that too?) For when his <hi>Lordship</hi> had said, <hi>That where-ever Christ held his peace, and that his words are not registred, no man may dare without rashness, to say, They were these or these:</hi> You very gravely add, <hi>That his Lordship must give you leave to tell him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 68.</note> 
                  <hi>you must bind up his whole assertion with this</hi> Proviso, <hi>but according as the Church shall declare.</hi> Your <hi>Church</hi> then must declare when <hi>Christ</hi> held his peace, and when he did not; when he spake so, that others might hear him, and when he did not; when any thing was taken notice of that he said, and when not. But when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Christ both spake, and did much more than ever was written, how well doth your Church acquit her Office in being <hi>Christ's Remembrancer?</hi> And therefore I believe your Church will be guilty of the same rashness with any private person in, S. <hi>Augustine's Opinion, In offering to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what Christ said<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> when either he held his peace, or his words are not registred.</hi> As for those things which you mention <hi>for Traditions,</hi>

                  <hi>not contrary to God's written Word, which yet are not an unwritten Word, such as the Ceremonies of Baptism</hi> by you mentioned, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not pertinent to our purpose, because they are only rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and our discourse is about <hi>doctrinal Traditions</hi>; neither yet if I would spend time in the enquiry, could you derive them from <hi>Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> notwithstanding what either you, or <hi>Bellarmine</hi> say. But the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all you have to say, pertinent to your purpose, is, <hi>That though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tradition be not God's unwritten VVord, yet it being necessary for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture to be the VVord of God, we must believe it either for some word written or unwritten, or we shall have no Divine Faith at all of the Point, because all Divine Faith must rely upon some VVord of God.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great novelty with you, that is, something like Argumentation, it obliges me to take a little more particular notice of it. Any one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders the force of this Argument, will find, that it lyes wholly upon your notion of <hi>Divine Faith</hi>: for it appearing unreasonable to you, that our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that the Scripture is the Word, should be resolved into the written Word it self; therefore you find out an <hi>unwritten VVord of God</hi> for a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith</hi> to fix it self upon, which can be nothing but <hi>some VVord of God.</hi> To this therefore I answer, that when you say, It is necessary <hi>we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101069:97"/>
the Scriptures to be the VVord of God with Divine Faith,</hi> this <hi>Divine Faith</hi> must be taken in one of these three senses; either first, that Faith may be said to be <hi>Divine,</hi> which hath a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> for its <hi>Material Object,</hi> as, that <hi>Faith</hi> may be said to be a <hi>Humane Faith,</hi> which is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant about natural causes, and the effects of them: And in this sense it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is conversant about the <hi>Scripture,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>: Or <hi>secondly,</hi> a <hi>Faith</hi> may be said to be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> in regard of its <hi>Testimony,</hi> or <hi>Formal Object</hi>; and so that is called a <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which is built on a <hi>Divine Testimony,</hi> and that a <hi>Humane Faith</hi> which is built on a <hi>Humane Testimony:</hi> Thus I assert, all that <hi>Faith</hi> which respects particular <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> supposing the belief of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> is in this sense <hi>Divine,</hi> because it is built on a properly <hi>Divine Testimony</hi>; but the Question is, Whether that <hi>Act of Faith</hi> which hath the whole <hi>Scripture</hi> as its <hi>Material Object,</hi> be in that sense Divine or no. <hi>Thirdly, Faith</hi> may be said to be <hi>Divine,</hi> in regard of the Divine <hi>Effects</hi> it hath upon the soul of man; as it is said in <hi>Scripture,</hi> to <hi>purifie the heart, overcome the world, resist Satan,</hi> and his <hi>Temptations, receive Christ, &amp;c.</hi> And this is properly a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith</hi>; and there is no Question, but every Christian ought to have this <hi>Divine Faith</hi> in his soul, without which the other sorts of <hi>Divine Faith</hi> will never bring men to Heaven. But it is apparent, that all who heartily profess to believe the <hi>Scriptures to be the VVord of God,</hi> have not this sort of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> though they have so firm an assent to the Truth and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it, that they durst lay down their lives for it. The <hi>Assent</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we see, may be firm, where the effects are not saving: The Question now is, Whether this may be called a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> in the second sense, that is, Whether it must be built on a <hi>Testimony infallible?</hi> For clearing which, we must further consider the meaning of this Question, <hi>How we know Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be Scripture?</hi> which may import two things, <hi>How we know that all these Books contain God's VVord in them?</hi> Or secondly, <hi>How we know the Doctrine contained in these Books to be Divine?</hi> If you then ask me, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be necessary that I believe with such a <hi>Faith</hi> as is built on <hi>Divine Testimony,</hi> that these <hi>Books</hi> called the <hi>Scripture,</hi> contain the principles of the Jewish and <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in them (which we call <hi>God's VVord</hi>) I deny it, and shall do so, till you shew me some further necessity of it than you have done yet; and my reason is, because I may have sufficient ground for such an <hi>Assent,</hi> without any <hi>Divine Testimony.</hi> But, if you ask me, On what ground I believe the <hi>Doctrine to be Divine, which is contained in those Books</hi>; I then answer affirmatively, On a <hi>Divine Testimony</hi>; because <hi>God</hi> hath given abundant evidence, that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> was of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> Thus you see, what little reason you have to triumph in your Argument <hi>from Divine Faith,</hi> inferring the necessity of an <hi>unwritten VVord of God.</hi> But, the further explication of these things must be reserved, till I come to the positive part of our way of <hi>resolution of Faith.</hi> I now return.</p>
               <p>Having, after your way (that is, very unsatisfactorily) attempted the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating your resolution of Faith,<note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> from the Objections which were offered against it by his Lordship; you come now to consider the second way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by him for the resolving Faith, which is, <hi>That Scripture should be fully and sufficiently known,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 69. n. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>as by divine and infallible Testimony, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendency of that light which it hath in it self only, and by the witness it can so give to it self</hi>; against which he gives such evident reasons, that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>the Relator himself hath sufficiently confuted it, and you agree with him in the Confutation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 69. n. 3.</note> Yet herein you grow very angry with him, <hi>for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101069:97"/>
saying, That this Doctrine may agree well enough with your grounds, in regard you hold, that Tradition may be known for God's VVord by its own light, and consequently the like may be said of Scripture.</hi> This you call <hi>aspersing you, and obtruding falshoods upon you.</hi> Whether it be so or no, must appear upon examination. Two Testimonies are cited from <hi>A. C.</hi> to this purpose, the first is, <hi>Tradition of the Church is of a Company, which by its own light, shews it self to be infallibly assisted.</hi> Your Answer is, <hi>That the word [which] must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly relate to the preceding word Company, and not to the more remote word Tradition.</hi> But what of all this? Doth any thing the less follow, <hi>which the Bishop charged</hi> A. C. <hi>with?</hi> For it being granted by you, <hi>That there can be no knowing an Apostolical Tradition, but for the Infallibility of the present Church</hi>; the same <hi>light</hi> which discovers the Infallibility of that Company, doth likewise discover the Truth of Tradition. If therefore your <hi>Church</hi> doth appear infallible by its own <hi>light,</hi> which is your own confession, May not the <hi>Scripture</hi> as well appear infallible by its own light. For is there not as great <hi>self-evidence,</hi> at least, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi> as that your <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>infallible</hi>? And therefore that way you take to shift the Objection, makes it return upon you with greater force: For, I pray tell me, how any Company can appear by its own <hi>Light</hi> to be assisted by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and not much more the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> to be divine? Especially seeing you must at last be forced to derive this <hi>Infallibility</hi> from the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> For, you pretend to no other Infallibility, than what comes by a promise of the <hi>immediate assistance of the Holy Ghost.</hi> How then can any Company appear by <hi>its own Light,</hi> to be thus infallibly assisted, unless it first appear by <hi>its own Light,</hi> that there was such a <hi>Promise?</hi> and how can that, unless it antecedently appear by <hi>its own Light,</hi> that the <hi>Scripture,</hi> in which the Promise is written, is the <hi>VVord of God?</hi> You tell us,<note place="margin">P. 70.</note> 
                  <hi>A. C</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> 
                  <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is only to affirm, That the Church is known by her Motives of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ever accompany her, and may very properly be called her own Light.</hi> How well you are acquainted with <hi>A. C</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> intention, I know not, neither is it much matter: for, granting this to have been his intention, may not the <hi>Scripture</hi> be known by <hi>her Motives of Credibility,</hi> as well as the <hi>Church?</hi> and do not these accompany her, as much as the <hi>Church</hi>? and may they not be called <hi>her Light,</hi> as properly as those of the <hi>Church?</hi> It is plain then, by all the senses and meanings you can find out, in the very same, that you say the <hi>Church</hi> may be known by <hi>her own Light,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> may much more; and therefore you have no reason to quarrel with his Lordship or affirming it.</p>
               <p>The second Testimony produced, is, <hi>That a Tradition may be known to be such by the Light it hath in it self; in which</hi> (you say) <hi>you find not one word, of Tradition being known by its own Light.</hi> But, who are so blind as those who will not see? I pray, what difference is there between a Tradition being known to be <hi>such by its own Light,</hi> and a <hi>Tradition</hi> being <hi>known</hi> by <hi>its own Light?</hi> Yes, say you, <hi>known to be such, implies, that is, to be God's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word</hi>; but are not doctrinal Traditions, and an unwritten Word, with you the same thing? Can therefore a Tradition be known to be an <hi>unwritten Word</hi> by its <hi>own Light,</hi> and not be known to be a <hi>Tradition</hi> by its <hi>own Light?</hi> Nay, How can it possibly be known to be an <hi>unwritten Word,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it first appears to be a Tradition? for <hi>Tradition</hi> containing under it both those that are <hi>unwritten Words,</hi> and those that <hi>are not</hi>; it must, in order of nature, be known to be a <hi>Tradition,</hi> before it can be <hi>known</hi> to be the other: As I must first know you to be a <hi>living Creature,</hi> before I can know you to be a <hi>reasonable Creature</hi>; and, I may much sooner know the one than the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101069:98"/>
other. You do therefore very well when you have given us such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for sport <hi>to give us leave to laugh at it,</hi> as you do in your next words.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note>But before you leave this point you have some graver matter to take notice of, which is, that you desire the reader to consider what the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator</hi> grants, <hi>viz. That the Church now admits of St.</hi> James <hi>and St.</hi> Judes <hi>Epistles, and the</hi> Apocalypse, <hi>which were not received for diverse years, after the rest of the New Testament.</hi> From which you wisely inferr, <hi>That if some Books are now to be admitted for Canonical which were not alwayes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be such, then upon the same authority some Books may now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Canon, which were not so in</hi> Ruffinus <hi>his time. And therefore the Bishop doth elsewhere unjustly charge the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>that it had erred in receiving more Books into the Canon, then were received in</hi> Ruffinus <hi>his time.</hi> To which I Answer. 1. By your own confession then, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> doth now receive into the <hi>Canon</hi> more Books then she did in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his time; from whence I enquire, whether the present <hi>Church of Rome</hi> were <hi>Infallible</hi> in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his time in determining the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Scripture? If not,</hi> then the <hi>present Church</hi> is no Infallible propounder of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and then all your discourse comes to nothing. <hi>If she were Infallible</hi> then, she cannot be now, for now she determins <hi>otherwise</hi> as to a main <hi>point</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> than she did then; unless you will say, your <hi>Church</hi> can be <hi>Infallible</hi> in determining both parts of a contradiction to be true. 2. Is the integrity of the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> an <hi>Apostolical tradition</hi> or no? I doubt not, but you will say, It is; if so, Whether were these Books which you admit now and were not admitted then, known to be of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> by this <hi>Apostolical tradition?</hi> If not, by what right come they now to be of the <hi>Canon?</hi> if so, then was not your <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Ruffinus</hi>'s time, much to seek for her <hi>Infallibility,</hi> in defining what was <hi>Apostolical tradition,</hi> and what not? 3. Your main principle on which the lawfulness of adding more books to the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> is built, is, <hi>That it is in the power of your Church judicially and authoritatively to determine what books belong to the Canon of the Scripture, and what not,</hi> which I utterly deny. For it is impossible that your <hi>Church,</hi> or any in the world, can by any definition make that <hi>Book</hi> to be <hi>Divine,</hi> which was not so before such a definition: For the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> doth meerly arise from <hi>Divine revelation.</hi> Can your <hi>Church</hi> then make that to be a <hi>Divine revelation,</hi> which was not so? All that any <hi>Church</hi> in the world can do in this case, is, not to constitute any new <hi>Canon,</hi> which were to make <hi>Books Divine</hi> which were not so, but to use its utmost diligence and care in searching into the <hi>authenticalness</hi> of those <hi>Copy's</hi> which have any pretence to be of the <hi>Canon,</hi> and whether they did originally proceed from such persons, as we have reason to believe had an <hi>immediate assistance</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and, according to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they find, the <hi>Church</hi> may declare and give in her verdict. For the <hi>Church</hi> in this case is but a <hi>Jury</hi> of <hi>grand Inquest</hi> to search into matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> and not a <hi>Judge</hi> upon the <hi>Bench</hi> to determine in point of <hi>Law.</hi> And that is the true reason, why the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> were gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received into the <hi>Canon,</hi> and some a great while after others, as St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>Jude, the Epistle to the Hebrews,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse</hi>; because at first, the Copyes being not so publickly dispersed, there was not that occasion ministred to the <hi>Church</hi> for examination of them; upon which, when by degrees they came to be more publick, it caused scruples in many concerning them, because they appeared no sooner: especially if any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101069:98"/>
in them seemed to gratifie any of the <hi>Sects</hi> then appearing; as the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the <hi>Novatians</hi>; and the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> the <hi>Millenary's:</hi> But when upon a through search and examination of all circumstances, it did appear that these Copyes were authentical, and did originally proceed from <hi>Divine Persons,</hi> then they came to be admitted and owned for such by the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> which we call being admitted <hi>into the Canon of the Scripture.</hi> Which I take to be the only true and just account of that which is called the constituting the <hi>Canon of Scripture,</hi> not as though ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Apostles</hi> met to do it, or St. <hi>John</hi> intended any such thing by those words in the end of <hi>the Apocalypse</hi> (for that Book being as much lyable to question as any, how could that seal the <hi>Canon</hi> for all the rest) much less, that it was in the power of any <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> and least of all of the <hi>Pope,</hi> to determine what was <hi>Canonical,</hi> and what not: but only that the <hi>Church</hi> upon examination and enquiry, did by her Universal reception of these <hi>Books,</hi> declare it self satisfied with the <hi>evidence</hi> which was produced, that those were true and authentick <hi>Copyes</hi> which were abroad under such names or titles, and that there was great reason to believe by a continued tradition from the age and time these Books were written in, that they were written by such persons, who were not only free from any design of <hi>imposture,</hi> but gave the greatest Rational evidence, that they had a more special and immediate assistance of Gods Spirit. You see then, to how little advantage to your Cause you made this <hi>digression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the third way propounded for resolving the Question,<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>How we know the Scriptures to be the Word of God,</hi> viz. <hi>by the testimony of the Holy Ghost</hi>; three things you object against the <hi>Bishops discourse</hi> about it; <hi>First,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag 70, 71.</note> 
                  <hi>that his discourse is roving and uncertain.</hi> 2. <hi>That notwithstanding his brags he must have recourse to a private spirit himself.</hi> 3. <hi>That though the Bishop would seem to deny it, diverse eminent Protestants do resolve their Faith into the private spirit.</hi> This being the substance of what you say, I shall return a particular Answer to each of them. For the first you tell us, <hi>He delivers himself in such a roving way of discourse, as signifies nothing in effect as to what he would drive at.</hi> No? that is strange, when that which his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> drives at, is, to shew how far this opinion is to be allowed and how far not, which he is so far from roving in, that he clearly and distinctly propounds the state of the question and the resolution of it: which in short is this,<note place="margin">P. 71, 72.</note> 
                  <hi>If by the testimony of the spirit be meant any special revelation of a new object of Faith, then he denies the truth of it at least in an ordinary way, both because God never sends us to look for such a testimony, and because it would expose men to the danger of Enthusiasms: but if by the testimony of the Spirit be meant the habit or the act of Divine infused Faith, by vertue of which they believe the object which appears credible, then he grants the truth but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes the pertinency of it, because it is quite out of the state of the question, which inquires only after a sufficient means to make this object credible, against all impeachment of folly and temerity in believing, whether men do actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or not. And withal adds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 74. n. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that the question is of such outward and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent means, as other men may take notice of, as well as our selves.</hi> Judge you now, whether this may be called <hi>roving</hi>; if it be so, I can freely excuse you from <hi>it</hi> in all the discourses I have met with in your Book, who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre nothing more then a true stating, and methodical handling any question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But yet</hi> (say you) <hi>the Bishop cannot free himself from that imputation of recurring to the private Spirit, against any that should press the business home.</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:101069:99"/>
Sure you refer us here to some one else who is able to press a business home, for you never attempt it your self; and instead of that, only produce a large testimony out of <hi>A. C. That he did not acquit the Bishop wholly of this.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did or no is to little purpose, and yet those very words which his Lordship cites, are in your testimony produced out of him. Only what you add more from him, that he must be driven to it; that his <hi>Lordship</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and neither <hi>A. C.</hi> or you have been able to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But though the Bishop seems not only to deny any such private revelation himself, but will not confess that any Protestants hold it; yet</hi> (you say) <hi>there can be no doubt in this, since</hi> Calvin <hi>and</hi> Whitaker <hi>do both so expresly own it.</hi> But according to those principles laid down before, both these testimonies are easily answered. For, 1. Neither of them doth imply any <hi>private revelation</hi> of any <hi>new object,</hi> but only a particular application of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence appearing in <hi>Scripture</hi> to the conscience of every Believer. 2.

called the Bible; which saith he, you tell me must be believed Infallibly with every part and parcel in it, to be the undoubted Word of the true God, before I can believe any other point of Religion as it ought to be believed. As to which, your Heathen sees no ground to assent that it is Gods Word.</hi> But by this way of management of your dispute, we may easily discern which way the issue of it is like to go. Doth his Lordship any where undertake to prove this in the first place <hi>Infallibly</hi> to a <hi>Heathen, That the Bible must be Infallibly believed to be Gods Word?</hi> No, he offers to prove, first, the <hi>excellency</hi> and the <hi>reasonableness</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> considered in its self. From whence you might easily conceive how the <hi>dispute</hi> ought to be managed; shewing first, that the <hi>precepts</hi> of Christianity are highly just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the <hi>Promises</hi> of it such as may induce any reasonable man to the <hi>practice</hi> of those <hi>Precepts</hi>; and that the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> is such, as may appear to any considerative person to have been very wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived: That there is nothing vain or impertinent in it, but that it is designed for <hi>great</hi> and <hi>excellent purposes,</hi> the bringing men off from the love of sin, to the love of <hi>God</hi>; that it is impossible to imagine any <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be contrived with more <hi>advantage</hi> for promoting these <hi>ends,</hi> because it represents to us the highest expressions of the <hi>Kindness</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to man, and that the Promises made by <hi>God</hi> were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world by the death of his only Son; That since mens <hi>natures</hi> are now so degenerate, <hi>God</hi> hath made a tender of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>divine assistance,</hi> whereby to enable men to perform the excellent duties of this Religion. That those <hi>things</hi> which seem most hard to <hi>believe</hi> in this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> are not such things as might have been spared out of it (as though <hi>God</hi> did intend only to puzzle mens reason with them) but they are such <hi>mysteries,</hi> as it is impossible the wit of man can conceive they should have been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered upon better <hi>reasons,</hi> or for more excellent <hi>ends</hi>; as, that a <hi>Virgin should conceive by the immediate power of God,</hi> to bring him into the world, who should be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of it; <hi>That there should be a resurrection of bodies,</hi> in order to a compleat felicity of them who obey this Doctrine; and so for others of a like nature: that supposing it possible such things should be, it is impossible to conceive they should be done upon better <hi>grounds,</hi> or for better purposes than they are in <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> This being now a short <hi>draught</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> is the <hi>first</hi> thing which I suppose any learned or inquisitive <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Infidel</hi> should be acquainted with; if he finds fault with this, let him in any thing shew the incongruity or unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it. If he acknowledge this model of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> reasonable, his next scruple is, Whether this be truly the <hi>Model</hi> of it or no; for that end I tell him, We have a <hi>Book</hi> among us, which is, and ever hath been, by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> taken for granted, to comprize in it the Principles of <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; I bid him take it, and read it seriously, and see if that which I have given him as the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> do not perfectly agree with that Book. I do not bid him presently <hi>absolutely and infallibly believe this Book to be God's VVord,</hi> which is a very preposterous way of proceeding; but only compare the <hi>Doctrine</hi> with the <hi>Book,</hi> as he would do a body of <hi>Civil Law,</hi> with the <hi>Institutes</hi> of it; or the Principles of any Science, with the most approved Authors of it. If after this search, he be satisfied, that the representation I gave him of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> agrees with those <hi>Books</hi> we call the <hi>Bible</hi>; he yet further adds, that he acknowledges the Principles of our <hi>Religion</hi> to be <hi>reasonable</hi>; but desires to be satisfied of the <hi>Truth</hi> of them; I must further enquire, Whether he doth believe any thing else to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101069:100"/>
                  <hi>be</hi> in the world, besides what he hath seen and heard himself? I may justly suppose his Answer <hi>affirmative</hi>; I then demand upon what grounds? A. <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the certain report of honest men, who have seen and heard other things than ever he did.</hi> But why do you think honest mens reports to be credible in such cases? A. <hi>Because, I see, they have no design or interest to deceive me in it.</hi> Will you then believe the report of such men, whom, I can make it appear, could have no interest in deceiving you? A. <hi>I can see no reason to the contrary.</hi> Will you then believe such men, who lost their lives to make it appear, that their Testimony was true? A. <hi>Yes.</hi> Will you believe such things, wherein persons of several Ages, Professions, Nations, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, Interests, are all agreed that they were so? A. <hi>Yes, if it be only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a matter of fact on their Testimony; I can see no ground to question it.</hi> That is all I desire of you, and therefore you must believe that there was in the world such a person as <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who dyed, and rose again; and, while he lived, wrought great <hi>miracles</hi> to confirm his <hi>Doctrine</hi> with; and that he sent out <hi>Apostles</hi> to preach this Doctrine in the world, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise did work many <hi>miracles,</hi> and that some of these persons the better to preserve and convey this Doctrine, did write the substance of all that <hi>Christ</hi> either did, or spake, and withall penned several <hi>Epistles</hi> to those <hi>Churches</hi> which were planted by them. These are all <hi>matters of fact,</hi> and therefore on your former Principle you are to believe them. There are then but two Scruples left, <hi>Supposing all this true, yet this doth not prove the Doctrine Divine; nor the Scriptures, which convey it, to be infallible.</hi> To which I answer, 1. Can you question, Whether that <hi>Doctrine</hi> be <hi>Divine,</hi> when the <hi>person</hi> who declared it to the world, was so <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> a person, not only in his conversation, but in those frequent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld <hi>Miracles</hi> which he wrought in the sight and face of his enemies, who, after his death, did rise again, and converse with his Disciples, who gave evidence of their fidelity in the Testimony they gave of it, by laying down their lives to attest the Truth of it? Again, Can you question the <hi>Divinity</hi> of that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which tended so apparently to the destruction of sin and wickedness, and the power of the evil <hi>Spirit</hi> in the world? For, we cannot think he would quit his possession willingly out of the bodies and souls of men; that therefore which threw him out of both, must be, not only a <hi>Doctrine</hi> directly contrary to his interest, but infinitely exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in <hi>power:</hi> And that can be no less than <hi>Divine.</hi> But still, you will say, <hi>Is it not, besides all this, necessary to believe these very Books, you call the Scripture, to be divinely inspired; and how should I know that?</hi> To that I answer, 1. That which <hi>God</hi> chiefly requires from you, is, the belief of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi>; for that is the <hi>Faith</hi> which will bring you to obedience, which is the thing <hi>God</hi> aims at. 2. If you believe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> you cannot reasonably question the <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Scriptures.</hi> For, in that you read, that not only <hi>Christ</hi> did miracles, but his <hi>Apostles</hi> too; and therefore their <hi>Testimony,</hi> whether writing or speaking was equally <hi>infallible</hi>; all that you want evidence for, is, that such <hi>persons</hi> writ these <hi>Books,</hi> and that being a <hi>matter of fact,</hi> was sufficiently proved and acknowledged before. Thus you see, if we take a right method, and not jumble things confusedly together, as you do, what a satisfactory account may be given to any inquisitive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; first, of the <hi>Reasonableness</hi>; next, of the <hi>Truth</hi>; and lastly, of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> both of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>Books</hi> containing it, which we call the <hi>Scripture.</hi>

                  <hi>as to inforce assent, yet it is strengthened so abundantly with probable Arguments, both from the Light of Nature it self, and Humane Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he must be very wilful and self-conceited, that shall dare to suspect it.</hi> And sure any reasonable man in the world would think it sufficient to deal with an adversary upon such terms.

How far <hi>Infallibility</hi> may be admitted in our belief, may partly be perceived by what hath been said already, and what shall be said more afterwards. That there is, and ought to be the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>actual Certainty</hi>; I assert as much as you: But, say you, <hi>The very Arguments being but probable, destroy it:</hi> To which I answer, by explaining the meaning of <hi>probable Arguments,</hi> in this case; whereby are not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood such kind of <hi>Probabilities,</hi> which cannot raise a firm <hi>Assent,</hi> in which sense we say, <hi>That which is probable to be, is probable not to be</hi>; but by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities</hi> are only meant such kind of <hi>rational Evidence,</hi> which may yield a sufficient foundation for a <hi>firm Assent,</hi> but yet notwithstanding, which an <hi>obstinate person</hi> may <hi>deny Assent.</hi> As for Instance, if you were to dispute with an <hi>Atheist</hi> concerning the <hi>Existence</hi> of a <hi>Deity,</hi> which he denies, and should proceed with you just as your <hi>Heathen</hi> doth with the <hi>Bishop.</hi> Sir, All that Religion you talk of, is built only upon the belief of a <hi>God,</hi> but I cannot be <hi>infallibly convinced by natural reason, that there is such a one.</hi> You pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tell him, that there is so much evidence for a <hi>Deity,</hi> from the works of nature, the consent of all people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he can have no reason to question it. But still he replies, <hi>None of these are demonstrations,</hi> for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I have considered these, I believe the contrary; but <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations</hi> would make me <hi>infallibly certain</hi>; these then are no more but <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Arguments, and therefore since it is but probably true, it may be probably false.</hi> How then will you satisfie such a person?

Unless you will tell him, it is to no purpose to believe a <hi>God,</hi> unless he <hi>believe it infallibly</hi>; and there being no <hi>infallible Arguments</hi> in nature, he must believe it on the <hi>Infallibility of your Church.</hi> And do you not think, this were an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way to confute <hi>Atheists?</hi> But when we speak of <hi>probable Arguments,</hi> we mean not such as are apt to leave the mind <hi>in suspence,</hi> whether the thing be true or no; but only such as are not <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>rigid demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or <hi>infallible Testimony,</hi> but the <hi>highest Evidence</hi> which the <hi>nature</hi> of the thing will bear, and therefore may cause an <hi>undoubted Certainty</hi> of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi> As it is in all <hi>matters of fact</hi>; for, Will you say, that it is as <hi>probable,</hi> that there is not such a <hi>place</hi> as <hi>Rome,</hi> as that there is, because the only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument you have to be convinced of it, is but in it self a <hi>probability,</hi> which is the fame and report of people. It is a piece therefore of great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of judgement, to say, That there can be no <hi>certain Assent,</hi> where there
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101069:101"/>
is a meer <hi>possibility</hi> of being deceived. For there is no kind of <hi>Assent</hi> in the humane understanding, as to the existence of any thing, but there is a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>deception</hi> in it. Will you say, because it is possible all mens senses may deceive them, therefore there can be no <hi>certainty</hi> of any object of <hi>sense?</hi> And, as well may you say it, as destroy any certainty of <hi>Assent</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> where you suppose a possibility of being deceived. But, if I be not much deceived (though I suppose you will account it a grand <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>) an <hi>Assent</hi> may be as <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> upon <hi>moral grounds,</hi> as upon a <hi>demonstration,</hi> that is, when the <hi>matter</hi> is capable of no more than <hi>moral grounds.</hi> For, the reason why we <hi>suspend Assent,</hi> is the <hi>unproportionateness</hi> of the <hi>evidence</hi> to the <hi>matter</hi> to be proved: So, when the <hi>matter</hi> is capable of more <hi>evidence</hi> than is produced, and <hi>I know it to be so,</hi> my <hi>understanding</hi> cannot firmly <hi>assent</hi> on such <hi>evidence</hi>; but when the <hi>matter</hi> is capable of no more than <hi>moral evidence,</hi> and <hi>I know it,</hi> I may as firmly <hi>assent</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> of such a thing, as to the <hi>Truth</hi> of a <hi>clearer</hi> thing, upon clearer <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Thus I may as firmly <hi>assent,</hi> that there are such <hi>places</hi> as the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> upon the constant report of men, as that the <hi>three angles of a triangle, are equal to two right angles:</hi> I say not, the <hi>evidence</hi> is the <hi>same,</hi> but that the <hi>Assent</hi> may be as <hi>firm.</hi> You cannot then destroy the <hi>certainty of Assent,</hi> which is required to <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> by telling men, that the <hi>Arguments</hi> they rely on, are but <hi>moral Arguments:</hi> And by this, you may see, there may be a degree far beyond <hi>probability</hi> in the <hi>Assent,</hi> where the Arguments in themselves considered, may be called <hi>probable</hi>; or rather, that <hi>Moral certainty</hi> may be a most <hi>firm, rational,</hi> and <hi>undoubted certainty.</hi> Your following discourse <hi>between the Bishop and Heathen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 73.</note> run upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mistake, as though his intention were to prove first the <hi>Bible</hi> to be <hi>God's Infallible Word,</hi> before he would prove <hi>Christian Religion to be true,</hi> which I have already shewed you, is a mistake, which appears sufficiently by his own words, <hi>of proving the Christian Religion to stand upon surer grounds than any other Religion</hi>; not only than <hi>that one</hi> which the <hi>Heathen</hi> believed, but <hi>any other</hi> in the world: and therefore your Objection is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that for all this, <hi>a third Religion may be truer than both.</hi> Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining discourse proves nothing at all, but on the former Supposition; and therefore, supposing his intention be to prove <hi>Christianity</hi> to be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> his Argument <hi>from the power of it over the Devil,</hi> follows plainly enough. And when he mentions the <hi>evidence of it out of Scripture,</hi> he doth not suppose the belief of it <hi>as an infallible Word of God,</hi> but only as of any other <hi>history,</hi> and therefore is far from such a <hi>petitio principii,</hi> as you imagine. That which <hi>the Bishop saith, may reasonably be supposed, as a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in Divinity</hi> (as there are <hi>postulata</hi> in other Sciences) is not the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Doctrine, or Revelation,</hi> but the <hi>Credibility</hi> of both, in order to further <hi>Conviction</hi> concerning their <hi>Infallibility</hi>; for, unless the <hi>Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of it be first assumed as a <hi>Principle,</hi> men will not use the means in order to conviction of its <hi>Infallibility.</hi> And in this sense he doth not contradict himself, nor unsay what he had said before; and that this was his sense, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the last words of that discourse, <hi>That a meer natural man may be thus far convinced, that the Text of God is a very credible Text.</hi> Thus we see,<note place="margin">P. 80. n. 18.</note> how much, notwithstanding your protestation to the contrary, <hi>You have wronged the Bishop, both by falsly imposing on him, and dissembling the force of his Argument:</hi> And how unjust that imputation is, <hi>That if his Doctrine had been held in the Primitive Church, it would have laid the world under an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of being converted to Christianity</hi>; whereas I have shewed how
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101069:102"/>
consonant his way is, as I explained it, both to reason, and the proceedings of the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> in the conversion of learned <hi>Heathens.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Scept.</hi> Sir, I understand by a <hi>great Book of yours,</hi> that you have only ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the right course to convince such persons as my self, who are a little doubtful concerning the received Principles of Religion in the world; for the wisest I have conversed with, of those who own those things, do offer only to prove them by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> which, I understand, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, <hi>as a way to make all men such as I am:</hi> but that you have an excellent <hi>recipe</hi> for men under my <hi>distemper</hi>; for you promise them <hi>no less then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty</hi> in all things you require them to believe, which is a thing I have been so long seeking for, and have yet so unhappily mist of, that I cannot but rejoyce in meeting with such <hi>a healing Priest,</hi> who offers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing short of <hi>Infallibility</hi> in all matters of <hi>Religion.</hi>

                  <hi>T. C.</hi> Sir, I question not, but before you and I part, I shall cure those <hi>distorted joynts</hi> of your mind, and instead of being a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> make you a sound <hi>Catholick.</hi> For indeed it is true, what you say, That those who would convince you by reason, do but offer to make you more a <hi>Sceptick</hi> than you are, at least, <hi>you can have no Divine Faith at all upon such princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>; but if you will follow my counsel, I doubt not but to make <hi>you In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly certain</hi> in the things we require you to believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scept.</hi> I see then there is hope of a cure for me; but I pray tell me what that is I must be <hi>Infallibly certain</hi> of, and by what means I shall attain it. I would therefore in the <hi>first place</hi> be <hi>Infallibly certain</hi> of the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>immortality of souls,</hi> for these I take to be the principles of all Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scept.</hi> But would you have me attain <hi>Infallible certainty,</hi> without any <hi>reason</hi> that is <hi>Infallible?</hi> But because you quarrel with my method, I will yield to yours, but let me desire to know first, <hi>What those things are which I must believe upon this Infallibility?</hi> and then, <hi>Whether nothing short of this Infallible certainty will serve in order to Faith?</hi> for if so, I must confess my self not only a <hi>Sceptick</hi> but an <hi>Infidel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>T. C. <hi>All objects of Faith must be believed with Infallible certainty,</hi> and nothing short of <hi>that</hi> can be <hi>true Faith,</hi> for <hi>true Divine Faith must rely on Divine Authority,</hi> or some <hi>Word of God:</hi> now because you cannot rely <hi>on Gods written Word</hi> for the <hi>Divine Authority of it self,</hi> you must rely on some <hi>Divine unwritten Word</hi>; which can be no other but what is delivered by the <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> of the <hi>present Roman Church.</hi>

                  <hi>Scept.</hi> I was in hopes, you intended my cure, but now I perceive you aim at making me worse; for I never heard so many things uttered in a breath with so great confidence, and so little shew of reason; that if I were not a <hi>Sceptick</hi> already, I should commence one now. You tell me
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101069:102"/>
indeed very magisterially, that I cannot believe without <hi>Infallibility,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Faith</hi> must rely on a <hi>Divine Testimony</hi>; this <hi>Divine Testimony</hi> is not in <hi>Scripture</hi> (as you call it) but in the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>present Roman Church</hi>; I find my doubts so increase by this discourse of yours, that they all croud so to get out, I know not how to propose them in order, but as well as I can. You tell me the ground why you require <hi>Infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> is, because <hi>Faith</hi> must rest on <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> and that this <hi>Authority</hi> must be that of <hi>your Church,</hi> which you say is <hi>Infallible</hi>: these things therefore I desire of you, <hi>first,</hi> to shew <hi>how your Churches Authority comes to be Divine.</hi> 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>T.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scept.</hi> I took you for a <hi>Priest</hi> before, but now I take you for an absolute <hi>conjurer:</hi> but I confess, I like this <hi>discourse</hi> well, for I perceive your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is built on such <hi>grounds,</hi> as you never intend should be understood, wherein I commend your <hi>discretion</hi>; for these <hi>distinctions</hi> will doubtless do your work among silly and ignorant people, which are a great part of mankind and much the greatest of your <hi>Church.</hi> I am therefore infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied with this answer to my <hi>first question</hi>; answer but the rest so, and I promise you to be less a <hi>Sceptick</hi> then ever I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T. C.</hi> to your second, <hi>How her Testimony comes to be Infallible</hi>; because I perceive you are <hi>an understanding person,</hi> I will acquaint you with our way. The <hi>Hereticks</hi> trouble us with this <hi>question</hi> above all others: for they presently cry out, If you know the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>Infallible</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Church Infallible</hi> by <hi>Scripture,</hi> we run into a <hi>Circle</hi>; and this we know as well as they, but do not think fit to let the people know it, and therefore we tell them of <hi>things being known in themselves and to us,</hi> between <hi>the formal object and the Infallible witness,</hi> between <hi>the principal cause and a condition prerequisite,</hi> between <hi>proving of it to Hereticks and to our selves</hi>; but I see some of my brethren of late have been much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some things with <hi>vizards</hi> upon them called <hi>Motives of credibility,</hi> and the generality are so frighted with them, that they will rather say they are satisfied then ask any more <hi>questions</hi>; but if they do, these do so little in <hi>truth</hi> belong to our <hi>Church,</hi> that then we storm, and sweat, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101069:103"/>
cry out upon them as <hi>Atheists,</hi> and that it is impossible they should believe any Religion who question them; and if that doth it not, then we patter over the former <hi>distinctions</hi> as we do our <hi>prayers,</hi> and hope they are both in an <hi>unknown tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scept.</hi> Well, I see you are the man like to give me <hi>satisfaction</hi>; I pray to your third question, <hi>How I may be Infallibly certain of this Infallibility?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T.C.</hi> that is a question never asked by <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and if we find any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it whom we hoped to proselyte, we give them <hi>hard words</hi> and leave them; for because we offer to prove our <hi>Infallibility</hi> by only <hi>motives of credibility,</hi> they presently ask us, Whether our <hi>Infallibility</hi> be <hi>an Article of Faith?</hi> if it be, then they may believe an <hi>Article of Faith without Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty,</hi> and then what need our <hi>Churches Infallibility?</hi> and then to what end do we quarrel with their <hi>Faith</hi> for being built on greater <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of credibility?</hi> which being such untoward questions we see there is no good to be done on them and so leave them: but in our <hi>Books</hi> we are sure to cry out of the <hi>fallibility</hi> and <hi>uncertainty</hi> of the <hi>Faith of Protestants,</hi> because they acknowledge their <hi>Churches not Infallible,</hi> and cry up our <hi>Church</hi> because she <hi>pretends</hi> to it; if they ask, How we prove it, we seek to confound the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>question,</hi> and run out into the <hi>necessity of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word,</hi> or bring such <hi>motives</hi> as hold only for the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Apostolical Church,</hi> and make them serve ours too. If all this will not do, we have other <hi>shifts</hi> still, but it is not yet fit to discover them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scept.</hi> To your fourth <hi>Question</hi> (and then I will tell you my judgement) <hi>How your Church comes to be called or accounted the Catholick Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>T.

But still we say, such a <hi>Faith</hi> is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Infallible,</hi> that it is not built on any sufficient or satisfactory ground, for the <hi>motive</hi> of it is that, which may be <hi>false</hi> as well as <hi>true</hi>; for he that <hi>assents</hi> to any thing on the Authority of any <hi>Church,</hi> before he doth judge whether her Authority be to be relyed on absolutely or no, may believe a <hi>falshood</hi> assoon as truth upon that <hi>Authority</hi>; and the more he makes this his foundation, the more he is in danger of being deceived. As suppose a Child brought up in <hi>Turky</hi> and instructed in that <hi>Religion</hi>; he is told that he must without examination believe <hi>Mahomets Alcoran</hi> to be <hi>Divine; and he must neither doubt of this, nor of any other Article of Faith, universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received among Mahumetans:</hi> may not such a one as invincibly believe the Authority of the <hi>Turkish Church</hi> (if we may call it so) as your <hi>Child</hi> doth the Authority of your <hi>Church?</hi> Where then lies the difference? you see plainly, it cannot be in the <hi>Motive</hi> to Faith, for the <hi>Authority</hi> is supposed equally <hi>Infallible</hi> in both; but it lies in the evidence of <hi>truth</hi> in one Religion above the other, and this requires something more then the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church, viz.</hi> judgement and diligent examination. And then Faith is built on a sure ground. Remember then, that we enquire not what abatements God makes for the <hi>prejudices</hi> of <hi>education</hi> in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not believing any Religion; nor how <hi>God</hi> intends to deal with them, who through age or other invincible prejudices are uncapable of judging the evidence of truth in any Religion; but what are the certain

                  <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which sober and understanding men may and ought to build their belief of true Religion upon. But you proceed, and <hi>suppose your young Christian to live, and apply himself to study, and becomes a learned man, and then upon the Churches recommendation betakes himself to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, upon which by the light he discovers in it he finds the Faith he had before, was but a humane perswasion and not a Divine Faith, and consequently that he had no saving Faith of any Article of Christian belief, and so was out of the state of Salvation; from whence</hi> (you say) <hi>will spring gripes and torture of spirit among Christians.</hi> And why so? What, because they discern greater reason to believe then ever they did, <hi>must they find gripes and torture of spirit?</hi> I had thought, the more <hi>light</hi> men had found, <hi>i. e.</hi> the more <hi>reason</hi> for <hi>believing,</hi> the more peace and contentment they had in their minds. And so I verily believe it is: but probably your meaning is, <hi>This Doctrine will cause gripes and torture of spirit in those who have no other foundation of Faith, but your Churches authority, and never enquire after more:</hi> If it does so, much good may they do them; and I verily believe, Such doubts may tend more to their satisfaction at last, than their present security; and a Doctrine which tends to convince the world of the folly and unreasonableness of such a kind of <hi>implicite Faith,</hi> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitableness of it to the nature of <hi>Religion</hi> in general, but more especially the <hi>Christian</hi> (whose great commendation is, that it puts men upon so much searching and enquiry into the truth of it) would tend more to the good of the <hi>Christian world,</hi> than any of those <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>easie principles</hi> which you seek to keep men in <hi>obedience</hi> by, and that I am afraid more to your <hi>Church</hi> than to <hi>Christ.</hi> Why then such a Doctrine should cause <hi>needless gripes and tortures of spirit,</hi> I cannot imagine: it must certainly be a great confirmation to the <hi>mind</hi> of any good man to see still further <hi>reason</hi> for his <hi>Faith,</hi> by which it grows more radicated and confirmed. Or would you have a man disquiet himself, because he is not still a Child? much such a kind of thing this is, that a mans mind must be <hi>tortured,</hi> because his <hi>Faith</hi> grows <hi>stronger</hi>; for we assert that there are <hi>degrees</hi> in Faith; which you who make all Faith <hi>Infallible</hi> cannot do, unless you suppose an <hi>Infallible thing</hi> may grow more <hi>Infallible.</hi> And if all true Faith be <hi>Infallible,</hi> how can men pray for the <hi>increase of Faith,</hi> unless they pray for the increase of their <hi>Infallibility</hi>; which is a prayer, I suppose, not many in your <hi>Church</hi> are allowed to make, for then what becomes of your <hi>Popes prerogative,</hi> when not only every one among you is supposed to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> but hopes as well as prayes to be more <hi>Infallible,</hi> which is more then your <hi>Pope</hi> or your <hi>Church</hi> dares pretend to.</p>
               <p>But whether Doctrine tends more to <hi>inward gripes</hi> and <hi>tortures of spirit,</hi> yours or ours, let any reasonable man judge; for we assert that <hi>true Faith</hi> is capable of <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>augmentation,</hi> but you assert that there is no <hi>Divine Faith</hi> but what is <hi>Infallible</hi>; when therefore men by reflection upon themselves are so far from finding such an <hi>Infallibility</hi> in their <hi>assent,</hi> that they combat with many <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> as we see the <hi>Apostles</hi> did even after the <hi>resurrection of Christ</hi>; you must pronounce that the <hi>Apostles</hi> when they questioned <hi>Christs resurrection</hi> from the dead had no <hi>Divine Faith</hi> at all: for it is plain they were far from an <hi>Infallible assent</hi> to it, <hi>when Christ upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,</hi>

S. <hi>Peter,</hi> for whom <hi>Christ</hi> prayed that his <hi>Faith should not fail,</hi> and from the <hi>indesectibility</hi> of whose Faith you derive that of the <hi>Pope</hi> (but here you may see what a certain Foundation you have for it, when it is so apparent here, that S. <hi>Peter's Faith</hi> did fail, and that as to so important <hi>an Article of Faith,</hi> as <hi>Christ's own Resurrection</hi>; for certainly, S. <hi>Peter</hi> was one of the eleven.) Nay, Doth not <hi>Christ upbraid</hi> them for their <hi>unbelief, in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them that had seen him after he was risen?</hi> We see then, <hi>Christ</hi> chides them for not resolving their <hi>Faith</hi> into a humane and moral Testimony: If you had been there, no doubt you must have told him, <hi>He was mistaken in the nature of Faith, which could rest on nothing but an infallible Testimony; and unless he shewed you by sufficient Motives, that those persons who saw him risen, were infallible, for all his haste you were not bound to believe him.</hi> But, whether Christ or you be the more infallible, judge you. We see our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> requires no more <hi>Assent,</hi> than the <hi>nature</hi> of the thing will bear; nay, he upbraids those who will not believe upon <hi>Moral and Humane Testimony</hi>; but you say just the contrary, as though you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to contradict him: But that is sufficient Argument to all <hi>Christians,</hi> of the falsity and folly of your Doctrine, which tends to no other end, but to make all considering men <hi>Scepticks,</hi> or <hi>Atheists.</hi> For, when you lay it down as a certain Maxim, that no <hi>Faith</hi> can be <hi>Divine,</hi> but what is <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi>; and they find no such <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the grounds or the nature of mens <hi>Assent,</hi> What then follows, but those worst sort of <hi>gripes and tortures,</hi> such as argue an inward <hi>Convulsion</hi> of mind, and bring men to a greater Question, Whether there be any such thing, as that you call true <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> in the world. You go on with your <hi>Catechumen's discourse,</hi> who must suppose, <hi>Either that the Church taught, that he was to believe Scripture infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, upon her own infallible Testimony, or not; If so, then he reflects, that this Church hath plainly deceived him, and all others, who believed upon that Supposition, and so exposed them all to the hazard of eternal damnation; and therefore was no True Church, but a deceiver.</hi>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101069:105"/>
of amendment of them, excuse your <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Imposture</hi> if you can; for my part, I cannot, nor any one else who throughly considers it. For the <hi>second</hi>; it will follow indeed, that the Testimony of your <hi>Church</hi> is as much as nothing, as to any <hi>infallible Foundation of Faith</hi>; but yet it may be of great <hi>use</hi> for conveying <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> to us, and so by that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> into our hands, as the <hi>infallible Rule of Faith.</hi> To the <hi>third</hi>; it by no means follows, that there is nothing but the <hi>sole Letter of Scripture</hi> left to convince us of the <hi>Divine Authority of Scripture</hi>; I hope the <hi>working Miracles, fulfilling Prophecies,</hi> the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>reasonableness of the Doctrine of Scriptures,</hi> are all left besides the bare letter of Scripture; and these, we say, are sufficient to make us believe, that the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the infallible Word of God.</p>
               <p>Now your <hi>profound Christian</hi> begins to reflect on the <hi>Bishops way, which is</hi> (say you) <hi>That the Testimony of the Church is humane and fallible,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>and that the belief of the Scripture rests upon the Scripture it self.</hi> But, it will be more to our purpose, to hear the <hi>Bishop</hi> deliver his own mind, than to hear you so lamely deliver it;<note place="margin">P. 83.</note> which, in short, he summs up thus. <hi>A man is probably led by the Authority of the present Church, as by the first informing, inducing, perswading means, to believe the Scripture to be the Word of God: But, when he hath studied, considered, and compared this Word with its self, and with other writings, with the help of ordinary grace, and a mind morally induced, and reasonably perswaded by the voice of the Church, the Scripture then gives greater, and higher Reasons of Credibility to it self, than Tradition alone could give. And then, he that believes, resolves his last and full Assent, that Scripture is of Divine Authority, into internal Arguments found in the Letter it self, though found by the help of Tradition without, and Grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> This is the substance of his <hi>Lordship's</hi> Opinion, against which we shall now consider what your Discourser hath to object.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">P. 76.</note>1. The <hi>first,</hi> is from the case of <hi>ignorant and illiterate persons; such, who either through want of learning could not read the Scripture, and examine, or else made little use of it, because they supposed they might have infallible Faith without it; What then becomes of millions of such souls, both in former and present times?</hi> To that I answer; Although the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and carelesness of men in a matter of so great consequence, be so great in all <hi>ages,</hi> as is not to be justified, because all men ought to endeavour after the highest waies of <hi>satisfaction,</hi> in a matter so nearly concerning them (and it is none of the least things to be blamed in your Church, that she doth so much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance this ignorance, and neglect of the <hi>Scripture</hi>) yet for such persons, who either morally, or invincibly, are hindered from this capacity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining <hi>Scripture,</hi> there may be sufficient means for their <hi>Faith</hi> to be built upon. For, although such illiterate persons cannot themselves see, and read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> yet, as many as do believe, do receive the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it, by that <hi>sense</hi> by which <hi>Faith</hi> is conveyed, that is, <hi>Hearing</hi>; and by that means they have so great <hi>certainty,</hi> as excludes all <hi>doubting,</hi> that such <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and such <hi>matters of fact,</hi> are contained in these <hi>Books,</hi> by which they come to the understanding of the nature of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and are capable of judging concerning the <hi>Divinity</hi> of it. For the <hi>Light</hi> spoken of in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> is not a <hi>Light</hi> to the <hi>eye,</hi> but to the <hi>mind</hi>; now the <hi>mind</hi> is capable of this <hi>Light,</hi> as well by the <hi>ear,</hi> as by the <hi>eyes.</hi> The case then of such <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest illiterate persons,</hi> as are not capable of reading <hi>Scripture,</hi> but diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and devoutly hear it read to them, is much of the same nature with those who heard the <hi>Apostles</hi> preach this <hi>Doctrine</hi> before it was writ. For,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101069:105"/>
whatever was an Argument to such to believe the <hi>Apostles</hi> in what they spake, becomes an Argument to such who hear the same things, which are certainly conveyed to us, by an <hi>unquestionable Tradition:</hi> So that nothing hinders, but such illiterate persons may resolve their <hi>Faith</hi> into the same <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> which others do, only those are conveyed to them by the <hi>ear,</hi> which are conveyed to others by the <hi>eyes.</hi> But, if you suppose persons so rude and illiterate, as not to understand any thing, but that they are to believe as the <hi>Church</hi> believes; do you, if you can, resolve their <hi>Faith</hi> for them; for my part, <hi>I cannot,</hi> and am so far from it, that I have no reason to <hi>believe</hi> they can have any.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>second</hi> thing objected by your discourser, is, <hi>That if the Churches judgement be fallible, then much more ones own judgement is fallible. And therefore, if, notwithstanding all the care and pains taken by the Doctors of the Church, their perswasion was only humane and fallible; What reason hath any particular person to say, That he is divinely and infallibly certain by his reading the Scripture, that it is Divine Truth.</hi> But, 1. Is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>Churches Perswasion,</hi> and the <hi>Churches Tradition?</hi> Doth the <hi>Bishop deny,</hi> but the perswasion of the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> as that of any particular person? But this he denies, that they can derive that <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>grounds</hi> of their <hi>Perswasion</hi> into their <hi>Tradition,</hi> so as those who are to receive it on their Testimony, may be competent Judges of it. May we not then suppose their Tradition to be <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>fallible,</hi> whose perswasion of what they deliver, is established on <hi>infallible grounds?</hi> As a <hi>Mathematician</hi> is demonstratively convinced himself of the Truth of any particular <hi>Problem</hi>; but, if he bids another <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> it on his <hi>Testimony,</hi> the other thereby hath no <hi>demonstrative evidence</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, but only so great <hi>moral evidence,</hi> as the <hi>Testimony</hi> of that person carries along with it. The case is the same here: Suppose those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the <hi>Church</hi> in every <hi>Age</hi> of it, have to themselves <hi>infallible evidence</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> yet when they are to deliver this to be believed by others, unless their <hi>Testimony</hi> hath <hi>infallible evidence</hi> in it, men can never have more than <hi>humane</hi> or <hi>moral certainty</hi> of it. 2. It doth not at all follow, that if the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>fallible,</hi> no particular person can be <hi>infallibly assured</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> unless this assurance did wholly depend upon that <hi>Testimony</hi>; indeed, if it did so, the Argument would hold, but otherwise it doth not at all. Now, you know, the <hi>Bishop</hi> denies that the <hi>Faith</hi> of any particular <hi>person</hi> doth rest upon the judgement of the <hi>Church</hi>; only he saith, This may be a <hi>Motive</hi> and <hi>Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to men, to consider further; but that which they rely upon, is, that <hi>rational evidence</hi> which appears in the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He goes on, and argues against this use of Tradition, thus, <hi>If the Light of the Scripture be insufficient to shew it self, unless it be introduced by the recommendation of the Church; How came</hi> Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, Husse, <hi>&amp;c. to discover this Light in it, seeing they rejected the Authority of all visible Churches in the world,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Sure your Discourser was not very profound in this, that could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between the <hi>Authority of Vniversal Tradition,</hi> and <hi>the Authority of the present visible Church,</hi> or between the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of it. Shew us where <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. did ever reject the <hi>Authority</hi> of an <hi>uncontrouled Vniversal Tradition,</hi> such as that here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned concerning the <hi>Scriptures being the Word of God:</hi> Shew us where they deny that <hi>Vse</hi> of the Testimony of those <hi>Churches,</hi> whose Authority
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101069:106"/>
in imposing <hi>matters of Faith</hi> they denied, which his <hi>Lordship</hi> asserts, <hi>viz.</hi> to be a means to introduce men to the knowledge and belief of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>; and, unless you shew this, you do nothing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He argues against that <hi>Light</hi> in Scripture, <hi>because it is not sufficient to distinguish Canonical Books from such as are not so; For</hi> (saies he) <hi>Had not the Ancient Primitive Fathers in the first three hundred years, as much reason and ability to find this Light in Scripture, as any particular person? Yet many Books which do appear to us to be God's Word, by their Light, did not appear to be so to them by it, till they were declared such by the Catholick Church.</hi> I answer, 1. Where doth his <hi>Lordship</hi> ever say, or pretend, that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by the <hi>Light</hi> contained in the <hi>Books,</hi> can distinguish <hi>Books</hi> that are <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical,</hi> from such as are not? All that can be discovered, as to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Books</hi> in question, is, the examination of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> contained in them by the <hi>series</hi> of that, which is in the unquestionable Books; for, we know, that <hi>God</hi> can never speak <hi>contradictions:</hi> but still this will only serve to exclude such <hi>Books</hi> as contain things contrary, but not to admit all which have no <hi>Doctrine</hi> contrary to <hi>Scripture.</hi> 2. The reason why the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> questioned any <hi>Books</hi> that we do not, was not because they could not discover that <hi>Light</hi> in them, which we do; for neither can we discover so much <hi>Light</hi> in any particular Book, as meerly from thence to say, It is <hi>Canonical</hi>; but there was not sufficient <hi>evidence</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to them, that those <hi>Copies</hi> did proceed from <hi>Apostolical persons</hi>; and this was therefore only an Argument of that commendable care and caution which was in them, lest any Book should pass for <hi>Canonical,</hi> which was not really so. 3. When the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> declared any controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Book to be <hi>Canonical</hi>; Did not the <hi>Church</hi> then see as much Light in it as we do? but that <hi>Light</hi> which both the <hi>Church</hi> and we discover, is not a discriminating <hi>Internal Light,</hi> but an <hi>External Evidence</hi> from the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and validity of <hi>Testimony.</hi> And such we have for the <hi>Canonical Books of the Old Testament</hi>; and therefore you have no cause to quarrel with us, <hi>for receiving them from the Jewish Synagogue</hi>; For who, I pray, are so competent witnesses of what is delivered, as they who received it? and the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, <hi>That to the Jews were committed the Oracles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence your discoursing <hi>Christian</hi> argues, <hi>That if one take up the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture on the account of Tradition, then, if one should deny S.</hi> Matthew<hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to be the written Word of God, he could not be accounted an Heretick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not sufficiently propounded to him to be God's Word.</hi> Whether such a person may be accounted a <hi>Heretick</hi> in your sense, or no, I am sure he is in S. <hi>Paul's,</hi> because <gap reason="foreign">

For my part, should I see, or hear any <hi>Church</hi> in the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking such an office as that, I should be so far from thinking it more
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101069:106"/>
sufficiently propounded by it, that I should not scruple to charge it with the greatest presumption and arrogance that may be. For, on what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count can it possibly be a thing credible to me, that S. <hi>Matthew's Gospel</hi> contains <hi>God's written Word</hi> any further, than it is evident that the <hi>person</hi> who wrote it, was one chosen by <hi>Christ,</hi> to deliver the summe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> to the world? And therefore I have no reason to think, he would deceive men in what he spake or writ: The only Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion then is, How I should know this is no counterfeit name, but that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> writ it? Let us consider, what possible means there are to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of it. I cannot imagine any but these two; Either that <hi>God</hi> should immediately reveal it either to my self, or to some <hi>Church</hi> to propound it to me; or else, that I am to believe those <hi>persons</hi> who first received those <hi>Copies</hi> from his hands, by whose means they were dispersed abroad in the world, from whence they are conveyed by an <hi>unquestionable Tradition</hi> down to us. Of these two, chuse whether you please: if the <hi>first,</hi> then particular <hi>immediate Revelations</hi> are necessary to particular persons, to have such an <hi>Object of Faith</hi> sufficiently propounded to them, and then the <hi>Church</hi> cannot authoritatively pronounce any <hi>Books of Scripture</hi> to be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical,</hi> without immediate Revelation to her, that this Book was written by such a person, who was <hi>divinely assisted</hi> in the writing of it. And this you have denied before to belong to the <hi>Church.</hi> If you take up with the <hi>second,</hi> the <hi>unquestionable Testimony of all Ages, since the Apostles</hi>; then judge you whether S. <hi>Matthew's Gospel</hi> be not sufficiently propounded to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and consequently, Whether any one who should question or deny it, be not guilty of the greatest peevishness and obstinacy imaginable. From hence we may see, with what superfluity of discretion the next words came from you; <hi>Nay, hence it follows, that even our blessed Saviour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 77.</note> 
                  <hi>who is Wisdom it self, would have been esteemed by all the world, not a wise Law-giver, but a meer</hi> Ignoramus <hi>and Impostor.</hi> For shame, man, forbear such insolent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions for the future, and repent of these. For, Must <hi>Christ's Wisdom</hi> be called in question, and he liable to be accounted an <hi>Ignoramus and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor</hi>; if he doth not make your <hi>Church infallible?</hi> I have told you often before, how much your <hi>Doctrine of Infallibility</hi> tends to <hi>Atheism,</hi> and now you speak out. For the meaning of your words plainly, is, <hi>If God hath not entrusted your Church with a full and absolute power to declare what is his will, and what not, Christ was an</hi> Ignoramus <hi>and Impostor.</hi> For that is the substance of your next words. <hi>For, had he not framed, think you, a strange and Chimerical Common-wealth, were it alone destitute of a full and absolute power, to give an authentical and unquestionable declaration, which is the true and genuine Law.</hi> Now, it is evident from all your discourse foregoing, you only plead for this full and absolute power in <hi>your Church</hi>; and judge you then what the consequence is (to all those who cannot see any shadow of reason for this your pretended Infallibility) neither more nor less, than that <hi>Christ is liable to be accounted by all the world an</hi> Ignoramus <hi>and Impostor:</hi> Nay, that they are <hi>fools,</hi> who account him not so, if they do not believe this <hi>present Infallibility of your Church; for it is apparent</hi> (say you) <hi>that he hath ordered his Common-wealth worse than ever any one did.</hi> And now let any that consider what pitiful silly proofs you have produced for this present Infallibility, (nay, such, that I am confident, that you cannot think your self you have in the least measure proved it) then judge, what thoughts of <hi>Christ</hi> you are forced to entertain your self upon your own Argument, <hi>viz. as of an Ignoramus and Impostor.</hi> Hath not your <hi>Infallibility</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:101069:107"/>
lead you now a fine dance? Is not this the way to make <hi>Faith certain,</hi> and to reclaim <hi>Atheists?</hi> I had thought it had been enough for your <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> to have charged <hi>Christ with indiscretion,</hi> if he had not left a <hi>Vicar</hi> on earth; but now, it seems, the <hi>profound Philosophers, learned Divines,</hi> and <hi>expert Historians</hi> (for such a one, you told us, your discoursing <hi>Christian</hi> was supposed by you to be in whose name these words are spoken) do charge <hi>Christ</hi> with folly and imposture, if he hath not made your <hi>Church infallible.</hi> For, shift it off, as you can, you cannot deny but that must be the aim of these words: for you are proving the necessity of an <hi>infallible Declaration</hi> by the <hi>present Church,</hi> in order to a <hi>sufficient Proposition</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi>; and it is notorious you never pretend that any <hi>Church</hi> hath any share in this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but your own; And therefore the consequence unavoidably follows, that since there can be no <hi>sufficient Proposition,</hi> that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be believed without this <hi>infallible Testimony</hi>; since no <hi>Church</hi> pretends to this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but <hi>yours</hi>; since, without such provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the <hi>Church, Christ would have been esteemed by all the world not a wise Law-giver, but a meer</hi> Ignoramus <hi>and Impostor</hi>; What then follows, but that if your <hi>Church</hi> be not <hi>infallible,</hi> He must be accounted so? And if you dread not these consequences; I hope all <hi>Christians</hi> do, and have never the better thoughts of your <hi>Infallibility</hi> for them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let us see, how he comes closer to the matter it self; and examines how <hi>this Light should be Infallible, and Divine, supposing the Churches Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be humane and fallible.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 77.</note> The substance of which, is this, <hi>If the Church may erre, we may suppose she hath erred in testifying some Books to be God's Word; in that case, Books that were not God's Word, would be equally recommended with those that were: And that it would be impossible for any particular person, by reading them, to distinguish the one from the other.</hi> To which I answer 1. It is all one with you to suppose a <hi>Church fallible,</hi> and suppose that <hi>she hath erred.</hi> To put a case of a like nature. The Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all mankind is <hi>fallible</hi>; May you therefore suppose that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath <hi>erred</hi> in something they are agreed in? The Testimony of all those persons who have seen <hi>Rome,</hi> is fallible; May I therefore question whether they were not all deceived? But of this, afterwards. 2. When you speak of the <hi>Church erring,</hi> Do you mean the <hi>Church in every Age since Christ's Coming, concerning all the Books of Scripture?</hi> or, <hi>the present Church, concerning only some Books of Scripture?</hi> If you suppose, the <hi>Church</hi> of all <hi>Ages</hi> should be deceived, you must suppose some, who were <hi>infallible,</hi> should <hi>be deceived</hi>; those were the <hi>Apostles</hi> in writing and delivering their <hi>Books</hi> to the <hi>Churches</hi> of their time, or else you must suppose all the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Churches</hi> deceived in taking those <hi>Books</hi> to have come from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which did not; And is not this a congruous Supposition? Well then, if it be unreasonable to suppose the <hi>Apostolical Churches</hi> deceived, and impossible to imagine the <hi>Apostles</hi> deceived, in saying, They writ what they did not: Where then must such an universal-errour as this, come in? Or, Is it not equally unreasonable to suppose all the <hi>Christian Churches</hi> in the world should be deceived, without any questioning of such a deceit, supposing but the goodness and common providence of <hi>God</hi> in preserving such records, and the moral industry used by <hi>Christians,</hi> in a matter of such importance? It is therefore a very absurd and unreasonable thing to imagine, <hi>That all the Churches of Christ, in all Ages, should erre in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the Books of Scripture.</hi> Let us then see, as to the present <hi>Churches</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as to <hi>particular Books?</hi> 1. Either the <hi>Records</hi> of former <hi>Ages</hi> are
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101069:107"/>
left to judge by, or no? If they be, as certainly they are, we thereby see a way to correct the <hi>errour</hi> of the <hi>present Church,</hi> by appealing to these records of the <hi>Church</hi> in former times? if they be not left, how could any of these <hi>Books</hi> be derived from <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> when we have no means to <hi>trace</hi> such a <hi>Tradition</hi> by? 2. Supposing only some <hi>Books</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, or that the <hi>present Church</hi> erres only in some particular Books; then it appears that there remains a far greater number of such <hi>Books,</hi> whose Authority we have no reason at all to question, and by comparing the other with these we may easily prevent any very dangerous errour; for if they contain any <hi>Doctrine</hi> contrary to the former, we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe them; if they do not, there can be no very dangerous <hi>errour</hi> in admitting them. Thus you see how easily this <hi>errour</hi> is prevented supposing the <hi>Churches</hi> testimony not only fallible, but that it also should actually <hi>erre</hi> in delivering some <hi>Books</hi> for <hi>Canonical,</hi> which are not so: but supposing a <hi>Church</hi> pretends to be <hi>Infallible</hi> and is believed to be so, and yet doth actually <hi>erre</hi> in delivering the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> what remedy is there then? for while we look on the <hi>Churches</hi> testimony as <hi>fallible,</hi> there is scope and liberty left for enquiry and further <hi>satisfaction,</hi> but if it be looked on as <hi>Infallible,</hi> all that believe it to be so are left under an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of escaping that <hi>errour</hi> which she is guilty of. And the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous such an errour is, the worse the condition is of all such who believe the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> Infallible. Now this is that we justly charge your Church with, that while she pretends to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> she hath actually <hi>erred</hi> in delivering such <hi>Books</hi> for <hi>Canonical</hi> which are not so, as hath been abundantly manifested by the worthies of our Church. The remainder of this discourse of yours concerning knowing <hi>Canonical Books by the light in them,</hi> is vacated by our present answer; and so is the other concerning <hi>Apostolical traditions</hi> by our former, upon that subject. As to that Scruple, <hi>How the light should be Infallible and Divine, when the Churches Testimony is humane and fallible,</hi> it signifies nothing unless the light be only supposed to rise from the <hi>Testimony,</hi> which his Lordship denies.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The judgement of the Fathers is inquired into</hi> concerning the present subject; out of whom only <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and St. <hi>Augustin</hi> are produced,<note place="margin">¬ß. 16.</note> as affirming in many places, <hi>That the Tradition of the Church is sufficient to found Christian Faith even without Scripture, and that for some hundreds of years after the Canon of Scripture was written.</hi> But must we stand only to the judgement of these two concerning the sense of the Primitive <hi>Church</hi> in this present Controversie?

Doth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in these words say, that even these <hi>Barbarians</hi> did believe upon the <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> of the <hi>present Church?</hi> No; he mentions no such thing, but that they believed that <hi>Tradition of Doctrine</hi> which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them from the <hi>Apostles.</hi> I ask you then; Suppose at that time some <hi>honest</hi> but <hi>fallible persons</hi> should have gone into <hi>Scythia,</hi> or some such <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous places,</hi> and delivered the <hi>Doctrine of the Gospel,</hi> and attesting the <hi>matters of fact</hi> as being <hi>eye-witnesses of Christs Miracles, Death, and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> whether would these <hi>Barbarians</hi> have been bound to believe or no? If not, then for all I know, <hi>Infidelity</hi> is a very excusable sin; If they were, I pray tell me what it was their <hi>Faith</hi> was resolved into; was it an infallible testimony of fallible men?

Would any one now, but <hi>T. C.</hi> have ventured so unluckily upon this Treatise of St. <hi>Augustin</hi> above all others, to prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> as necessary to <hi>Faith</hi> by? Could any <hi>Protestant</hi> have delivered his mind more punctually and plainly than he doth? And can you, or any one else that doth but look into that Book, imagine that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> ever imagined, that any such thing should ever be thought of in the world, as that the Testimony of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> must be owned as the Infallible foundation of Faith, and the Infallible Interpreter of Scripture? But this it is, to converse with the <hi>Fathers</hi> only by <hi>retail,</hi> as they are delivered out in <hi>parcels</hi> to you with <hi>directions</hi> upon them what <hi>use</hi> they are for, by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and such Artists as himself. This is, instead of <hi>quoting</hi> the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to <hi>challenge</hi> them; and you see they are not afraid to appear, though to your shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
               <p>But for all this you have a Reserve in St. <hi>Augustin</hi> still: let us see what quotation that is, which lies so in <hi>Ambuscado</hi> behind the hedges, and is so loath to come out.

by Councils.</hi> Think you then, that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> ever thought of a present <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Church?</hi> or if he did, he expressed it in as odd a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ever I read: How easily might he have stopt the mouths of the <hi>Donatists</hi> with that one pretence of <hi>Infallibility?</hi> How impertinently doth he dispute through all those <hi>Books,</hi> if he had believed any such thing?

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>how can I ever be Infallibly certain, that she hath not erred</hi> de facto, <hi>and defined some Book to be the Word of God, which really is not his Word?</hi> To which I answer. If you mean by <hi>Infallible certainty,</hi> such a <hi>certainty</hi> as must have some <hi>Infallible Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> for the ground of it, you beg the question: for I deny any such <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Testimony</hi> to be at all requisite for our believing the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and therefore you object that as an inconvenience, which I apprehend to be none at all. For I do not think it any absurdity to say, that I cannot believe upon some <hi>Infallible Testimony,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> hath not <hi>erred</hi> in defining the <hi>Canon of Scripture.</hi> If by <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> you mean such a <hi>certainty</hi> as absolutely excludes a <hi>possibility of deception</hi>; you would do well, first to shew how congruous this is to <hi>humane nature</hi> in this present state, before you make such a <hi>certainty</hi> so necessary for any act of humane understanding. But, if by <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> you mean only such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all <hi>possibility of reasonable doubting</hi> upon the consideration of the validity and sufficiency of that <hi>Testimony</hi> I am to believe the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> upon; then I assert, that upon making the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> to be fallible, it doth not at all follow, but that I may have so great a certainty as excludes the <hi>possibility</hi> of all <hi>reasonable doubting</hi> concerning the <hi>Canon of Scripture.</hi> For when I suppose the <hi>Churches Testimony fallible,</hi> I do not thereby understand, as though there were <hi>as great reason to suspect her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as not,</hi> (nay, I say there can be no reason to suspect her deceived); but by that I understand only this, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath not any <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Infallibility</hi> given her in delivering such a <hi>Testimony,</hi> or that such <hi>Infallibility</hi> must be the foundation of believing the thing so delivered. For whether I suppose your particular <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> to be <hi>supernaturally Infallible</hi> in her Traditions, there will be the same difficulty returning, and an equal impossibility of vindicating our <hi>Faith</hi> from the entanglements of a Circle. For still the question unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably returns, From whence I believe such a <hi>supernatural Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Church?</hi> For in that it is <hi>supernatural</hi> it must suppose some <hi>promise</hi> on which it depends, that <hi>promise</hi> must be somewhere extant, and that can be no where but in <hi>Scripture</hi>; therefore when I am asked, Why I believe the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be true; if I answer, Because the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is <hi>Infallible,</hi> the question presently returns, Since humane nature is in it self fallible, whence comes the <hi>Church</hi> to have this Infallibility? If I answer, By the <hi>assistance of Gods spirit,</hi> I am presently asked, Since no man by the light of nature and meer reason can be assured of this; how know you that you are not deceived in believing such an <hi>assistance?</hi> If to this I answer, Because <hi>God</hi> who is Infallible hath made this <hi>promise</hi> in his <hi>Word,</hi> I am driven again to the <hi>first question, How I know
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101069:110"/>
this to be Gods Word,</hi> and must answer it as before, Upon the <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Testimony of the Catholick Church.</hi> Thus we see, how impossible it is to avoid a <hi>Circle</hi> in the supposition of a <hi>supernatural Infallibility</hi> in the Churches Tradition. But, if no more be meant but a kind of <hi>rational In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> (though those terms be not very proper) <hi>i. e.</hi> so <hi>great evidence,</hi> as, if I question it, I may, upon equal grounds, question every thing which mankind yields the <hi>firmest Assent</hi> to, because I cannot imagine, that so great a part of the <hi>wisest,</hi> and most considerative part of the world should be so grosly deceived in a matter of such moment (especially supposing a <hi>Divine Providence</hi>) then I freely and heartily assert, We have such a kind of <hi>rational Infallibility</hi>; or rather the highest degree of <hi>actual Certainty</hi> concerning the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Canon of Scripture</hi>; and that the <hi>Catholick Church hath not</hi> de facto, <hi>erred in defining it.</hi> Thus I have followed your discoursing Christian through all his doubts and perplexities, and upon the result, can find no ground at all either of doubting concerning the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or of believing the Testimony of your <hi>Church,</hi> or any, to be an <hi>infallible ground of Faith.</hi> Your next passage, is, to tell us <hi>how his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Dedalian windings</hi> (as you finely call them) <hi>are disintricated</hi>: A happy man you are at squaring Circles, and getting out of <hi>Labyrinths.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 78.</note> And thus it appears in the present case. For when his Lordship had said, <hi>That the Tradition of the Church is too weak, because that is not absolutely Divine</hi>; you repeat over your already exploded Proposition, that there may be <hi>an infallible Testimony which is not absolutely Divine</hi>; which, when I have your faculty of writing things, which neither you, nor any one else can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand I may admit of; but till then, I must humbly beg your pardon, as not being able to assent to any thing which I cannot understand, and have no reason to believe. And withall, contrary to your second Answer, it appears, <hi>That if the Testimony of the Primitive, were absolutely Divine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause infallible,</hi> the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>present Church,</hi> must be <hi>absolutely Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> if it be <hi>infallible.</hi>

               <p>The rest of this Chapter is spent in the examining some by-citations of men of your own side chiefly,<note place="margin">¬ß. 19.</note> and therefore it is very little material as to the truth or falshood of the present Controversie; yet, because you seem to triumph so much assoon as you are off the main business, I shall briefly return an Answer to the substance of what you say. His <hi>Lordship</hi> having asserted <hi>the Tradition of the Primitive Apostolical Church to be Divine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 81. n. 20.</note> and <hi>that the Church of</hi> England <hi>doth embrace that as much as any Church whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> withall adds, <hi>That when S.</hi> Augustine <hi>said, I would not believe the Gospel,</hi>

                  <hi>unless the Authority of the Catholick Church moved me; some of your own will not endure should be understood, save of the Church in the time of the Apostles only; and some, of the Church in general, not excluding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages: but sure to include Christ and his Apostles.</hi> In your Answer to this, you insult strangely over his <hi>Lordship</hi> in two things. <hi>First, That he should say Some, and mention but one in his Margent.</hi> 2. <hi>That that One doth not say, what he cites out of him.</hi> To the <hi>first</hi> I answer, you might easily observe, the use his <hi>Lordship</hi> makes of his <hi>Margent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n 7.</note> is not so much to bring clear and distinct proofs of what he writes in his Book, but what hath some <hi>reference</hi> to what he there saies; and therefore it was no absurdity for him to say in his Book indefinitely <hi>some,</hi> and yet in his Margent only to mention <hi>Occham.</hi> For, when his Lordship writ that, no doubt his mind was upon <hi>others,</hi> who asserted the same thing, though he did not <hi>load</hi> his

And, that you may see, I have reason for what I say, I hope you will not suppose his Lordship unacquainted with the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies</hi> of those of your side, who do in terms assert this. That I may therefore free you from all kind of suspicion; What think you of <hi>Gerson,</hi> when, speaking of the greater Authority of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> than <hi>of the present:</hi> he adds. <hi>And by this means we come to understand,</hi>

For, where it is evidently known, there was but <hi>one,</hi> it were a <hi>Soloecism</hi> to say <hi>some</hi>; as to say, that <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>Apostles betrayed Christ,</hi> when it is known, that <hi>none</hi> but <hi>Judas</hi> did it. But, if I should say, that <hi>some Jesuits</hi> had writ for the killing of <hi>Kings,</hi> and in the <hi>Margent</hi> should cite <hi>Mariana,</hi> no person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in their <hi>writings,</hi> would think it a <hi>Soloecism</hi>; for, though I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him for a remarkable Instance, yet that doth not imply, that I have <hi>none</hi> else to produce, but only that the mentioning of <hi>one,</hi> might shew I was not without proof of what I said. For your impudent oblique slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the memory of that <hi>excellent Prelate Arch-Bishop</hi> Cranmer, when you say, <hi>If a Catholick to disgrace the Protestant Primacy of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>should say, Some of them carried a holy Sister lockt up in a Chest about with them, and name</hi> Cranmer <hi>only in the Margent</hi>; His memory is infinitely above your slyest detractions; and withall, when you are about such a piece of <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism,</hi> I pray, tell me, what doth <hi>some of them</hi> relate to.

Though, I confess, it were a great injury in this case, to cite but <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>Margent,</hi> unless in pity to the Reader; yet, you may sooner vindicate <hi>some of them</hi> from a <hi>Soloecism</hi> in <hi>Language,</hi> when the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> went before, than <hi>any of them</hi> from those <hi>Soloecisms</hi> in <hi>manners,</hi> which your own Authours have complained of.</p>
               <p>But, say you, <hi>What if this singular-plural say no such thing, as the words alledged by the Bishop signifie?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 79.</note> I have already granted it to have been a very venial mistake of memory in his Lordship of <hi>Occham</hi> for <hi>Durandus</hi>;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:101069:111"/>
in whom those very words are which are in the Margent of his Lordships Book, as appears in the Testimony already produced. I acknowledge therefore, that <hi>Occham</hi> in that place of his <hi>Dialogues,</hi> doth speak of the <hi>Catholick Church of all Ages,</hi> comprehending the <hi>Apostles and Evangelists</hi> in it; and in this sense he saith, that place of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> is to be understood. But, what advantage this is to your cause, I cannot imagine. For, what if the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> be taken in that comprehensive sense, to include not only the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> successively from their times? Doth it hence follow, <hi>That it is not day though the Sun shines?</hi> Or rather, Doth it not follow, That you are not so <hi>quick-sighted</hi> as you would seem to be? And, Whether his Lordship or you come nearer the meaning of <hi>Occham</hi>'s words, let any one judge. For they who speak of the <hi>Church</hi> in that comprehensive sense, do only suppose the <hi>Infallibility</hi> to have been in the <hi>Primitive Apostolical Church,</hi> but the <hi>successive Church</hi> to be only the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of <hi>conveyance</hi> of that Testimony down to us, and so they say no more than we do.

But, say you, It is evident, that S. <hi>Augustine must speak of the Church in his time, because he speaks of that Church which said to him,</hi> Noli credere Manichaeo, <hi>which was not true of the Apostolical Church?</hi> But, Why might not the <hi>Apostolical Church</hi> be a reason to S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> not to believe <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he found no footsteps of his Doctrine in the <hi>Records</hi> of that Church? Again, suppose he means the <hi>present Church,</hi> Doth he mean the <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> of the <hi>present Church?</hi> Might not the Testimony of the <hi>Church,</hi> supposing it fallible, be sufficient for what S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith of it? I doubt it not: And, you seem to have no great confidence in this Testimony your self, when you add, <hi>That though it be a point of Faith to believe that the Church is infallible, in delivering Scripture to us, yet it is not a point of Faith, that her Infallibility is proved out of the cited place of S.</hi> Augustine. <hi>But, when</hi> you say, <hi>it is sufficient that it be clear and manifest out of the Text it self,</hi> what Text do you mean? S. <hi>Augustines,</hi> or the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> If S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines,</hi> you would do well to shew, by what engines you force <hi>Infallibility</hi> out of his words; if the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> What becomes of our <hi>good Motives of Credibility?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When his Lordship objects, <hi>That according to your Principles,</hi>

                  <hi>the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the present Church must be as infallible as that of the Primitive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 81. n. 21.</note> you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learnedly distinguish, <hi>That if he means, the one must be as truly and really infallible,</hi> quoad substantiam, <hi>as the other, you grant it: But if he mean,</hi>

                  <hi>the one must be as highly and perfectly infallible, as the other,</hi> quoad modum, <hi>you deny it.</hi> Very good still! It seems there are higher and lower degrees in Infallibility. I pray tell us, What that is which is <hi>more than infallible?</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:101069:112"/>
The <hi>present Church</hi> (you say) <hi>is infallible, but not so highly and perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> therefore there must be <hi>degrees</hi> in <hi>Infallibility</hi>; and since the lowest <hi>degree</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi> that which is <hi>highly infallible,</hi> must be <hi>more</hi> than <hi>infallible.</hi> Again, What difference is there between the <hi>substance</hi> and the <hi>mode</hi> in <hi>Infallibility</hi>; I had thought, the <hi>substance of Infallibility</hi> had layn in the <hi>mode</hi>; and I should rather think <hi>Infallibility it self</hi> to be a <hi>mode</hi> of <hi>Apprehension</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> then talk of <hi>substances and modes</hi> in it. But, it may be, you mean <hi>such kind of modes of Infallibility, as absolute and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical.</hi> If you do so, explain your self by them; and that we may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understand your meaning, shew us whether the <hi>Church</hi> be at all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>absolute Infallibility</hi>; if not<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> What difference there is in <hi>degrees</hi> between the <hi>hypothetical Infallibility of the present and Primitive Church,</hi> supposing both <hi>infallible</hi> in delivering their Testimony, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For you yet again add, <hi>Of the Churches Testimony being infallible, but not simply Divine,</hi> but it is the infallible Testimony of a desperate cause, to have but one bad shift, and to use it so often.</p>
               <p>Because you would be apt to say, That upon his <hi>Lordships</hi> rejecting the Infallibility of Tradition, he left no use at all of it; <hi>He therefore tells you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 82.</note> 
                  <hi>Notwithstanding that, it is serviceable for very good ends, that it induces Infidels to the reading and consideration of Scripture, and that it instructs novices, and doubters in the Faith; which two ends</hi> (you say) <hi>fall short of the end of Tradition; For</hi> (say you) <hi>it founds and establishes Believers, even the greatest Doctors of the Church</hi>; for which you cite again this same place of S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> But did not his <hi>Lordship</hi> tell you, that some of your own understood that very place, <hi>either of Novices or Infidels:</hi> For which, besides the Testimony of some of your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he adds this reason, <hi>because the words immediately before are, If thou find one</hi> qui Evangelio nondum credit, <hi>which did not yet believe the Gospel, What wouldst thou do to make him believe?</hi> Ego vero non, &amp;c. To which you very prudently say nothing.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Jacobus Almayn</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>That we are first, and more, bound to believe the Church than the Scripture</hi>; you would seem in terms to disavow it, though very faintly; <hi>it is not altogether true</hi>; and hope to salve it by a distinction of <hi>priority of time and nature</hi>: and you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>That in priority of nature we are first bound to believe the Church,</hi> and, I suppose, in priority of <hi>time</hi> too, if we believe the <hi>Scripture for the Churches sake: Yet, you would not have it said, That we are more bound to believe the Church than Scripture;</hi> but it is not what you would have properly said, but what follows from that antecedent, which <hi>Jacobus Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn</hi> puts. <hi>It is certain,</hi> saith he, <hi>that we are bound to believe all things contained in the Sacred Canon, upon that account alone, because the Church believes them; therefore we are first, and more, bound to believe the Church than the Scripture,</hi> which is so evident a consequence, that nothing but shame would make you deny it.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Almayn</hi>'s and <hi>Gerson</hi>'s reading <hi>compelleret</hi> for <hi>commoveret,</hi> his Lordship saith, That <hi>Almayn</hi> falsifies the Text notoriously; you say, <hi>No</hi>; but <hi>you had rather charitably think, they both read it so in some Copies</hi>; his Lordship produceth <hi>a very ancient M.S. for the common reading,</hi> you none at all for that, but only the concurrent Testimonies of <hi>some Schoolmen,</hi> who must be confessed to be <hi>excellent Criticks,</hi> and well versed in <hi>ancient M.SS.</hi> unless where they met with a <hi>little Greek,</hi> or some <hi>hard Latin words</hi>; and among whom, the mistake of one would pass current for
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101069:112"/>
want of examining <hi>Copies,</hi> let the Reader therefore judge, whether Judgement be more probable: But, I think it not worth while to say more about it.</p>
               <p>In your vindication of the Authority of <hi>Canus,</hi> you make use of a very silly piece of <hi>Sophistry</hi>; for, say you, <hi>Though he make Infidels and Novices in the Faith, to be convinced by the Authority of the Church; yet, you say, It doth not follow, that he makes the said Authority a fallible, but a certain and sure way to make them believe it.</hi> But, 1. The Question is, Whether <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> doth understand that place of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> of Infidels and Novices or no? 2. Suppose he sayes, <hi>It is a sure way,</hi> Doth it therefore follow, that it is <hi>an infallible way?</hi> Is nothing <hi>certain</hi> but what is <hi>infallible?</hi> I hope you are <hi>certain</hi> that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is the <hi>Cacholick Church</hi>; but, Are you <hi>infallible</hi> that she is so? If you advance all <hi>certainty</hi> to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or bring down all <hi>Infallibility</hi> to <hi>Certainty,</hi> every <hi>Christian</hi> is as <hi>infallible</hi> as your <hi>Church</hi> is: For, I make no question, but that every <hi>good Christian</hi> is <hi>certain</hi> of the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of his Religion. The same thing you return upon again (after to little purpose you multiply words about <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi>'s Testimonies.) For, say you, because S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks of a <hi>sure way,</hi> therefore he must mean an <hi>infallible way,</hi> as though what was not <hi>supernaturally infallible,</hi> was presently <hi>unsure.</hi> I pray, tell me, <hi>Are you sure that two and two make four?</hi> Yet, I hope you will not say, You are <hi>supernaturally infallible</hi> that they do so. I hope, you are sure, there is a <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and a goodly <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Cardinals</hi> there; but, Are you infallible in this? It is not then certainly the same, to deny a thing to be <hi>infallible,</hi> and to make it <hi>unsure:</hi> And, you are either very <hi>weak,</hi> or very <hi>wilful,</hi> in saying so. In what sense this so much controverted place of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> is to be understood, will be afterwards discussed; and whether it be intended wholly for <hi>Infidels</hi> or no: only I shall take notice now, how, in the <hi>last words</hi> of this Chapter, you would again inferr <hi>Infallibility</hi> from <hi>undoubted certainty. For,</hi> say you, <hi>the Church, in S.</hi> Augustine's <hi>time, esteemed her self undoubtedly certain, that the Gospel was the infallible Word of God; for otherwise she might be deceived her self, and deceive others in commanding them to believe that to be God's Word, which was only the word of man:</hi> But, What is it you would inferr from all this? For we believe the <hi>Church</hi> as undoubtedly <hi>certain,</hi> as may be, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>God's Word</hi>; yet we are far enough from believing that her Testimony now is <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally infallible.</hi>

Therefore for our more distinct method of proceeding, I shall first endeavour to prevent misunderstanding, by premising several things which are necessary for a through opening the state of the Controversie, and then come to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of it. The things then I would premise, are these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we enquire not after the <hi>reason, why we assent to what is divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed,</hi> but after the <hi>reason why we believe any thing to be a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> Therefore when men speak of the <hi>last resolution of Faith</hi> into the <hi>Veracity</hi> of <hi>God</hi> revealing, they speak that which is undoubtedly true, but it reacheth not our present enquiry. I freely grant, that the <hi>ultimate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> why any thing is believed, is upon the <hi>Testimony</hi> of him from whom it comes; and the greater the knowledge and fidelity is, of him whose Testimony I believe, the <hi>stronger</hi> my <hi>Assent</hi> is, supposing I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence that it is his Testimony. But that is our present Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, for it being taken for granted among all <hi>Christians,</hi> that <hi>God's Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> is <hi>absolutely infallible,</hi> there can no dispute arise concerning the ground of resolving <hi>Faith,</hi> supposing <hi>God's Revelation</hi> to be sufficiently known. For no one questions but <hi>God's Veracity</hi> however discovered, is a sufficient ground for Faith; but all the Question is, How we come to know wherein this <hi>Veracity</hi> of <hi>God</hi> doth discover it self; or what those
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101069:113"/>
things are which are immediately revealed by him. Therefore to tell us, that the <hi>resolution</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is into <hi>Gods Infallible Testimony,</hi> without shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what account this testimony is to be beleeved to be from <hi>God,</hi> is, to tell us that which no one doubts of, and to escape that which is the main question. For in case <hi>Isaac</hi> should have denyed submission to his <hi>Fathers</hi> will when he went to be sacrificed, till he could be satisfied concerning the lawfulness of that action which his <hi>Father</hi> went about; Do you think it had been satisfactory to him, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had told him, that <hi>God</hi> had power to relax his own <hi>Laws,</hi> and therefore he need not question the lawfulness of the action; might not <hi>Isaac</hi> have presently answered, That he did not question, that what <hi>God</hi> commanded was lawful, but that he desired, was, some evidence that he had a <hi>revelation</hi> for what he did. And the answer to this had been only pertinent and satisfactory. So that he might have no reason to question it, although he did not believe any thing more then common fidelity in his <hi>Fathers</hi> testimony. For <hi>God</hi> never (when revelations were most common) thought it necessary to multiply <hi>revelations</hi> so far, as to make one necessary to attest another; but that <hi>revelation</hi> which was communicated to one was obligatory to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, though they could have nothing but <hi>Moral certainty</hi> for it. By this it appears, that when we now speak of the <hi>resolution</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> though the <hi>utmost reason</hi> of our assent, is, that <hi>Infallibility</hi> which is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in <hi>Divine Testimony,</hi> yet the nearest and most proper resolution of it, is, into the grounds inducing us to believe that such a Testimony is <hi>truly Divine,</hi> and the <hi>resolution</hi> of this cannot be into any Divine Testimony without a process in <hi>infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That when we speak of the <hi>resolution of Faith,</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> we understand a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>discursive act</hi> of the mind. For <hi>Faith</hi> being an <hi>assent</hi> upon <hi>evidence,</hi> or <hi>reason</hi> inducing the mind to assent, it must be a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>discursive act</hi>; and such a one that one may be able to give an account of to another. And this account which men are able to give why they do believe, or on what ground they do it, is that which we call <hi>resolving Faith.</hi> And by this it appears, that whatever resolves <hi>Faith</hi> into its <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause,</hi> (which some improperly call <hi>the Testimony of the spirit</hi>) though it may be true, yet comes not home to the question. For if by the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the spirit</hi> be meant that <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi> whereby saving <hi>Faith</hi> is wrought in us, then it gives no account from the <hi>thing</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, why we <hi>assent</hi> to it, but only shews how <hi>Faith</hi> is wrought in us by way of <hi>efficiency</hi>; which is rather resolving the question <hi>about the necessity of Grace</hi> than the <hi>grounds of Faith.</hi> Our question is not then, concerning the necessity of <hi>infused habits of Grace,</hi> but of those <hi>rational inducements</hi> which do incline the mind to a firm assent. For <hi>Faith</hi> in us, however it is wrought, being a <hi>perswasion</hi> of the mind, it is not conceivable how there should be any <hi>discursive act</hi> of the mind, without some <hi>reason</hi> causing the mind to assent to what is propounded to it. For without this, Faith would be an unaccountable thing, and <hi>the spirit of revelation</hi> would not be <hi>the spirit of wisdom</hi>; and <hi>Religion</hi> would be exposed to the contempt of all unbelievers, if we were able to give no other account of Faith, then that it is wrought in us by the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> When we speak therefore of the <hi>resolving Faith,</hi> we mean, what are the <hi>rational inducements to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> or what evidence there is in the object propounded to make us firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assent to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>According to the different acts of Faith, there must be assigned a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101069:114"/>
resolution of Faith.</hi> For every act being <hi>rational</hi> and discursive, must have its proper <hi>grounds</hi> belonging to it; unless we suppose that act elicited without any <hi>reason</hi> for it, which is incongruous with the nature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane understanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note>There are then in the question of <hi>resolution of Faith,</hi> these three questions to be resolved. First, <hi>Why I believe those things to be true which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Book called the Scripture?</hi> 2. <hi>Why I believe the Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Book to be Divine?</hi> 3. <hi>Why I believe the Books themselves to be of Divine revelation?</hi> Now every one of these <hi>questions</hi> admits of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>way</hi> of <hi>resolution</hi>; as will appear by the handling each of them distinctly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If I be asked, <hi>On what grounds I believe the things to be true which are contained in Scripture?</hi> my answer must be, From the <hi>greatest evidence of truth,</hi> which things of that nature are capable of. If therefore the <hi>persons</hi> who are supposed to have writ these things, were <hi>such</hi> who were fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what they writ of; if they were such <hi>persons</hi> who cannot be suspected of any design to <hi>deceive</hi> men by their <hi>writings</hi>; and if I be certain that these which go under the <hi>name</hi> of their <hi>writings,</hi> are undoubtedly theirs; I must have sufficient <hi>grounds</hi> to believe the truth of them. Now that the <hi>writers of these things cannot be suspected of ignorance,</hi> appears by the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>age</hi> they writ in, when the <hi>story</hi> of these things was new, and such multitudes were willing enough to have <hi>contradicted</hi> it, if any thing had beeen amiss: besides, <hi>some</hi> of the <hi>writers</hi> had been intimately conversant with the <hi>person</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of him whom they writ most of. <hi>That they could have no intent to deceive,</hi> appears from the <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>candour</hi> both of their <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>writings,</hi> from their <hi>contempt</hi> of the world, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves to the greatest <hi>hazards</hi> to bear witness to them. <hi>That these are the very same writings,</hi> appears by all the <hi>evidence</hi> can be desired; For we have as great, if not much greater <hi>reason</hi> to believe them to be the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Books</hi> under their <hi>Names,</hi> than any other <hi>writers</hi> of any <hi>Books</hi> whatsoever, both because the <hi>matters</hi> are of greater <hi>moment,</hi> and therefore men might be supposed more <hi>inquisitive</hi> about them; and that they have been unanimously received for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> from the very <hi>time</hi> of their being first written, (except some very few, which upon strict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination were admitted too) and we find these very <hi>Books</hi> cited by the learned <hi>Christians</hi> under these Names in that time, when it had been no difficulty to have found out several of the Original <hi>Copy's</hi> themselves. When therefore they were universally received by <hi>Christians,</hi> never doubted of by <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Heathen Philosophers:</hi> we have as great evidence for this <hi>first act of Faith,</hi> as it is capable of. And he is unreasonable who desires more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If I be asked, why I believe the Doctrine contained in these Books to be Divine?</hi> I must give in two things for answer. 1. <hi>That in the Age when the Doctrine was delivered, there was sufficient reason to believe it Divine.</hi> 2. <hi>That if there was sufficient reason then, we have sufficient reason now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That in the Age when the Doctrine was delivered, there was sufficient reason to believe it Divine</hi>; Supposing then, that we already believe upon the former answer, that all <hi>the matters of fact</hi> be true, I answer, that if <hi>Christ</hi> did such unparalle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>d <hi>miracles,</hi> and rose from the dead, they who heard his <hi>Doctrine</hi> had reason to believe it to be of <hi>God:</hi> and this I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the greatest <hi>Infidel</hi> would not deny, if himself had been one of the <hi>witnesses</hi> of his <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>resurection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:101069:114"/>2. <hi>That if they had reason then, we have so now</hi>; because tradition to us doth only supply the want of our <hi>senses,</hi> as to what <hi>Christ</hi> did and spake; <hi>i. e.</hi> That <hi>tradition</hi> is a kind of <hi>derivative</hi> and <hi>perpetuated sensation</hi> to us; it being of the same use to <hi>us</hi> now which our <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>ears</hi> had been, if we had been actually present when <hi>Christ</hi> delivered his Doctrine and wrought his Miracles. Which that we may better understand, we may consider what the use of our <hi>senses</hi> had been, if we had been then present; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently what the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>tradition</hi> is now to us. Now it is apparent, that the use of the <hi>senses,</hi> to those <hi>who saw the Miracles and heard the Doctrine of Christ,</hi> was not to give any <hi>credibility</hi> to either of them, but only to be the <hi>means</hi> of conveying to them those things which might induce them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; the same doth <hi>tradition</hi> now to us, it doth not in it self make the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin</hi> more <hi>credible,</hi> but supplies the use of our <hi>senses</hi> in a certain conveyance of those things to us which were the <hi>motives</hi> to believe then. For the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to <hi>Faith</hi> both to them and us are the same, only the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance is different; but our case is much the same with those who lived in the same <hi>Age,</hi> but by reason of distance of <hi>place</hi> could not be personally present at what <hi>Christ did</hi> or <hi>said</hi>; now if those <hi>persons</hi> were <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> and had sufficient <hi>reason</hi> for <hi>Faith,</hi> who by reason of <hi>distance of place</hi> could not exercise their <hi>senses</hi> about <hi>Christs Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> the same <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> have we, who cannot do it by reason of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of time.</hi> And if there be any advantage on either side, it is on ours, because though the <hi>tradition</hi> doth not in it self give any <hi>credibility</hi> to the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> yet there are such <hi>circumstances</hi> accompanying this tradition, which may much facilitate our belief above <hi>theirs:</hi> because by such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued tradition we have an evidence of the <hi>efficacy</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which had so continual a <hi>power</hi> as to engage so many in all <hi>ages</hi> since its first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to be the propagators and defenders of it. And therefore this hath very much the advantage of the <hi>report</hi> of any <hi>credible persons</hi> in that <hi>age,</hi> who might report to any at distance the <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Doctrine of Christ.</hi> And this is the way of resolution of Faith, which the Scripture it self directs us to. <hi>How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him: God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</hi> Where we plainly see, the <hi>resolution of Faith</hi> as to the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> was into the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it (which was the proper <hi>witness</hi> or <hi>testimony of the Holy Ghost</hi>) but the means of conveyance was by the <hi>tradition</hi> of those who were <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>ear-witnesses</hi> of what <hi>Christ</hi> said or did. As therefore it was not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed necessary for them who saw the <hi>miracles</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> either to have some <hi>inward Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or some external <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to assure them that these <hi>miracles</hi> were really done by <hi>Christ,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> left them to the judgement of <hi>sense</hi>; so proportionably neither of those <hi>two</hi> is now necessary for the <hi>resolution of our Faith,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> instead of the judgement of <hi>sense</hi> leaves us to the evidence of <hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>

For, 1. What greater <hi>certainty</hi> had they who lived in the time of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and did not see
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101069:115"/>
their <hi>Miracles?</hi> Had they, or could they have, any more than this you call <hi>moral Certainty</hi>? and, Do you really think, that all such could not be sufficiently assured, that <hi>Christian Religion</hi> was infallibly true? 2. <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> may be a sufficient Foundation for the most <hi>firm Assent</hi>; and therefore, if the matter to be believed be the <hi>infallible Truth</hi> of a <hi>Doctrine</hi> upon <hi>suitable evidence,</hi> though we have now but <hi>moral Certainty</hi> of that evidence, the <hi>Assent</hi> may be firm to such a <hi>Doctrine</hi> as infallible. And therefore the grand mistake lyes here, as though our <hi>Faith</hi> were resolved finally into this <hi>moral Certainty</hi>; or, as if the Faith of those who saw <hi>Christ's Miracles,</hi> were resolved into their <hi>eyes,</hi> and not into the <hi>Miracles</hi>; for as their <hi>eyes</hi> were but the <hi>means</hi> of conveyance of that <hi>evidence</hi> which was <hi>infallible,</hi> so is that <hi>Tradition</hi> to us by which we have our <hi>Certainty</hi> of those evidences of the <hi>infallible Truth</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> And we are further to consider that the nature of <hi>Certainty</hi> is not so much to be taken from the <hi>matters themselves,</hi> as from the <hi>grounds</hi> inducing the <hi>Assent</hi>; that is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>things</hi> be <hi>Mathematical, Physical,</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi>; if there be no <hi>reason</hi> to <hi>question</hi> the <hi>grounds</hi> of belief, the case is all one as to the nature of the <hi>Assent.</hi> So that <hi>moral Certainty</hi> may be as <hi>great</hi> as <hi>Mathematical</hi> and <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical,</hi> supposing as little reason to <hi>doubt</hi> in <hi>moral things</hi> as to their <hi>natures,</hi> as in <hi>Mathematical</hi> and <hi>Physical</hi> as to theirs. Therefore this great quarrel about <hi>moral Certainty</hi> is very unreasonable; unless it be proved, that there is no cause of <hi>firm Assent</hi> upon <hi>moral grounds</hi>; now, if the <hi>cause</hi> of the <hi>Assent</hi> may be, as <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>proportionable</hi> to their <hi>nature</hi> in <hi>moral things,</hi> as in <hi>Mathematical</hi>; there may be as <hi>firm</hi> an <hi>Assent</hi> in the <hi>One,</hi> as in the <hi>Other,</hi> as I have already shewed. For which, this <hi>reason</hi> is plain and evident, that <hi>Certainty</hi> implies the taking away all <hi>suspicion of doubt:</hi> But there can be no taking away all <hi>suspicion of doubt</hi> in <hi>Mathematical</hi> things, without <hi>Mathematical evidence</hi>; but in <hi>moral things,</hi> all suspicion of <hi>doubt</hi> is removed upon <hi>moral evidence,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Certainty</hi> may be as great in the Assent to one as the other. Thus, we see, how unjustly, and how much to the dishonour of Religion you quarrel with <hi>moral evidence,</hi> as an uncertain thing. But, I answer yet further, 3. <hi>That the greatest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance we can desire, that any Religion is infallibly True, is from moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>; and that upon these three grounds. 1. <hi>Because the grounds of all Religion are capable of no more.</hi> 2. <hi>Because the highest evidence of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion must depend upon it.</hi> 3. <hi>Because this, in it self, may evidently demonstrate, that Christian Religion is infallibly True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There can be no greater than this moral Certainty of the main Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all Religion,</hi> which are, The <hi>Being of God,</hi> and <hi>Immortality of souls</hi>; without the supposition of which, there can be no such thing as Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the world; and therefore from thence I may easily prove, that there can be no more than moral <hi>Certainty</hi> of the existence of a <hi>Deity.</hi> For, if the very notion of Infallibility doth suppose a <hi>God,</hi> then you cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prove that there is <hi>One</hi> (in your sense of Infallibility) for then you must beg the Question, and suppose that already to be, which you are proving the <hi>existence</hi> of: Now that, <hi>Infallibility</hi> in us doth suppose the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of God,</hi> appears most evidently, because, mans understanding being of it self fallible, it cannot be supposed in any thing infallible, without the <hi>supernatural Assistance</hi> of a <hi>being Infallible,</hi> which can be nothing else but <hi>God.</hi> But, if you think you have <hi>infallible proofs,</hi> produce them, and convince the world of <hi>Atheists</hi> by them: We acknowledge we have as great <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>certainty,</hi> as humane nature is capable of, of a <hi>Being</hi> of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101069:115"/>
such a <hi>Nature</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is, from the consideration of his works; but all this still is <hi>moral Certainty</hi>; for the grounds are neither <hi>Mathematically demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative,</hi> nor <hi>supernaturally infallible.</hi> What folly and madness then is it for your party to cry out so much against <hi>moral Certainty in Religion,</hi> when the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Religion</hi> is capable of no more; And may not this justly increase our suspicion, that under <hi>moral Certainty</hi> you strike at the Foundation of all Religion?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Suppose God gives the most infallible evidence of any Religion, it is not possible, but that some who are bound to believe that Religion, can have any more than moral Certainty of it.</hi> And, for all that, I know the greatest <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Certainty</hi> is as liable to question as <hi>moral</hi>; there being as great a <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of Deception</hi> in that, as a <hi>suspicion of doubt</hi> in this, and oft-times grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What advantage then had those who stood by, and saw the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> of <hi>Moses and Christ,</hi> above those who did not, but had the report of them conveyed to them in an unquestionable manner? Besides, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, <hi>God</hi>'s great aim in any <hi>Religion,</hi> is most at the good of those who can have only a <hi>moral Certainty</hi> of the great <hi>evidences</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of that <hi>Religion</hi>; because it being <hi>God</hi>'s intention, that the <hi>Religion</hi> delivered by Him, should be not meerly for the benefit of those very few persons who could be present at such things, but for the advantage of those incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably greater numbers, who, by reason of <hi>distance</hi> of <hi>place and age,</hi> could not be present; it would argue a strange want of <hi>provision</hi> for mens <hi>Faith,</hi> unless <hi>moral Certainty</hi> were sufficient. Only you indeed will suppose that which <hi>God</hi> himself never thought necessary, <hi>viz. an infallible Testimony of the present Church</hi>; but to what good purposes you have introduced this, hath largely appeared already.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Moral Certainty yields us sufficient Assurance, that Christian Religion is infallibly true:</hi> And that I prove, because <hi>moral Certainty</hi> may evidently shew us the <hi>Credibility</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which you deny not, nor any else; and, that from the <hi>Credibility</hi> of it, the <hi>infallible Truth</hi> of it may be proved, will appear by these two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That where there is evident Credibility in the matter propounded, there doth arise upon men an obligation to believe:</hi> And that is proved both by your own confession (as to the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> being believed on the <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Credibility</hi>) and from <hi>Gods intention,</hi> in giving such <hi>Motives,</hi> which was, to perswade them to believe, as appears by multitudes of <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi>; and withall, though the meer <hi>Credibility</hi> of the <hi>Motives</hi> might at first suppose some <hi>doubts</hi> concerning the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> yet it is not consistent with any doubt, as to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>obligation to believe</hi>; because there can be no other reason assigned of these <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> than the inducing on men an <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That where there is such an obligation to believe, we have the greatest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, that the matter to be believed is infallibly True:</hi> Which depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this manifest proof, <hi>That God cannot oblige men to believe a lye</hi>; it being repugnant to all our conceptions of the <hi>Veracity</hi> and <hi>Goodness of God,</hi> to imagine, that <hi>God</hi> should require from men (on the pain of <hi>eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> for not believing) to believe something as <hi>infallibly True,</hi> which is really false. Thus, you see, what a clear and pregnant demonstration we have of the <hi>infallible Truth of Christian Religion</hi> from <hi>moral Certainty</hi>; How injurious then have those of your party been, who have charged this opinion of believing upon <hi>moral Certainty,</hi> with betraying <hi>Religion,</hi> and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101069:116"/>
denying <hi>Christian Religion</hi> to be <hi>infallibly True.</hi> Thus much for this grand Objection; I now come to the last Question considerable in the Resolution.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note>3. <hi>On what account do I believe these particular Books of Scripture to be Gods Word?</hi> Which may admit of a double sense: 1. <hi>On what account I do believe the Doctrine contained in these Books to be Gods Word?</hi> 2. <hi>On what account I do believe the Books containing this Doctrine to be Gods Word?</hi> As to the <hi>first,</hi> I have answered already, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon the same <hi>rational evidence</hi> which <hi>God</hi> gave, that the <hi>Testimony</hi> of those who delivered, was a <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>infallible Testimony:</hi> To the second, I answer in these two Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>last Resolution of Faith</hi> is not into the <hi>Infallibility of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of conveyance,</hi> but into the <hi>Infallibility of that Doctrine,</hi> which is thereby conveyed to us. For the writing of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is only the <hi>condition</hi> by which this <hi>Revelation</hi> is made manifest to us; it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the <hi>nature</hi> of the thing, that the <hi>writing</hi> of a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> is not necessary for the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as to that Revelation: because men may believe a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> without it; as is not only evident in the case of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> but of all those, who in the time of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> did believe the truth of the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> before it was written. If therefore the <hi>writing</hi> be only the <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> in a <hi>certain</hi> way to us, the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> is not to be resolved into <hi>that</hi> which is only the <hi>mode</hi> of our knowledge of the Object to be believed; but into <hi>that</hi> which is properly the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> why we believe that <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> to be <hi>Divine,</hi> which is contained in those Books. And this is still the case of all illiterate <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> who cannot resolve their <hi>Faith</hi> properly into the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but into the <hi>Doctrine</hi> delivered them out of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Hence we may discern the difference between the <hi>Formal Object,</hi> and the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi>; the <hi>Formal Object</hi> is that evidence which is given of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Testimony</hi> of those who delivered the Doctrine; the <hi>infallible Rule of Faith</hi> to us, is the <hi>Scripture, viz.</hi> that which limits and bounds the <hi>material Objects</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which we are bound to believe; and this doth therefore discover to us what those things are, which on the account of the <hi>Formal Object,</hi> we are obliged to believe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Those who believe the Doctrine of Scripture to be Divine, have no reason to question the infallible conveyance of that Doctrine to us, in those Books we call the Scripture.</hi> Therefore, whatever things we are to believe in order to salvation, we have as great evidence as we can desire, that they are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly</hi> conveyed to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If the Doctrine of Christ be True and Divine, then all the Promises be made were accomplished</hi>: Now, that was one of the greatest, <hi>That his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit should lead his Apostles into all Truth</hi>;<note place="margin">Joh. 16.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101069:116"/>
                  <hi>Christ and his Apostles.</hi> So that it will appear an absurd thing to assert, that the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi> is <hi>Divine,</hi> and to question, whether we have the <hi>infallible Records</hi> of it. It is not pertinent to our Question, in what way the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> assisted them that wrote, Whether by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>suggestion</hi> of all such things which might be sufficiently known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and whether in some things which were not of concernment, it might not leave them to their own judgement; (as in that place,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.19.</note> 
                  <hi>When they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs,</hi> when, no doubt, <hi>God's Spirit</hi> knew infallibly whether it was, but thought not fit to reveal it) whether in some lighter circumstances the Writers were subject to any inadvertencies (the negative of which is more piously credible) whether meer <hi>historical passages</hi> needed the same infallible Assistance, that <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>Doctrinal</hi>; these things, I say, are not necessary to be resolved, it being sufficient in order to <hi>Faith,</hi> that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> we are to believe, as it was infallibly delivered to the world, by the preaching of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> so it is infallibly conveyed to us in the <hi>Books of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Because these Books were owned for Divine by those Persons and Ages, who were most competent Judges, Whether they were so or no.</hi> For the Age of the <hi>Apostles</hi> was sufficiently able to judge, whether those <hi>things</hi> which are said to be spoken by <hi>Christ,</hi> or written by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> were really so or no. And we can have no reason at all to question, but what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by them, was infallibly true. Now, from that <hi>first Age</hi> we derive our <hi>knowledge</hi> concerning the <hi>Authority</hi> of these <hi>Books,</hi> which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us in the most <hi>unquestionable</hi> and <hi>universal Tradition,</hi> we can have no reason in the world to doubt, and therefore the <hi>greatest reason</hi> firmly to <hi>assent,</hi> that the <hi>Books</hi> we call the <hi>Scripture,</hi> are the <hi>infallible Records</hi> of the <hi>Word of God.</hi> And thus much may suffice in general concerning the Protestant Way of resolving Faith: I now return to the examination of what you give us by way of answer to his Lordship's discourse.</p>
               <p>The first Assault you make upon his Lordship, is, for making <hi>Apostolical Tradition a ground of Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> but because your peculiar excellency lyes in the involving plain things; the best service I can do, is to lay things open as they are; by which means we shall easily discern where the truth lyes. I shall therefore first shew, how far his Lordship makes <hi>Apostolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a ground of Faith,</hi> and then consider what you have to object against it. In that Section which your Margent referrs to, all that he sayes of it, is,<note place="margin">Sect. 16. n. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Voice and Tradition of that Church which included in it Apostles, Disciples, and such as had immediate Revelation from Heaven, was Divine, and the Word of God from them is of like validity written or delivered. And, as to this Tradition</hi> (he saith) <hi>there is abundance of Certainty in it self, but how far it is evident to us, shall after appear.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 84.</note> At the end of the next <hi>n.</hi> 21. he saith, <hi>That there is double Authority, and both Divine, that confirms Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the Word of God. Tradition of the Apostles delivering it, and the internal worth and argument in the Scripture, obvious to a soul prepared by the present Churches Tradition, and Gods Grace.</hi> But, <hi>n.</hi> 23. he saith, <hi>That this Apostolical Tradition is not the sole and only means to prove Scripture Divine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 85.</note> 
                  <hi>but the moral perswasion, reason, and force of the present Church, is ground enough for any one to read the Scripture, and esteem reverently of it. And this once done, the Scripture hath then In and home-arguments enough to put a soul that hath but ordinary Grace, out of doubt, that the Scripture is the Word of God, infallible and Divine.</hi> I suppose his Lordships meaning may be comprized in these particulars. 1. That to those who lived in the <hi>Apostolical</hi> times the <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> by those who had an infallible Testimony, was a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101069:117"/>
sufficient ground of their believing it infallibly true. 2. That though the <hi>conveyance</hi> of that <hi>Tradition</hi> to us be not infallible, yet it may be sufficient to raise in us a high esteem and veneration for the <hi>Scripture.</hi> 3. That those who have this <hi>esteem</hi> for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> by a through studying and consideration of it may undoubtedly believe that <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> Word of <hi>God.</hi> This I take to be the substance of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships discourse. We now come to examine what you object against him. <hi>Your first demand is, How comes Apostolical Primitive Tradition to work upon us, if the present Church be fallible?</hi> Which I shall answer by another, How come the <hi>decrees of Councils</hi> to work upon you,<note place="margin">P. 82.</note> if the reporters of those <hi>Decrees</hi> be fallible? If you say, <hi>It is sufficient that the Decree it self be infallible, but it is not necessary that the reporter of those Decrees should be so</hi>; The same I say concerning the <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> though it were <hi>infallible</hi> in their <hi>Testimony,</hi> yet it is not necessary that the conveyance of it to us should be <hi>infallible.</hi> And if you think your self bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Decrees of <hi>General Councils</hi> as <hi>infallible,</hi> though fallibly convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you; Why may not we say the same concerning <hi>Apostolical Tradition?</hi> Whereby you may see, though Tradition be <hi>fallible,</hi> yet the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by it, may have its proper effect upon us. Your next Inquiry (if I understand it) is to this sense, <hi>Whether Apostolical Tradition be not then as credible as the Scriptures?</hi> I answer freely (supposing it equally evident) what was delivered by the <hi>Apostles</hi> to the Church by word or writing, hath equal <hi>Credibility</hi>? You attempt to prove, <hi>That there is equal evidence, because the Scripture is only known by the Tradition of the Church, to be the same that was recommended by the Apostolical Church, which you have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for Apostolical Tradition.</hi> But, 1. Do you mean the same <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> here or no, which the <hi>Arch-Bishop speaks of, i. e.</hi> that act of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> whereby they delivered the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi> upon their <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> to the world. If you mean this Tradition, for my part, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it as any thing really distinct from the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self. For, although I grant, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did deliver that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by <hi>Word</hi> as well as <hi>Writing,</hi> yet if that <hi>Tradition</hi> by <hi>Word</hi> had been judged sufficient, I much question whether we had ever had any written <hi>Records</hi> at all. But, because of the speedy decay of an oral <hi>Tradition,</hi> if there had been no standing <hi>Records,</hi> it pleased <hi>God</hi> in his infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> to stir up some fit persons to digest those things summarily into writing, which otherwise would have been exposed to several cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in a short time. For we see presently in the <hi>Church,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, how suddenly the <hi>Gnosticks, Valentinians, Manichees</hi> and others, did pretend some <hi>secret Tradition</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> distinct from their writings. When therefore you can produce as certain evidence any <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> distinct from <hi>Scripture,</hi> as we can do, that the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> were delivered by the <hi>Apostles</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> you may then be hearkened to, but not be before. 2. We have other waies to judge of the <hi>Identity</hi> of the <hi>Copies</hi> of Scripture (which we have) with those delivered by the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> besides the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>present Church.</hi> And the judgement of the <hi>present Church</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meerly as such can be no argument to secure any man concerning the integrity and incorruption of the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> We do therefore justly appeal to the ancient <hi>Copies,</hi> and <hi>M. SS.</hi> which confirm the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of ours. But, say you, <hi>What infallible Certainty have we of them, besides Church Tradition?</hi>

of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and as though your <hi>Church</hi> could give men <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> which <hi>Copy's</hi> were ancient and which were not. But for our parts, we should not be at all nearer any <hi>certainty</hi> much less <hi>Infallibility</hi> concerning the <hi>authenticalness of any ancient Copy's,</hi> because your <hi>Church</hi> declared it self for them; neither can we imagine it at all necessary in the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>ancient Copy's</hi> to have any <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> at all of them. For as well you may pretend it as to any other Authours, when all that we look after in such <hi>Copy's</hi> is only that evidence which things of that nature are capable of. But you make his <hi>Lordship</hi> give as wise an answer to this question of yours; <hi>They may be examined and approved by the authentical Autographa's of the very Apostles.</hi> Where is it that this answer is given by his <hi>Lordship?</hi> If you may be allowed to make questions and answers too, no doubt, the one will be as wise as the other. But I suppose you thought, nothing could be said pertinent in this case, but what you make his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> say: and then by the unreasonableness of that answer, because none of these <hi>Autographa's</hi> are supposed extant, and because if they were so, all men could not be <hi>Infallibly certain</hi> of them, you think you have sufficient ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against your adversary, because thereby it would appear there can be no certainty of <hi>Scripture</hi> but from the <hi>authority</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi> To which because it may seem to carry on your great design of rendring <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> uncertain, I shall return a particular answer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Supposing we could have no <hi>certainty</hi> concerning the <hi>Copy's</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> but from <hi>Tradition,</hi> this doth not at all advantage your <hi>cause,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is no reason to suppose this should be your meaning</hi>; for you are speaking of such things which are necessary to be <hi>believed,</hi> and therefore are properly <hi>objects of Faith,</hi> but that there are no kind of <hi>corruptions</hi> crept into the <hi>Copy's</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> cannot with you be an <hi>object of Faith.</hi> For those of your party do <hi>some</hi> of them <hi>confess</hi> and <hi>others contend,</hi> that there are many <hi>corruptions</hi> crept into the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> of the Old <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> of the <hi>New</hi>; and that there are abundance of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in your <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> is not only abundantly proved by our Writers, but acknowledged by the <hi>learnedst</hi> of your own, and irrefragably demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the different editions of <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Clement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppose this were your meaning, <hi>there were no reason in the thing</hi>; For, 1. <hi>Your Church cannot Infallibly assure us, there are no corruptions.</hi> 2. <hi>We may be sufficiently assured of it without the Testimony of your Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Your <hi>Church</hi> cannot assure us at all, much less <hi>Infallibly</hi> that there are no such <hi>corruptions.</hi> For what reason can there be, Why we should rely on the judgement of only a <hi>part</hi> of the whole <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> and that <hi>part</hi> at great <hi>opposition</hi> with many other considerable <hi>Churches</hi>; must we then believe your <hi>Church</hi> where it agrees with, or it differs from the rest? If <hi>only where it agrees with the rest,</hi> then it is not the <hi>testimony</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> we rely on, but the <hi>Vniversal consent</hi> of all: If <hi>where it differs,</hi> shew us some reason, why we should believe your <hi>Church</hi> in opposition to all others. Especially, 1. When we consider what contradiction there hath been in the testimony of your <hi>Church</hi> about this very thing: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not only by the great difference among your writers concerning the <hi>authentick Copy's,</hi> some still defending the <hi>Hebrew and Greek Texts,</hi> and others standing up for that great <hi>Diana of Rome</hi> the <hi>Vulgar Latin.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering then, that by the decree of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> is looked on by you as the most <hi>authentick Copy</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> let any one judge whether ever this could be judged more authentick, than when the <hi>Pope</hi> himself <hi>in Cathedr√¢</hi> doth revise any <hi>edition</hi> of it, and use all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible care for the setting of it forth, not only comparing it with the best ancient <hi>MS S.</hi> but taking the pains to correct it with his own hand both before and after the <hi>press,</hi> and all this was done by <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. as himself declares in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>edition</hi> of the <hi>Vulgar Latin, A.D.</hi> 1590. Yet within little more then two years after comes out the edition of <hi>Clement</hi> 8. which, as appears by the computation of such who have taken the pains to compare them, differs from the other in some <hi>thousands</hi> of <hi>places.</hi> Now I pray tell me what <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> are we like to have concerning the <hi>Copy's of Scripture,</hi> being the same with those delivered by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> from the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> when this testimony of your <hi>Church</hi> doth so finely contradict it self within little more then two years time.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>In what way and manner that Churches Authority did perswade him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

But all this while, since the <hi>Christians</hi> thought they had evident reason for believing the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently none to believe the Doctrine which did oppose them; therefore they found it necessary to go further, and to charge those <hi>Copies</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> with falsifications and corruptions, which were generally received among <hi>Christians.</hi> But these are fully delivered by S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Book <hi>de utilitate credendi,</hi> as will appear to any one who looks into it; but the

And this I take to be truest and most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral account of these so much controverted words of S. <hi>Austin</hi>; by which sense the other two Questions are easily answered: for it is plain, S. <hi>Austin</hi> means not the <hi>judgement of the present Church,</hi> but of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in the most comprehensive sense, as taking in all <hi>ages and places,</hi> or in <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> his words, <hi>Succession, Vniversality,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi>; and it further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the influence which this Authority hath, is sufficient to induce Assent to the thing attested in all persons who consider it, in what age, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, or condition soever. And therefore, if in this sense you extend it beyond <hi>Novices and Weaklings,</hi> I shall not oppose you in it; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that it is intended chiefly for <hi>doubters in the Faith,</hi> because the design of it is to give men satisfaction as to the <hi>reason</hi> why they ought to <hi>believe.</hi> But neither you, nor any of those you call <hi>Catholick Authours,</hi> will ever be able to prove, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> by these words ever dreamt of any <hi>infallible Authority in the present Church,</hi> as might be abundantly proved from the chapter foregoing, where he gives an account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> from the <hi>Consent of People and Nations from that Authority which was begun by miracles, nourished by hope, increased by charity, confirmed by continuance,</hi> which certainly are not the expressions of one who resolved his Faith into the <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> of the <hi>present Church.</hi> And the whole scope and design of his Book <hi>de utilitate credendi,</hi> doth evidently refute any such apprehension, as might be easily manifested, were it not too large a subject for this place, where we only examine the meaning of S. <hi>Austin</hi> in another Book. The substance of which, is, that That speech of his doth not contain a <hi>resolution of his Faith,</hi> as to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christs Doctrine</hi>; but the <hi>resolution</hi> of it, as to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticalness</hi> of the <hi>writings</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi> which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be into the Testimony of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in the most large and comprehensive sense.</p>

he hath the same assurance by Grace.</hi> Whether you be not herein guilty of abusing his Lordship by a plain perverting of his meaning, will be best seen by producing his words.<note place="margin">P. 83.</note> 
                  <hi>A man</hi> (saith he) <hi>is probably led by the Authority of the present Church, as by the first informing, inducing, perswading means, to believe the Scripture to be the Word of God: But, when he hath studied, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and compared this Word with it self, and with other writings, with the help of ordinary Grace, and a mind morally induced, and reasonably perswaded by the Voice of the Church, the Scripture then gives greater and higher reasons of Credibility to it self, than Tradition alone could give. And then he that believes, resolves his last and full assent, that Scripture is of Divine Authority, into internal arguments found in the letter it self, though found by the help and direction of Tradition without, and Grace within.</hi> Had you not a great mind to calumniate, who could pick out of these words, <hi>That the Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved his Faith into Grace?</hi> Can any thing be more plain, than the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is from them, when in the most perspicuous terms he says, <hi>that the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of Faith is into internal arguments, and only supposeth Tradition and Grace as necessary helps for the finding them?</hi> Might you not then as well have said, That his Lordship, notwithstanding his zeal against the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Tradition,</hi> is fain to resolve his <hi>Faith</hi> into it at last, as well as say, that he doth it <hi>into Grace</hi>; for he joyns these two together? But, Is it not possible to assert the <hi>Vse</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> in order to <hi>Faith,</hi> but the last Resolution of it must be into it? Do not all your <hi>Divines,</hi> as well as ours, <hi>suppose</hi> and <hi>prove</hi> the <hi>Necessity of Grace,</hi> in order to <hi>believing</hi>; and, Are they not equally guilty of having recourse to the <hi>private Spirit?</hi> Do you really think your self, that there is any thing of <hi>Divine Grace in Faith</hi> or no? If there be, free your Self then from the <hi>private Spirit,</hi> and you do his Lordship. For shame then forbear such pitiful calumnies; which, if they have any truth in them, You are as much concerned as Your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary in it. You would next perswade us, <hi>That the Relator never comes near the main difficulty, which</hi> (say you) <hi>is, if the Church be supposed fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in the Tradition of Scripture, how it shall be certainly known, whether</hi> de facto, <hi>she now errs not in her delivery of it?</hi> If this be your grand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, it is sufficiently assoiled already, having largely answered this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <hi>in terminis,</hi> in the preceding Chapter.</p>
               <p>You ask further, <hi>What they are to do who are unresolved which is the true Church</hi>; as though it were necessary for men to know which is the <hi>true Church,</hi> before they can believe the <hi>Scriptures to be the Word of God?</hi> but when we assert the <hi>tradition of the Church</hi> to be <hi>necessary</hi> for believing the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> we do not thereby understand the particular <hi>Tradition</hi> of any particular <hi>Church</hi> whose judgement they must rely on, but the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition</hi> of all <hi>Christians</hi> though this must be first made known in some particular Society, by the means of some <hi>particular persons,</hi> though their <hi>authority</hi> doth not oblige us to believe, but only are the means whereby men come acquainted with that <hi>Vniversal Tradition.</hi> And therefore your following discourse <hi>concerning the knowing the true Church by its motives is superseded</hi>; for we mean no other <hi>Church</hi> than the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Christians</hi> in this Controversie; and, if you ask me, <hi>By what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives I come to be certain which is a Community of Christians, and which of Mahumetans, and how one should be known from another,</hi> I can soon resolve you: But we are so far from making it necessary to know <hi>which particular society of Christians</hi> in opposition to others, is the <hi>true Church</hi> for resolving this question, that we look on it as a great argument of the <hi>Credibility</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:101069:123"/>
as well as <hi>Vniversality</hi> of this <hi>Tradition,</hi> that all these differing <hi>Societies</hi> consent in it. And not only they, but the greatest opposers of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Jews,</hi> or <hi>Philosophers,</hi> could never see any reason to call in question such a <hi>Tradition.</hi>

               <p>His Lordship the better to represent <hi>the use of Tradition</hi> in the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of Faith makes <hi>use of this illustration, That as the knowledge of Grammer and Logick is necessary in order to the making a Demonstration, yet the knowledge of the Conclusion is not resolved into Grammer or Logick, but into the immediate principles out of which it is deduced: So a mans first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to Faith is the Churches Tradition, but his full and last assent is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into the internal arguments of Scripture.</hi> This you quarrel with, and tell us, <hi>There is not the same Analogy between Logick and Church Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>;<note place="margin">Pag. 86.</note> your meaning, I suppose is, because <hi>Logick</hi> doth <hi>Physically</hi> by inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the understanding fit men for <hi>demonstrations,</hi> but <hi>Church-Tradition</hi> cannot enable men to understand the <hi>Scripture.</hi> But cannot you easily discern that <hi>Analogy</hi> which his Lordship brought this illustration for, which is, that some things may be necessary <hi>preparatives</hi> for knowledge, which that <hi>knowledge</hi> is not resolved into. Is not this plain in <hi>Logick,</hi> and is it not as plain between <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Scripture?</hi> For though <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> doth not open our <hi>eyes</hi> to see this light, yet it presents the object to us to be seen, and that in an unquestionable manner. <hi>But for all this,</hi> say you, <hi>a man must either receive it on the sole authority of Church-Tradition, or be as much in the dark as ever.</hi> Why so? Is there any repugnancy in the thing, that Scripture should be received first upon the account of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet afterwards men resolve their Faith into the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self? May not a man very probably believe that a <hi>Diamond</hi> is sent him from a Friend upon the testimony of the <hi>Messenger</hi> who brings it, and yet be firmly perswaded of it, by discerning the <hi>Sparklings</hi> of it? <hi>But,</hi> say you further, <hi>The Scriptures themselves appear no more to be the Word of God, then the Stars to be of a certain determinate number,</hi>

That this may be discerned in the very <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> without the supposition of the authority of any <hi>Church</hi>; for he mentions the Doctrine meerly as written, and what may be found by the reading of it. Go then, and learn some piety and ingenuity (where it is

so seldome to be learned) from a <hi>Jesuite,</hi> and think not that we shall ever have the meaner thoughts of the <hi>Scripture</hi> for such bold expressions; but, we can easily see, that the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> cannot possibly stand together.</p>
               <p>Your subsequent discourse consists of some rare pieces of subtilty, which may be resolved into these consequences; If your <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as to the number of Canonical Books,</hi> then <hi>the Catholick Church, ever since Christs time, hath erred</hi>; if <hi>the Church may erre, then we cannot be certain but she hath erred</hi>; if <hi>we can have no infallible certainty, then we can have none at all</hi>; These consequences your discourse to n. 5. may be resolved into; and make good ever a one of them, I will say you have proved some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; which is more than you have done yet.</p>

                  <hi>Caeteram quippe turbam non intelligendi vivacitas, sed credendi simplicitas tutissimam facit:</hi> That <hi>God</hi> requires not from the common sort of believers, the <hi>subtilty of Speculation, but the simplicity of Faith</hi>; which may be very firm even in them from the reading of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it plainly delivered to them, though they are not able to give such accounts of their Faith, which may be satisfactory to any but themselves. So we say, <hi>That the way is so plain, that mean capacities may not erre therein.</hi> But, I wonder at you, of all men, that you should charge our way with <hi>intricacy,</hi> who lead men into such perplexities and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, before they can be satisfied that they ought to believe; for to this end you make the <hi>infallible Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> necessary; and, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny insuperable difficulties are there before one can be assured of that? first, he must know your <hi>Church</hi> to be the <hi>True Church,</hi> and this must be proved by a continual <hi>succession</hi> of <hi>Pastors</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> and by a <hi>conformity</hi> of your <hi>Doctrine</hi> with the <hi>Ancients</hi>; and, Do you think these two are not very easie introductions to <hi>Faith,</hi> like the taking <hi>Rome</hi> in ones way, to go from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>London</hi>; but, though a man should pull down a <hi>House</hi> to find a <hi>Key</hi> to open it, and after he had searched in all the rubbish of <hi>antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> find enough to perswade him <hi>yours</hi> may be a <hi>True Church,</hi> yet he is as far from believing as ever, unless he finds a way through another <hi>Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door</hi> for his <hi>Faith,</hi> which is, that <hi>yours,</hi> though a particular <hi>Church,</hi> is yet the only <hi>Catholick Church, i. e.</hi> that the first <hi>room</hi> he comes in, is <hi>infallibly</hi> the <hi>whole house,</hi> and therefore he never needs look further.

               <p>What follows next concerning <hi>Grace,</hi> is already answered: What cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty we have that <hi>Scripture</hi> is of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and consequently what obligation lyes upon men to believe it, are things largely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed on in the beginning of this Chapter; and I shall suppose sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared, till you shew me reason to the contrary: By which it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (contrary to what follows n. 6.) that we have the <hi>highest reasons</hi> or <hi>motives of Credibility,</hi> to assent to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Divine Authority of the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you proceed to an attempt of something new; which is,<note place="margin">¬ß. 12.</note> in a long ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue to disprove his Lordships Opinion of <hi>resolving Faith</hi> into that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light</hi> which appears in <hi>Scripture.</hi> This you insist on from n. 6. to n. 8. the substance of all which discourse, I suppose, may be reduced to these three things. 1. <hi>That though the Scripture be called a Light, yet that is to be understood only of those who own its authority.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Scripture cannot shew it self to be an Infallible Light.</hi> 3. <hi>That if there were such Light in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all others would see it as well as he.</hi> Before I come to a particular handling of each of these, it will be necessary to consider, What it is which his Lordship means by this <hi>Divine Light</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi>; for, there is nothing causeth more confusion in the discourses and apprehensions of men, than the applying <hi>Metaphors</hi> taken from the <hi>sense</hi> to the <hi>acts</hi> of the <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> For, by this means, we are apt to judge of our intellectual acts in a way wholly suitable to those of <hi>sense.</hi> We are not therefore to conceive, there can be any thing in <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> which so immediately doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it self to the mind, as <hi>light</hi> doth to the <hi>eye.</hi> But that only which bears proportion to the <hi>light</hi> in the mind, is <hi>reason</hi>; for mens minds being <hi>discursive,</hi> and not <hi>intuitive,</hi> they do not behold the truth of things by immediate <hi>intuition,</hi> but by such <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> as do induce and perswade to assent. We are not therefore to imagine any such <hi>Light</hi> in Scripture, that doth as immediately work upon the understanding, as the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> doth on the organs of sight; and therefore that common speech, that <hi>Light doth discover it self as well as other things,</hi> is in this sense improperly applied to the Understanding; for, whatever is discovered to the mind in a <hi>discursive manner,</hi> as all Objects of Faith are, must have some antecedent <hi>evidence</hi> to it self, which must be the ground of the act of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. That therefore which is called the <hi>Divine Light of Scripture,</hi> is, I suppose that <hi>rational evidence</hi> which is contained in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> whereby any reasonable man may be perswaded that these <hi>Books</hi> are of <hi>Divine Authority.</hi> Now that herein I say nothing beyond or besides his Lordships meaning and intention, will appear by his own discourse on this subject. For 1. His Lordship designedly disproves that Opinion that <hi>Scripture should be fully and sufficiently known as by Divine and Infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi> lumine proprio,<note place="margin">P. 69. sect. 16. n. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>by the resplendency of that Light which it hath in it self only, and by the witness that it can so give to it self. Because, as there is no place in Scripture that tells us such Books containing such and such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, are the Canon and Infallible Will of God; so, if there were any such place, that could be no sufficient proof</hi>; for, <hi>a man may justly ask another Book to bear witness to that, and so</hi> in infinitum. <hi>Again, this inbred Light of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:101069:125"/>
Scripture is a thing coincident with Scripture it self, and so the Principles and the Conclusion in this kind of proof should be entirely the same, which cannot be. Besides, if this inward Light were so clear, how could there have been any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety among the ancient Believers, touching the authority of S.</hi> James, <hi>and S.</hi> Judes <hi>Epistles, and the Apocalypse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For certainly the Light which is in the Scripture, was the same then which now it is.</hi> On these reasons then, we see, his Lordship not only disclaims, but disproves such knowing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture meerly by the Light within. Two things then I hence inferr, which will be very necessary to clear his Lordships meaning. 1. That he no where attributes such an <hi>inward Light</hi> to <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>by it self</hi> it can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that these <hi>Books</hi> are from <hi>God.</hi> 2. That where his Lordship mentions this <hi>Light</hi> most, he supposeth <hi>Tradition</hi> antecedent to it, as appears by his whole discourse. From whence I gather this to have been the plainest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his way of resolving Faith, as I have already intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>resolution of Faith</hi> may be considered two waies; into the <hi>Books,</hi> and into the <hi>Doctrine</hi> contained in them. The <hi>resolution</hi> into the <hi>Books,</hi> must, of necessity, suppose <hi>Tradition,</hi> and rely upon it; and this kind of <hi>resolution</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> cannot be into any <hi>self-evidence,</hi> or <hi>internal Light</hi>: but, supposing the <hi>Books</hi> owned on the account of <hi>Tradition,</hi> if the Question be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> then he asserts, that the <hi>resolution</hi> of this is into the <hi>Divine Light</hi> of Scripture, <hi>i. e.</hi> into that <hi>rational evidence</hi> which we find of the Divinity of it, in these Books which are owned on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Tradition.</p>
               <p>And that this is his Lordships meaning, appears 2. By his own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,<note place="margin">P. 101. n. 32.</note> who was best able to explain himself; for, when he goes about to confirm his Opinion by the Testimonies of the Fathers, he tells us, <hi>This was the way which the ancient Church ever used, namely, Tradition, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Authority first, and then all other arguments, but especially internal, from the Scripture it self.</hi> And, for this first, instanceth in S. <hi>Augustine, who</hi> (saith he) <hi>gives four proofs all internal to the Scripture it self, which are, First, The Miracles. Secondly, That there is nothing carnal in the Doctrine. Thirdly, Fulfilling of Prophecies. Fourthly, The efficacy of it for conversion of the world.</hi> All these we see he instanceth in, as internal arguments, and therefore make up that which he calls <hi>Divine Light.</hi> So that all that he means by this <hi>Light of Scripture,</hi> is only that <hi>rational evidence</hi> of the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which may be discovered in it, or deduced from it.</p>
               <p>Having thus explained his Lordships meaning, it will be no matter of difficulty to return an Answer to the particulars by you alledged.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You say, <hi>That when Scripture is said to be a Light by the Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, it is to be understood in this sense, Because, after we have once received it from the infallible Authority of the Church, it teacheth what we are to do and believe.</hi> But, 1. Doth not the <hi>Scripture</hi> sufficiently teach what we are to do and believe, supposing it not received on the infallible Authority of the Church? doth that add any thing to the <hi>Light of Scripture ?</hi> Or, do you suppose the necessity of infallibly believing it on the <hi>Churches Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> before one can discern what it teacheth us to do and believe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. What ground have you, in the least, to imagine, that <hi>David</hi> ever believed the <hi>Scripture</hi> on the <hi>infallible authority</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> That he doth suppose it to be <hi>Gods Word,</hi> when he saith, It is a <hi>Light to his feet,</hi> I deny not; but that he should suppose it to be so, because the <hi>Church</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly tell him it was so, is a most ungrounded Assertion. Had he not sufficient evidence that the <hi>Law</hi> was from <hi>God,</hi> by those many unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:101069:125"/>
and stupendous <hi>Miracles,</hi> which attended the delivery of it? Was not the whole constitution and government of the <hi>Jewish Nation,</hi> an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable argument that those things were true, which were recorded in their Books? Did ever the <hi>Jewish Sanhedrin, High Priest,</hi> or others, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to themselves any infallible Testimony, in delivering the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> to the people? The most you can suppose of a ground of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among them, was from that <hi>Sacred Record</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> which was kept in the <hi>Ark:</hi> And how could they know that was <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> but from the same <hi>Tradition,</hi> which conveyed the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> to them? So that nothing like any infallible Authority of a <hi>Church</hi> was looked on by them as necessary to believe the Law to have been from God. 3. Supposing it from tradition unquestionable, that the <hi>Law</hi> was from <hi>God,</hi> those incomparable directions which were in it might be a great confirmation to <hi>David's Faith,</hi> that it was his Word. Which is that he intends, in these words, <hi>Thy Word is a light to my feet, &amp;c.</hi> to shew that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perspicuity which was in his <hi>Word,</hi> that it gave him the best directions for ordering his conversation. And this is all which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship means, that to those, who, by the advantage of Tradition, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready venerable thoughts of <hi>Scripture</hi>; the serious conversing with it, doth highly advance them, and establish their belief of it, as that <hi>Faith</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>clinched</hi> which was <hi>driven in</hi> by education. And therefore, when he saith, <hi>That Light discovers its self as well as other things,</hi> he presently adds, <hi>not till there hath been a preparing instruction what Light it is. Thus</hi> (he saith) <hi>the Tradition of the Church is the first moral motive to belief: But the belief it self, that Scripture is the Word of God, rests upon Scripture,</hi>

                  <hi>yet doth he never avow, that this could be proved out of them, unless they were received by the infallible Authority of the Church.</hi> Which Answer is very unreasonable. For 1. It might be justly expected that his <hi>Lordship</hi> had produced an express Testimony to his purpose out of <hi>Origen,</hi> you should have brought some other as clear for his believing <hi>Scripture</hi> on the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> which you are so far from, that you would put us to prove a <hi>Negative</hi>: But, if you will deal fairly, and as you ought to do, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your Testimonies out of him, and the rest of the <hi>Fathers</hi> concerning your Churches Infallibility.

What doth your Infallibility conduce to the believing <hi>Scriptures</hi> for <hi>themselves?</hi> For, you say, <hi>The Scriptures cannot be proved by themselves to be Gods Word, unless they were received by the infallible Authority of the Church</hi>; it seems then, if they be so received, they may be proved by themselves to be <hi>Gods Word.</hi> Are those proofs by <hi>themselves</hi> sufficient for <hi>Faith</hi> or no?

asserting the <hi>last resolution of Faith</hi> to be into simply Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cites that speech of <hi>Henr. √† Gandavo, That in the Primitive Church, when the Apostles themselves spake, they did believe principally for the sake of God, and not the Apostles</hi>; from whence he inferrs, <hi>If, where the Apostles themselves spake, the last resolution of Faith was into God, and not into themselves on their own account; much more shall it now be into God, and not the present Church, and into the writings of the Apostles, than into the words of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors made up into Tradition.</hi> All that you answer, is, <hi>That this argument must be solved by the Bishop, as well as you, because he hath granted the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Apostles was Divine as well as you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Was there ever a more sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Answer! Doth <hi>Gandavo</hi> deny the <hi>Apostles authority</hi> to have been <hi>Divine?</hi> Nay, Doth he not imply it, when he saith, Men did not believe for the <hi>Apostles sakes,</hi> but for <hi>Gods,</hi> who spake by them. As S. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>You received our word, not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the Word of God.</hi> How <hi>the Bishop should be concerned to answer this,</hi> is beyond my skill to imagine. If <hi>Origen speaks to such as believed the Scriptures to be the Word of God</hi>; so doth the <hi>Bishop</hi> too, <hi>viz.</hi> on the account of Tradition and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. If <hi>Origen</hi> endeavoured by those proofs to confirm and settle their Faith, that is all the <hi>Bishop</hi> aims at, that a Faith taken up on the Churches Tradition, may be settled and confirmed by the internal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Scripture. But, how you should from this discourse assert, <hi>That the Authority of the Church must be infallible in delivering the Scripture,</hi> is again beyond my reach, neither can I possibly think what should bear the face of <hi>Premises</hi> to such a <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Unless it be, if <hi>Origen</hi> assert, <hi>That the Scriptures may be believed for themselves, if</hi> Gandavo <hi>saith, That the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith must be into God himself,</hi> then the <hi>Churches Authority</hi> must be <hi>infallible</hi>; but it appears already, that the premises are true, and what then remains but <hi>therefore, &amp;c.</hi> which may indeed be listed among your rare argumentations for <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Scripture cannot manifest it self to be an infallible Light</hi>; the proof of which is the design of your following discourse.<note place="margin">¬ß. 13.</note> Wherein you first quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel <hi>with the Bishop for his arguing from the Scriptures being a Light; for thence</hi> (you say) <hi>it will only follow, that the Scripture manifests it self to be a Light, which you grant, but that it should manifest it self to be an infallible Light you deny;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 88, 89.</note> 
                  <hi>for</hi> (say you) <hi>unless he could shew that there are no other Lights, save the Word of God, and such as are infallible, he can never make good his consequence. For in</hi> Seneca, Plutarch, Aristotle, <hi>you read many Lights, and those manifest themselves to be Lights; but they do not therefore manifest themselves to be infallible Lights.</hi> The substance of your argument lyes in this, <hi>The Scripture discovers the Being of God; so doth the Talmud and Alcoran, as well as it; the Scripture delivers abundance of moral instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but these may be found in multitudes of other Books, both of Christians, and Jews, and Heathens; and as we do not thence inferr, that these Books are infallible, so neither can we that the Scriptures are.</hi> This is the utmost of sense or reason, which I can extract out of your discourse; which reduced into <hi>Form,</hi> will come to this. If the <hi>Scriptures</hi> contain nothing in them, but what may be found in other <hi>Books</hi> that are not <hi>infallible,</hi> then the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cannot shew themselves to be <hi>infallible</hi>; but the antecedent is true, and therefore the consequent. I could wish you would have taken a little more pains in proving that which must be your assumption, <hi>viz. That Scripture contains nothing in it but what may be seen in</hi> Seneca, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Aristotle, <hi>the</hi> Talmud, Alcoran, <hi>and other Books of Jews and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:101069:126"/>
These are rare things to assert among <hi>Christians,</hi> without offering at any more proof of them than you do, which lyes in this <hi>Syllogism. If Scripture contain some things</hi> which may be seen in these <hi>Books,</hi> then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>nothing</hi> but what may be seen in these <hi>Books</hi>; but the <hi>Scripture</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains some things which may be seen in other Books, <hi>viz. the existence of God,</hi> and <hi>moral instructions</hi>; therefore it contains nothing but what is in them. And, Do you really think that you have now proved, that there is nothing in <hi>Scripture</hi> that can shew it self to be <hi>infallible,</hi> because some things are common to other writings. Would you not take it very ill that any should say that you had no more <hi>brains</hi> than a <hi>Horse,</hi> or a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a like nature, because they have <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> as well as you? Yet this is the very same argument whereby you would prove that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cannot shew themselves to be <hi>Divine,</hi> because the <hi>Talmud, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and <hi>Philosophers,</hi> have some things in them which the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath. But, Can you prove that the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath nothing else in it, but what may be found in any, or all of these Books? Will you undertake to shew any where such <hi>representations</hi> of the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Attributes of God,</hi> so suitable to the conceptions which naturally flow from the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Infinite Being,</hi> and yet those <hi>Attributes</hi> discovered in such contrivances for mans <hi>Good,</hi> which the wit of man could never have reached to; above all, in the <hi>reconciliation</hi> of the world to himself by the death of his <hi>Son?</hi> Will you find out so exact a <hi>Rule</hi> of Piety, consisting of such <hi>excellent Precepts,</hi> such <hi>incouraging Promises</hi> as are in <hi>Scripture,</hi> in any other writings whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever? Can you discover any where such an unexpressible <hi>energy</hi> and force in a writing of so great <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>plainness</hi> as the <hi>Scripture</hi> is? Is there any thing unbecoming that <hi>Authority,</hi> which it awes the consciences of men with? Is there any thing mean, trivial, fabulous, and impertinent in it? Are not all things written with that infinite <hi>decorum</hi> and suitableness, as do highly express the <hi>Majesty</hi> of him from whom it comes, but in the most sweet, affable, and condescending manner? Are there any such arguments in the writings of <hi>Seneca, Plutarch, Aristotle,</hi> for the Being of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> of <hi>souls,</hi> as there are in <hi>Scripture?</hi> Are there any <hi>moral instructions</hi> built on such <hi>good grounds,</hi> carried on to so high a <hi>degree,</hi> written with that <hi>life</hi> and <hi>vigour</hi> in any of the <hi>Heathen Philosophers,</hi> as are in the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> How infinitely do the highest of them fall short of the <hi>Scripture</hi> in those very things, which they seem most to have in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with it? As, were it here a fit place, might be at large discovered. But, besides, and beyond all these, Are there not other <hi>things</hi> which evidence the <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which none of the <hi>writings</hi> you mention, can in the least pretend to, <hi>viz.</hi> the accurate <hi>accomplishment</hi> of <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and the abundance of <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought for the confirmation of the <hi>Divine Testimony</hi> of those who delivered this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> to the world. And these very things now to us are <hi>internal</hi> to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>motives</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> being delivered to us in the same Books that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is: In which sense the <hi>Scriptures</hi> may well be said to be proved <hi>Divine</hi> by <hi>themselves,</hi> and that they appear <hi>infallible</hi> by the <hi>Light</hi> which is in them, notwithstanding you most pitifully pretend to the contrary. And, if your <hi>Church</hi> will again pardon you for such opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous language of Scripture, as not only to compare the writings of <hi>Seneca, Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> with it, which yet are commendable in their kind, for <hi>moral Virtue,</hi> and <hi>natural Knowledge</hi>; but those wretched and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impostures of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the fabulous relations of the <hi>Talmud</hi>;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:101069:127"/>
if, I say, your <hi>Church</hi> will pardon such expressions as these, because they tend to inhance her <hi>Infallibility,</hi> well fare that <hi>Pope,</hi> who said <hi>Heu quam minimo regitur mundus!</hi>

               <p>As for your following instance <hi>of a Candle lighted in a room, which shews that it is a light, but not who lighted it; so the sentences in Scripture are lights, and shew themselves to be such, but they cannot shew themselves to be such infallible lights which are produced by none but God himself:</hi> I answer; That I commend your discretion in making choice of a <hi>Candle</hi> rather than of the <hi>light of the Sun</hi> to set forth the <hi>Scripture</hi> by. For a <hi>Candle</hi> yields but a dim uncertain light, may be put into a <hi>dark lanthorn,</hi> and <hi>snuffed</hi> at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; so would your <hi>Church</hi> fain pretend of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that its <hi>light</hi> is very <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> that your <hi>Church</hi> must open the sides of the <hi>Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn</hi> that it may give light, and make use of some <hi>Apostolical Snuffers</hi> of the <hi>Popes</hi> keeping, to make it shine the <hi>clearer,</hi> though they often endanger the almost extinguishing of it; at least as to the generation of those who should enjoy the benefit of it. But because that poor <hi>light</hi> of a <hi>Candle</hi> cannot shew who lighted it, Will not the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> manifest it self to be no greater than that of a <hi>Candle?</hi> Cannot any one inferr from the <hi>vast extent</hi> of that <hi>light,</hi> from the vanishing of it upon the <hi>Suns</hi> setting, and its dispersing it self at his <hi>rising,</hi> that this <hi>light</hi> can proceed only from that great <hi>luminous body</hi> which is in the <hi>Heavens?</hi> And may we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably inferr, from the <hi>clearness, greatness, majesty, coherency</hi> of those <hi>truths</hi> revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that they must certainly come from none but <hi>God</hi>; especially being joyned with those impregnable <hi>evidences</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the persons who delivered them that they were imployed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for that end? But because this is a matter of great consequence give me leave to propound these questions to you, and after you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered them seriously, return me a rational answer to them. 1. Doth it imply any repugnancy at all in the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> or to the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that he should reveal his mind to the world. 2. If it doth not, as I suppose you will grant that, Whether is it possible that <hi>God</hi> should make it evident to the world that such a <hi>Revelation</hi> is from himself? 3. If this be not impossible, Is it not necessary that it should be so, supposing that <hi>God</hi> should require the <hi>belief</hi> of a Doctrine so reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>eternal damnation</hi> for not believing it? 4. Whether <hi>God</hi> may not give as great evidence of a <hi>Revelation</hi> that he makes of his mind to the world, as he doth of his <hi>Being,</hi> from the <hi>Wisdom, Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which may be seen in the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Creation?</hi> 5. Whether any other way be conceivable that it should be evident that a <hi>Doctrine</hi> comes from <hi>God,</hi> but that it contains things highly suitable to the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> things above the <hi>finding</hi> out of <hi>humane reason,</hi> things only tending to advance <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> in the world, and this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be delivered by persons who wrought unparalleld <hi>miracles?</hi> 6. Whether all these be not in the most evident manner imaginable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture?</hi> which I leave any man that hath common sense to judge of? 7. Whether then it be not the highest disparagement of this <hi>Divine doctrine</hi> to make it stand in need of an Infallible testimony of any company who shall take the boldness to call themselves the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in order to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of it; and whether there can be any greater dishonour done it, then to say it hath no more light to discover it self Divine, than the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Philosophers,</hi> not to add of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans?</hi> These things I

leave you and the reader to consider of, and proceed. What follows <hi>concerning the Fathers and others proving the Scriptures to be the Word of God by themselves, after they have believed them infallibly on other grounds,</hi> is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> unless you can prove from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Scriptures infallibly</hi> on other grounds.

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>but it doth not follow that it must be evident to every one that looks into it; for the blindness or perversness of mens minds may keep them from the discovery of it.</hi> 2. He saith, <hi>This light is not so full a light as that of the first Principles, as, that the whole is greater than the part, that the same thing cannot be, and not be, at the same time.</hi> And yet such is your sincerity, you would seem at first to perswade the Reader of the contrary in your next <hi>Paragraph</hi>; but at last you grant that he denies it to be <hi>evidently known as one of the Principles of the first sort.</hi> (For you with your wonted subtilty distinguish <hi>Principles known of themselves, into such as are either evidently, and such as are probably known of themselves,</hi> i. e. <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples known of themselves,</hi> are either such as <hi>are known of themselves,</hi> or such <hi>as are not</hi>; for what is but <hi>probably known,</hi> is not certainly <hi>known of it self,</hi> but by that <hi>probable argument</hi> which causeth assent to it).

               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Bishop saith, That when he speaks of this light in Scripture, he only means it of such a light as is of force to breed Faith, that it is the Word of God; not to make a perfect knowledge.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:101069:128"/>
than any knowledge can be, because it rests upon Divine authority, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive; whereas knowledge (or at least he that thinks he knows) is not ever certain in deductions from Principles; but the Evidence is not so clear. Now God doth not require a full demonstrative knowledge in us that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is his Word, and therefore in his Providence hath kindled in it no light for that, but he requires our Faith of it, and such a certain demonstration as may fit that.</hi> Now what answer do you return to all this? <hi>Why,</hi> forsooth, <hi>We must have certainty, nay an Infallible certainty, nay such an Infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as is built on the Infallible Authority of the Church,</hi> yet such an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Authority</hi> as can be proved only by <hi>motives of credibility</hi>; which is a new kind of <hi>Climax</hi> in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> viz. a <hi>ladder</hi> standing with both <hi>ends</hi> upon <hi>ground</hi> at the same time.

I shall not quarrel much with you about the interpretation of those words of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the sense you give them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Eccles.</hi> l. 3. c. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> if they be understood of <hi>absolute necessity, not of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and <hi>only in rare cases,</hi> that it is not necessary to believe that there is Scripture, on supposition that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> could be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently conveyed to the minds of any without it, as in the case of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations</hi> mentioned by <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> But for you who make the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the present <hi>Church Infallible,</hi> and at the least the <hi>Infallible conveyer</hi> of the <hi>formal object of Faith</hi>; I do not see how you can avoid making it as <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to be believed as any other <hi>object</hi> of Faith: unless your <hi>Church</hi> hath some other way of conveying objects of Faith, than by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the <hi>Scripture</hi> infallibly to us. If therefore men are bound to believe things absolutely necessary to salvation, because contained in that <hi>Book,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> delivers to be the <hi>Infallible Word of God</hi>; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly see, but the belief of the <hi>Scripture</hi> on the Churches Infallible Testimony must be as necessary <hi>necessitate medii</hi> as any thing contained in it. As for the Citation of <hi>Hooker</hi> by <hi>Brierely,</hi> Whether it be falsified or no will best be seen by producing the scope and design of that worthy <hi>Authour</hi> in the Testimonies, cited out of him. Upon an impartial view of which in the several places referred to, I cannot but say, that if <hi>Briere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>'s design was to shew that <hi>Hooker</hi> made the authority of the <hi>Church</hi> that into which <hi>Faith</hi> is lastly resolved, he doth evidently contradict Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> design, and is therefore guilty of unfaithful representing his meaning. For where he doth most fully and largely express himself he useth these words, which for clearing his meaning must be fully produced. <hi>Scripture teacheth all supernaturally revealed truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. 3 sect. 8</note> 
                  <hi>without the knowledge whereof salvation cannot be attained. The main principle whereon the belief of all things therein contained dependeth, is, that the Scriptures are the Oracles of God himself. This in it self we cannot say is evident. For then all men that hear it would acknowledge it in heart, as they do when they hear that every whole is more than any part of that whole, because this in it self is evident. The other we know that all do not acknowledge it when they hear
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101069:128"/>
it. There must be therefore some former knowledge presupposed, which doth herein assure the hearts of all believers. Scripture teacheth us that saving truth which God hath discovered to the world by Revelation, and it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth us taught otherwise, that it self is Divine and Sacred. The question then being by what means we are taught this; some answer, That to learn it we have no other way then only Tradition: As namely that so we believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both we from our predecessours, and they from theirs have so received. But is this enough? That which all mens experience teacheth them, may not in any wise be denyed. And by experience we all know, that the first Motive leading men so to esteem of the Scripture is the Authority of Gods Church. For when we know the whole Church of God, hath that opinion of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we judge it even at the first an impudent thing for any man bred and brought up in the Church to be of a contrary mind without cause. Afterwards the more we bestow our labour in reading or hearing the mysteries thereof, the more we find that the thing it self doth answer our receiv'd opinion concerning it. So that the former inducement prevailing somewhat with us before, doth now much more prevail, when the very thing hath ministred farther reason.</hi> Can any thing be more plain (if mens meaning may be gathered from their words, especially when purposely they treat of a subject) than that <hi>Hooker</hi> makes the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> the primary inducement to <hi>Faith,</hi> and that <hi>rational evidence</hi> which discovers it self in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> revealed to be that which it is finally resolved into? For, as his Lordship saith on this very place of <hi>Hooker, The resolution of Faith ever settles upon the farthest reason it can, not upon the first inducement.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 90.</note> By this place then where this <hi>worthy Authour</hi> most clearly and fully delivers his judgement, we ought in reason to interpret all other occasional and incidental passages on the same subject. So in that other place. <hi>For whatsoever we believe concerning salvation by Christ although the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be therein the ground of our belief, yet the authority of man is,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. 2. sect. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>if we mark it, the key which openeth the door of entrance into the knowledge of the Scriptures.</hi> I will not dispute, whether here he speaks concerning the knowledge of <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>Scripture,</hi> or concerning the natural sense and meaning of <hi>Scripture:</hi> suppose I should grant you the latter, it would make little for your purpose; for when he adds, <hi>The Scripture doth not teach us the things that are of God, unless we did credit men who have taught us that the words of Scripture do signifie those things.</hi> You need not here <hi>bid us stay a while:</hi> For his sense is plain and obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> that men cannot come to the natural sense and importance of the words used in <hi>Scripture,</hi> unless they rely on the <hi>authority of men</hi> for the <hi>signification</hi> of those <hi>words.</hi> He speaks not here then at all concerning <hi>Church-Tradition</hi> properly taken, but meerly of the <hi>authority of man,</hi> which he contends must in many cases be relyed on, particularly in that of the sense and meaning of the <hi>words</hi> which occurr in <hi>Scripture.</hi> Therefore with his Lordships leave and yours too, I do not think that in this place <hi>Hooker</hi> by the <hi>authority of man</hi> doth understand <hi>Church-Tradition,</hi> but if I may so call it <hi>Humane-Tradition, viz.</hi> that which acquainteth us with the force and signification of <hi>words</hi> in <hi>use.</hi> When therefore you prove that it is <hi>Tradition</hi> only, which is all the ground he puts of believing <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> from those words of his, <hi>That utterly to infringe the force and strength of mans testimony, were to shake the very Fortress of Gods truth. Now</hi> (say you) <hi>How can that Fortress (the Scripture) be shaken, were not that authority esteemed by him the ground of that Fortress.</hi> That may
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101069:129"/>
very easily be shewn, <hi>viz.</hi> by calling in question the <hi>truth of humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> in general; for he plainly speaks of such a kind of <hi>humane testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> as that is, whereby we know there is such a City as <hi>Rome,</hi> that such and such were <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein the ground of our perswasion can be nothing else but <hi>humane testimony</hi>; now take away the <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity</hi> of this <hi>testimony,</hi> the <hi>very Fortress of truth</hi> must needs be shaken; for we could never be certain that there were such persons, as <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>Prophets, Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> in the world, we could never be certain of the meaning of any thing written by them. But how farr is this from the final resolution of Faith into <hi>Church-Tradition?</hi> But the place you lay the greatest force on, is that which you <hi>first</hi> cite out of him, <hi>Finally we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Scriptures of God are sacred,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. 2. sect. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and that they have proceeded from God; our selves we assure, that we do right well in so believing. We have for this a demonstration sound and Infallible. But it is not the Word of God which doth or can possibly assure us, that we do well to think it his Word.</hi> From hence you inferr, <hi>That either he must settle no Infallible ground at all, or must say that the Tradition of the Church is that ground.</hi> No <hi>Infallible ground</hi> in <hi>your sense,</hi> I grant it, but well enough in his own; for all the difficulty lies in understanding what he means by <hi>Infallible</hi>; which he takes not in your sense for a <hi>supernatural,</hi> but only for a <hi>rational Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>; not such a one as excludes <hi>possibility of deception,</hi> but all <hi>reasonable doubting.</hi> In which sense he saith of such things as are capable only of moral certainty, <hi>That the Testimony of man will stand as a ground of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible assurance</hi>;<note place="margin">L. 2. sect. 8.</note> and presently instanceth in these, <hi>That there is such a City of Rome, that Pius</hi> 5. <hi>was Pope there,</hi> &amp;c. So afterwards, he saith, <hi>That the mind of man desireth evermore to know the truth according to the most Infallible certainty which the nature of things can yield:</hi> by which it is plain, that the <hi>utmost certainty</hi> which things are capable of is with him <hi>Infallible certainty</hi>; and so a sound and <hi>Infallible ground</hi> of Faith is a <hi>certain ground,</hi> which we all assert may be had without your Churches <hi>Infallible Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Whether therefore <hi>Brierely</hi> and you are not guilty, if not of falsify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hookers</hi> words, yet of perverting his meaning, let the <hi>Impartial Reader</hi> judge.</p>

               <head>CHAP.VIII. The Churches Infallibility not proved from Scripture.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Some general considerations from the design of proving the Churches Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from Scripture. No Infallibility in the High-Priest and his Clergy under the Law; if there had been, no necessity there should be under the Gospel. Of St. <hi>Basils</hi> Testimony concerning Traditions. Scripture less lyable to corruption than Traditions. The great uncertainty of judging Traditions when Apostolical, when not. The Churches perpetuity being promised in Scripture proves not its Infallibility. His Lordship doth not falsifie <hi>A. C</hi>'s words, but <hi>T. C.</hi> doth his meaning. Producing the Jesuits words no traducing their Order. <hi>T. C</hi>'s. miserable Apology for them. The particular texts produced for the Churches Infallibility, examined. No such Infallibility necessary in the Apostles Successours as in Themselves. The similitude of Scripture and Tradition to an Ambassadour and his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials, rightly stated.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE main design of this Chapter being to prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> from the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi>;<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> before I come to a particular discussion of the matters contained in it, I shall make some general <hi>Observations</hi> on the scope and design of it, which may give more light to the particulars to be handled in it. 1. <hi>That the Infallibility you challenge to the Church, is such as must suppose a promise extant of it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi> Which is evident from the words of <hi>A. C.</hi> (which you own) to his Lordship, <hi>That if he would consider the Tradition of the Church, not only as it is the Tradition of a company of fallible men, in which sense the Authority of it is humane and fallible, but as the Tradition of a company of men assisted by Christ and his Holy Spirit; in that sense he might easily find it more than an Introduction, indeed as much as would amount to an Infallible Motive.</hi> Whence I inferr, that in order to the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> being an <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Motive</hi> to <hi>Faith,</hi> it must be believed that this <hi>company of men</hi> which make the <hi>Church,</hi> are <hi>assisted by Christ</hi> and his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; Now I demand, Supposing there were no <hi>Scripture</hi> extant, (the belief of which you said before in defence of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> was not necessary to salvation) by what means could you prove such an Infallible <hi>Assistance</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in order to the perswading an <hi>Infidel</hi> to believe? Could you to one that neither believes <hi>Christ,</hi> nor the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> prove evidently that your <hi>Church</hi> had an assistance of both these? You tell him that he cannot believe that there is a <hi>Christ</hi> or a <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> unless he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves first your <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> and yet he cannot believe your <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> unless he believes there are such things as <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; for that Infallibility, by your own confession, doth suppose the peculiar <hi>assistance</hi> of both these. And can any one believe their <hi>assistance,</hi> before he believes they are? If you say, as you do, <hi>By the motives of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility you will prove your Church Infallible.</hi> But (setting aside the absurdity of that which I have fully discovered already) Is it possible for you to prove your <hi>Church Infallible,</hi> unless antecedently to the belief of your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> You can prove to an <hi>Infidel</hi> the truth of these things?</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>names of Christ</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> are no <hi>Chimerical Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Ideas,</hi> but that they do import <hi>something real:</hi> otherwise an <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:101069:130"/>
would speedily tell you, these <hi>names</hi> imported nothing but some kind of <hi>Magical spells</hi> which could keep men from <hi>errour,</hi> as long as they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them about with them. That as well might <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or any other <hi>Impostor,</hi> pretend an <hi>infallible assistance</hi> from some <hi>Tutelar Angels,</hi> with hard <hi>Arabick names,</hi> as you of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> unless you can make it appear to him, that really there are such <hi>Beings</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and when you have proved it to him, and he be upon your proof inclinable to believe it, you are bound to tell him by your <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that for all these <hi>proofs,</hi> he can only <hi>fancy</hi> there are such <hi>Beings,</hi> but he cannot really <hi>believe</hi> them, unless he first believes your <hi>Church infallible.</hi> And when he tells you, <hi>He cannot, according to your own Doctrine, believe that Infallibility, unless he believes the other first,</hi> Would he not cry out upon you, as either lamentable <hi>Fools,</hi> that did not understand what you said, or egregious <hi>Impostors,</hi> that play fast and loose with him, bidding him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve first one thing, and then another, till at last he may justly tell you, that in this manner he cannot be perswaded to believe any thing at all. 2. Supposing he should get through this, and believe that there were such <hi>Beings</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> he may justly ask you, 1. Whether they be nothing else but such a kind of <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> as the <hi>Arabick Philosophers</hi> imagined, some kind of <hi>Being</hi> which did assist the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in conception? You answer him <hi>No,</hi> but they are <hi>real distinct perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalities</hi> of the same <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>essence</hi> with <hi>God</hi> himself; then he asks, 2. Whence doth this appear? for these being such grand <hi>difficulties,</hi> you had need of some very clear evidence of them: If you send him to <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> he asks you, To what end? for the belief of that must suppose the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> in <hi>Question,</hi> that your <hi>Church is infallible</hi> in delivery of this <hi>Scripture</hi> for <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> But he further demands, 3. Whence comes that <hi>Church</hi> which you call <hi>Infallible</hi> to have this <hi>Assistance</hi> of both these? Do they assist all kind of men to make them <hi>infallible?</hi> You an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>No.</hi> But, Do they assist, though not all men separately, yet all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of men conjunctly? You answer, <hi>No.</hi> Do they assist all men only in <hi>Religious actions,</hi> of what Religion soever they are of? Still you answer, <hi>No.</hi> Do they assist then all men of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in their societies? <hi>No.</hi> Do they assist all those among the <hi>Christians,</hi> who say, they have this <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance? No.</hi> Do they thus assist all <hi>Churches</hi> to keep them from errour? <hi>No. Whom</hi> is it then that they do thus infallibly assist? You answer, The <hi>Church.</hi> But what <hi>Church</hi> do you mean? <hi>The Catholick Church.</hi> But, which is this <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (for, I hear, there are as great Controversies about that, as any thing.) You must answer confidently, <hi>That Church which is in the</hi> Roman <hi>Communion, is the true Catholick Church.</hi> Have then all in that <hi>Communion</hi> this <hi>Infallible Assistance? No.</hi> Have all the <hi>Bishops</hi> in this Communion, it? <hi>No.</hi> Have all these <hi>Bishops</hi> this <hi>Assistance,</hi> when they meet together? <hi>Yes,</hi> say you, <hi>undoubtedly, if the Pope be their Head, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Acts.</hi> Then it should seem to me, that this <hi>Infallible Assistance</hi> is in the <hi>Pope,</hi> and he it is whom you call the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is a <hi>very big man</hi> then, is he not? But, say you, <hi>These are Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which are not necessary for you to know, it sufficeth that the Catholick Church is the subject of Infallibility.</hi> But, I had thought nothing could have been more necessary than to <hi>have known this</hi>: But I proceed then, How comes this <hi>Catholick Church</hi> to have this <hi>Infallible Assistance?</hi> Cannot I suppose that <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> may exist without giving this <hi>Assistance?</hi> cannot I suppose that <hi>Christian Religion</hi> may be in the world, without such an
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101069:130"/>
                  <hi>Infallibility?</hi> Is this <hi>Assistance</hi> therefore a <hi>necessary,</hi> or a <hi>free</hi> Act? A <hi>free Act.</hi> If a <hi>free Act,</hi> then, for all you know, Your <hi>Catholick Church</hi> may not be so assisted: <hi>No,</hi> (you reply) <hi>you are sure it is so assisted.</hi> But, Whence can you be <hi>sure</hi> of an <hi>arbitrary thing,</hi> unless the <hi>Authours</hi> of this <hi>Assistance</hi> have engaged themselves by <hi>Promise,</hi> to give your <hi>Catholick Church that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Assistance? Yes,</hi> that they have (you reply) and then produce <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. But, although our <hi>Infidel</hi> might ask some untoward Questions still; as, How you are sure these are <hi>Divine Promises,</hi> when the knowledge that they are <hi>Divine</hi> must suppose the thing to be <hi>true,</hi> which you would prove out of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that your <hi>Church is infallible?</hi> Supposing them <hi>Divine,</hi> how are you <hi>sure,</hi> That, and no other, is the <hi>meaning</hi> of them, when from such places you prove, that your <hi>Church</hi> is the only <hi>Infallible Interpreter</hi> of <hi>Scripture?</hi> But, I let pass these, and other Questions, and satisfie my self with this, <hi>That it is impossible for you to prove such an Infallible Assistance of Christ and the Holy Spirit, unless you produce some express Promise for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This being impossible, it necessarily follows, <hi>That the only Motives of Credibility, which can prove your Church Infallible, must be such as do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently prove these Promises to be Divine.</hi> This is so plain and evident a <hi>Consectary</hi> from the former, that it were an <hi>affront</hi> upon humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to go about to prove it: For, if the <hi>Infallibility</hi> doth depend upon the <hi>Promise,</hi> nothing can prove that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but what doth prove that <hi>Promise</hi> to be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Divine: True,</hi> or else not to be believed; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> or else not to be relyed on for such an <hi>Assistance</hi>; none else being able to make a promise of it, but the Authour of it. As therefore my right to an estate as given by <hi>Will,</hi> depends wholly upon the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Validity</hi> of that <hi>Will,</hi> which I must first prove, before I can challenge any <hi>right</hi> to it; So your pretence of <hi>Infallibility</hi> must solely depend upon the <hi>Promises</hi> which you challenge it by. By which it appears, that your attempting to prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> by <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Credibility,</hi> antecedent to, and independent on the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is vain, ridiculous, and destructive to that very <hi>Infallibility</hi> which you pretend to. Which, being by a <hi>free As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> must wholly depend on the proof of the <hi>Promise</hi> made of it. For, if you prove no <hi>Promise,</hi> all your <hi>Motives of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility</hi> prove nothing at all, as I have at large demonstrated before, and shall not follow you in needless repetitions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>No right to any priviledge can be challenged, by virtue of a free Promise made to particular persons, unless it be evident that the intention of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miser was, that it should equally extend to them and others.</hi> For the <hi>Promise</hi> being <hi>free,</hi> and the <hi>Priviledge</hi> such as carries no necessity at all along with it, in order to the great ends of Christian Religion; it is intolerable <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance</hi> and <hi>Presumption</hi> to challenge it, without manifest evidence, that the design of it was for <hi>them,</hi> as well as the <hi>persons</hi> to whom it was made. Indeed, in such <hi>Promises</hi> which are built on common and general <hi>grounds,</hi> containing things agreeable to all <hi>Christians,</hi> it is but reasonable to inferr the universal <hi>extent</hi> of that <hi>Promise</hi> to all such as are in the like condition. Hence the <hi>Apostle</hi> inferrs, from the particular Promise made to <hi>Joshua, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee</hi>; the effect of it upon all believers. Although, had not the <hi>Apostle</hi> done it before us, it may seem questionable on what ground we could have done it, unless from the general <hi>reason</hi> of of it, and the unbounded nature of <hi>Divine Goodness,</hi> in things necessary for the <hi>Good</hi> of his <hi>People.</hi> But in things <hi>arbitrary,</hi> and such as contain <hi>special
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:101069:131"/>
Priviledge</hi> in them, to challenge a <hi>right</hi> to a Promise of the same Priviledge, without equal <hi>evidence</hi> of the descent of it, as the first <hi>Grant,</hi> is great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and a challenge of the <hi>Promisor</hi> for <hi>partiality,</hi> if he doth not make it good. Because the pretence of the right of the <hi>Priviledge</hi> goes upon this ground, that it is as much due to the <hi>Successor,</hi> as to the Original <hi>Grantee.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Nothing can be more unreasonable, than to challenge a right to a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by virtue of such a Promise which was granted upon quite different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations from the grounds on which that right is challenged.</hi> Thus I shall after make it evident, that the Promise of an <hi>Infallible Assistance</hi> of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> had a peculiar respect to the <hi>Apostles</hi> present employment, and the first <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that it was not made upon <hi>reasons</hi> common to all ages, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <hi>Government of the Church, deciding Controversies, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith,</hi> all which Ends may be sufficiently attained without them. But, above all, it seems very unreasonable, that a <hi>Promise</hi> made to persons in <hi>one office,</hi> must be applied in the same manner to persons in a quite <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent office</hi>; that a Promise made to <hi>each of them separate,</hi> must be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to others <hi>only as in Council</hi>; that a <hi>Promise</hi> made implying <hi>Divine Assistance,</hi> must be equally applied to such, who dare not say, that <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> is <hi>Divine</hi> (but <hi>infallible,</hi> and <hi>after a sort Divine</hi>) that a <hi>Promise</hi> made of <hi>immediate Divine Revelation,</hi> and enabling the <hi>persons</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Priviledge of it, <hi>to work miracles</hi> to attest their Testimony to be <hi>infallible,</hi> should be equally applied to such as dare not challenge a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> nor ever did <hi>work a miracle</hi> to attest such an <hi>Infallible Assistance.</hi> Yet all this is done by you in your endeavour of fetching the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> out of those Promises of the <hi>assistance</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which were made to the <hi>Apostles.</hi> These general Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, do sufficiently enervate the force of your whole Chapter, which yet I come particularly to consider.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> tells <hi>A. C. That in the second sense of Church-Tradition, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find that the Tradition of the present Church is of Divine and Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 2. Sect. 16. n. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>till</hi> A. C. <hi>can prove that this company of men (the</hi> Roman <hi>Prelates and Clergy he means) are so fully, so clearly, so permanently assisted by Christ, and his Spirit, as may reach to Infallibility, much less to a Divine Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in this or any other Principle which they teach.</hi> In answer to this, you tell us,<note place="margin">P. 98. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Bishop declines the Question by withdrawing his Reader from the thesis, to the hypothesis; from the Church, to the Church of</hi> Rome. But, Is it not sufficiently known to all persons who deal in this Controversie, what you mean by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in this Controversie, that it shall not be lawful <hi>for his Lordship in a Parenthesis,</hi> to shew where you place this <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> but he must be charged with declining the Question? This only shews a desire to <hi>cavil</hi> at little things, when you were unable to answer greater. Besides, in the way you take of proving the <hi>Churches Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> by the <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> there is a necessity even in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, of declaring what that <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is, which must be known by these <hi>Motives</hi>; and therefore you have no cause to look upon this as running away from the Question. <hi>That</hi> A. C. <hi>after a long and silent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did meerly, through the heat of his zeal, become earnest in this business, to do his Adversary good.</hi> I must believe it, because you tell me so, though I see no great <hi>Motive of Credibility</hi> for it. And on that account did desire him, <hi>to consider the Tradition of the Church, as of a Company of men infallibly assisted. For such assistance</hi> (you say) <hi>is necessary as well to have sufficient
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:101069:131"/>
assurance of the true Canon of Holy Scripture, as to come to the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and interpretation thereof.</hi> But this is as easily denied as said. We wait therefore for your proofs.</p>
               <p>That which only seems here intended for that end, is, That <hi>when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator had said, The Prophets under the Old Testament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 91. n. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Apostles under the New, had such an Infallible Divine Assistance; but neither the High Priest with his Clergy in the Old, nor any Company of Prelates or Priests in the New, since the Apostles, ever had it.</hi> To this you reply, <hi>That the like assistance (with the Prophets and Apostles) the High Priest with his Clergy had in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, as we gather out of</hi> Deut. 17.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 97. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Where in doubts the people were bound, not only to have recourse to the High Priest and his Clergy, but to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and stand to their judgement. Much more then ought we to think, that there is such an obligation in the New Testament; which could not stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Infallibility. Witness the infinite dissentions and divisions in Points of Faith, amongst all the different Christians that deny it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things the force of this argument lyes in. 1. <hi>That there was Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility in the High Priest and his Clergy under the Law.</hi> 2. <hi>That if there were so then, there ought to be so now.</hi> Both these must be considered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there was Infallibility in the High Priest and his Clergy under the Law,</hi> which you prove from <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8. <hi>Because there the people were not only to have recourse to them, but to submit and stand to their judgement.</hi> This argument in form, is this. Where there is to be not only a recourse, but an <hi>obligation to submission,</hi> there must be <hi>Infallibility</hi>; but there were both these among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as to the <hi>High Priest and his Clergy; ergo.</hi> You may see how forcible this argument is in a like case: Where there is to be not only a recourse in matters of difficulty, but an obligation to <hi>submit</hi> and stand to their <hi>judgement,</hi> there must be <hi>Infallibility</hi>; but to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> there ought to be not only a recourse in matters of <hi>difficulty,</hi> but a <hi>submission to their judgement</hi>; therefore the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is as <hi>infallible</hi> as the <hi>High Priest and Clergy</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> by the very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by you produced. The same will hold for all <hi>Courts of Justice.</hi> But, Can you by no means distinguish between an <hi>obligation to submission,</hi> and an <hi>obligation in conscience to assent</hi> to what is determined as <hi>infallibly true?</hi> Is every person in all judiciary <hi>Cases,</hi> where submission is required, bound to believe the <hi>Judges</hi> sentence <hi>infallible?</hi> If so, we need not go over the <hi>Alps</hi> for <hi>Infallibility,</hi> we may have it much cheaper at home: But, I suppose you will reply, The case is very different, because in the Text by you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, 1. <hi>Not Civil Matters,</hi> but <hi>Religious</hi> are spoken of. 2. That not any <hi>Civil Magistrates,</hi> but the <hi>High Priest and his Clergy</hi> are the <hi>Judges</hi> mentioned. 3. That not every kind of <hi>Judgement,</hi> but an <hi>Infallible Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is there set down. But, if every one of these be false, you will see, what little advantage comes to your cause by this Testimony; which I shall in order demonstrate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this place speaks not of <hi>Religious Causes,</hi> as such; but of <hi>Civil Causes, i. e.</hi> not of <hi>matters of Doctrine</hi> to be decided as <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> but <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> to be determined as to <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong.</hi> Not but that some things concerning the <hi>Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> of the Nation might be there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; for it was impossible in a Nation, whose <hi>Laws</hi> depended on their <hi>Religion,</hi> to separate the one from the other: But, that the <hi>Judgement</hi> given there, did not determine the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>falshood</hi> of things, so as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige <hi>mens consciences</hi> to believe them; but did so peremptorily decide them, that the persons concerned were bound to acquiesce in that determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101069:132"/>
For the proof of this, one would think, the very reading of the place were sufficient.<note place="margin">Deut. 17.8.</note> 
                  <hi>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in Judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversies within thy gates, then shalt thou arise and get thee up into the place which the Lord thy God shall chuse,</hi> &amp;c. Which words are so generally expressed, on purpose to take in all manner of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which might rise among them, whether civil, criminal, or ceremonial. And herein <hi>God</hi> makes provision against any <hi>rupture</hi> which might be among them upon any emergent Controversie, by establishing a <hi>Court of Appeals,</hi> to which all such causes should be brought, in which the lesser <hi>Courts</hi> could not agree. For that seems to be the main scope of the words, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing expression of <hi>Controversies within thy gates,</hi> by which it seems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the <hi>Controversies</hi> were such as could come to no <hi>resolution</hi> in those inferiour <hi>Courts</hi> which sate in the <hi>Gates of the Cities</hi>; by which it appears, that these could be no momentous <hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> which never came under the cognizance of those <hi>inferiour</hi> and <hi>subordinate Courts.</hi> By these words then <hi>God</hi> doth erect a <hi>Supreme Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature</hi> among them, to which they might <hi>appeal,</hi> not only in case of <hi>injury,</hi> but in case of difficulty; and those lesser <hi>Courts,</hi> as well as particular <hi>persons,</hi> were to <hi>submit</hi> to the <hi>Decree</hi> of the great <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> sitting in the place which <hi>God</hi> should chuse, which was <hi>Shilo</hi> first, and <hi>Hierusalem</hi> after. And thence <hi>Maimonides</hi> so often saith, That the establishment and coagmentation of all the <hi>Israelites,</hi> did depend upon this place; for hereby <hi>God</hi> set up such a Tribunal, to which the <hi>last Resort</hi> should be made, and from whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations there should remain no further appeal. And according to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> these appeals were to be <hi>gradual, i. e.</hi> in case any Priest should be to seek as to any <hi>Ceremonial Cause,</hi> as that of <hi>Leprosie,</hi> brought before him, he was to take advice of the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> where he lived; if that did not agree, then he was to appeal to the lesser <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of 23. in the neighbour-City, if there it could not be ended to the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of 23. at the entrance of the Mount of the <hi>Temple</hi>; if not there neither, then <hi>appeal</hi> was made to the <hi>Great Sanhedrin,</hi> whose sentence was final and <hi>peremptory,</hi> and was instead of a <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Case.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. You are greatly mistaken in supposing that all this is spoken of the <hi>High Priest and his Clergy:</hi> I deny not but express mention is made of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> as those who were supposed most acquainted with all matters of <hi>difference</hi> which should happen among them; and therefore were probably the greatest part of the great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> (for it is a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less fancy to suppose two distinct <hi>Courts,</hi> the one <hi>Civil,</hi> and the other <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi>) Nay the <hi>High Priest</hi> himself was so far from being the constant <hi>President</hi> of this <hi>Court,</hi> that, if we believe the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he was not admitted to sit there, without the same previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examination and tryal which others underwent. Indeed, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the <hi>Jewish Polity,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Assomanean Family,</hi> the chief Civil Power was in the hands of the <hi>High Priest,</hi> on which account he might then preside in the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> but that is nothing to this place, where mention is made <hi>vers.</hi> 9. of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> and then of the <hi>Judge,</hi> which is, in case <hi>God</hi> should raise up among them an <hi>extraordinary person,</hi> who should be <hi>Judge over Israel,</hi> then the <hi>appeals</hi> might be to him; but otherwise <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>they were to do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the Lord shall chuse, shall shew thee,</hi> which was the <hi>great Sanhedrin.</hi> According therefore to the sentence of this Court,

whether pronounced by a <hi>Priest,</hi> or other, they were to act; and they that refused were punished with death.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

And the man that will do presumptuously,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 17.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and will not hearken unto the Priest, or unto the Judge, even that man shall dye.</hi> Besides, we are so far from reading of any promise of <hi>Infallibility</hi> made to the <hi>High Priest</hi> and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> or to the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> himself doth suppose a possibility of errour in the whole <hi>Congregation of Israel,</hi> Levit. 4.15. And all along the Books of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> we see how much <hi>God</hi> chargeth the <hi>Priests</hi> with <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>forsaking his way.</hi> And, I pray, Where was that <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>High Priest</hi> and his <hi>Clergy,</hi> not only when our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> was condemned by him, and the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> both; but in that time, <hi>when Israel for a long season had been without the True God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and without a Teaching Priest, and without Law.</hi> So that we see what very little relief you have out of this place for the Infallibility of the <hi>High Priest and his Clergy.</hi> But, suppose we should grant them <hi>Infallible,</hi> and that <hi>Infallibility</hi> proved from this place, What is that to us? Might not you as well challenge the <hi>Oracular Responses</hi> by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> to belong to you, as the <hi>High Priests Infallibility,</hi> supposing he had any? If <hi>God</hi> thought it fit to make them <hi>Infallible,</hi> and gave such express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning obedience and submission to their judgement, Is it not very reasonable to think, that under the <hi>Gospel</hi> there should be express mention made of the subject of this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> the place whither we should resort for <hi>final judgements,</hi> as there is here? Nay, had it not been far more necessary to have specified and determined these circumstances, since they are of such vast <hi>importance</hi> for the peace of the <hi>Christian world?</hi> How <hi>easily</hi> had all our debates been ended, if <hi>God</hi> had said any where in the New Testament, <hi>When any Controversie of Faith ariseth, go to the place which I shall chuse,</hi> viz. <hi>Rome, and there enquire</hi> the Judgement of <hi>the Bishop that shall sit there, and whatever he determines, that believe as infallib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true</hi>; if we had met with any thing so express, nay, that had any seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tendency this way, How readily should we submit our <hi>Controversies</hi> to his determination? But, when there is so little ground or foundation for it there, that you are fain to deduce your Infallibility, from <hi>Gods settling a Court of Appeals</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi>; Can you think that we are presumptuous, <hi>and deserve to be cut off, if we do not believe?</hi> For, for all that I know, you may challenge the <hi>sanction of the Law,</hi> as well as the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of it</hi>; and your former practises would perswade us, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Sanction</hi> to be as valid as the other.</p>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101069:134"/>
originally written to particular persons, must be at first received as authentical upon their credit: but, on the other side, Apostolical Traditions</hi> (for which you instance in the <hi>Observation of the Lords day, Infant-baptism, use of Altars,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>in their prime Institution and practise being publickly practised and owned by the Apostles; it was incomparably harder, morally speaking, to doubt in the beginning of these Traditions, then whether St.</hi> Johns <hi>Epistle, or St.</hi> Lukes <hi>Gospel were really theirs or no.

For you cannot but know that this game of <hi>Tradition</hi> is quite spoiled, if we offer to come to particulars.

Could they be deceived themselves, or had they an intent to deceive their posterity? If some of them did fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie <hi>Tradition</hi> so soon, we see what little <hi>certainty</hi> there is in the deriving a <hi>Tradition</hi> from the <hi>Apostles:</hi> if neither falsified, then it should seem there was no universal <hi>practise</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> concerning it, but they looked on it as a matter of <hi>indifferency,</hi> and some might practise one way, and some another. If so, then we are yet further to seek for an <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> binding succeeding <hi>Ages.</hi> For can you possibly think the <hi>Apostles</hi> did intend to bind unalterably succeeding Ages in such things which they used a <hi>Liberty</hi> in themselves? If then it be granted, that in matters of an <hi>indifferent nature</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> might practise severally as they saw occasion, How then can we be <hi>certain</hi> of the <hi>Apostles universal practise</hi> in matters of an <hi>indifferent nature?</hi> If we cannot so, we can have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of an <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but in some things which they judged necessary. But whence shall we have this unquestionable evidence, <hi>first</hi> that they did such <hi>things,</hi> and <hi>secondly,</hi> that they did them with an apprehension of the <hi>necessity</hi> of them, and with an intention to oblige posterity by their actions? By what rule or measure must we judge of this necessity? By their <hi>Vniversal practise?</hi> but that brings us into a plain <hi>Circle</hi>; for we must judge of the <hi>necessity</hi> of it by their <hi>Vniversal practise,</hi> and we must prove that <hi>Vniversal practise</hi> by the <hi>necessity</hi> of the thing. For, if the thing were not judged necessary, the <hi>Apostles</hi> might differ in their <hi>practise</hi> from one another.

such a determination, though unwritten. But, 1. The <hi>Vniversal Practice</hi> we have seen already, was far from being evident, when not only the <hi>African,</hi> but the <hi>Eastern Church</hi> did practise otherwise, and that on the account of an <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> too. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing such an <hi>Vniversal Practice,</hi> How doth it thence follow, that it must be derived from the <hi>Apostles</hi>; unless it be first proved, that the <hi>Church</hi> could never consent in the <hi>use</hi> of any thing, but what the <hi>Apostles</hi> commanded them? Which is a very unreasonable supposition, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different emergencies which might be in the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and succeeding times, and the different <hi>reasons</hi> of <hi>practice</hi> attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, with that great desire which crept into the <hi>Church</hi> of represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the things conveyed by the Gospel in an <hi>external symbolical manner,</hi> whence, in the second <hi>Century,</hi> came the use of many <hi>baptismal Ceremonies,</hi> the <hi>praegustatio mellis &amp; lactis,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it, and several of a like nature, which, by degrees, came into the <hi>Church</hi>: Must we now derive these, and many other customs of the <hi>Church</hi> necessarily from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when, even in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time, several <hi>customs</hi> were supposed to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> which yet are otherwise believed now. As in that known Instance of <hi>Infants Participation</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> which is otherwise determined by the <hi>Council of Trent</hi>; and, for all that I know, the arguments used against this Tradition by some men, may as well hold against <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi>; for there is an equal incapacity as to the <hi>exercise</hi> of all <hi>acts of reason</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> in both: and, as the <hi>Scripture</hi> seems to suppose such <hi>acts of grace</hi> in one as have their foundation in the use of <hi>reason,</hi> it doth likewise in the other, and I cannot see sufficient evidence to the contrary; but if that place, <hi>Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 3.5.</note> taken in the sense of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> doth imply a necessity of <hi>Baptism</hi> for all, and consequently of <hi>Children</hi>; that other place, <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you,</hi>

                  <hi>Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you,</hi> taken like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the sense of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> will import the necessity of a <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> by <hi>Infants</hi> as well as others. I speak not this with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to plead either for <hi>this,</hi> or for the <hi>rebaptizing Hereticks,</hi> but to shew the great <hi>uncertainty</hi> of knowing <hi>Apostolical Traditions</hi>; some things having been taken for such, which we believe were not so, and others which could not be known whether so or no, by the <hi>ages</hi> next succeeding the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And therefore let any reasonable person judge what <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> there is in what you drive at, that <hi>Apostolical Traditions</hi> may be more easily known than <hi>Apostolical Writings.</hi>

               <p>By which it appears, (3.) How vain and insufficient your reasons are,<note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Why Traditions should not be so liable to corruption as the Scriptures.</hi> 1. You say, <hi>Vniversal Traditions are recorded in Authours of every succeeding age; and it seems more incident to have the Bible corrupted than them, because of its bulk and passing through the hands of particular men; whereas universal and immemorial Traditions, are openly practised and taken notice of by every one in all ages.</hi> To which I answer, 1. That you give <hi>no</hi> sufficient <hi>reason</hi> why the <hi>Bible</hi> should be corrupted. 2. And as little why <hi>Traditions</hi> should be more preserved than that. Two Accounts you give why the Bible might be corrupted by errours, <hi>because of its bulk, and passing through the hands of particular men.</hi> But, Do you think it a thing impossible, or at least un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, to suppose that a Book of no greater <hi>bulk</hi> than the <hi>Bible,</hi> should, by the care and vigilancy of men, through the assistance of <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:101069:137"/>
be preserved from any material <hi>corruptions</hi> or <hi>alterations?</hi> Surely, if you think so, you have mean thoughts of the <hi>Christians</hi> in all ages, and meaner of <hi>Divine Providence:</hi> For, you must suppose <hi>God</hi> to take no care at all for the preservation of a Monument of unspeakable concernment to the good of mankind; and you must conceive the <hi>Christians,</hi> in all <hi>ages,</hi> to be stupendiously <hi>careless</hi> and <hi>negligent,</hi> either in transcribing, or reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which could suffer errours to slip into them, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of them. Do you think that the <hi>Christians</hi> had no higher esteem of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> than of the <hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>Altars,</hi> or any other of your immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>Traditions</hi>; but, say you, <hi>The one were publick, and the other passed through the hands of particular men.</hi> It should seem then, their <hi>Altars</hi> were upon <hi>high places,</hi> but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were only read in <hi>corners,</hi> never any such thing being publickly read as the <hi>Bible,</hi> so that any alteration might be there, and no notice at all taken of it. The poor <hi>African Bishop</hi> found the contrary to his sorrow, who was in such danger from the people, for alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one word according to S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> Translation, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> reports the story. But, suppose <hi>it passed through the hands of particular men,</hi> Was it therefore more liable to be corrupted? I should think just the contrary; unless you could suppose all <hi>those particular men</hi> to agree in <hi>corrupting</hi> it, which, considering the difference of <hi>opinions, capacities,</hi> and <hi>interests,</hi> is a most unreasonable supposition; that some <hi>verbal</hi> and <hi>literal mistakes</hi> might slip in, you might rationally imagine, but that therefore any great <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> should creep into it, argues your mean thoughts both of <hi>Gods Providence,</hi> and the care of the <hi>Christian world.</hi> Well, <hi>but still it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to corrupt your Traditions.</hi> It were a much harder matter to free your <hi>Traditions</hi> from being <hi>corruptions</hi> themselves of the <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> And why so hard for them to be corrupted? <hi>Because recorded in Authours of every succeeding age.</hi> I had thought, all Books of <hi>equal,</hi> or much bigger bulk than the <hi>Scripture,</hi> had been as liable to <hi>corruption</hi> as <hi>that</hi>; but it seems not. If a <hi>Book</hi> be written of <hi>Traditions,</hi> the very <hi>Traditions</hi> will preserve it <hi>pure,</hi> though as big as that <hi>Livy, Quem mea vix totum bibliotheca capit:</hi> But that is not all, it seems, these <hi>Traditions are recorded in Authours of every succeeding age:</hi> Unhappy men we, that cannot find them there! I wish, instead of writing <hi>Controversies,</hi> you would write the <hi>history</hi> of these <hi>Traditions</hi>; but, be sure to deduce them through the <hi>Authours</hi> of every <hi>succeeding age</hi>; and, I suppose, you mean, ever since the <hi>Apostles.</hi> I shall then indeed believe <hi>Popish Traditions</hi> to be no <hi>Novelties,</hi> but not before. But, let us grant this: Were not the <hi>Scriptures</hi> attested by the same Authours? No, <hi>It seems, they were agreed about all Traditions, but not so about the Scripture.</hi> And the reason is, <hi>Because the Scriptures were first delivered to private men, as S.</hi> John<hi>'s Epistle, and S.</hi> Luke<hi>'s Gospel; but Traditions had an universal practice.</hi> But, Can you suppose it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but that particular Books must be first delivered to private men? Would you have them delivered only to <hi>General Councils,</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Cardinals?</hi> It seems, S. <hi>John</hi> was to blame for not directing his Epistle to the <hi>Pope,</hi> instead of <hi>Gaius</hi>; and S. <hi>Luke</hi> his Gospel to a <hi>General Council,</hi> instead of <hi>Theophilus</hi>; for then we might have had <hi>Infallible Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of them; but now it is a plain <hi>case,</hi> we can have no more than <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> that ever they were theirs. But, for this trick, it seems, they fared the worse; <hi>for some Books were doubted of, for many years, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches.</hi> It is well yet, they were not discarded by your <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> because the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not put their <hi>Books</hi> into your <hi>hands</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101069:137"/>
them. But what if some <hi>Books,</hi> by some <hi>men,</hi> were for some time doubted of, which yet were afterwards universally received upon sufficient evidence? <hi>Why then</hi> (say you) <hi>Tradition hath much advantage of Scripture?</hi> How so? Was no Tradition, which would be accounted <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,</hi> doubted of by any men at any time? <hi>No</hi> (say you) <hi>it is impossible it should, for universal Traditions were universally practised at all times.</hi> Now you speak home; and nothing wants to the proof of it, but only to let us know, What these <hi>Vniversal Traditions</hi> are, which were so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally practised in all ages, containing things different from <hi>Scripture,</hi> which are recorded in the <hi>Authours</hi> of every succeeding Age. Your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer is so fair, that my request shall be very short; <hi>name them,</hi> and <hi>prove them,</hi> and I will believe you, but not before. So much for this, which, though a <hi>digression</hi> in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> yet is not from the <hi>design</hi> of this <hi>discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Setting aside therefore your discourse <hi>about</hi> A.C<hi>'s. Pen being troubled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> in which is nothing worth our notice; I come to the main dispute of this Chapter, which is, <hi>Whether the Promises of Infallibility made to the Apostles, are to be restrained to their own times, or to be extended to the present Church in all ages?</hi> We assert the former, and you the latter. For which you produce this argument, <hi>That from these very places, Christians do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, that the Church shall never fall away and perish.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 99. n. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>For if the assistance be not to preserve the succeeding Church, at least from some kind of errours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly; it may, notwithstanding all the assistance he allows it here, fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all kind of errours one after another, and so by degrees, the whole Church might fall into a general Apostacy, and thereby perish. There must therefore be some kind of infallible assistance in the Apostles successors, by virtue of these Promises.</hi> But, 1. Is it all one to say, There shall alwaies be a <hi>Church,</hi> and to say, That <hi>Church</hi> shall alwaies be <hi>infallible?</hi> Those, who from the places in question, do prove, that the <hi>Church</hi> shall never quite <hi>fall away,</hi> do not dream of a <hi>present Infallibility</hi> in your sense, but that there alwaies shall be a number of men professing <hi>Christianity</hi> in the world: And, Cannot you possibly conceive, that there should be such a number of men professing <hi>Christianity</hi> without <hi>Infallibility?</hi> To help therefore your understanding a little; suppose that all the members of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> should in one <hi>age</hi> be destroyed (and, according to your former Principle, that <hi>if a Church may erre, we cannot be certain but that it doth erre</hi>; because this may be, we cannot be certain but that it is) but we only make the supposition: Do not you think that there would be still a number remaining, who profess <hi>Christianity,</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Protestant Churches?</hi> yet, I hope, you will not say, that these were <hi>infallible.</hi> There may be then a number of <hi>Christians,</hi> who are not <hi>infallible</hi>; and that is all which is meant by saying, <hi>That the present Church is infallible in Fundamentals,</hi> viz. that there shall alwaies be a <hi>Church,</hi> for that which makes them a <hi>Church,</hi> is the belief of <hi>Fundamentals</hi>; and if they believe not them, they cease to be so. That therefore which being supposed, a <hi>Church</hi> is, and being destroyed, it ceaseth to be, is the formal <hi>constitution</hi> of it; but thus it is as to the <hi>Church,</hi> the belief of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> makes it a <hi>Church,</hi> and the not belief of them makes them cease to be a <hi>Christian Church</hi>; I speak of an <hi>Essential,</hi> and not of an <hi>Organical Church</hi>; and, I know not who those persons are, who, out of those places, do inferr the perpetuity of an <hi>Organical Church</hi>; nor, if they did, doth it thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they must suppose an <hi>Infallible Assistance,</hi> beyond an <hi>Essential</hi> to make
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101069:138"/>
it an <hi>Organical Church.</hi> For I cannot imagine what necessity can be supposed of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> in order to that which may be sufficiently constituted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. 2. I answer, the perpetuity of the <hi>Church</hi> doth rather argue the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Promise</hi> then of the <hi>Church.</hi> Which if you did consider, you would not certainly inferr <hi>Infallibility</hi> from a <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>Perpetuity.</hi> For all the <hi>Infallibility</hi> supposable in this case is an <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment</hi> of the <hi>Promise</hi> made. As in a clear and parallel Instance of that <hi>Promise,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> 
                  <hi>The Scepter shall not depart from</hi> Judah, <hi>nor a Lawgiver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his feet, untill</hi> Shiloh <hi>come.</hi> Taking it in the most received Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation among <hi>Christians,</hi> that the <hi>Jewish Polity</hi> should remain till the dayes of the <hi>Messias</hi>; doth this inferr, that there should be a continual <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Jewish Polity,</hi> because there was a <hi>Promise</hi> made of its <hi>perpetuity?</hi> When <hi>God</hi> saith, <hi>In</hi> Jerusalem <hi>have I set my name for ever,</hi> doth it follow that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> should be alwayes <hi>Infallible?</hi> But how would you triumph beyond all reason, if you had but any thing like such a promise for <hi>Rome,</hi> as that is for <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> Supposing then that the <hi>Promises</hi> by you insisted on, should be so far extended, as to imply a <hi>perpetuity</hi> of a <hi>Christian Church</hi> what doth that argue, but only this, that to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that <hi>Promise</hi> is Infallibly true, there shall alwaies be a succession of <hi>Christians</hi> in the world. 3. Suppose I should grant that the <hi>being</hi> of a <hi>Christian Church</hi> doth suppose the <hi>assistance</hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> is there no <hi>assistance,</hi> but what is <hi>Infallible?</hi> If not, no one can be a <hi>Christian</hi> without <hi>Infallibility</hi>; For we speak of no other <hi>assistance,</hi> but what is necessary to make men <hi>Christians</hi>; for, what makes them such severally, take them conjunctly makes them a <hi>Church.</hi> But if you, besides what <hi>assistance</hi> is requisite to make them <hi>Christians,</hi> do suppose somewhat more to make them a <hi>Church,</hi> I pray name <hi>what it is</hi>; and whatever it be, it will not be owned by <hi>such</hi> who inferr a perpetuity of a <hi>Church</hi> out of these places. But if in order to that no more be meant, (as no more can be meant) then what is necessary to make men <hi>Christians</hi> then <hi>Infallibility</hi> will grow so cheap and common, it will not be worth challenging by you for your <hi>Church.</hi> 4. Suppose I grant this assistance to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> doth all <hi>Infallible assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> make an <hi>Infallible Testimony?</hi> I am sure not in their sense, who say the <hi>Church is infallible in Fundamentals,</hi> for they never offer to assert that the present <hi>Church is Infallible</hi> in defining what are <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and what not. And this is the only <hi>Infallibility</hi> in question, <hi>viz.</hi> Such a one as makes the Testimony of those who have it <hi>Infallible.</hi> For such a kind of <hi>assistance</hi> was that of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> which is only the thing enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If you can therefore prove such an <hi>Infallibility</hi> in your <hi>Churches</hi> Testimony, as the <hi>Apostles</hi> had, you do something; but what is short of this, is nothing at all to the purpose. 5. Suppose I should grant the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> yet all these concessions were nothing for your advantage, unless you could as evidently prove that your <hi>Church</hi> is the only <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Which that you can never do, will appear when we come to that question. 6. Suppose I should yield the <hi>Catholick Churches Testimony</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> and your <hi>Church</hi> to be the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; yet all this is far from proving <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> or both to be <hi>Infallible.</hi> For, By what means come they to claim the <hi>Infallibility</hi> as belonging to them which is given to the <hi>Church?</hi> by what deeds are the <hi>conveyances</hi> settled of the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to them? Where is it ever said in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or in the least intimated, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> made to the <hi>Church</hi> are to be understood of the <hi>representative
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:101069:138"/>
Church?</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> had this Promise in their personal <hi>capacities</hi> made to them, and not in a <hi>representative</hi>; how comes then the Promise to be understood of a <hi>representation</hi> afterwards? Thus you see, that you are at least <hi>six removes</hi> from any <hi>title</hi> to claim this <hi>Infallibility</hi> from these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> by: and therefore you have little hopes that your <hi>claim</hi> should be admitted upon so slender a <hi>title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this therefore at present you fly off, to the vindicating <hi>A.

For are they not as express as may be, viz. <hi>That there is the Promise of Christ, and his Holy Spirits continual presence,</hi> Luk. 10.16. Matth. 28.19, 20. Joh. 14.16. <hi>not only to the Apostles, but to their Successours also, the lawfully sent Pastours and Doctors of the Church in all Ages.</hi> To which his Lordship saith, <hi>Here's a deal of Infallibility indeed, and yet errour store.</hi> You presently cry out,<note place="margin">Pag. 94.

To the first therefore <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you heareth me,</hi> &amp;c.

For where the command is for Preaching,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 28.20.</note> 
                  <hi>the Restraint is added. Go, saith Christ, and teach all Nations: but you may not Preach all things that you please, but all things which I have commanded you.

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 101.</note> To this you reply, <hi>That this is rather to pervert our Saviours words, than to Interpret them, is manifest.</hi> And the reason you give, is, <hi>Because a Sectary, who denies the Apostles Infallibility as well as the Churches, might apply this restraint to the Apostles themselves, as well as he now applies it to their Successors.</hi> But they are strange kind of <hi>Sectaries</hi> indeed who deny the <hi>Apostles Infallibility,</hi> and my memory doth not serve me with any such who asserted <hi>Christs Infallibility</hi> and denyed the <hi>Apostles</hi>; but if there be any such <hi>Sectaries,</hi> let us know them, that we may then say, There are some in the world who believe great <hi>absurdities</hi> as well as you. However let us for the present, take this for a <hi>supposition,</hi> that any men might do so; whether then they might not say, the <hi>Apostles</hi> were only <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> when they spake <hi>Christs words</hi> and not their own, <hi>i. e.</hi> delivered his
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101069:139"/>
Doctrine and not any other. No doubt they might, and said very well in it too. And if these be the <hi>Sectaries</hi> you mean, I am one of them my self; For I believe, the <hi>Apostles</hi> were no further <hi>Infallible</hi> then as they delivered <hi>Christs Doctrine</hi> to the world, and I suppose there are many such <hi>Sectaries</hi> besides my self. But all the difference then between the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> and their <hi>Successors</hi> was this, that those who heard the <hi>Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> had ground to believe them <hi>Infallible</hi> in what they delivered for <hi>Christs Doctrine</hi>; but we have no ground to believe so of any <hi>Church</hi> since the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, that it is <hi>Infallible</hi> in delivering the <hi>Doctrine of Christ</hi> to others. The promise then of <hi>Infallible assistance</hi> as made to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> doth imply that <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> would be so with them, that they should deliver nothing for the revealed will of <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but what was really and truly so. And if you can from this or any other place prove such an <hi>Infallible assistance</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of all <hi>ages,</hi> you do something, but not otherwise. But for this particular place, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me</hi>; I have something more yet to say, which may manifest how wholly impertinent it is to your purpose. 1. It seems to me very questionable, whether any such thing as <hi>Infallibility</hi> be at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this place: and then certainly from hence you cannot inferr a successive <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> And the reasons why I question it, are, 1. The <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves had not that continual <hi>Infallible assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> till after <hi>Christs Ascension,</hi> when the promise of <hi>Christs</hi> sending his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon them was remarkably accomplished, Will you say then they had <hi>Infallible assistance</hi> by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> before the promise of that <hi>Infallible assistance</hi> was made to them? If then the <hi>Apostles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had not such a continual <hi>Infallible assistance,</hi> much less the <hi>LXX.</hi> Disciples who are here spoken of. 2. The <hi>message</hi> they were sent upon did not at all require any <hi>Infallible assistance,</hi> for it was only a <hi>preparative message,</hi> they not being sent to deliver fully the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> but to tell them, <hi>The Kingdom of God is at hand, or nigh unto you,</hi> ver. 9, 11. <hi>i. e.</hi> that blessed state of things under the <hi>Messias</hi> is now ready to be revealed to you: the whole design therefore of that commission of the <hi>LXX.</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when they were first sent abroad, was of the same nature with <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s, <hi>viz.</hi> to prepare people for the reception and entertainment of that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> should deliver to them. Now what <hi>Infallible assistance</hi> can be supposed necessary in order to this? 3. The words imply nothing of <hi>Infallible assistance</hi> in them. For when <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me, and he that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me:</hi> the plain meaning is no more than this, They which hearken to your message, and believe the <hi>truth</hi> of what you say, do therein manifest their <hi>readiness</hi> to hearken to me, and consequently will receive my <hi>Doctrine,</hi> when it is delivered to them; but they who despise this message of yours, the <hi>affront</hi> they offer you, reflects most on me who <hi>sent</hi> you; and they shall find to their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that in <hi>rejecting me</hi> they reject <hi>God</hi> too, who will punish them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely for it: which, that it is the meaning of the words, will very easily appear to any one that considers the scope and design of the place. Now is it not possible for any to declare their respect to <hi>Christ</hi> by receiving his <hi>Messengers,</hi> without believing those <hi>Messengers</hi> to be <hi>Infallibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

                     <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </hi> If that be possible, then what kind of <hi>Infallibility</hi> can you hence inferr? 2. Suppose I should grant these <hi>LXX Infallible</hi> in what they delivered, yet nothing can be hence drawn for the <hi>Churches continual Infallibility,</hi> because of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101069:140"/>
different reason of one from the other, and that will appear in these things. 1. These were immediately sent abroad by <hi>Christ</hi> himself, when there were no <hi>Infallible writings</hi> containing this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> made by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or his <hi>Apostles.</hi> And was there not then much more reason for such an <hi>Infallibility</hi> then there can be now? 2. These had sufficient <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> to attest that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> by that power of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which they had in curing diseases and casting out of <hi>Devils,</hi> ver. 9.‚Äî17. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those they were sent to had sufficient inducement to believe such an <hi>Infallibility,</hi> if they had pretended to it; when therefore you can prove the like of your <hi>lawfully sent Doctors and Pastors,</hi> either a-part or in a <hi>General Council,</hi> you may then from hence argue some thing toward that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but not before.</p>
               <p>In your following words you acknowledge a difference in applying this text to the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>their Successors, For it was true in every one of the Apostles apart, but it is not so in every one of the succeeding Pastors</hi>; and for this you give these Reasons, 1. <hi>Your adversaries and you are agreed in it,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Pastors apart are fallible.</hi> 2. <hi>'Tis manifest by experience, that many eminent Pastors have not only been erronious, but heretical.</hi> 3. <hi>There is universal Tradition for it.</hi> 4. <hi>Plain Scripture for it, that even from themselves there should arise some that should speak perverse things.</hi> These reasons I acknowledge to be so true, that, if you had expressed the <hi>Pope</hi> himself in them, you could not have proved his fallibility better, then by <hi>Experience, Consent,</hi> and <hi>Scripture.</hi> But yet you have two Reserves in a Corner, which marr all the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> that from these places you make <hi>General Councils infallible,</hi> and, according to your most received perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Pope</hi> too. Do you so indeed? and from these places ? and both of them Infallible, whether they agree or not? But if our reasons be not stronger against any such <hi>Infallibility</hi> deducible from these places, than yours are for it (for I have not seen any) I am content to blind my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so much, if I can, as to believe what you say, <hi>That to give reasons against your exposition is impossible.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 102.</note> But as your reason in all other things is weak, so in this it appears, that either your <hi>ignorance</hi> or your <hi>confidence</hi> is intolerable.</p>

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note>The next place, is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. <hi>I am with you alwaies, even unto the end of the world.</hi> To which his Lordship saith, <hi>Yes most certain it is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by his spirit;</hi>

                  <hi>for else in bodily presence, he continued not with his Apostles but during his abode on earth. And this promise of his spiritual presence was to their Successors; else why to the end of the world? The Apostles did not, could not live so long; But then to the Successors, the Promise goes no further, than, I am with you alwaies, which reaches to continual assistance, but not to Divine and Infallible.</hi> What say you now to this? Why forsooth, <hi>It is the same answer as before, and therefore deserves no further refutation.</hi> But doth it not deserve some further proof of your Infallibility from this place? Or are you content to let it go, because you cannot but see, that a <hi>spiritual presence</hi> and not <hi>infallible</hi> is hereby promised, either to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> or their <hi>Successors,</hi> although from other places it appears, that the <hi>spiritual presence</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> with his <hi>Apostles</hi> did extend to so high a degree, as to make them <hi>infallible</hi> in what they delivered for the <hi>Doctrine of Christ,</hi> but no place of <hi>Scripture</hi> doth assert so much of the <hi>Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> It is well then that you grant, that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> did not believe any <hi>infallible assistance</hi> in the <hi>Pastors of the Church</hi>; but (you say) <hi>he understood it of them apart,</hi> to make which probable, you must produce some other
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:101069:140"/>
places, where he saith otherwise of them in <hi>Council.</hi> But how a gracious <hi>presence of Christ</hi> with his <hi>Church,</hi> which you grant <hi>Rhabanus Maurus</hi> meant by this place, should suppose a <hi>conjunctive infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pastors</hi> as a necessary foundation and support of the <hi>Church diffusive,</hi> I confess is beyond my understanding; but at least you say, <hi>it denies it not:</hi> neither doth it deny that you or I are infallible; but doth it therefore follow that we are so? What places you produce (or rather bid us go seek for out of the Fathers) <hi>to prove that they, in effect,</hi> (it seems then, not evidently) <hi>do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute infallibility to the Church</hi> (but by no means <hi>Divine infallibility,</hi> for this is more than the third time that you have forbid the <hi>Banes</hi> between those two words <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi>) will to any that reads them appear to be capable of proving no more than the <hi>Perpetuity of a Church</hi> in the world; but if any of them can do any better service, I doubt not, but we shall again meet with them, and therefore shall adjourn their considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a more convenient place. <hi>To prove that any of the Fathers have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed this place to extend to infallibility,</hi> is a very unreasonable thing which you put <hi>the Bishop and his party upon,</hi> because they only deliver what they conceive the meaning of places to be, without reflections on any <hi>Heresies,</hi> but such as were most prevalent in their own times. And if your Church had in their time challenged <hi>Infallibility</hi> from such places, you might have heard of their <hi>Negative,</hi> which at present you put us unreasonably to prove.</p>
               <p>Your answer to <hi>John</hi> 14.16. only is,<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that it must be understood in some absolute sense</hi>; and doth not his Lordship say so too, <hi>viz. in regard of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation and Grace.</hi> But if you say, there can be no other <hi>absolute</hi> sense, but an <hi>infallible assistance,</hi> you would do well to prove it and not barely to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it: and so likewise, what follows as to <hi>John</hi> 16.13. (which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship justly restrains to the <hi>Apostles</hi> alone) you tell us, <hi>That you contend, that in whatsoever sense all truth is to be understood in respect of each Apostle apart, it is also to be understood in relation to their Successors, assembled in a full Representative of the whole Church. That you contend,</hi> we grant; but we say, it is without sense or reason. And therefore come to examine what you produce for it. Your first reason,<note place="margin">P. 103. n. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Because the Representative of the Church in General Council, and the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>as Pastor of the whole Church, have equal power to oblige the Church to believe what they deliver, as each Apostle had,</hi> is utterly denied, and must be more then barely supposed as it is here. Your second, which you call <hi>the Fundamental reason</hi> of this <hi>Exposition</hi> is, in short,<note place="margin">N. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That the preservation of the Church requires infallibility in future ages of the Church, as well as in the Apostles times,</hi> which is again utterly denied; And the next time you write, I pray prove your reasons well; and think not your confident producing things you know are denied by us, will serve for reasons against us. Before you can sufficiently prove that any rite of the <hi>Church,</hi> not mentioned in <hi>Scripture,</hi> had the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> for its Authour, especially when contrary to a custome expressed in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> you must do more then produce a single testimony of St. <hi>Augustine</hi> for it; who was apt to suppose the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> might be pleased with such things, which the <hi>Church,</hi> though not therein infallible, might consent in the practise of. Which certainly is far from supposing the <hi>Church</hi> to have infallible assistance with it, in delivering Doctrines of Faith; because some things might be used in the <hi>Church</hi> which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> might be supposed not displeased with, which is the utmost can be made of your citation out of St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:101069:141"/>It seems you were aware of that disparity between the <hi>Apostles</hi> times and ours, as to the pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> because the <hi>Apostles</hi> were first to deliver this Doctrine to the world, and after to consign it by writing to future ages; from whence it were easie to inferr, there could not be that necessity of a <hi>Continual Infallible Assistance</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> because the Doctrine infallibly delivered by them is preserved in the <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Infallible Records of it.</hi> But to this your answer is considerable. <hi>What wise man</hi> (say you) <hi>would go about to raise a stately building for many ages,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 104. n. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and satisfie himself with laying a Foundation to last but for a few years? Our Saviour the wisest of Architects, is not to be thought to have founded this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable building of the Church upon sand; which must infallibly have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, had he not intended to afford his continual assistance also to the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pastors of the Church, to lead them, when assembled in a General Council, into all those truths wherein he first setled the Apostles.</hi> Whether you call this arguing for the <hi>Churches infallibility,</hi> or libelling against our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> if he hath not done what you would have him, is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. I am sure, it is arguing <hi>ab absurdo</hi> with a witness; for if he hath not done, just as you fancy he should have done; he must venture to be accounted an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> and <hi>Impostor</hi> before, and here <hi>to do that which no wise man would have done,</hi> viz. <hi>build a stately Fabrick, the Church, upon the Sands.</hi> So it seems you account <hi>the Prophets and the Apostles:</hi> for if the <hi>Apostle</hi> may be credited,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>we are built on the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief Corner-stone.</hi> And this is it you must mean <hi>by being built on the sand</hi>; for herein it is plain, the <hi>Church</hi> is built on these, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Infallible doctrine</hi> which was delivered <hi>by them,</hi> but here is not one word or the least intimation of an <hi>inherent infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> which was to be its foundation so as to secure it from all errour. <hi>And this</hi> (you say) <hi>must infallibly happen, if there be not the same infallibility in General Councils which was in the Apostles</hi>; for that I suppose must be the meaning of your last words, if they be to the purpose. But how groundless your pretence of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils</hi> is, will appear when we come to that subject; but have you so little of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense and reason with you, as to suppose the <hi>Church</hi> presently not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine of Christianity</hi> in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> to be built on Sand, if <hi>General Councils be not infallible?</hi> Is there not sufficient ground to rely on the Doctrine of <hi>Christianity,</hi> supposing there never had been any <hi>General Council</hi> in the world? What was the <hi>Church</hi> built on before the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> only on <hi>Sand?</hi> surely the <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Billows</hi> of persecutions would then have easily overturned it. What if through civil combustions in the <hi>Empire</hi> there could never have been any <hi>Assembly's</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> afterwards, must the <hi>Church</hi> needs have fallen to the ground for want of <hi>General Councils?</hi> But why, I pray, must the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> be compared only <hi>to a foundation that can last but for few years?</hi> Do you suppose that these <hi>Apostles</hi> never did commit their <hi>Doctrine infallibly</hi> to <hi>writing</hi>; or that these <hi>writings</hi> of theirs did last but for <hi>a few years?</hi> without one of these, it is hard to find out your meaning by those expressions. If you deny either of them, I shall readily prove them: but if you affirm both these, (as if you are heartily a <hi>Christian</hi> you must do) with what face can you say that <hi>Christ,</hi> in making the <hi>Apostles</hi> infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, did lay a <hi>Foundation</hi> but for a few years. But thanks be to <hi>God,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perverse and unreasonable men are alwaies quarrelling with the methods of <hi>Divine wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> this <hi>Foundation of the Lord stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

sure still</hi>; and, as long as the <hi>Infallible Doctrine of the Gospel</hi> continues, the <hi>Church</hi> will be built on a stedfast and unmoveable <hi>Rock,</hi> which will prove a much surer <hi>Foundation</hi> than the <hi>seven Hills</hi> of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> But this is your grand and fundamental mistake, to suppose a <hi>Church</hi> cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without a <hi>vital inherent Principle</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> in her self, which must be discovered by <hi>Infallible</hi> Directions from the <hi>Head</hi> of it: whereas we grant the necessity of an <hi>Infallible Foundation</hi> of Faith, but cannot discern either from <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> or <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that there must be a living and standing <hi>Infallible Judge,</hi> which must deliver and interpret those Infallible Records to us. We grant then Infallibility in the <hi>Foundation</hi> of Faith, we assert the highest <hi>Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of that <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> we declare that the owning of that <hi>Infallible Foundation</hi> is that which makes men <hi>Christians</hi> (the body of whom we call a <hi>Church</hi>) we further grant, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath left in his <hi>Church</hi> sufficient <hi>means</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of it in Truth and Unity; but we deny that ever he promised such an <hi>Infallibility</hi> to be constantly resident in that <hi>Church,</hi> as was in the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi>; and that neither any intention of Christ, or any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the thing can be manifested, why such an <hi>Infallibility</hi> should be so necessary for the <hi>Churches preservation,</hi> that without it the <hi>Wisdom of Christ</hi> must be questioned, and the <hi>Church</hi> built on a sandy Foundation. Your citation of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> proves nothing but the <hi>Churches</hi> constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in adhering to that Doctrine of Faith, which was delivered from the beginning; but how that should prove a <hi>Constant Infallibility,</hi> I cannot understand, unless it is impossible that there should be any <hi>Truth,</hi> where there is no inherent <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Thus we see, what very little suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess you have in the attempt of proving the <hi>Churches</hi> continual <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> from <hi>Scripture.</hi>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:101069:142"/>
what his <hi>Lordship</hi> saith, That though there be a <hi>mutual Testimony,</hi> yet it <hi>is not equal</hi>; for, although the <hi>Letters of Credence</hi> might be the sooner read and admitted of, on the <hi>Embassadours Reputation</hi> and Sincerity, yet still those <hi>Letters</hi> themselves, upon the delivery of them, may further, and in a higher degree, confirm the <hi>Prince</hi> he is sent to, of his <hi>authority</hi> to act as <hi>Embassadour.</hi> Supposing then, that there be a sufficient <hi>Testimony,</hi> that these <hi>Letters</hi> were sealed by the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> who did manifest his <hi>Sincerity</hi> in the highest manner in the <hi>sealing</hi> of them; though a <hi>Forein Prince</hi> might not know the <hi>hand and Seal,</hi> yet upon such a creditable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, he may be assured that they were <hi>sealed</hi> by the <hi>Prince</hi> himself. But then withall, if the <hi>Embassadour,</hi> to assure the <hi>Prince,</hi> offers his own <hi>life</hi> to attest the truth of his <hi>Credentials,</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> by reading the <hi>Letters,</hi> find something in them which could not be written by any other than that <hi>Prince,</hi> he then hath the highest certainty he can desire. This is the case between <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Scripture; General Tradition</hi> at first makes way for the first admission of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the general repute of an <hi>Embassadours</hi> coming doth for his <hi>access</hi> to the <hi>Prince</hi>; the particular <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is like the <hi>Embassadours</hi> affirming to the <hi>Prince,</hi> that he hath Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Credence</hi> with him; but then, when he enquires into the <hi>Certainty</hi> of those <hi>Letters,</hi> those <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Credibility</hi> (not which relate to the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Embassadour</hi>) but which evidently prove the <hi>sealing</hi> of those <hi>Letters</hi> (as the constant <hi>Testimony</hi> of such who were present at it, the <hi>Secretaries</hi> and <hi>Embassadours</hi> venturing their lives upon it) must confirm him in that; and lastly, his own reading the <hi>Credentials,</hi> give him the highest <hi>Confirmation, i. e.</hi> The testimony of those who saw the miracles of <hi>Christ and his Apostles,</hi> and confirmed the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Testimony,</hi> by their dying for it, are the highest inducement to our believing that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were sealed by <hi>God</hi> himself in the miracles wrought, and written by his own hand, his <hi>Spirit</hi> infallibly assisting the <hi>Apostle</hi>; but still, after all this, when in these very <hi>Scriptures</hi> we read such things as we cannot reasonably suppose could come from any but <hi>God</hi> himself; this doth in the highest degree settle and confirm our <hi>Faith.</hi> Therefore, as to the main scope for which this Similitude was used by his <hi>Lordship,</hi> it holds still; but your mistake lyes, in supposing that the <hi>Embassadours</hi> reception depended whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his own single <hi>Testimony,</hi> and that was enough to make any <hi>Prince</hi> infallibly certain that his Letters of <hi>Credence</hi> are true, which cannot be, unless he knows before-hand that <hi>Embassadour</hi> to be <hi>infallibly true,</hi> which is impossible to be supposed at his first reception. Yet this is plainly your case, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are to be infallibly believed on the single Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>present Church,</hi> which is, to make the <hi>Embassadour</hi> himself give <hi>authority</hi> to his <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Credence,</hi> and set <hi>hand and seal</hi> to them. Whereas the contrary is most evident to be true. But then, supposing these <hi>Credentials</hi> admitted, the <hi>Prince</hi> transacts with the <hi>Embassadour,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>power</hi> which is conveyed to him therein. And thus it is in the present case: Not as though a <hi>Prince</hi> treated every <hi>Envoy</hi> with equal respect to an <hi>Embassadour,</hi> no more ought any <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> be received, but according to that power and authority which their <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials, viz.</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do convey to them. We own therefore the <hi>Apostles</hi> as <hi>Gods</hi> immediate <hi>Embassadours,</hi> whose <hi>miracles</hi> did attest their commission from Heaven to all they came to; and no persons could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ignorance, that this is <hi>Gods hand and Seal</hi>; but all other <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> we look on only as <hi>Agents</hi> settled to hold <hi>correspondency</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                  <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Vs,</hi> but no extraordinary <hi>Embassadours,</hi> who must be looked on as immediately transacting by the <hi>Infallible Commission</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> When therefore the <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> shall bring new <hi>Credentials</hi> from Heaven, attested with the same <hi>Broad-seal</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> which the <hi>Apostles</hi> had, <hi>viz. Miracles,</hi> we shall then receive them in the same capacity as <hi>Apostles, viz.</hi> acting by an <hi>Infallible Commission,</hi> but not till then. By which I have given a sufficient Answer to what follows, concerning the credit which is given to <hi>Christ's Legats</hi> as to himself; for hereby it appears they are to have no greater authority than their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> gives them. Produce therefore an Infallible <hi>Commission</hi> for your <hi>Pastors Infallibility,</hi> either apart, or conjunctly, and we shall receive it; but not else. Whether <hi>A.C.</hi> in the words following, doth in terms at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute <hi>Divine and Infallible authority to the Church, supposing it infallibly assisted by the Holy Ghost,</hi> is very little material; for, Whether he owns it or no, it is sufficient that it necessarily follows from his Doctrine of <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</hi> For, How can the <hi>Church</hi> be infallible by virtue of those <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> wherein <hi>Divine Infallibility,</hi> you say, is promised, and by virtue of which the <hi>Apostles</hi> had <hi>Divine Infallibility,</hi> and yet the <hi>Church</hi> not to be <hi>divinely Infallible?</hi> The remainder of this Chapter, which concerns the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in this Controversie, will particularly be considered in the next, which is purposely designed for it.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Consider what remains of this Controversie in your Book.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the manifesting the concurrence of <hi>Antiquity</hi> with us; I shall confine my present discourse to the most pure and genuine <hi>Antiquity,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the compass of the <hi>three first Centuries,</hi> or at least, of those who have purposely writ in vindication of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> Not that I do in the least distrust the consent of the <hi>succeeding</hi> Writers of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> but upon these Reasons. 1. Because it would be too large a <hi>task</hi> at present to undertake, since no necessity from what you object, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my desire to clear the <hi>Truth,</hi> and rectifie the <hi>mistakes</hi> of such, who are led blindfold under the pretence of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> hath led me to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. 2. Because in reason they could not but understand best the waies and methods used by the <hi>Apostles</hi> for the perswading men to the <hi>Christian Faith</hi>; and if they had mentioned any such thing as an <hi>Infallibility</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to continue in the <hi>Charch,</hi> those <hi>Pastors</hi> certainly who received the care of the <hi>Church</hi> from the <hi>Apostles</hi> hands, could not but have heard of it: And were strangely to blame if they did not discover and make use of it. Whatever therefore of truly <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> is to be relyed on in such cases, must be conveyed to us from those persons who were the <hi>Apostles immediate Successors</hi>; and if it can be made manifest that they heard not of any such thing, in that, when occasion was offered, they are so far from mentioning it, that they take such different waies of satisfying men, which do manifestly suppose that they did not believe it. I know some of the greatest <hi>Patrons</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and such who know best how to manage things with best advantage for the interest of that <hi>Church,</hi> have made little account of the <hi>three first ages,</hi> and confined themselves within the compass of the <hi>four first Councils,</hi> upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, because the <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Writers</hi> are so <hi>rare</hi> before, and that those <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> who lived then, had no occasion to write of the matters in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between them and us. But if the ground why those other things which are not determined in <hi>Scripture,</hi> are to be believed by us, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as necessary, be, that they were <hi>Apostolical Traditions,</hi> Who can be more competent <hi>Judges</hi> what was so, and what not, then those who lived nearest the <hi>Apostolical times?</hi> and those certainly (if they writ of any thing) could not write of any thing of more concernment to the <hi>Christian world,</hi> than the knowledge of such things would be; or at least we cannot imagine but that we should find express intimations of them, where so many, so wise, and learned persons do industriously give an account of themselves, and their solemn actions to their <hi>Heathen persecutors.</hi> But however silent they may be in other things, which they neither heard, nor thought of, as in the Customs controverted between the <hi>Papists</hi> and us (which, no
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:101069:143"/>
doubt, is the true reason why the <hi>three first ages</hi> are declined by <hi>Cardinal Perrone</hi>) yet there is not the least shadow of pretence, why they should be silent in this present Controversie, since the great business of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings was to vindicate the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> to perswade the <hi>Heathens</hi> to believe it, and to manifest the grounds on which they were induced to believe themselves. If therefore in this they do unanimously concurr with that <hi>resolution of Faith</hi> I have already laid down, nothing can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired more for the evidence and confirmation of the truth of our way, than that it is not only most consonant to <hi>Scripture,</hi> but built on the truest <hi>Reason,</hi> and was the very same which the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> used when they gave an <hi>account of their Faith:</hi> Which I shall do, not by some mangled <hi>citations,</hi> but deducing it from the scope and design of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and drawing it successively down from the first after the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who appeared in <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi>

                  <hi>blessed men, just, and lovers of God, speaking by the inspiration of the Divine Spirit, foretelling things which have come to pass since, whom they call Prophets. These only saw the Truth, and declared it to men; neither flattering, nor fearing any, nor conquered with the love of honour: But they only spake the things which they heard and saw, being filled with the Holy Spirit. Whose Books are still extant; which, whosoever reads, and assents to, will find himself much improved in the principles and ends of things, and whatever becomes a Philosopher to know. For, they write not by way of argument or demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but, that which is above it, they are most faithful witnesses of Truth. For the things which have, and do come to pass, do enforce men to believe the Truth of what they spake: And not only so, but they are most worthy to be believed, for the Miracles which they wrought. Moreover, they extol the Maker of the World, God and the Father, and declare to the World his Son Christ: which the false Prophets, who are acted by a seducing and impure spirit, neither have done, nor yet do do; but they attempt to shew some tricks for the amazement of men, and cry up the evil and deceiving spirits. But, do thou, above all things, pray, that the gates of light may be opened to thee. For these things are not seen nor understood by all, but only by them to whom God and Christ, shall grant the knowledge of them.</hi> A most signal and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Testimony (as any is extant in all Antiquity) for acquainting us with the true <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>reasons</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which therefore I have at large produced. The very reading of which is sufficient to tell us, How true a <hi>Protestant</hi> this, whether <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> was. When <hi>Justin</hi> asked him, <hi>What Teachers he should have to lead him to Truth</hi>; He tells him, There had been long before <hi>Philosophers,</hi> excellent persons in the world, called <hi>Prophets,</hi> men every way good, who did nothing for fear or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or love of themselves. But <hi>Justin</hi> might further ask, <hi>How he should come to be instructed by them?</hi> He tells him, Their <hi>Writings</hi> were still <hi>extant,</hi> wherein were contained such things as might hugely satisfie a <hi>Philosophical</hi> mind concerning the <hi>Origine</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of things. He might still enquire, <hi>Whether those things were demonstrated or no, in them?</hi> No, he replies; but they deserve assent as much, if not beyond any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration; because they manifest themselves to be from God, by two things, the exact accomplishment of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> made by them, and the unparalleld <hi>Miracles</hi> which were wrought by them. <hi>But, might not the evil spirits work such things?</hi> No: For, although their false <hi>Prophets</hi>

God, and his Son Christ.</hi> But, <hi>May then any one, by the innate power of his mind, yield a divine assent to these things?</hi> No: but, pray earnestly to God to enlighten your mind; for this is the effect of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> in and <hi>through Christ.</hi> What part is there now of our <hi>resolution of Faith,</hi> which is not herein asserted? If you ask, <hi>Why you believe there were such men in the World as these Prophets?</hi> The continuance of their Books and common Fame sufficiently attest it. If you ask, <hi>Why you should believe them to be True Prophets?</hi> The <hi>excellency</hi> of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> joyned with the <hi>fulfilling Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and <hi>working Miracles,</hi> abundantly prove it. But if you lastly ask, <hi>Whether, besides objective evidence, there be not some higher efficient requisite to produce a Divine Faith</hi>; The Answer is, That depends upon the <hi>Grace of God in Christ:</hi> So that here we have most evidently all those things concurring, which his Lordship asserts in the <hi>resolution of Faith; Moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement preparing the mind, rational evidence</hi> from the thing into which <hi>Faith</hi> is resolved, and <hi>Divine Grace</hi> requisite in the nature of an <hi>efficient cause.</hi> But, Where is there the least intimation of any <hi>Churches Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> requisite to make men believe with a <hi>firm and Divine Faith?</hi> No doubt that was a <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> which <hi>Justin</hi> was bid to pray so heartily for, and which was only in those <hi>to whom it was given</hi>; and yet even this <hi>Faith</hi> had no other assurance to build it self upon, but that <hi>rational evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> which is before discovered. <hi>That Divine Person never thought of mens believing with their Wills, much less that the Books of Scripture had no more evidence of themselves, than distinction of colours to a blind man; he did not think Christ an Ignoramus or Impostor, because he left no Church infallible, nor that God by the Prophets laid a Foundation upon sand, or that would last but a few years, because he did not continue such an Infallible Assistance as the Prophets had to the Church in all ages</hi>; yet these are all brave <hi>assertions</hi> of yours; which, doubtless, you would be ashamed of, and recant, if you had not, as <hi>Casaubon</hi> saith of the <hi>Person</hi> whom you could not tell whether he was a <hi>Jesuit</hi> or no (but by that character you might guess it) that he had <hi>frontem ferream, &amp; cor involutum</hi>; a <hi>brow of steel,</hi> and a <hi>heartfull of Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> (to use your own fine expression.)

And the whole design of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> is to prove the contrary, by an appeal to all the <hi>Apostolical Churches,</hi> and particularly by appealing to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> because of its due fame and celebrity in that Age wherein <hi>Irenaeus</hi> lived. So that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> appealed to the then <hi>Roman Church,</hi> even when he speaks highest in the honour of it, for somewhat which is fundamentally contrary to the <hi>pretensions</hi> of the <hi>now Roman Church.</hi> He then appealed to it, for an evidence against such <hi>oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> which were pretended to be left by the <hi>Apostles</hi> as a rule to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>Scripture</hi> by; and, were it not for this same pretence now, what will become of the Authority of the <hi>present Roman Church.</hi>

               <p>After he hath thus manifested by recourse to the <hi>Apostolical Churches</hi> that there was no such <hi>Tradition</hi> left <hi>among them,</hi> it was very reasonable to inferr that there was <hi>none such at all</hi>; for they could not imagine, if the <hi>Apostles</hi> had designed any such <hi>Tradition,</hi> but they would have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to those famous <hi>Churches</hi> which were planted by them, and it was absurd to suppose that those <hi>Churches</hi> who could so easily derive their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from the <hi>Apostles</hi> should in so short a time have lost the memory of so rich a treasure deposited with them, as that was pretended to be; from whence he sufficiently refutes that unreasonable imagination of the <hi>Valentinians.</hi> Which having done, he proceeds to settle those firm <hi>grounds</hi> on which the <hi>Christians</hi> believed in <hi>one God the Father,</hi> and in <hi>one Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> which he doth by removing the only Objection which the <hi>Adversaries</hi> had against them. For when the <hi>Christians</hi> declared, the main <hi>reason</hi> into which they resolved their Faith as to these principles, was, <hi>Because</hi> no other <hi>God or Christ</hi> were revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but them whom they believed, the <hi>Valentinians</hi> answered, this could not be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>foundation</hi> for their <hi>Faith</hi> on this account, because many things were delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi> not according to the <hi>truth of the things,</hi> but the <hi>judgment and opinion of the persons they were spoken to.</hi> This therefore being such a <hi>pretence</hi> as would destroy any <hi>firm resolution of Faith into Scripture,</hi> and must necessarily place it in <hi>Tradition; Irenaeus</hi> concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self much to demonstrate the <hi>contrary,</hi> by an <hi>ostension</hi> (as he calls it) that <hi>Christ and the Apostles did all along speak according to truth, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opinion of their auditours,</hi> which is the entire subject of the fifth <hi>Chapter</hi> of his third <hi>Book.</hi> Which he proves first of <hi>Christ,</hi> because he was <hi>Truth it self,</hi> and it would be very contrary to his nature to speak of things, otherwise then they were, when the very design of his coming was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect men in the way of <hi>Truth. The Apostles</hi> were <hi>persons</hi> who professed to declare <hi>truth</hi> to the world, and as <hi>light</hi> cannot communicate with <hi>darkness,</hi> so neither could <hi>truth</hi> be <hi>blended</hi> with so much <hi>falshood</hi> as that opinion sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth in them. And therefore neither <hi>our Lord</hi> nor his <hi>Apostles</hi> could be supposed to mean any other <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> then whom they declared. <hi>For this</hi> (saith he) <hi>were rather to increase their ignorance and confirm them in it, then to cure them of it</hi>; and therefore that Law was true which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a <hi>curse on every one who led a blind man out of his way.</hi> And the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:101069:148"/>
                  <hi>Apostles</hi> being sent for the <hi>recovery of the lost sight of the blind,</hi> cannot be supposed to speak to <hi>men</hi> according to their <hi>present opinion,</hi> but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>manifestation</hi> of truth. For, what <hi>Physitian intending to cure a Patient, will do according to his Patients desire, and not rather what will be best for him?</hi> From whence he concludes, Since the <hi>design of Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> was not to flatter but to cure mens souls; it follows, that they did not speak to them, according to their former <hi>opinion,</hi> but according to <hi>truth</hi> without all <hi>hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>dissimulation.</hi> From whence it follows, that if <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> did speak according to truth, there is then need of no Oral Tradition for our understanding <hi>Scripture,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the resolution of our <hi>Faith</hi> as to <hi>God and Christ,</hi> and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as to other objects to be believed, is not into any Tradition pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be derived from <hi>the Apostles,</hi> but into the <hi>Scriptures themselves</hi>; which by this discourse evidently appears to have been the <hi>judgement</hi> of <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>

For he speaks not of any <hi>Tradition infallibly attested</hi> to us, without which you pretend there can be no <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> but of such an <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> which depends wholly upon <hi>Antiquity, Vniversality,</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> and never so much as mentions, much less pretends to any thing of <hi>Infallibility</hi>: So

That the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:101069:152"/>
                  <hi>first beginning</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>equal</hi> to the highest <hi>degree</hi> of it; for when he speaks of the <hi>Church,</hi> he speaks of <hi>Christs entring by that,</hi> which can be meant of nothing else but the <hi>first step to Faith,</hi> as is plain in the parallel case of the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>; but if this were <hi>Divine and Infallible,</hi> it must be <hi>equal</hi> to the <hi>highest</hi> degree, for that I suppose can <hi>be but Divine and Infallible,</hi> unless you can find out <hi>degrees</hi> in <hi>Infallibility.</hi> By this Rule, you make him that is but over the <hi>threshold,</hi> as much in <hi>the house,</hi> as he that is <hi>sate down</hi> to the <hi>Table</hi>; a <hi>plant</hi> at its first <hi>peeping</hi> out of the earth, to be as <hi>tall</hi> as at its full growth; and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> as firmly to <hi>believe</hi> in Christ at the first <hi>mention</hi> of him by the <hi>Woman,</hi> as when they saw and heard him. 2. By this you make an <hi>Infallible Faith</hi> to be built on a <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Testimony</hi>; for to what purpose else was the Similitude of the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria</hi> insisted on, but to parallel the Testimony of the <hi>Church</hi> with that of the <hi>Woman,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Faith</hi> built on the <hi>Churches</hi> Testimony to be like that which the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had of <hi>Christ</hi> upon the <hi>Womans Testimony</hi>; and if you believe that <hi>Faith Infallible,</hi> you must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, an <hi>Infal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But, it may be, though these seem hard things, yet you prove them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly:<note place="margin">P. 108.</note> No doubt of it; for, you say, <hi>That Christ enters by that Faith, but Christ cannot enter into a soul by a meer humane fallible perswasion, but by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith only. Nay, when he says, That he more believes the Scripture, than the Churches Testimony, he saith, That he believes the Church; But how can he believe without Faith?</hi> O the irresistible force of demonstrations! But what sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people are we, that thought a man might <hi>enter</hi> into a <hi>house</hi> by the <hi>door,</hi> though he met not with his hearty entertainment till afterwards? But, Do you really think, that <hi>Christ</hi> never <hi>enters</hi> into a <hi>soul,</hi> but by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Infallible Faith?</hi> For <hi>Christ enters</hi> by that which gives him his <hi>first admission,</hi> but his <hi>full reception</hi> must be by a higher <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Do you think men believe as much at <hi>first</hi> as ever after? If not, May not <hi>Christ</hi> be said to <hi>enter</hi> by that <hi>lower degree of Faith?</hi> I pray, What think you of the <hi>case</hi> in hand, Did not the belief of <hi>Christ enter</hi> by the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria?</hi> and was that, as <hi>Divine a Faith,</hi> as what they had afterwards? Nay, take <hi>Christs entring</hi> (as improperly as you can imagine it) for his <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reception</hi> in the soul, Can that be no other waies but by an <hi>Infallible Faith?</hi> A <hi>Faith</hi> supposed to be built on <hi>infallible grounds,</hi> I grant; but whether all, who do truly <hi>believe</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> do build their <hi>Faith</hi> on <hi>grounds in themselves infallible,</hi> my charity to some deluded souls in your <hi>Church</hi> (as well as honest, but ignorant persons elsewhere) gives me just <hi>reason</hi> to question. But still there is a greater subtilty behind, which is, if he believes the <hi>Scripture</hi> more than the <hi>Church,</hi> then he must believe the <hi>Church</hi> equally with the <hi>Scripture</hi>; for that must be the meaning of what you say, <hi>when he sayes, He believes the Scripture more than the Church, he believes the Church; but how can he believe without Faith? Ergo,</hi> this must be Divine Faith, or else all the rest come to nothing. So that if I say, <hi>I believe the Scripture more than you,</hi> it follows, that <hi>I believe you as much as the Scripture,</hi> by the very same consequence. But you have gotten such a knack of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting your self, that poor <hi>Gandavo</hi> cannot fall into your hands, but you must make him do so too. When you say, <hi>A man cannot believe without Faith,</hi> I dare justifie it to be one of the greatest truths in your Book; but,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101069:152"/>
if your meaning be, <hi>A man cannot believe without Divine Faith,</hi> I hope we <hi>Protestants</hi> sufficiently confute that; for you dare not deny that <hi>we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve at all,</hi> but (just as the <hi>Devils</hi> do) we must (according to you) <hi>believe and tremble,</hi> because our Faith is not <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible.</hi> But still your subtilty works with you, for because <hi>Gandavensis</hi> saith, <hi>That we must yield our first Faith to the Scripture, but,</hi> secundam sub ista, <hi>a secondary Faith to the definitions and customs of the Catholick Church:</hi> You cry out, <hi>Here's</hi> prima &amp; secunda fides; <hi>but yet both of them are properly and truly Faith.</hi> But, Are both of them properly and truly <hi>Divine Faith?</hi> If so, How comes the distinction of the <hi>first and second,</hi> one subordinate to the other, if both be <hi>equally Divine and Infallible?</hi> Nay, according to your Principles, the Faith given to the <hi>Church</hi> must be the <hi>first Faith,</hi> and to the <hi>Scriptures the second</hi> under that; because, for the sake of the <hi>Churches Testimony,</hi> we are to believe the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And, Do you really think, there may be no discovery of <hi>Infidelity</hi> in rejecting a <hi>sufficient Testimony</hi> for <hi>Faith,</hi> where there is not an <hi>Infallible Testimony?</hi> But, whatever you think, your great enemy, <hi>Reason,</hi> tells us the contrary; and therefore what follows <hi>of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, sub poen√¢ perfidiae,</hi> is to no more purpose than what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The strength therefore of all that you say as to this Testimony of <hi>Gandavensis,</hi> lyes in the proof of this one thing; <hi>That no man can believe any thing without an Infallible Faith</hi>; yet I <hi>verily believe</hi> that you have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably perverted the <hi>Schoolmens</hi> words, and think no more <hi>Infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> requisite for it, than your <hi>own words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, it may be, though you do so ill by the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> you may use the <hi>Fathers</hi> more civilly.<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> Three things therefore you have to answer to those Testimonies of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 109.</note> which seem most to make use of internal Arguments. 1. <hi>That they use them not to such as had no Divine Faith, but to such as had.</hi> 2. <hi>That they do not use them as Primary, Infallible and Divine proofs, but as secondary arguments, perswasive only to such as believed Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be Gods Word antecedently to them.</hi> 3. <hi>That they do not use only such proofs as are wholly internal to the Scripture it self. As to the two first condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you say 'tis evident, these proofs were made by Christians, namely the Holy Fathers; and commonly to Christians, who lived in their times. And as clear is it, that they never pronounced them to be the Primary, Infallible, and Divine Motives of their belief in that point, nor used they them as such.</hi> How false and absurd these Answers are, may appear by our precedent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, wherein we manifested, that the <hi>Christians</hi> insisted on those <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> there mentioned not <hi>for themselves</hi> and other <hi>Christians,</hi> but chiefly to convince and perswade by them the <hi>Gentile world</hi> to the belief of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</hi> And, Did they suppose these <hi>Heathens</hi> to have a <hi>Divine Faith</hi> already? Or, Did they look on such arguments as only <hi>secondary motives,</hi> when these were the <hi>chief,</hi> nay only <hi>arguments</hi> which they used to perswade them; if they had other that were <hi>Primary, Divine,</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made use of <hi>secondary, humane, probable motives,</hi> they were guilty of the highest <hi>betraying</hi> the <hi>Christian Cause</hi> imaginable. And you make them only to <hi>defend Christianity,</hi> as <hi>Vaninus</hi> did <hi>Divine Providence</hi> with such silly and weak arguments, that by their overthrow, the belief of it might fall with them. Indeed, if they had pretended the <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> there might have been just reason for such a <hi>Suspicion,</hi> and any wise men would have thought their design had been to make their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contemptible, and expose it to the derision of <hi>Atheists,</hi> instead of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter establishing the <hi>Foundations</hi> of believing it. But those wise and holy
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:101069:153"/>
men knew better the <hi>interest</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> than to offer to defend it by <hi>Principles</hi> in themselves <hi>false,</hi> and much more liable to question than that was which they were to prove by them: and therefore made choice of arguments in themselves <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> and built on <hi>Principles, common to themselves, and those whom they disputed against, i. e.</hi> they urged them with the greatest strength of <hi>Reason,</hi> and the clearest <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and never questioned but that a <hi>Faith</hi> built on those <hi>grounds,</hi> if effectual for a <hi>holy Life,</hi> was a <hi>true and Divine Faith.</hi> It seems then, your cause cannot be maintained, without the most sharp and virulent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on those <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> who among all those arguments whereby they so successfully prevailed over the <hi>Gentile world,</hi> never did so much as vouchsafe to mention the least pretence to <hi>Infallibility</hi>; for which they are now accused of using only the <hi>blunter weapons,</hi> of <hi>humane and fallible motives,</hi> and not those <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>Divine Motives of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</hi> But this is not the first time we have seen, what desperate shifts a bad cause puts men upon.</p>
               <p>It may be yet, your strength may lye in your <hi>last condition, viz. That these arguments used by them, were not internal.</hi> For, 1. You say, <hi>That of Miracles is external;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 109.</note> 
                  <hi>the Scriptures themselves work none, neither were ever any Miracles wrought to confirm, that all the Books now in the Canon (and no more) are the Word of God.</hi> I answer, 1. I have already told you of a double resolution of <hi>Faith,</hi> the one as to the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the other as to the <hi>Veracity</hi> of the <hi>Books</hi> which contain it: when therefore <hi>Miracles</hi> are insisted on, it is not in order to the <hi>latter</hi> of these which we have sufficient assurance of without them, as I have already largely proved, both as to the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> of the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi>; but <hi>Miracles,</hi> we say, are the arguments to prove the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> by, because they attest the <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of the persons, who deliver this Doctrine to the world. 2. As <hi>to us</hi> who receive the report of those <hi>Miracles,</hi> as conveyed to us by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> those may be said to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal arguments</hi> to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which are there recorded in order to our believing the <hi>Doctrine</hi> therein contained to be <hi>Divine.</hi> The <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> being delivered to us now joyntly with the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> although on different <hi>grounds</hi> we believe the <hi>Veracity</hi> of the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> contained in it. We believe that the <hi>Miracles</hi> were truly done, because they are delivered to us by an unquestionable Tradition, in such <hi>Authentick Writings</hi> as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are; but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Doctrine</hi> contained in the Books to be <hi>Divine,</hi> because attested by such <hi>Miracles,</hi> and we believe the Books of <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,</hi> because such persons cannot be supposed to <hi>falsifie</hi> to the world who wrought such <hi>great Miracles.</hi> 2. You say, <hi>The conversion of so many People and Nations by the Doctrine contained in Scripture, is also external to the Scripture.</hi> But still you suppose that these arguments are brought to prove these <hi>Books</hi> to be <hi>divinely inspired,</hi> which is denied; we say only, That the <hi>admirable propagation of the Doctrine of the Gospel,</hi> is a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that it was from <hi>God.</hi> And therefore, when afterwards you say, <hi>That supposing all those arguments mentioned by the Bishop out of S.</hi> Augustine, <hi>to be internal to the Scripture, yet they cannot infallibly and divinely prove that Scripture is the Word of God.</hi> If by <hi>Scripture,</hi> you mean the <hi>Writings,</hi> we pretend not to it; if by <hi>Scripture,</hi> you mean the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it, we assert it, and think it no argument at all against that, which you add, <hi>That perswade they may, but convince they cannot</hi>; no doubt if they <hi>perswade,</hi> they
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101069:153"/>
do much more than <hi>convince</hi>; But, I suppose, your meaning is, they do it not <hi>effectually</hi>; if so, that is not the fault of the <hi>arguments,</hi> but of the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> who by his <hi>obstinacy,</hi> will not hearken to the <hi>clearest evidence</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> All that this can prove, is a necessity of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> to go along with <hi>external evidence,</hi> which you dare not assert, for fear of running into that <hi>private Spirit,</hi> which you objected to his Lordship on the same account. But it is very pretty which follows: You say, <hi>Supposing that all those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mentioned, of Miracles, nothing carnal in the Doctrine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 110<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>performance of it, and conversion of the world by it, were all of them internal to Scripture, yet they could not prove infallibly the Scripture to be the Word of God</hi>; and to prove this, you tell us, <hi>concerning the third and fourth, How can it ever be proved, that either the performance of this Doctrine, or the conversion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is internal to Scripture.</hi> But, Did you not suppose them before to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal to <hi>Scripture?</hi> and though they were so, yet could not prove the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c?</hi> and to prove that, you say they cannot be proved <hi>internal to Scripture.</hi> Which is just as if I should say, If you were <hi>Pope</hi> you would not be <hi>Infallible</hi>; and all the evidence I should give for it, should be only to prove that you were not <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You conclude this <hi>Chapter</hi> with a <hi>Wonder</hi> (I mean not any thing of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> which would really be so) <hi>But,</hi> say you, <hi>who can sufficiently wonder, that his Lordship, for these four Motives, should so easily make the Scripture give Divine Testimony to it self, upon which our Faith must rest, and yet deny the same priviledge to the Church. Seeing it cannot be denied, but that every one of these Motives are much more immediately and clearly applied to the Church, than to the Scripture.</hi> What? more immediately and clearly? and so clearly, that it cannot be denied? Prove but any one of them as to that <hi>Church,</hi> whose Infallibility is in question, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>present Roman-Church,</hi> and I will yield you the rest. Produce but any one <hi>undoubted Miracle,</hi> to confirm the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Pastors</hi> of it, shew your <hi>Doctrine</hi> (wherein it differs from ours) not to be <hi>carnal,</hi> manifest the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of the <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> only in the <hi>members</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> prove that it is <hi>your Church, as such,</hi> which hath preached <hi>this Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>converted whole Nations to the belief of it</hi> (in any other way than the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> did the poor <hi>Indians</hi>) and we may begin to hearken with somewhat more patience to your arrogant and unreasonable pretence of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Can any one then who hath any grain of reason left him, think that from these arguments, <hi>while his Lordship disputes most eagerly against the present Churches Infallibility, he argues mainly for it,</hi> as you very wisely conclude that Chapter. If this be arguing for your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> much good may such arguments do you.</p>
               <p>And so I come to the last part of my task as to this Controversie, which is, to examine your next Chapter,<note place="margin">¬ß. 11.</note> which puts us in hopes of seeing an End of this <hi>tedious Controversie:</hi> But this containing very little new in it (and therefore deserves not to be handled apart) will on that account admit of a quicker dispatch.

To his 1. <hi>That it seems reasonable, that since all Sciences suppose Principles; Theology should be allowed some too; the chiefest of which is, That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are of Divine Authority</hi>; your Answer is considerable;<note place="margin">P. 114.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. that he confounds Theology, a discoursive Science, with Faith, which is an act of the Vnderstanding, produced by an Impulse of the Will,</hi> &amp;c. But not to examine what hath been already handled, of the power of the <hi>Will in the act of Faith,</hi> it is plain when his Lordship speaks of <hi>Theology,</hi> he means <hi>Theology,</hi> and not <hi>Faith</hi>; and the intent of this Consideration was to shew, the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of starting this Question in a Theological Dispute about the Church.</hi> In your Answer to the <hi>second,</hi> you say, <hi>That Fallible Motives cannot produce Certainty,</hi> which if you would prove, you would do more to the purpose than you have done yet, and by this argument, I could not be <hi>certain,</hi> whether <hi>you had done it or no,</hi> unless you brought some <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Motives</hi> to prove it.

                  <note place="margin">P. 115.</note> I agree with you in it, having elsewhere sufficiently declared my self as to them. For the sixth you referr to your former Answer, and so do I to the reply to it. In the seventh, his <hi>Lordship</hi> proves <hi>the necessity of some revelation from God</hi> rationally and strongly, and thence inferrs, <hi>That either there never was any such Revelation, or that the Scripture is that Revelation, and that's it we Christians labour to make good against all Atheism, Prophaneness, and Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> To which you have two Exceptions.<note place="margin">P. 116.</note> 1. <hi>That this cannot be proved by the meer Light of Scripture,</hi> which His Lordship never pretended to. 2. <hi>That he leaves out the Word,</hi> only, <hi>which was the cause of the whole Controversie</hi>; What, between <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Atheists?</hi> For of that Controversie, he there speaks; but since you are so fond of your <hi>unwritten Revelations,</hi> pray prove the <hi>necessity</hi> of them as strongly against <hi>Atheists,</hi> as his <hi>Lordship</hi> hath done the <hi>necessity</hi> of a <hi>written one.</hi> In the <hi>last Consideration</hi> he musters up all the several <hi>arguments</hi> whereby men may be perswaded, <hi>that this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is contained in those Books we call the Scripture</hi>; as the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Testimony of former Ages,</hi> the <hi>consent of times,</hi> the <hi>Harmony of Prophets,</hi> and <hi>the Prophecies fulfilled,</hi> the <hi>success of the Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of it,</hi> the <hi>spiritual nature and efficacy of it,</hi> and lastly, the <hi>inward light and excellency of the Text it self</hi>; which, with a great deal of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> is there set forth. But to all this you say no more than what hath been abundantly disproved, <hi>viz. That all these only justifie our belief,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>when it is received as the ancients received it upon the Infallible Authority of Church-Tradition, but never otherwise.</hi> Whereas we have proved, that the <hi>ancients</hi> received it only on the same <hi>grounds,</hi> which are here mentioned, and therefore certainly are <hi>sufficient</hi> not only to <hi>justifie</hi> our <hi>Faith,</hi> but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us to <hi>believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your argument against what his <hi>Lordship</hi> saith of the <hi>necessity of the Spirit's assistance with these Motives,</hi>

                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:101069:155"/>
for then you must say, that either that <hi>Grace</hi> is not necessary in order to <hi>salvation,</hi> or <hi>that those who want it, are neither truly Christians, nor capable of salvation.</hi> And <hi>how horridly soever these consequences sound in the ears of the unlearned,</hi> they can sound no worse than those <hi>multitudes</hi> of <hi>Scriptures</hi> do which tell men, That <hi>without true Divine Faith, and real Grace, they are under eternal condemnation.</hi> But, it may be, that the <hi>unlearned</hi> may not be affrighted with such <hi>sentences</hi> as those are, you think it a great deal better to let them hear little or nothing of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and to let them be continually entertained with the <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>melodious voice of the Church.</hi> No doubt, you thought, your next argument had done the business ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually;<note place="margin">P. 116.</note>

Nay, Will it not much more hold against any in your <hi>Church,</hi> saying their <hi>Creed</hi> at all, unless they first believe your <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> which is very well known that all do not. For then, according to <hi>you, they do but lye, and profess to do that which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do, nor can do, without the Churches Infallible Testimony:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must begin a new work of <hi>Catechizing</hi> the <hi>members</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> to know whether they believe the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> before they can say their <hi>Creed.</hi> Unless you solve it among your selves, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, It is not a <hi>formal lye,</hi> but only an <hi>aequivocation,</hi> which many of you say, is <hi>lawful</hi> in case of <hi>danger,</hi> as you see apparently this is. But if the <hi>aequivocation</hi> be said only to lye in the word <hi>Believe,</hi> you might easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>weakness</hi> of your <hi>argument,</hi> through it. For if some may <hi>truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> what they do not <hi>savingly believe,</hi> there is <hi>no lye</hi> certainly told, in <hi>saying,</hi> They do <hi>believe</hi> as far as they do; which is by a <hi>firm assent</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> of all the <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> by that which is call'd an <hi>historical,</hi> or <hi>dogmatical Faith,</hi> where there may be no <hi>saving Faith.</hi> But that because <hi>Children are taught</hi> (as a short <hi>systeme</hi> of the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith) to say their</hi> Creed, <hi>we must be convinced of the foulness of our errour,</hi> is an apparent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that either you apprehended our <hi>understandings</hi> to be <hi>very weak,</hi> or that you sufficiently <hi>discover</hi> your <hi>own</hi> to be <hi>so.</hi>

That in all Controversies among <hi>Christians,</hi> whose decision depends upon the <hi>authority of Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> must be supposed as granted to be of <hi>Divine Authority</hi> by both <hi>parties.</hi> 2. That in that <hi>Question, Whether the Scripture contains all necessary things of Faith,</hi> that <hi>necessity</hi> must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to relate to the <hi>things</hi> which depend upon <hi>Scripture,</hi> and therefore implies it believed on other grounds, that this <hi>Scripture</hi> is of <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> For the Question is, Whether <hi>God</hi> hath consigned <hi>his Will</hi> so fully to us, in this <hi>Revelation</hi> of himself, that nothing necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved is left out of it? For men then to say, That this is <hi>left out of it,</hi> viz. <hi>to believe that this is a Divine Revelation,</hi> is an unreasonable Cavil, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed in the very <hi>Question,</hi> that it is so. 3. That in this sense the <hi>Scripture</hi> may be said to be a <hi>supposed Principle,</hi> because it hath a different way of <hi>probation,</hi> from <hi>particular objects of Faith,</hi> revealed in <hi>Scripture.</hi> For to a <hi>rational Enquirer,</hi> who seems to doubt of the Truth of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> it is equally absurd to give him any one of these three Answers. 1. <hi>That it is a Principle to be supposed</hi>: for, though it be supposed as to the particular debate depending on <hi>Scripture</hi>; yet it is fond and absurd to say, It must be <hi>supposed</hi> when it is the <hi>thing</hi> in question. 2. <hi>That it is known meerly by its own Light:</hi> for the person I have to deal with, supposing himself equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable to judge of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Evidence,</hi> as my self, it doth but betray the <hi>weakness</hi> of my <hi>cause,</hi> or my <hi>inability</hi> to manage it, to pretend that to be <hi>evident,</hi> which it is much more <hi>evident</hi> that he doth not think so; and it is only to tell him, my <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> must rule <hi>his,</hi> and that whatever appears to me to have <hi>Light</hi> in it self, ought likewise <hi>so</hi> appear to him. 3. It is as absurd as either of the other two, to say, <hi>That you will prove to a rational Enquirer, the Scripture to be Gods Word, by an unwritten Word of God.</hi> For, 1. His Enquiry is, Whether there be <hi>any Word of God or no,</hi> you prove <hi>there is, because there is</hi>; for that is all you prove by your <hi>unwritten Word.</hi> He denies, or at least questions, Whether there be <hi>any,</hi> and particularly instanceth in <hi>Scripture</hi>; you think to end the Question, by telling him, <hi>He must believe it to be so, because there is another Word of God which attests it,</hi> which, instead of <hi>ending</hi> the <hi>first Question,</hi> begets a great many more. For, 2. He will be more to seek, concerning this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word</hi> than before; because he might use his <hi>Reason</hi> in judging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>written Word,</hi> but cannot as to this <hi>unwritten</hi>; it being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told him, There is such a <hi>thing,</hi> but he knows not <hi>what it is, how far it extends, who must deliver it, what evidence this hath beyond the other, that it comes from God,</hi> that it must be used as an <hi>argument</hi> to prove it with. If you send him to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> you must either presume him of a very weak <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> or else he would easily discern your perfect <hi>jugling</hi> in this; the <hi>veins</hi> of which I have discovered throughout this discourse. There remains nothing then but <hi>Reason,</hi> a Principle common to us both; by which I must prove, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are from <hi>God,</hi> which <hi>Reason</hi> partly makes use of the <hi>Churches Tradition,</hi> not in any notion of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but meerly as built on <hi>Principles common to humane nature,</hi> and partly uses those other <hi>arguments</hi> which prove by the greatest

                  <hi>rational evidence,</hi> that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> was from <hi>God</hi>; and if this were all the meaning of saying, <hi>The Scriptures are a Principle sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,</hi> because of a different way of <hi>proving</hi> them, from particular objects of <hi>Faith,</hi> you can have no reason to deny it.</p>

                  <p>The Question of Schism explained. The nature of it enquired into. Several general Principles laid down for clearing the present Controversie. Three grounds of the charge of Schism on Protestant Churches by our Authour. The first, of the Roman Churches being the Catholick Church, entered upon. How far the Roman Church may be said to be a true Church. The distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Church morally and metaphysically true justified.

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> have in these last ages been divided in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from each other, the great contest and enquiry hath been, which party stands guilty of the cause of the present distance and separation. For, both sides retain still so much of their common <hi>Christianity,</hi> as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that no Religion doth so strictly oblige the owners of it to peace and unity as the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> doth; and yet notwithstanding this, we finde these breaches so farr from closing, that,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101069:157"/>
supposing the same grounds to continue, a reconciliation seems to humane reason impossible. An evidence of which, is, that those persons who either out of a generous desire of seeing the wounds of the <hi>Christian</hi> world healed, or out of some private interest or design, have made it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to propound terms of reconciliation between the divided parties, have been equally rejected by those parties they have professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the members of. For whether any of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> have ingenuously confessed the great corruptions crept into that <hi>Church,</hi> and desired a reformation of them, or any of the <hi>Protestant Communion</hi> have endeavoured to excuse, palliate, or plead for the <hi>corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> we find how little incouragement they have had for such under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings from that <hi>Church</hi> whose Communion they have professed to retain. The distance then being so great as it is, it is a very necessary enquiry what the <hi>cause</hi> of it is, and where the main fault lies; and it being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that there is a possibility that <hi>corruptions</hi> may get into a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and it being impossible to prove that <hi>Christianity</hi> obligeth men to communicate with a <hi>Church</hi> in all those <hi>corruptions</hi> its Communion may be tainted with, it seems evident to reason that the cause of the breach must lye there, where the corruptions are owned and imposed as conditions of Communion. For, can any one imagine it should be a fault in any to keep off from Communion, where they are so far from being obliged to it, that they have an obligation to the contrary, from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their common Christianity? and where men are bound not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, it is impossible to prove their not communicating to be <hi>Schism.</hi> For there can be no <hi>Schism,</hi> but where there is an obligation to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Schism</hi> being nothing else but a willful violation of the bonds of <hi>Christian Communion</hi>; and therefore when ever you would prove the <hi>Protestants</hi> guilty of <hi>Schism,</hi> you must do it by proving they were bound to communicate with your <hi>Church</hi> in those things, which they are <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> for disowning of. Or that there is so absolute and unlimited an obligation to continue in the <hi>Society</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> that no <hi>conditions</hi> can be so hard, but we are bound rather to submit to them, than not joyn in <hi>Communion</hi> with you.

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note>This being a matter of so vast consequence, in order to the settling mens minds in the present disputes of the <hi>Christian</hi> world, before I come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, I shall lay down those general principles which may manifest how free <hi>Protestants</hi> are, from all imputation of <hi>Schism. Schism</hi> then import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>violation</hi> of that <hi>Communion</hi> which we are <hi>obliged</hi> to, the most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way for understanding what <hi>Schism</hi> is, is to enquire what the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> are of <hi>Christian Communion,</hi> and how far the <hi>bonds</hi> of it do extend. Now the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Christian Communion</hi> in general depend upon the acknowledgement of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> For that <hi>Religion</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> came to deliver to the world being supposed <hi>true,</hi> is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why any look on themselves as obliged to profess it; which <hi>obligation</hi> extending to all persons who have the same grounds to believe the <hi>truth</hi> of it, thence ariseth the ground of <hi>Society</hi> in this profession, which is a common <hi>obligation</hi> on several persons joyning together in some <hi>acts</hi> of common concernment to them. The truth then of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acknowledged by several persons, they find in this <hi>Religion</hi> some
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101069:157"/>
                  <hi>actions</hi> which are to be performed by several persons in Society with each other. From whence ariseth that more immediate obligation to <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Society,</hi> in all those who profess themselves <hi>Christians</hi>; and the whole number of <hi>these</hi> who own the truth of Christian Religion and are thereby obliged to joyn in Society with each other, is that which we call the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</hi> But although there be such a relation to each other in all <hi>Christians</hi> as to make them one common Society; yet for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of particular <hi>acts</hi> of communion, there must be lesser <hi>Societies</hi> wherein persons may joyn together in the actions belonging to them. But still the <hi>obligation</hi> to communion in these <hi>lesser,</hi> is the same with that which constitutes the great body of <hi>Christians,</hi> which is the owning <hi>Christianity</hi> as the only true Religion and way to eternal Happiness. And therefore those lesser <hi>Societies</hi> cannot in justice make the necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of communion narrower, than those which belong to the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; i. e. those things which declare men <hi>Christians,</hi> ought to capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them for communion with <hi>Christians.</hi> But here we are to consider that as to be a <hi>Christian</hi> supposeth mens owning the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi> so the conveyance of that <hi>Religion</hi> being to us now in those <hi>Books</hi> we call the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> there must be an acknowledgement of them as the indispensable rule of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>manners,</hi> which is, That these <hi>Books</hi> are the <hi>great Charter</hi> of the <hi>Christian Society,</hi> according to which it must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
               <p>These things being premised as the foundation in general of <hi>Christian Society,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> we shall the better understand how far the <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in it doth extend. For which it must be considered, that the grounds of <hi>continuance</hi> in <hi>Communion,</hi> must be suitable and proportionable to the first <hi>reason</hi> of entering into it. No man being obliged by vertue of his being in a Society, to agree in any thing which tends to the apparent ruine of that Society; but he is obliged to the contrary, from the general grounds of his first admission into it. His primary <hi>obligation</hi> being to preserve the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> of it, and to joyn in <hi>acts</hi> of it so far as they tend to it. Now the main end of the <hi>Christian Society</hi> being the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Gods honour</hi> and the <hi>salvation</hi> of <hi>mens souls,</hi> the primary <hi>obligation</hi> of men entering into it, is the advancement of these <hi>ends,</hi> to joyn in all <hi>acts</hi> of it so far as they tend to these <hi>ends</hi>; but if any thing come to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red directly repugnant to these <hi>ends,</hi> those men of whom such things are required, are bound not to <hi>communicate</hi> in those lesser <hi>Societies</hi> where such <hi>things</hi> are imposed, but to preserve their communion with the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Society</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi> But these general discourses seeming more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, it will be necessary for the better subserviency of them to our design, to deduce them into particulars. Setting then aside the <hi>Catholick Society</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> we come to enquire how far men are bound to communicate with any lesser <hi>Society,</hi> how extensive so ever it may pretend its commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is no Society of Christians of any one Communion, but may impose some things to be believed or practised which may be repugnant to the general Foundations of Christian Society.</hi> But if any <hi>Society</hi> shall pretend a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of communion with her, because it is impossible this should be done by her: this priviledge must in reason be as evident as the common grounds of <hi>Christianity</hi> are; nay much more evident, because the belief of <hi>Christianity</hi> it self, doth (upon this pretence) depend on the knowledge of such <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and the indispensable obligation to communion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:101069:158"/>2. <hi>There being a possibility acknowledged, that particular Churches may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire unreasonable conditions of communion; the obligation to communion cannot be absolute and indispensable; but only so far as nothing is required destructive to the ends of Christian Society.</hi> Otherwise men would be bound to destroy that which they believe, and to do the most unjust and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable things. But the great difficulty lyes in knowing when such things are required, and who must be the judge in that case: to which I answer,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Nothing can be more unreasonable, then that the Society imposing such conditions of communion should be judge, whether those conditions be just and equitable or no.</hi> If the question only were in matters of peace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, and order, the judgement of the <hi>Society</hi> ought to over-rule the judgements of particular persons; but in such cases where great Bodies of <hi>Christians,</hi> judge such things required to be unlawful conditions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, what justice or reason is there, that the party accused should sit Judge in her own cause?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Where there is sufficient evidence from Scripture, reason, and tradition, that such things which are imposed are unreasonable conditions of Christian communion, the not communicating with that Society which requires these things cannot incurr the guilt of Schism.</hi> Which necessarily follows from the precedent grounds, because none can be obliged to communion in such cases, and therefore the not communicating is no culpable <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>By how much the Societies are greater which are agreed in not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with a Church imposing such conditions, by how much the power of those who rule those Societies so agreeing is larger, by so much the more justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the Reformation of any Church from these abuses, and the setling the bonds of Christian communion without them.</hi> And on those grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Church of</hi> Romes <hi>imposing unlawful conditions of communion,</hi> it was necessary <hi>not to communicate</hi> with her; and on the <hi>Church of</hi> Englands <hi>power to reform it self</hi> by the assistance of the <hi>Supream power,</hi> it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and justifiable not only to redress those <hi>abuses,</hi> but to settle the <hi>Church</hi> upon its proper and true foundations. So that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Romes</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing unlawful conditions of communion, is the reason why we do <hi>not communicate</hi> with her, and the <hi>Church of Englands</hi> power to govern and take care of <hi>her</hi> self, is the reason of our joyning together in the <hi>service</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon the principles of our <hi>Reformation.</hi> On these grounds I doubt not but to make it appear, how free the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Schism.</hi>

                  <hi>though it be by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy means and disparagement of truth) that the question was neither asked in that form, nor so answered. And that there is a great deal of difference (especially as Romanists handle the question of the Church) between The Church and A Church, and there is some between a True Church and a Right Church. For The Church may import the only true Church, and perhaps the root and ground of the Catholick.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">N. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>And this</hi> (saith he) <hi>I never did grant of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, nor ever mean to do. But A Church, can imply no more, then that it is a member of the whole. And this I never did</hi> (saith he) <hi>nor ever will deny, if it fall not absolutely away from Christ. That it is a True Church I granted also; but not a Right. For Truth only imports the being; right, perfection in conditions; thus a Thief is a true man, though not an upright man. So a corrupt Church may be true, as a Church is a company of men which profess the Faith of Christ and are baptized into his Name; but it is not therefore a right Church, either in doctrine or manners. And this</hi> (he saith) <hi>is acknowledged by very learned Protestants before him.</hi> This is the substance of his Lordships answer, to which we must consider what you reply;<note place="margin">P. 127. c. 2. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That about the terms of the Ladie's question</hi> you grant <hi>to be a verbal Controversie; and that whatever her words were, she was to be understood to demand this alone,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether the Roman were not the True, Visible, Infallible Church out of which none can be saved; for, herein</hi> (you say) <hi>she had from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Controversie desired satisfaction: And in this subject the Roman Church could not be any Church at all, unless it were The Church and a Right Church. The reason is, because St.</hi> Peters <hi>successour, being the Bishop of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">P. 128. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>and Head of the whole Church</hi> (as you tell us <hi>you will prove anon) that must needs be the Church <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> if it be any Church at all. And because the Church can be but one, if it be a true Church it must be the right Church.</hi> But all this amounts only to a confident assertion of that which wants evident proof, which is, that the notion of a <hi>Church</hi> relates to <hi>one as appointed the Head of the whole Church, without which it would be no Church at all.</hi> Which being a thing so hard to be understood, and therefore much harder to be proved, we must be content to wait your leasure till you shall think fit to prove it. When you therefore tell us afterwards, <hi>That the Vniversal Church supposes the acknowledgement of the same Vicar of Christ, and that those Dioceses which agree in this acknowledgement as well as in the same Faith, and communion of the same Sacraments make up one and the same Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church</hi>; When you further add, <hi>That the Roman Church is therefore stiled the Church, because it is the seat of the Vicar of Christ and chief Pastor of the Church Vniversal:</hi> I can only say to all these confident affirmations, that if you had sat in the <hi>chair</hi> your self, you could not have <hi>said</hi> more or <hi>proved</hi> less. It is not therefore in what sense words <hi>may be</hi> taken by you (for who questions but you may abuse words?) but in what <hi>sense</hi> they <hi>ought</hi> to be taken. You may call <hi>the Bishop of Rome the Vicar of Christ,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can expect our submission to him, you must prove <hi>that he is</hi> so; you may call the <hi>Roman Church, The Church</hi> if you please, among your selves: but if by that you would perswade us there can be no <hi>Church</hi> but that, you would do an office of kindness to offer a little at some small
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101069:159"/>
proof of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> as much as the cause, and your abilities will afford. And what if <hi>the Ancients by a true Church did mean an Orthodox Church?</hi> I know but one of these things will follow from it, either that they took a <hi>true Church</hi> for one <hi>morally</hi> and not <hi>metaphysically true</hi>; or that if your <hi>Church</hi> be not an <hi>Orthodox Church,</hi> it can be none at all. From hence you proceed to quarrel with his <hi>Lordship</hi> for saying, <hi>That may be a true Church which is not a right Church</hi> (which is all the thanks he hath for his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to you);<note place="margin">N. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>for</hi> (say you) <hi>how can you call that a true Church in which men are not taught the way to Heaven, but to eternal perdition?</hi> Which is as much as to ask, How you can call that man a <hi>true man</hi> that hath a <hi>Leprosie</hi> upon him. But if you had considered, what his <hi>Lordship</hi> had said, you would never have made such an objection. For his <hi>Lordship</hi> doth not speak of the <hi>soundness</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> but of the <hi>metaphysical entity</hi> of it. For he saith,<note place="margin">Sect. 20. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>It is true in that sense as</hi> ens <hi>and</hi> verum, <hi>Being and True, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible one with another; and every thing that hath a Being is truly that Being which it is in truth of substance. But</hi> (say you), <hi>how can that be a true Church which teacheth the way to eternal perdition by some false Doctrine in matter of Faith? because it either teacheth something to be the Word of God which is not; or denies that to be his Word which is: to err in this sort is certainly to commit high and mortal offence against the honour and veracity of God, and consequently the direct way to eternal perdition.</hi> An excellent discourse to prove that no man can be saved that is not Infallible! for if he be not Infallible he may either <hi>teach something to be Gods Word which is not, or deny that to be his Word that is; either of which being a mortal offence against the honour and veracity of God,</hi> it is impossible any man that is not Infallible should be saved: either then we must put off that humanity which exposes us to errour, or pronounce it impossible for any men to be saved, or else assert that there may be <hi>errour</hi> where <hi>Gods</hi> veracity is not denyed. And if so, then not only men severally but a <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>men</hi> may propound that for <hi>truth</hi> which is not, and yet not mortally offend against <hi>Gods veracity</hi>; supposing that <hi>Society</hi> of men doth believe (though falsly) that this is therefore <hi>true</hi> because revealed by <hi>God.</hi> In which case that <hi>Church</hi> may be a <hi>true Church</hi> in one sense, though an <hi>erroneous Church</hi> in another: <hi>true,</hi> as there is a possibility of salvation in it; <hi>erroneous,</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering that for truth which is not so. But here is a great deal of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a <hi>Church</hi> acknowledging her self fallible, and that which doth not. For suppose a <hi>Church</hi> propose something <hi>erroneous</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, if she doth not arrogate <hi>Infallibility</hi> to her self in that <hi>proposal,</hi> but requires men to search and examine her doctrine by the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the danger is nothing so great to the persons in her communion; but when a <hi>Church</hi> pretends to be <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>teacheth errours,</hi> that <hi>Church</hi> requiring those <hi>errours</hi> to be believed upon her Authority, without particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> proposed, is chargeable with a higher offence against the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>veracity</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and doth as much as in her lies (in your expression) <hi>teach men the way to eternal perdition.</hi> And of all sorts of <hi>blind guides</hi> it is most dangerous following such who pretend to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> in their <hi>blindness</hi>; and it is a great miracle if such do not fall past recovery. The more therefore you aggravate the danger of <hi>errour,</hi> the worse still you make the condition of your <hi>Church,</hi> where men are bound to believe the <hi>Church Infallible,</hi> when she proposeth the most <hi>dangerous errours.</hi> When you say, <hi>The whole Church is not lyable to these inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of seducing or being seduced,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 129.</note> if you mean (as you speak) of that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:101069:159"/>
which is <hi>truly the whole Church of Christ,</hi> you are to seek for an <hi>Adversary</hi> in it; if you mean the <hi>Roman Church</hi> you are either <hi>seduced</hi> or endeavour to <hi>seduce</hi> in saying so, when neither that is or can be <hi>the whole Church,</hi> neither is it free from believing or proposing errours as will appear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.

               </p>
               <p>But we must see, how well you have fitted it. <hi>Instead of a man,</hi>

That which follows, to shew the incongruity of his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi> Similitude would much more shew your wit, if it were capable of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable sense: <hi>For,</hi> you say, <hi>the word Church in our present debate, implies not a simple or uncompounded term, as that of man,</hi>

What follows concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Holy Catholick Church in the Apostles Creed, the entire Catholick Faith in the Athanasian Creed, the Churches being the Spouse of Christ, and a pure Virgin,</hi> are all things as <hi>true</hi> in themselves, as your <hi>Church</hi> is little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them.

For</hi> (saith he) <hi>in all the Primitive times of the Church, a Man, or a Family, or a National Church were accounted right and orthodox, as they agreed with the Catholick Church, but the Catholick was never then measured or judged by Man, Family, or Nation. But now in the Jesuits new School, the One, Holy, Catholick Church, must be measured by that which is in the Diocese or City of</hi> Rome, <hi>or of them which agreed with it; and not</hi> Rome <hi>by the Catholick. So upon the matter, belike the Christian Faith was committed to the custody of the</hi> Roman, <hi>not of the Catholick Church; and a man cannot agree with the Catholick Church of Christ (in this new doctrine of</hi> A. C.) <hi>unless he agree with the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>but if he agree with that, all is safe, and he is as orthodox, as he need be.</hi> To which you seem to answer at first by some slight tergiversations,<note place="margin">P. 131.</note> 
                  <hi>as, though this did not follow from</hi> A. C<hi>'s words, and that the Lady did not trouble her self with such punctilio's as those of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholick Church with</hi> Rome, <hi>or</hi> Romes <hi>agreeing with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> but at last you take heart, and affirm stoutly, <hi>That the Church is stiled Catholick from its agreement with</hi> Rome, <hi>and that this is no Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitism, but a received and known Truth in the Ancient Church.</hi> In these terms then I fix my self, and this present dispute; as containing the proper state of the <hi>Controversie</hi> concerning the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> And if you can make it appear that the <hi>Church is stiled Catholick by agreeing with</hi> Rome, <hi>and that this was a received Truth in the Ancient Church,</hi> then you may very plausibly charge us with <hi>Schism</hi> in our separation from <hi>Rome</hi>; but if the contrary be made evident, by your own pretence we are freed from that charge.</p>
               <p>Now in the handling this Controversie, you first explain your terms, and then produce your Testimonies.<note place="margin">P. 130. n. 5.</note> In the explication of your terms, you tell us, <hi>The word Catholick may be used in three different Acceptions,</hi> viz. <hi>either formally, causally, or by way of participation. Formally, the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church,</hi> i. e. <hi>the society of all true particular Churches, united together in one body, in one Communion, under one Head, is called Catholick. Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is stiled Catholick, because it hath an influence and force to cause Vniversality in the whole body of the Church Catholick; to which two things are necessary, Multitude and Vnity. The</hi> Roman <hi>Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which as a Center of Ecclesiastical Communion, infuses this Vnity, which is the form of Vniversality, into the Catholick Church, and thereby causes in her Vniversality, may be called Catholick causally, though she be but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church. As he that commands a whole Army is stiled General, though he be but a particular person. Thirdly, every particular orthodox Church is termed Catholick</hi> participative, <hi>by way of participation, because they agree in, and participate of the Doctrine and Communion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. For which</hi> (you bring) <hi>the instance of the Church of</hi> Smyrna <hi>writing to the Catholick Church of</hi> Philomilion, &amp;c. <hi>Thus we see</hi> (say you) <hi>both how properly the</hi> Roman <hi>Church is called Catholick, and how the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church it self takes causally the denomination of Vniversal or Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick from the</hi> Roman, <hi>considered as the chief particular Church, infusing
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101069:160"/>
Vnity to all the rest, as having dependence of her, and relation to her.</hi> Thus I have recited your words, that we may fully understand your meaning; the substance of which is couched in your last words, <hi>That the reason why any Church was accounted Catholick, was from its Vnion with the Church of</hi> Rome. But if it appear that this sense of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is wholly a stranger to Antiquity, That the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> was so call'd upon farr different accounts than those mentioned by you, If the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had no other relation to the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> but as a <hi>member</hi> of it as other <hi>Churches</hi> were, then all this discourse of yours comes to nothing, and that is it which I now undertake to prove. Now the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> lying in two things, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> of it, if in neither of these, it had any <hi>dependence of the Church of Rome,</hi> then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it could not be call'd <hi>Catholick, causally</hi> from the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, the <hi>Church</hi> was called <hi>Catholick</hi> from the <hi>Vniversal spread</hi> of its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>agreement of all particular Churches</hi> in it.<note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> So <hi>Irenaeus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> spread abroad over the world from the <hi>Vnity</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> which was Universally received, and from thence saith, <hi>That the Church is but as one house, and having one soul and heart, and speaks as with one mouth.</hi> Nothing can be more plain then that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> makes the <hi>consent in Doctrine</hi> to be the <hi>ground of Vnity</hi> in the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>

So fatal hath it been to <hi>Rome</hi> even from its first foundation to be a <hi>receptacle</hi> for such persons.

And that the former words do really import such a <hi>full power</hi> in <hi>particular Bishops,</hi> over <hi>that part of the flock which is committed to them,</hi> appears from the true importance of the phrase <hi>insolidum</hi>; a phrase taken out of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> where great difference is made between an obligation <hi>in partem</hi> and <hi>in solidum,</hi> and so proportionable between a

                  </note> and had left Societies there which joyned in his <hi>Schism.</hi> For <hi>Caralis</hi> was the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and it appears by St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that the <hi>Luciferians</hi> confined the <hi>Church</hi> only to <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which is the cause of that expression of his; <hi>That Christ did not come meerly for the sake of the Sardini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> So that those <hi>Luciferians</hi> were much like the <hi>Donatists,</hi> confining the <hi>Church</hi> only to their own number. Now there being such a <hi>Schism</hi> at that time in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> what did <hi>Satyrus</hi> any more then enquire whether the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>place</hi> he resorted to was guilty of this <hi>Schism</hi> or no? <hi>But</hi> (say you) <hi>he made that the tryal whether he was a Catholick or no, by asking whether he agreed with the Church of Rome.</hi> To which I answer, that there was very great reason for his particular instancing in the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> 1. Because <hi>Satyrus</hi> was originally of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> himself; for <hi>Paulinus</hi> in the life of S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose (Satyrus</hi> his brother) speaking of him after his consecration to be <hi>Bishop,</hi> say's, <hi>Ad urbem Romam hoc est ad natale solum perrexit, He went to Rome,</hi> i. e. <hi>to the place of his birth</hi>; now <hi>Satyrus</hi> being originally a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> what wonder is it that he should particularly enquire of the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> As suppose one of the <hi>Gallican Church</hi> of <hi>Arles</hi> or <hi>Vienna</hi> should have been cast upon shore in another <hi>Island</hi> belonging to <hi>France</hi> at the same time, and understanding there was a <hi>Schism</hi> in the place, should particularly enquire whether they agreed with the <hi>Catholick Bishops,</hi> i. e. with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Arles</hi> or <hi>Vienna,</hi> Could you hence inferr that either of these were <hi>the center of Ecclesiastical communion,</hi> and if not from hence, how can you from the other? Or suppose, in the time of the <hi>Donatists Schism</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> a stranger coming accidentally thither and desiring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Christians</hi> of that <hi>City</hi> he was in, should enquire of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> whether he communicated with the <hi>Catholick Bishops, i. e.</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Hippo</hi> or <hi>Carthage.</hi> Could you hence inferr that <hi>Hippo</hi> was <hi>causally the Catholick Church,</hi> and if not, with what reason can you do it from so parallel a case? 2. Because <hi>Sardinia</hi> did belong to the <hi>Metropolitan Province</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; it being one of the <hi>Subur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicarian Provinces</hi> under the jurisdiction of the <hi>Roman Lieutenant,</hi> and consequently one of the <hi>Suburbicarian Churches</hi> appertaining to the <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan power</hi> of the <hi>Bishop of Rome:</hi> and therefore it was but reason to ask whether the <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Sardinia</hi> did agree with their <hi>Mother Church</hi> or no. But all this is very farr from implying that the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> comes from the particular <hi>Church of Rome:</hi> on this account, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at that time when the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> was preserved by that continual <hi>correspondence</hi> between the parts of it by the <hi>formed let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and otherwise, who ever was known to have communion with any one particular Church (which communicated with the rest) had thereby communion with the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> So that on that account the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion might as well have been asked of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Milan, Agobio,</hi> or any other in <hi>Italy</hi> as of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> For whosoever communicated
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:101069:164"/>
with any of them did communicate with the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as well as those who did communicate with the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> So that your first instance will prove no more the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be the <hi>fountain</hi> and <hi>center</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical communion,</hi> then any other particular Church. Your second is, from St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> saying, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Alexandria <hi>made it her glory to participate of the Roman Faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

For, any one who reads that <hi>Epistle</hi> will easily see, that St. <hi>Hierome</hi> there speaks of the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> not as it <hi>proceeds</hi> from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> but as it was <hi>received</hi> by it; and that he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of the then <hi>present Roman Faith,</hi> any further then it agreed with that <hi>Faith</hi> which the <hi>Apostle</hi> commended in them. So that the utmost which can be extracted out of this testimony, is, that it was the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to hold the same <hi>Faith</hi> which the Primitive <hi>Roman Church</hi> did, for which the <hi>Apostle</hi> commended it. Which is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by the design of the whole <hi>Epistle,</hi> which is to encourage <hi>Theophilus</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to suppress the <hi>Nefarions Heresie</hi> (as he calls it) of the <hi>Origenists</hi>; for, it seems, <hi>Theophilus</hi> then dealt more mildly with them, which <hi>Hierome</hi> was displeased at. And therefore tells him, that although he took some care by the discipline of the <hi>Church</hi> to reduce them, yet that was not enough, and thence brings in these words; <hi>But withall know, that nothing is more our design then to preserve the rights of Christ,</hi>

                  <hi>who did not consent in all things with the See Apostolick:</hi> but the main force of your testimonies lyes in a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that men will never take the pains to examine them. We must therefore consider the occasion and manner of the writing this <hi>Epistle</hi>; for those words you cite, are not the words of the <hi>Patriarch</hi> himself, but of the form of <hi>subscription</hi> required by <hi>Hormisda</hi> in order to an <hi>Vnion</hi> of the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches</hi>; which had been then a long time in a <hi>Schism.</hi> For after that <hi>Acacius</hi> stood up so resolutely in defence of the <hi>rights</hi> of his <hi>See</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops (who made it then their design to infringe the <hi>liberties</hi> of other <hi>Churches</hi> the better to inhance their own) would by no means admit of any reconciliation unless the names of <hi>Acacius,</hi> and those who defended him in that <hi>See</hi> being his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, as <hi>Phravita, Euphemius, Macedonius,</hi> &amp;c. were expunged out of the <hi>Diptychs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; which being so unjust and unreasonable a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for a long time the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> would by no means assent to it. But after the death of the <hi>Emperour Anastasius, Justin</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the throne, one who made it his business to have this <hi>breach</hi> made up; in order to which he writes to <hi>Hormisda,</hi> and earnestly perswades him to a reconciliation; and so likewise doth the <hi>Patriarch John.</hi> But it hath been the common practise of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> to be therein unlike the <hi>unjust Judge,</hi> that they will not be wrought on by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities</hi>; but have been the more implacable, the more they have been sought to: as it appeared in this present case. For this soure and inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible <hi>Pope</hi> would not yield to any terms of <hi>Vnion,</hi> but upon conditions of his own prescribing, which were, the <hi>expunging</hi> of <hi>Acacius,</hi> and <hi>subscribing</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:101069:165"/>
that <hi>form</hi> which he sent to them. Which when the <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> saw, though they were sufficiently displeased at it, yet out of their greedy desire of peace, they were contented rather to <hi>swallow</hi> these hard conditions than suffer the <hi>Schism</hi> to remain still. Now it is in this <hi>form</hi> of <hi>subscription</hi> that these words are contained, wherein they promise, <hi>not to recite the names of those in the sacred mysteries, who are severed from the communion of the Catholick Church,</hi> i. e. <hi>who consent not in all things with the See Apostolick.</hi> But lest these words being thus inserted by the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, should be interpreted to the disadvantage of other <hi>Churches,</hi> and particularly that of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; The <hi>Patriarch</hi> makes a Preface to that <hi>Subscription</hi> by way of <hi>Protestation</hi>; wherein after declaring the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Popes letters,</hi> and congratulating the hopes of <hi>Vnion,</hi> he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests his own desire of peace, and his willingness to refuse the communion of all Hereticks. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>I look on those most holy Churches of your elder and our new</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>as both making but one Church.</hi> And after, declaring his assent to the decrees of the four <hi>General Councils,</hi> he adds, <hi>That those who opposed them he judged fallen off, √† Sanct √¢ Dei generali &amp; Apostolic√¢ Ecclesi√¢,</hi> from the holy <hi>Catholick and Apostolick Church.</hi> Now when the <hi>Patriarch</hi> was thus careful to explain himself, so as to assert that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> made but one <hi>Church,</hi> when he adds what he means by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> viz. <hi>the truely General and Apostolical Church</hi>; inferr as much from <hi>Hormisda's</hi> words as you will, I am sure you can do little to your purpose from the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> taking them in the sense he explains himself in, by this <hi>Protestation.</hi> So that the meaning of them is only this, that as he judged the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> a member of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (whose <hi>Vnity</hi> required, that those who were out of communion in one <hi>Church</hi> should be so with the rest) so he consented to acknowledge them justly <hi>excommunicated</hi> whom the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> would have to be so. So that hence nothing ariseth to your purpose, more then will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advance the authority of any other particular <hi>Church</hi>; whose excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications did oblige the <hi>whole Church,</hi> as we have seen already in the case of <hi>Sinope</hi> and <hi>Ptolemais.</hi>

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:101069:166"/>
whom the whole world (saith he, meaning the whole Catholick Church) agrees by communicatory letters in one Society of communion; See here</hi> (say you) <hi>how clearly he makes the union with the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>the measure of the Catholick Church; which the Bishop calls a Jesuitism, and further proves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be in the Catholick Church, because he was in communion with the See of St.</hi> Peter. For our better understanding the meaning of these words of <hi>Optatus,</hi> we must consider the state of the Controversie between <hi>Optatus</hi> and <hi>Parmenianus,</hi> by which it will appear, how very little these words of his make to your purpose. The main question between the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Donatists</hi> was, about the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> To whom it was that title did belong. The difficulty seemed the greater, because there was no difference between them in any matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> or in the substance of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and therefore they were fain to find out other means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this Controversie, than by either of those two. For which the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> made choice of these two arguments <hi>Vniversality</hi> and <hi>Succession,</hi> the former as agreeing with that large <hi>spread</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> which was Prophesied to be in the times of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> whereas the <hi>Donatists</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the <hi>Church</hi> to a Corner in <hi>Africa:</hi> the latter in regard of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of deriving themselves from the <hi>Apostolical Churches.</hi> Now the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi> denying any but themselves to be the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> the proof lay on their <hi>Adversaries</hi> part, who upon all occasions offer to make it good, That the <hi>Church</hi> from which the <hi>Donatists</hi> separated themselves, was the only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Accordingly <hi>Optatus</hi> having in the first book discussed the matters of <hi>fact</hi> about the rise of the <hi>Schism,</hi> the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Cecilian</hi> and <hi>Majorinus,</hi> and the proceedings used for the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Schism,</hi> in this second Book he enters on the Controversie of the <hi>Church</hi> which <hi>Parmenianus</hi> would have to be only among themselves; against which he urgeth first, that then certainly the <hi>Church</hi> could not be called <hi>Catholick,</hi> because it was so called <hi>from its large comprehension and universal spread.</hi>

                  <hi>who should place another chair against that. Therefore in this one chair St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>sate first, to whom succeeded</hi> Linus, <hi>to him</hi> Clemens <hi>and so on to</hi> Syricius <hi>who joyns with us, with whom the whole world communicates by the entercourse of formed letters. Do you now give an account of your chair, who challenge to your selves the name of the Holy Church.</hi> To pass by that ridiculous account of the name <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> which <hi>Baldwin</hi> supposes to be inserted into the text from some ignorant gloss made in the margin, the main thing to be considered, is the scope and design of these words; in which he doth two things, 1. He shews the evident succession of the <hi>Catholick Bishops</hi> from St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which he doth by a distinct and particular enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. 2. From thence shews the unlawfulness of setting up an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>chair</hi> in opposition to that, <hi>i. e.</hi> pretending to another right of <hi>Government</hi> then what was conveyed down from the <hi>Apostles</hi>; or setting up another <hi>chair</hi> in opposition to that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome, i. e.</hi> that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Bishops</hi> which was derived from him. Now, saith he, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the unity of the <hi>Church,</hi> intended there should be but one <hi>chair</hi> in a place, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the several <hi>Apostles</hi> should not in the same <hi>place</hi> set up a distinct <hi>Cathedra</hi> or <hi>succession</hi> of <hi>Church-Governours,</hi> and therefore though St. <hi>Paul</hi> as well as St. <hi>Peter</hi> were instrumental in the settling the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> yet, that the <hi>Churches Vnity</hi> might be preserved, there were not two distinct <hi>series</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> the one deriving from St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> from St. <hi>Paul.</hi> So that <hi>Optatus</hi> his saying is much of the same nature with that of <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the case of the <hi>Schism</hi> about <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatianus,</hi> who urgeth that most, <hi>That there ought to be but one Bishop in one Church,</hi> now the <hi>Bishop</hi> and his <hi>Cathedra</hi> are <hi>correlates</hi> to each other. <hi>Optatus</hi> therefore saying that there was but <hi>one Cathedra</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> puts the <hi>Donatist's</hi> upon this issue, that if they could not deduce their <hi>succession</hi> from St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> they could have no pretence to the <hi>Cathedra</hi> there. And therefore challengeth them to deduce the <hi>succession</hi> of their <hi>Bishops</hi> there, as at large appears in his following discourse. Which could be no higher then of <hi>Macrobius</hi> from <hi>Encolpius, Encolpius</hi> from <hi>Bonifacius Balli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi> as he from <hi>Victor Garbiensis,</hi> who was sent over on purpose from the <hi>Donatists</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi> to make a faction and a party at <hi>Rome,</hi>

Now this being the utmost <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> they could pretend to, and that being in opposition to that <hi>successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which was derived from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> nothing could be more plain then that at <hi>Rome</hi> (about which the Contest was) the <hi>Cathedra</hi> could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Donatists</hi> but their <hi>Adversaries</hi>; and therefore that being by <hi>Parmenianus</hi> acknowledged one of the <hi>dowries</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> the title of that could not belong to the <hi>Donatists</hi> but their opposers. This therefore doth not at all concern <hi>Romes</hi> being <hi>causally the Catholick Church,</hi> but is only produced as a particular <hi>Church</hi> for a <hi>known instance</hi> whereby to decide this particular Controversie of succession. For otherwise the argument would have held as well for any other <hi>Apostolical Church</hi> where
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:101069:167"/>
the succession was clear: And therefore afterwards he makes the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the seven Churches as plain an argument of communion with the Catholick,</hi>

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>Vicinity</hi> and <hi>Fame</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the easier knowing the succession there, he instanceth in <hi>that</hi> in the first place, and then proceeds to the rest of them. But withall, to shew the <hi>Vnity</hi> of all these <hi>Apostolical Churches,</hi> when he had mentioned <hi>Siricius</hi> as the present <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he adds, <hi>That all the world agreed with him in the entercourse of the formed Letters</hi>; not thereby intimating any <hi>supremacy</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> above others, but to shew that that succession he instanceth in at <hi>Rome,</hi> was of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> because the <hi>whole Christian world,</hi> did agree in <hi>Communion</hi> with him that was the <hi>Bishop</hi> there.

and <hi>Miletius</hi>; but besides this <hi>Schism,</hi> it seems S. <hi>Hierom</hi> suspected some remainders of <hi>Arrianism</hi> to be still among them; from their <hi>demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of him, Whether he acknowledged three distinct <hi>hypostases</hi> in the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>

                  <hi>But</hi> (say you) <hi>whatever the occasion of the words were, Is it not plain, that he makes the Church to be built on S.</hi> Peter's <hi>See, and that whosoever is out of the communion of that Church, is an Alien, and belongs to Antichrist?</hi> To that therefore I answer, 1. That he doth not say, that the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is built on the particular <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> for it is not, <hi>super hanc Petram,</hi> as referring to the <hi>Cathedra</hi> immediately preceding; but, <hi>super illam,</hi> and therefore it is not improbably supposed by some, that the <hi>Rock</hi> here referrs to <hi>Christ.</hi> And, although <hi>Erasmus</hi> doth imagine, that some particular <hi>priviledge</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> did belong to <hi>Rome</hi> above other <hi>Churches</hi> from this place (which is not the thing we contend about) yet withall he sayes, that by the <hi>Rock</hi> we must not understand <hi>Rome</hi>; for <hi>that may degenerate, but we must understand that Faith which</hi> Peter <hi>professed.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. I answer, when S. <hi>Hierom</hi> pronounces <hi>those Aliens and prophane, who are out of the communion of the Church</hi>; either it belongs not to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or, if it doth, it makes not much for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. 1. There is no certainty that he there speaks of the <hi>particular Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that he rather speaks of the true <hi>Vniversal Church</hi>;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:101069:168"/>
for it is plain, he speaks of that <hi>Church which is built upon the Rock,</hi> now by your own confession, that cannot be the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that you suppose to be the <hi>Rock,</hi> it self, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> built upon it, must be the <hi>Vniversal Church.</hi> And that this must be his meaning, appears from his plain words, for, he saith, <hi>Vpon that Rock the Church is built, and whosoever eats the Lamb without this house, is prophane</hi>;‚Äîhe cannot certainly mean, <hi>Whosoever eats without the Rock, but without the house built upon it</hi>; so that the <hi>house</hi> in the latter <hi>clause</hi> must needs be the same with that <hi>which was built on the Rock</hi> in the former. Either therefore you must deny the <hi>See of Peter</hi> to be the <hi>Rock,</hi> or you must of necessity assert the <hi>house built upon it</hi> to be the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> and not the particular one of <hi>Rome</hi>; and consequently the danger lyes not upon mens not being in communion with the <hi>Roman,</hi> but with the <hi>truly Catholick Church.</hi> And how from hence you will inferr, <hi>That they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane who are out of the Roman Church</hi>; it would be worth our while to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. 2. Suppose I should grant, that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> did mean the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet I am not satisfied, that this comes home to your purpose, unless you could prove, that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> spake of what was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily and unalterably to be in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not meerly of what was in that time, when he spake these words. But that is your perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Paralogism</hi> in the citations of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in praise of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> what they spake, and it may be deservedly of the <hi>Church</hi> of their own time (although sometimes their <hi>Rhetorick</hi> swell'd too high in their <hi>Encomiasticks</hi>) that you will needs have to be understood of the same <hi>Church</hi> at all times, and in our present age. As though it were not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a <hi>Church</hi> to be eminent for <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> in one age, and to decline as much from it in another. But I need give no other instance in this case, than S. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself, for if we believe S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his <hi>Catalogue, the two immediate predecessors of</hi> Damasus, <hi>in the See of</hi> Rome, Liberius, <hi>and</hi> Felix <hi>were tainted with Heresie</hi>; and that very <hi>Heresie,</hi>

                  <hi>that having set up a Bishop against him at</hi> Carthage, <hi>they sail to the chair of</hi> Peter, <hi>and the principal Church from whence the sacerdotal Vnity had its rise, and carry Letters from prophane and Schismatical persons, not considering that the</hi> Romans <hi>(whose Faith was commended by the Apostle) were such to whom perfidiousness could not have access.</hi> Now the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this place you would have to be this, and no other, <hi>viz. that the See of S.</hi> Peter, <hi>which is the principal of all Churches, was so infallibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Holy Ghost, that no errour in Faith could have access to it, or be admitted by it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> if not as a particular Church,</hi>

Which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by particular examinations of what you return in answer to his Lordship. Three things his Lordship answers to this place.<note place="margin">Sect. 3. n. 3, &amp;c.</note> 1. <hi>That</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidia <hi>can hardly stand here for errour in Faith</hi>; and if so then this can make nothing for <hi>Infallibility.</hi> 2. <hi>That supposing it granted to signifie errour in Faith and Doctrine, yet it belongs not to the</hi> Romans <hi>absolutely, but with a respect to those first</hi> Romans <hi>whose Faith was commended by the Apostle.</hi> 3. <hi>That it seems to be rather a Rhetorical insinuation, than a dogmatical assertion.</hi> And that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> could not be supposed to assert herein the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> appears by the <hi>contracts</hi> between him and the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is the short of his Lordships answers to this place, to which we must consider what you reply. 1. His Lordship sayes, <hi>That perfidia can hardly stand for errour in Faith or misbelief, but it properly signifies malicious falshood in matter of trust and action, not error in Faith, but in fact against the discipline and Government of the Church.</hi> And to make this interpretation appear the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his Lordship gives an account of the story which was the occasion of writing that <hi>Epistle,</hi> which is this, as his Lordship reports it from <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Baronius; In the year</hi> 255. <hi>there was a Council in</hi> Carthage <hi>in the cause of two Schismaticks,</hi> Felicissimus <hi>and</hi> Novatian, <hi>about restoring of them to the communion of the Church, which had lapsed in time of danger from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity to Idolatry.</hi> Felicissimus <hi>would admit all even without penance, and</hi> Novatian <hi>would admit none, no not after penance. The Fathers</hi> 42 <hi>in number went, as Truth led them, between both extreams. To this Council came</hi> Privatus <hi>a known Heretick, but was not admitted because he was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:101069:170"/>
excommunicated, and often condemned. Hereupon he gathers his Complices together, and chooses one</hi> Fortunatus <hi>(who was formerly condemned as well as himself) Bishop of</hi> Carthage, <hi>and set him up against St.</hi> Cyprian. <hi>This done</hi> Felicissimus <hi>and his Fellows haste to</hi> Rome <hi>with letters testimonial from their own party, and pretend that</hi> 25 <hi>Bishops concurred with them: and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was to be received into the communion of the Roman Church, and to have their new Bishop acknowledged.</hi> Cornelius <hi>then Pope, though their haste had now prevented St.</hi> Cyprians <hi>letters, having formerly heard from him, both of them, and their Schism in</hi> Africk <hi>would neither hear them, nor receive their letters. They grew insolent and furious (the ordinary way that Schismaticks take). Vpon this</hi> Cornelius <hi>writes to St.</hi> Cyprian<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
                  <hi>and St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>in this Epistle gives</hi> Cornelius <hi>thanks, for refusing these</hi> African <hi>fugitives, declares their Schism and wickedness at large, and encourages him and all Bishops to maintain the Ecclesiastical Discipline, and censures against any the boldest threatnings of wicked Schismaticks.</hi> This being the story, his Lordship sayes, <hi>He would fain know why</hi> perfidia <hi>(all circumstances considered) may not stand here in its proper sense for cunning and perfidious dealing, which these men having practised at</hi> Carthage, <hi>thought now to obtrude upon the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>also, but that he was wary enough not to be over-reached by busie Schismaticks?</hi> This demand of his Lordship seeming very just and reasonable we are bound to consider what reasons you give, why <hi>perfidia</hi> must be understood <hi>for errour in Faith</hi> and not in the sense here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Why calls he</hi> (say you) <hi>St.</hi> Peters <hi>chair,</hi> Ecclesiam principalem <hi>(the chief Church) but because it is the head to which all other Churches must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate in matter of doctrine?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 133.</note> 
                  <hi>the words following signifie as much,</hi> Unde unitas sacerdotalis exorta est, <hi>from which chair of St.</hi> Peter <hi>as it were from its fountain, unity in Priesthood and consequently unity in Faith is derived. Why brings he the Apostle as Panegyrist of the Roman Faith? Is it forsooth, because no malicious falshood in matter of trust or errour in fact against the Discipline and Government of the Church can have access unto them, as the Bishop will needs misinterpret the place? or rather because no errour in Faith can approach the See Apostolick? Certain it is</hi> perfidia <hi>in this sense, is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically opposed to the Faith of the Romans immediately before commended by the Apostle (which was true Christian Faith) and consequently it must of necessity be taken for the quite contrary,</hi> viz. <hi>misbelief or errour in Faith.</hi> Three Arguments in these words you produce, why <hi>perfidia</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of <hi>errour in Faith.</hi> 1. <hi>Because the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is called the chief Church</hi>; but is it not possible it should be called so in any other sense, but as the <hi>head of all other Churches in matter of doctrine?</hi> Is it not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that there were other accounts of calling the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> the <hi>chief</hi> or <hi>principal Church,</hi> as the <hi>eminency</hi> of it joyned with the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> (the <hi>potentior principalitas</hi> in <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) which advanced its reputation to the height it was then at? What <hi>matters of doctrine</hi> do you find brought to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>Infallibly</hi> decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time? how little did St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> believe this, when he so vehemently opposed the judgement of <hi>Stephen Bishop of Rome</hi> in the case of <hi>rebaptization?</hi> Doth he write, speak, or carry himself in that <hi>Controversie</hi> like one that owned that <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be <hi>head</hi> of all <hi>other Churches,</hi> to which they must be subordinate in <hi>matter of doctrine?</hi> Nay in the very next words St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> argues against <hi>appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and is it possible then to think, that in these words he should give such an <hi>absolute power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to it? And therefore any one who would reconcile
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:101069:170"/>
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>himself</hi> must by those words of <hi>Ecclesia principalis</hi> only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>eminency,</hi> and not the <hi>power,</hi> much less the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And no more is implyed in the Second, <hi>That it is said to be the fountain of Sacerdotal Vnity,</hi> which some think may probably referr to the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of the <hi>Church of Africk,</hi> which had its rise from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others,<note place="margin">

For what connexion is there between <hi>Vnity</hi> in <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> in <hi>Faith?</hi> Suppose the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> should be owned as the <hi>principal Member</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and therefore that the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> should begin there in regard of the <hi>dignity</hi> of it, doth it thence follow that there must be an <hi>absolute subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of all other <hi>Churches</hi> to it? Nothing then can be inferr'd from either of those particulars, that by <hi>perfidia,</hi> errour in Faith must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, taking those two expressions in the most favourable sense that can be put upon them. But considering the present state of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> at the time when <hi>Felicissimus</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> came thither, I am apt to think another interpretation more probable than either of the foregoing. For which we must remember that there was a <hi>Schism</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> between <hi>Novatianus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the former challenging to be <hi>Bishop</hi> there, as well as the latter, upon which a great breach was made among them. Now these persons going out of <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might manage their business with the more advantage, address themselves to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his <hi>party</hi>; upon which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>Navigare audent ad Petri Cathedram atque ad Ecclesiam principalem, unde Vnitas sacerdotalis exorta est,</hi> thereby expressing their <hi>confidence</hi> that they not only went to <hi>Rome,</hi> but when they were there, they did not presently side with the <hi>Schismatical party</hi> of the <hi>Novatians</hi> there, but as though they had been <hi>true Catholicks,</hi> they go to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who, being the legal successour of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in opposition to <hi>Novatianus,</hi> calls his <hi>See the chair of St.</hi> Peter, and the <hi>principal Church,</hi> and the <hi>spring of the Vnity of the Priesthood</hi>; because the contrary party of <hi>Novatianus</hi> had been the cause of all the <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>disunion</hi> which had been among them. And in this sense which seems very agreeable to St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words and design, we may easily understand what this <hi>perfidia</hi> was, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>falseness and perfidious dealing</hi> of these persons, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were <hi>Schismaticks</hi> themselves, yet they were so farr from seeming so at their coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> that as though they had been very good <hi>Catholicks,</hi> they seek to joyn in communion with <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the <hi>Catholick party</hi> with him. By which we see what little probability there is from those expressions that <hi>perfidia</hi> must be taken, <hi>for an errour in Faith.</hi> But, 3. You say, <hi>To what purpose else doth he mention St.</hi> Pauls <hi>commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Faith, if this</hi> perfidia <hi>were not immediately opposite to it?</hi> But then inform us what part of that <hi>Apostolical Faith</hi> was it, which <hi>Felicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> sought to violate at <hi>Rome?</hi> It is apparent their whole design was to be admitted into <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (which in all probability is that <hi>access</hi> here spoken of): if therefore this <hi>perfidia</hi> imported some <hi>errour in Faith,</hi> it must be some <hi>errour</hi> broached by those particular persons as contrary to the old <hi>Roman Faith</hi> which was extold by the <hi>Apostle.</hi> And although these persons might be guilty of

Although withall, I suppose St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> might give him some taste of his old office, of a <hi>Rhetorician</hi> in the allusion between <hi>fides</hi> and <hi>perfidia,</hi> without ever intending that <hi>perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> should be taken in any other sense then what was proper to the cause in hand.</p>
               <p>You having effected so little in the solution of his Lordships first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, you have little cause to boast in your following words, <hi>That hence his other explication also vanishes into smoak,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> viz. <hi>when he asserts that</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidia non potest <hi>may be taken hyperbolically for</hi> non facile potest; <hi>because this interpretation suits not with those high Elogiums given by St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>to the Roman Church, as being the principal Church, the Church whence Vnity of Faith and Discipline is derived to all other Christian Churches.</hi> If you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may have the liberty to interpret St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words as you please, by adding such things to them, of which there is no intimation in what he saith, you may make what you please unsuitable to them. For although he calls it <hi>the principal Church, from whence the Vnity of the Priesthood is sprung</hi>; yet what is this to <hi>the Vnity of Faith and Discipline as derived from thence to all other Churches,</hi> as you would perswade the unwary reader that these were St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words, which are only your groundless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them. And therefore there is no such improbability in what his Lordship sayes, <hi>That this may be only a Rhetorical excess of speech, in which St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>may</hi> laudando praecipere, <hi>by commending them to be such, instruct them that such indeed they ought to be, to whom perfidiousness should not get access.</hi> And for this he instanceth in such another <hi>Rhetorical expression</hi> of <hi>Synesius</hi> to <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wherein he tells him that he ought to esteem <hi>what his Throne should determine as an Oracle or Divine Law.</hi>

But still you have the unhappiness to misunderstand him. For although he
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:101069:171"/>
grants that <hi>perfidia</hi> may relate to <hi>errour in Faith,</hi> yet as it is here used, it is not understood of it <hi>abstractly</hi> but <hi>concretely,</hi> for <hi>perfidious misbelievers, i. e.</hi> such <hi>perfidious persons,</hi> excommunicated out of other <hi>Churches,</hi> were not likely to get access at <hi>Rome,</hi> or to find admittance into their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And in this sense, it is plain that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not intend by these words, to exempt the <hi>Romans</hi> from <hi>possibility of errour,</hi> but to brand his adversaries with a title due to their merit, calling them <hi>perfidious,</hi> i. e. such as had betrayed or perverted the <hi>Faith.</hi> When you therefore ask, <hi>is not this great praise?</hi> I suppose none but your self would make a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had then so great <hi>purity</hi> as not to admit such <hi>perfidious misbelievers</hi> into her communion. And it were well if the present <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were capable of the same <hi>praise.</hi> But when you add, <hi>It is as if St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>should say St.</hi> Peters <hi>See could not erre so long as it continued constant in the truth</hi>; you wilfully misunderstand his Lordships meaning, who speaks of the <hi>persons</hi> and not meerly of their <hi>errours</hi>; but however, is it not a commendation to say that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> consisted of such <hi>persons</hi> then who adhered to the <hi>Apostolical Faith,</hi> and therefore <hi>errour</hi> could not have <hi>access</hi> to them? And I look on it as so great a commendation, that I heartily wish it could be verified of your <hi>Church</hi> now. Neither is this any such <hi>Identical proposition</hi> as that you produce, but only a declaration of their present constancy, and inferring thence, how unlikely it was that <hi>errours</hi> should be admitted by them. His Lordship to make it plain that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had no meaning to assert the unerring <hi>Infallibility</hi> of either <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> insists on the contest which after happened between St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Pope Stephen</hi>; upon which he saith expresly, <hi>That Pope</hi> Stephen <hi>did not only maintain an errour but the very cause of Hereticks,</hi>

                  <hi>With a famous distinction of the Popes erring as a private Doctor and as the Vniversal Pastor, and that St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>might very well be supposed to think the Pope erred only in the first sense.</hi> Not to spend time in <hi>rifling</hi> this distinction of the <hi>Popes erring personally,</hi> but not <hi>judicially,</hi> or as a <hi>private Doctor,</hi> but not as <hi>Vniversal Pastor,</hi> which it were an easie matter to do, by manifesting the incongruity of it, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities consequent upon it, in case that <hi>doctrine</hi> which the <hi>Pope erres</hi> in, comes to be <hi>judicially</hi> decided by him; It is sufficient for us at present to shew that this distinction cannot relieve you in our present case. For your <hi>Doctors</hi> tell us, the <hi>Pope</hi> then erres <hi>personally</hi> and as a <hi>private Doctor,</hi> when he erres only in his <hi>own judgement</hi> without <hi>obliging</hi> others to <hi>believe,</hi> what he judges to be <hi>true</hi>; but then he erres <hi>judicially</hi> and as <hi>Vniversal Pastor,</hi> when he <hi>declares</hi> his <hi>judgement</hi> so as to <hi>oblige</hi> others to <hi>receive</hi> it as <hi>true.</hi> Now can any thing be more evident then that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> judged <hi>Pope Stephen</hi> to erre in this <hi>latter</hi> and not in the former sense? For doth he not absolutely and severely declare himself against St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: condemning it as an <hi>errour</hi> and an <hi>innovation?</hi> But say you, <hi>He did not properly define any doctrine in that contestation; but said</hi> nihil innovetur nisi quod traditum. But was not that the question what was <hi>traditum</hi> and what not, for <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his <hi>party</hi> denyed it to be a <hi>tradition,</hi> which <hi>Stephen</hi> asserted was so; and doth he not therefore undertake to define
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:101069:172"/>
something in this cause? But say you, <hi>If this argument hold good against the Infallibility of Popes,</hi> viz. <hi>that St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>held Pope</hi> Stephen <hi>erred, therefore the Pope may erre in matters of Faith, it will be a good consequence also to say St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>held Pope</hi> Stephen <hi>erred, even whilst he maintained an universal immemorial tradition‚Äîtherefore the Pope may erre whilst he follows such a tradition.</hi> I answer, 1. Who besides you, would not have seen, that the question was not, Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Infallible</hi> or no, but whether St. <hi>Cyprian judged him to be Infallible</hi> or no? for if it appear that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not judge him <hi>Infallible,</hi> then those former words cannot be interpreted to such a sense as doth imply Infallibility. 2. No doubt if the <hi>Pope</hi> may err in other things, he may <hi>err</hi> when he thinks he follows an <hi>universal immemorial tradition</hi>; not that he doth err, when he doth really follow such a one, but he may err in <hi>judging</hi> that to be an <hi>universal immemorial tradition</hi> which is not: and this was the case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Pope Stephen</hi>; the <hi>Pope</hi> pretended to follow an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal tradition,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> judgeth him to err in it, and that it was not so. And is it not plain still, notwithstanding these frivolous pretences, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had no opinion at all of the <hi>Popes Infallibility</hi> in any sense: and therefore out of honour to him, you are bound to interpret his former words to some other sense then that of any <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus all his Lordships answers standing good, you have gained no great matter by this first testimony of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>

left out? Yes</hi> (say you) <hi>these Books were left then under dispute:</hi> with whom were they under dispute? with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> or not? If <hi>with her,</hi> was she not <hi>Infallible</hi> the mean while, when so great a matter as the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> was <hi>under dispute</hi> with her? But this whole business concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> is largely discussed already; only here it is sufficient to shew, how you are pent in on every side; so that there is no possibility of getting out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the strait</hi> (his Lordship takes notice of) <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is driven to, in borrowing a testimony for her Infallibility from one whom she branded with Heresie in that very Book from whence this testimony is taken</hi>; You answer, <hi>That it evidently argues the truth and uncorruptedness of that Church, which is so clear that even her Adversaries cannot but confess it.</hi> But if they confess it no better then <hi>Ruffinus</hi> doth, she will have little cause to applaud her self for her <hi>Integrity</hi> in that respect. And although a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony may be taken from persons suspected in some things, yet it argues those have but very <hi>few friends,</hi> who are fain to make use of their <hi>enemies</hi> to bear witness for them. What follows concerning a <hi>particular Church being Infallible,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 140.</note> because you disown it (although not consonantly to the principles of your party as was shewed in the occasion of the Conference) I pass by.</p>
               <p>The errours of the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome (which his Lordship mentions, but you say <hi>proves not</hi>) you shall find abundantly proved before our task is over.</p>
               <p>Your vindication of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> from inconsistency in saying <hi>A proposition is most true, and yet but peradventure as true as another,</hi> is so fine and subtil that it were an injury to the Reader to deprive him of the pleasure of perusing it. And yet when all is done, <hi>a Proposition very false</hi> might be <hi>as true</hi> as this which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> speaks of, <hi>viz. That the Pope when he teacheth the whole Church in matters of Faith cannot erre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have cleared that there can be no ground of an imputation of <hi>Schism</hi> on our <hi>Church</hi> from hence, that the <hi>Roman Church is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> which acception of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> I have manifested to be as great a stranger to <hi>Antiquity</hi> as it is an enemy to <hi>Reason:</hi> And that the calling the <hi>Roman Church</hi> the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is (as his Lordship truly saith) <hi>a meer Novelty</hi> and <hi>perfect Jesuitism.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. Protestants no Schismaticks.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Schism a culpable separation; therefore the Question of Schism, must be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by enquiring into the causes of it. The plea from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s being once a right Church, considered. No necessity of assigning the punctual time when errours crept into her. An account why the originals of errours seem obscure. By <hi>Stapleton</hi>'s confession, the <hi>Roman</hi> and Catholick Church were not the same. The falsity of that assertion manifested, That there could be no pure Church since the Apostles times, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were corrupt. No one particular Church free from corruptions; yet no sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the Catholick Church. How far the Catholick Church may be said to erre. Men may have distinct communion from any one particular Church, yet not separate from the Catholick Church. The Testimony of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus de Alliaco</hi> vindicated. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> not mis-cited. <hi>Almain</hi> full to his Lordships purpose. The <hi>Romanists</hi> guilty of the present Schism, and not Protestants. In what sense there can be no just cause of Schism; and how far that concerns our case. Protestants did not depart from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but were thrust out of it. The Vindication of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from Schism, at last depends upon the two false Principles, Of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and being the Catholick Church. The Testimonies of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi> not to the purpose. The Catalogue of Fundamentals, the Churches not erring, &amp;c. referr'd back to their proper places.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note>BEfore I come to examine the particulars of this Chapter, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to see, what the state of the Controversie was, concerning Schism, between his Lordship and his Adversary. His Lordship delivers his sense clearly and fully in these words;<note place="margin">P. 133. sect. 21. n. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Tis too true indeed, that there is a miserable rent in the Church, and I make no question but the best men do most bemoan it; nor is he a Christian that would not have Vnity, might he have it with Truth. But, I never said, nor thought, that the Protestants made this rent. The cause of the Schism is yours; for you thrust us from you, because we call'd for truth, and redress of abuses. For a Schism must needs be theirs, whose the cause of it is. The woe runs full out of the mouth of Christ ever against him that gives the offence; not against him that takes it ever.</hi> And in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, shewing <hi>that a separation may sometimes be necessary,</hi> he instanceth in <hi>the orthodox departing from the communion of the</hi> Arrians: upon which he sayes; <hi>It cannot be that a man should do well in making a Schism. There may be therefore a necessary separation, which yet incurrs not the guilt of Schism; and that is, when Doctrines are taught contrary to the Catholick Faith.</hi> And after saith, <hi>The Protestants did not depart: for, departure is voluntary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 135. n. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>so was not theirs; I say not theirs, taking their whole body and cause together. For, that some among them were peevish, and some ignorantly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, is neither to be doubted, nor is there danger in confessing it. Your body is not so perfect (I wot well) but that many amongst you are as pettish and as ignorantly zealous as any of ours. You must not suffer for these, nor we for those,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 136, n. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>nor should the Church of Christ for either.</hi> And when <hi>A. C.</hi> saith, <hi>That though the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did thrust the Protestants from her by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, yet they had first divided themselves by obstinate holding and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opinions contrary to the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith.</hi> His Lordship answers, <hi>So then
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:101069:174"/>
in his Opinion, Excommunication on their part was not the prime cause of this division, but the holding and teaching of contrary Opinions. Why but then in my opinion</hi> (saith he) <hi>that holding and teaching was not the prime cause nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the corruptions and superstitions of</hi> Rome, <hi>which forced many men to hold and teach the contrary: So, the prime cause was theirs still.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 142. n. 6.</note> And <hi>A. C.</hi> telling him, <hi>That he said that it was ill done of those who first made the separation.</hi> He answers, <hi>That though he remembred not that he said those words; yet withall adds, If I did not say it then, I do say it now; and most true it is, That it was ill done of those, whoere they were, who first made the separation. But then</hi> A. C. <hi>must not understand me of Actual only, but of Causal separation. For (as I said before) the Schism is theirs, whose the cause of it is: and he makes the separation that gives the first just cause of it; not he that makes an actual separation upon a just cause preceding. And this is so evident a Truth, that</hi> A. C. <hi>cannot deny it, for he sayes it is most true.</hi> These passages I have laid together, that the Reader may clearly understand the full state of this great Controversie concerning <hi>Schism</hi>; the upshot of which, is, that it is agreed between both parties, that all separation from communion with a <hi>Church,</hi> doth not involve in it the guilt of <hi>Schism,</hi> but only such a separation as hath no sufficient <hi>cause</hi> or <hi>ground</hi> for it. So that the Question comes to this, Whether your <hi>Church</hi> were not guilty of such errours and corruptions, as gave sufficient cause for such a separation. The Question being thus stated, we now come to consider how you make good your part in it.</p>
               <p>Your first pretence is (if reduced into argument,<note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> for you seem to have a particular <hi>pique</hi> against a close way of disputing) <hi>That your Church is a right and orthodox Church, and therefore could never give any just cause of separation from it.</hi> For the Lady asked (as <hi>A. C.</hi> would have it) <hi>Whether the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was not the right Church; not, be not, but, was not</hi>; that is, relating to the times, before the breach was made.<note place="margin">P. 131. n. 5.</note> Now his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship tells him, <hi>That as to the terms he might take his choice; For the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>neither is, nor was the right Church, as the Lady desired to hear. A particular Church it is, and was, and in some times right, and in some times wrong: but the right Church, or the Holy Catholick Church, it never was, nor ever can be. And therefore was not such before</hi> Luther <hi>and others left it, or were thrust from it. A particular Church it was; but then</hi> A. C. <hi>is not distinct enough here neither. For the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>both was, and was not a right or orthodox Church before</hi> Luther <hi>made a breach from it. For the word</hi> ante, <hi>before, may look upon</hi> Rome, <hi>and that Church a great way off, or long before; and then in the prime times of it, it was a most right and orthodox Church. But it may look also nearer home, and upon the immediate times before</hi> Luther, <hi>or some ages before that: and then in those times</hi> Rome <hi>was a corrupt and tainted Church, far from being Right. And yet both these times, before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>made his breach.</hi> And so he concludes that Section with this clause, <hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>Church which was once right, is now become wrong, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing superstition and errour.</hi> And what say you now to all this? Two things you have to return in answer to it, or at least to these two all that you say may be reduced. 1. <hi>That if the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was right once, it is so still.</hi> 2. <hi>That if the</hi> Roman <hi>Church were wrong before</hi> Luther, <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church was so too.</hi> These two containing all that is said in this case, must be more particularly discussed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That if the</hi> Roman <hi>was the right Church, it still is so,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 142.</note> 
                  <hi>seeing no change can be shewn in her Doctrine. If there have been a change, let it appear when,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:101069:175"/>
and in what the change was made.</hi> Thus you say: but you know his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship never granted, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ever was <hi>the right Church</hi> (in the sense you take those words for the <hi>true Catholick Church</hi>;) that it was once a <hi>right particular Church</hi> he acknowledged, and as such was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards tainted with errours and corruptions. If so, <hi>you desire to know what these were,</hi> and <hi>when they came in</hi>; to the former I shall reserve an Answer till I come to the third part of my task, where you shall have an account of them; to the latter, <hi>the time when these came in,</hi> because this is so much insisted on by your party, I shall return you an Answer in this place. And that I shall do in these following Propositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Nothing can be more unreasonable, than to deny, that errours and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions have come into a Church, meerly because the punctual time of their coming in cannot be assigned.</hi> For, Will any one question the birth of an Infant, because he cannot know the time of his conception? Will any one deny there are tares in the field, because he did not see them sown? and our Saviour hath told us,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.25.</note> That the <hi>time of sowing tares by the enemy, was, when the men were asleep.</hi> So we say, The errours and corruptions of your <hi>Church</hi> came in, in a time of great <hi>Ignorance,</hi> when little notice was taken of them, and few records preserved of those times and all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of them. Since Learning and Religion commonly decay and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish together, How is it possible there should be as exact an account given of the decay of Religion, as of the flourishing of it? Besides, Are there not many things you judge errours and corruptions your selves, which you can give no account when they first entred into the <hi>Church?</hi> As the necessity of communicating Infants; name us the person who first broached that Doctrine, and the time in which it was first received in the Church? That no souls of men departed, shall see <hi>God</hi> till the day of resurrection, is, I suppose, with you, an errour; yet it would puzzle you to find out the first Authour of it. So for the rebaptizing Hereticks, and many things of a like nature, it is easier to shew, when they appeared publickly, than when they first came into the Church. And as evident is it, in the decay of the primitive Discipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> the altering the <hi>orders</hi> of <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> and the <hi>rites</hi> belonging to them, the leaving of the <hi>communicatory Letters</hi> between <hi>Churches,</hi> and many other customes of the <hi>Church</hi> grown into disuse; and yet I suppose you will not presume to name the persons who first altered the former orders of the <hi>Church</hi>; and methinks, this is as reasonable as the naming the punctual time when other corruptions came in. If you say, the primitive <hi>Discipline</hi> decayed gradually and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly; so say I, that the <hi>Churches</hi> corruptions came in as the other went out, in the same gradual and insensible manner; and if you cannot name the precise time of the one, it is not reasonable you should expect the other from us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We may have sufficient reason to judge what are errours and corruptions in a Church, though we cannot fix on the time when they came in:</hi> Which is, by comparing them with that Rule of Faith which is delivered down by an interrupted tradition to us, and with the practice of the first <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> What is apparently contrary to either of these, we have reason to reject, though we cannot determine when it first came in. For as long as these are our certain <hi>standards,</hi> it matters not who first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them, as long as we see that they have departed. But when we own an absolute and infallible Rule of Faith and manners, to question, Whether any thing contrary to it, be an errour or no, because we cannot
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:101069:175"/>
tell when it first began, would be, as if the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> when they saw their Land overflowed by the <hi>Nile,</hi> should question, Whether it were so or no, because they could not find out the head of <hi>Nilus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They who assert their Doctrines and Practices to be Apostolical, are bound to shew the continued succession of them from the Apostles times.</hi> And if they fail in this, upon their own principles, they must be <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>corruptions,</hi> though the <hi>punctual time</hi> of their first obtaining in the Church, cannot be set down. Since therefore you <hi>affirm,</hi> you are bound to <hi>prove.</hi> If you say, The judgement of your <hi>Church</hi> being infallible, you need prove no more than that. I answer, you must prove that this <hi>Infallibility</hi> then, hath been ever received in the <hi>Church</hi>; but if there be not the least footstep of it in the records of the ancient <hi>Church,</hi> we justly look on this as an <hi>errour</hi> of the <hi>first magnitude,</hi> though we cannot tell you the minute of its <hi>first ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>We have sufficient evidence from your selves, that many Doctrines and Practices are owned by you, which are of no great antiquity in the Christian Church.</hi> Thus, by the confession of <hi>Scotus, Transubstantiation</hi> is no elder than the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran, Purgatory</hi> not much heard of in the primitive <hi>Church</hi> by the acknowledgement of <hi>Bishop Fisher, Communion</hi> in <hi>one kind</hi> confessed by most to be contrary to the primitive practice and institution, <hi>Prayer in an unknown tongue</hi> can be no elder than the general disuse of the <hi>Latin tongue</hi> in the <hi>Roman Provinces.</hi> And so for many others, for which we have the confessions of your own party; but I need not insist upon that, since your very Doctrine of the <hi>Churches</hi> power to declare matters of Faith, may make things <hi>necessary</hi> in one <hi>Age,</hi> which were not in a foregoing, and, in that case, sure it is no great difficulty to tell you, when some things of <hi>School-points</hi> became <hi>necessary Doctrines</hi>; but then the Question goes off from the <hi>time</hi> to the <hi>matter,</hi> Whether any thing declared by your <hi>Church</hi> can be an errour: but of that, enough hath been said already.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>There may be a sufficient account given, why the beginnings of errours and corruptions in your Church have been so obscure; because</hi> they came not in all of a sudden, but some at one time, some at another, <hi>because</hi> they rise gradually, as is apparent in <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images, because</hi> many of those things which ended in great <hi>corruptions,</hi> were taken up at first out of good designs, to win more upon the <hi>Gentile</hi> world, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> many things were at first practised <hi>freely,</hi> which afterwards were ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as <hi>necessary; because Barbarism</hi> came into the <hi>Church</hi> along with these <hi>corruptions; because</hi> many who gave occasion to them, were persons of great esteem in their age, and others strove to follow their example more than the Rule; <hi>because</hi> the state of the <hi>Church</hi> did very much alter from it self in several ages, which altered mens apprehensions and judgements of things, in regard of their suitableness and necessity; <hi>because</hi> those persons who brought in, and contended for these things, were the persons chiefly in power then in the <hi>Church,</hi> which hindered their being cast out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as others had been; <hi>because</hi> a long time most of these errours and corruptions, were but the private opinions and practices of a faction, though then the more prevalent in the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore not so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently opposed in the first <hi>rise</hi> of them, as when this imposthumated mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was grown to a head, and then there was a necessity of lancing it. These, and several other reasons might be given, why the first <hi>originals</hi> of <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>corruptions</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> cannot with so much clearness be manifested, as that they were errours and corruptions: Although such,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:101069:176"/>
who would take the pains to travel in an argument of that nature, might with very great probability, trace the most both of your errours and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to the time and age, when they were first publickly owned and received. But thus much may here suffice as to your demand, <hi>That if your Church be not the same she was, we should mention the time, when the change was made.</hi> As though <hi>Chronical</hi> distempers could not be known, unless we could set down the punctual <hi>time</hi> of their first <hi>on-set.</hi> The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers of your <hi>Church</hi> are <hi>Hectical,</hi> I wish not in that respect, that <hi>they are seldome fully discovered, till they be incurable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You answer, <hi>That if your Church hath erred, the Catholick Church hath done so too</hi>;<note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> for which you say two things. 1. <hi>That in this dispute the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church, and the Catholick Church, are all one.</hi> 2. <hi>That then there was no one visible Church untainted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 142. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>uncorrupt, right, orthodox throughout the whole world.</hi> 1. You learnedly tell us, <hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>and Catholick Church are all one in this dispute,</hi> and most discreetly tell his Lordship, <hi>That he beggs the Question in supposing the contrary</hi>; but you know whose arts those are to charge their neighbours with that, they were sure to be told of themselves, if the other had spoke first. But very worthily you prove this, from D. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> who offers to confirm his assertion by that which overthrows yours. He sayes, <hi>That amongst the Ancients, the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and the Catholick Church were taken for the same, and his reason is, because the communion of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was most certainly and evidently with the whole Catholick.</hi> And, Can any thing then be more plain, than that the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholick Church</hi> were not the same? For, Can any thing be the measure of it self? If it were therefore <hi>Catholick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> agreeing with the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> then it was not <hi>causally the Catholick Church,</hi> but only by way of communion and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If I should say, That a man and a living-creature, are the same, and should give this reason for it, Because man agrees in every thing with the nature of a living creature; doth this imply, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal notion of man, and a living-creature, are the same? or only that man partakes so much of the properties of a living creature, that he may well receive the denomination? So it is here with the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that might well be called <hi>Catholick</hi> by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> because it did partake of the properties of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but not as though the <hi>formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of a <hi>Churches</hi> being <hi>Catholick,</hi> came from partaking of communion with the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; as you assert, wherein you are diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>Stapleton,</hi> for he makes the reason, why the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> to be, Because it had communion with the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> By which it is evident, that the notion of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> was much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than that of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> Besides, <hi>Stapleton</hi> only saith, <hi>That the Ancients thought so,</hi> and surely they thought so only of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> of their own time; which might then have certain communion with the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and yet not have so in the next age ensuing; therefore, though the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> continue ever the same, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, it will by no means follow, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> must do so too. Whatever <hi>A. C.</hi> or you understand by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is not, as you elsewhere phrase it, a <hi>straws matter,</hi> unless you proved better than you have done, that the proper notion of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> is the same with <hi>those who agree with the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in Doctrine and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> Which is your fundamental mistake, and a thing you would fain have taken for granted, without the least shadow of a solid proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:101069:176"/>But there may be more force in your second Answer, <hi>That if the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church were wrong and corrupted, it follows, that not only for some time,</hi>

                  <hi>but for many ages before</hi> Luther, <hi>yea even up to the Apostles times, there was no one visible Church untainted, uncorrupt, right, orthodox throughout the whole world.</hi> It were worth our while to know what you mean by <hi>no one Visible Church</hi>; Do you think there are, or may be, more <hi>Visible Churches</hi> than one, taking the <hi>Visible Church</hi> in its proper sense for the <hi>Catholick Visible Church?</hi> If this be your meaning in general, how unhappily soever it be expressed, <hi>viz. that then it follows, there could be no Visible Church at all with whom we might have communion</hi>; I see not how it is proved by what you bring: But if this be all you aim at (for no further your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will carry you) that there was <hi>no one Visible Church untainted,</hi> i. e. <hi>no one Church of a distinct communion from other Churches</hi> altogether free from errour; I see no such dangerous consequence in the owning it. But if it were so, when <hi>Luther</hi> began to oppose the <hi>corruptions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> How doth it follow that it must be so <hi>even up to the Apostles times?</hi> But we ought to see, how you prove your assertion. <hi>For if in all those Ages the</hi> Roman <hi>Church were wrong, corrupted, and tainted; and all those likewise that disagreed from her,</hi> viz. Hussites, Albigenses, Waldenses, Wicklevites, Greeks, Abyssins, Armenians, &amp;c. <hi>had in them corrupt Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine during those ages (as 'tis certain they had, neither could the Relator de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it) I say, If the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was thus corrupt; it follows, that not only for some time, but for many ages before</hi> Luther, <hi>yea even up to the Apostles times, there was no one Visible Church untainted, incorrupt, right, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, throughout the whole world. And consequently, that during the said ages, every good Christian was in conscience obliged in some point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian belief or other, to contradict the Doctrine, and desert the communion of all Visible Churches in the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whence it would further follow, that Schism or separation from the external communion of the whole Church might be not only lawful, but even necessary; which is impossible, as being contrary to the very essential predicates of Schism, which is defined to be, A voluntary or wilful departure (such as no just cause, or reason, can be given of it) from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the whole Church.</hi> Three things this discourse of yours may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into. 1. <hi>That if in</hi> Luthers <hi>time the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was corrupt, then there was no one Visible Church uncorrupt.</hi> 2. <hi>That if so, it follows that there was none uncorrupt even up to the Apostles times.</hi> 3. <hi>That if there were no one Visible Church uncorrupt, then it was necessary to separate from the external communion of the whole Church.</hi> To every one of these I shall return a peculiar and distinct Answer. To the <hi>first</hi> I say, That the utmost you can prove from hence, is, That there was <hi>no one Church of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct communion from others,</hi> which was free from all errours. And what great absurdity is there in saying so? Unless you could prove, that there must be <hi>some one Church</hi> in all ages of the world, which must be free from all kind or possibility of errour. And when you have done this, I shall acknowledge it absurd to say the contrary; but otherwise that very sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position seems to have the greater absurdity in it; because it restrains the utmost supposable priviledges of the <hi>truly Catholick Church,</hi> to a <hi>particular Church of some one denomination.</hi> What then if we grant that in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, there was <hi>no one Visible Church</hi> free from errours and corruptions? What if we should say, in our own times? What if, in elder times? For that which is possible to be, may be supposed actually in any time. If it be possible for one particular <hi>Church</hi> to fall into <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>corruptions,</hi> Why is it not for another? (unless some particular priviledge of <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:101069:177"/>
be pretended; but that is not our present Question) if it be possible for every <hi>particular Church</hi> to fall into <hi>errour,</hi> Why may not that possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity come into act in one <hi>Age,</hi> as well as several? Is there any promise that there shall be a succession and course of erring in <hi>Churches,</hi> that one <hi>Church</hi> must erre for one age, and another for the next? but that it shall never fall out, that by any means whatsoever they shall erre toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If there be no such promise to the contrary, the reason of the thing will hold, that they may all erre at the same time. <hi>No,</hi> say you, <hi>for then it would follow, that the Catholick Church might erre.</hi> To that I answer, 1. Either you mean by that, that all societies in the <hi>Christian world</hi> may concurr in the same <hi>errour,</hi> or else that <hi>several</hi> of them may have several <hi>errours:</hi> and this latter is it only which you prove, for you do not suppose that the <hi>Romanists, Hussites, Albigenses, &amp;c.</hi> were all guilty of the same <hi>errours,</hi> but that these several <hi>societies</hi> were guilty of several <hi>errours</hi>; and therefore from hence it follows not, that they may all concurr in the same <hi>errour,</hi> which is the only way to prove that the <hi>Church as Catholick</hi> may erre, for otherwise you only prove, that the several particular <hi>Churches,</hi> which make up the <hi>Catholick,</hi> may fall into errour. 2. Supposing all these <hi>Churches</hi> should agree in one errour, (which is more than you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or, it may be, can) have you proved that they concurr in such an <hi>errour,</hi> which destroies the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> For you would do well to evince, that the Church is secured from any but such errours which destroy its Being; for the means of proving, That the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> cannot erre, are built on the promises of its <hi>perpetuity</hi>; now those can only prove that the <hi>Church</hi> is secured from <hi>Fundamental errours,</hi> for those are such only which destroy its Being. And so his Lordship tells you,<note place="margin">P. 139. sect 18. n. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That the whole Church cannot universally erre in the Doctrine of Faith, is most true, and granted by divers Protestants (so you will but understand its not erring in absolute Fundamental Doctrines)</hi> and this he proves, <hi>from that promise of Christ, That the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi> So that the <hi>Catholick Churche's</hi> not erring, and the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> do with us,<note place="margin">P. 141.</note> mean the same thing. For his Lordship grants, <hi>That she may erre in superstructures, and deductions, and other By, and Vnnecessary truths, if her curiosity, or other weakness, carry her beyond, or cause her to fall short of her Rule.</hi> There is then a great difference between saying, <hi>That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church cannot erre,</hi> which is no more than to say, <hi>That there shall be alwaies a Catholick Church,</hi> and saying, <hi>That there must be alwaies some one Visible Church,</hi> which must be free from all errour and corruption. For this we deny, and you produce no reason at all to prove it. Granting, that all particular <hi>Churches,</hi> whether of <hi>Romanists, Greeks,</hi> or others, are subject to errours and corruptions, we assert no more of them, than you grant your selves, that any <hi>particular Church</hi> is subject to; for the only ground, why you would have your <hi>Church</hi> exempt from errour, is, the supposing her not to be a <hi>particular,</hi> but the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which implies, that if she were only <hi>a particular Church</hi> (as she is no more) she might be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>errours</hi> as well as other <hi>Churches.</hi> And what incongruity then there is in asserting, that there may be <hi>no one Visible Church</hi> of any particular <hi>denomination</hi> free from all errour and corruption, I cannot understand.</p>
               <p>But further, you say, <hi>If there were no one Visible Church then free from errour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>it follows, not only for some time, but for many ages before</hi> Luther, <hi>yea even up to the Apostles times, there was no one Visible Church untainted throughout the whole world.</hi> Not to meddle with the truth of the thing, Whether there were so or no, the consequence is that, we are now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:101069:177"/>
that if it were so in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, it must be so <hi>even up to the Apostles times.</hi> The proof of which depends upon the impossibility of a <hi>Churches</hi> degeneracy in Faith or Manners, and so supposeth the thing in question, that there must be some <hi>one Visible Church</hi> absolutely exempt from all impossibility of errour. For otherwise that might be <hi>true</hi> in one <hi>age,</hi> which might not in another. For although we say, that particular <hi>Churches</hi> may erre, and be corrupt, we do not say, that it is necessary they should alwaies be so. For, in some ages particular <hi>Churches</hi> may be free from errour and corruption, and yet in another age be overspread with them. And thus we assert it to have been with the <hi>Roman Church</hi>: for his Lordship saith, <hi>In the prime times it was a most right and orthodox Church, but in the immediate times before.</hi> Luther, <hi>or in some ages before, that it was a corrupt and tainted Church:</hi> And so in those times in which it was right, those might be <hi>heretical</hi> who did not communicate with it, not meerly because they did not communicate with it, but because in not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with <hi>a right and orthodox Church</hi> they shewed themselves guilty of some <hi>errour</hi> or <hi>corruption.</hi> We see then, there is no connexion in the world in the parts of your consequence, <hi>That if it were so at one time, it must be so alwaies; if in the time of</hi> Luther, <hi>it must be so even up to the Apostles times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. From hence you say it will follow, <hi>That it will be necessary to separate from the external communion of the whole Church.</hi> I answer, there can be no separation from <hi>the whole Church,</hi> but in such things wherein the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>whole Church</hi> lyes; for <hi>separation</hi> is a violation of some <hi>Vnion:</hi> now when men separate from the <hi>errours</hi> of all particular <hi>Churches,</hi> they do not separate from <hi>the whole,</hi> because those things which one separates from those particular <hi>Churches</hi> for, are not such, as make all them put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be the <hi>whole,</hi> or <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> This must be somewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explained. There are two things considerable in all particular <hi>Churches</hi>; those things which belong to it as <hi>a Church,</hi> and those things which belong to it as <hi>a particular Church.</hi> Those things which belong to it <hi>as a Church,</hi> are the common <hi>ligaments</hi> or grounds of union between all particular <hi>Churches,</hi> which taken together, make up the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> Those things which belong to it <hi>as a particular Church,</hi> are such as it may retain the essence of a <hi>Church</hi> without. Now, I say, Whosoever separates from any particular <hi>Church</hi> (much more from all) for such things without which that can be no <hi>Church,</hi> separates from the communion of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi>; but he that separates only from particular <hi>Churches</hi> as to such things which concern not their <hi>Being,</hi> is only separated from the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of those <hi>Churches,</hi> and not the <hi>Catholick.</hi> And therefore, supposing that all particular <hi>Churches</hi> have some errours and corruptions in them, though I should separate from <hi>them all,</hi> I do not separate from the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> unless it be for something, without which those could be no <hi>Churches.</hi> An evidence of which, is, that by my decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the grounds of my separation to be such <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>corruptions,</hi> which are crept into the communion of such <hi>Churches,</hi> and imposed on me in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, I withall declare my readiness to joyn with them again, if those errours and corruptions be left out. And where there is this readiness of <hi>communion,</hi> there is no absolute separation from the <hi>Church</hi> as such, but only <hi>suspending communion</hi> till such abuses be reformed. Which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more properly a <hi>separation</hi> from the <hi>errours,</hi> than the <hi>communion</hi> of such a <hi>Church.</hi> Wherefore if we suppose that there is <hi>no one Visible Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:101069:178"/>
whose communion is not tainted with some corruptions, though, if these <hi>corruptions</hi> be injoyned as conditions of communion, I cannot communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with any of those <hi>Churches,</hi> yet it follows not that I am separated from the <hi>external communion of the Catholick Church,</hi> but that I only <hi>suspend communion</hi> with those particular <hi>Churches,</hi> till I may safely joyn with them. As, suppose all the particular men I can converse with, were infected with <hi>Leprosie,</hi> my not associating with them, doth not imply that I am separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the communion of all <hi>mankind,</hi> but that I am loath to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as they are, and therefore withdraw my self till I can meet with such healthful persons with whom I may safely associate again. And if se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other persons be of the same mind with me, and we therefore joyn together, Do we therefore divide our selves from the whole world by on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking care of our own safety? And especially if any company of such leprous persons should resolve that none should live among them, but such as would eat of those meats which brought that distemper upon them; our withdrawing our selves, and associating without them will still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more reasonable and commendable. Therefore we say, We do not necessarily separate from all <hi>Churches</hi> that have <hi>errours</hi> or corruptions in them, supposing those errours and corruptions be not <hi>imposed</hi> on us, as <hi>conditions</hi> of <hi>communion</hi>; and thence though we should grant, <hi>No one visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church</hi> free from taint or corruption, yet it is not necessary we should separate from them all: For we may lawfully joyn in Communion with <hi>Churches</hi> having errours and corruptions, if our joyning be not an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them. Thus though the <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Albigenses, Abyssms</hi> may have some errours, or corruptions, yet if they be not Fundamental, and be not injoyned as necessary to be approved in order to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, notwithstanding them, we may lawfully Communicate with them. It doth not then at all follow, that if there may be <hi>no one visible Church</hi> free from errour and corruption, it would be necessary to separate from the <hi>Communion of the Catholick Church:</hi> because 1. All those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Churches</hi> may not make those errours conditions of Communion. 2. Though they did, we separate not from them as <hi>Catholick,</hi> but as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and erroneous <hi>particular Churches.</hi> And therefore you might have spared your labour in telling us from the <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> and the Reverend and learned Dr. <hi>Hammond, That it can never be lawful to separate from the Catholick Church,</hi> for we assert the same, but have made it appear that it follows not from the premises which were laid down.</p>

                  <note place="margin">P. 143.</note> 
                  <hi>but of Schisms and Heresies raised against the Church (not fostered by her) in all parts of Christendom.</hi> But I appeal to any indifferent Reader of this Testimony, whether he can conceive that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> intended to acquit or accuse the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in those words of his. For taking them in your sense, they must contain a high <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:101069:178"/>
of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that in the midst of so many <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> raised against her, she preserved her Faith entire; and think you that he that said, The <hi>Church of God</hi> needed reformation, thought there was nothing in the <hi>Church</hi> which stood in need of it? And therefore this Testimony doth sufficiently prove that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was a tainted and corrupted <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be sufficient evidence, <hi>that there are tares sown in the Church of</hi> Rome, it is not to much purpose to enquire Whether they were sown <hi>while the Bishops slept,</hi> or whether <hi>they themselves did not help to sow them.</hi> But it seems <hi>in their private capacities they might sow them, as private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> and then it is not likely that in their publick capacity they would pluck them up. <hi>If the Catholick Faith only,</hi> as you tell us, <hi>oblige us to maintain that the Pope is Infallible when he defines a General Council</hi>; then there will be opportunity enough for errours to be sown, and grow up in the interval of such definitions. But you further add, <hi>That though this be all which men are obliged to maintain</hi> (for no man can be bound to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities) <hi>yet that it is a very pious opinion to hold, That no Popes have personally erred as private Doctors, i. e.</hi> you have a very good mind to maintain it, if you knew how; for that is the meaning of your pious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if you thought it had been defensible, no doubt it had been <hi>de fide</hi> long ago. But it was hard thwarting the Records of former ages wherein the <hi>errours</hi> of <hi>Popes,</hi> and their mutual contradictions are so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all that search after them, and therefore it was wisely concluded that this should not be held <hi>de fide,</hi> but, if any would venture upon a thing so acceptable at <hi>Rome</hi> as Personal Infallibility is, it should be accounted a very <hi>pious</hi> undertaking. And accordingly <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est care and industry endeavoured it in several Chapters; but, as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship truly saith, <hi>All</hi> Bellarmin's <hi>labour though great and full of art, is not able to wash them clean.</hi> And this (if you had undertaken the defence of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>) should have been made good; but since you are so cautious as not to think your self obliged to do it, I commend your discretion in it, and proceed. I cannot see that his Lordship is guilty of a false quotation of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for that saying, <hi>Et Papas quosdam graves errores semin√¢sse in Ecclesi√¢ Christi, luce clarius est,</hi> for he doth not seem at all to Cite <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for it; but having Cited the place just before, where he endeavours to vindicate the <hi>Popes</hi> from all <hi>errours</hi>; he adds this expression, as directly contrary to his design, that though he had endeavoured so much to clear them from errours, yet that they had sown some grievous errours in the <hi>Church</hi> was as clear as the day; and as it immediately follows is proved by <hi>Jac. Almain,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore it was only your own oscitancy which made you set it in the Contents of your Chapter, <hi>that Cardinal</hi> Bellarmin <hi>was most falsly quoted by him.</hi> But that falseness which with so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence you charge his Lordship with, rebounds with greater force on your self, when you say, <hi>That</hi> Almain <hi>speaks not of errours in Faith at all, but only of errours, or rather abuses in point of manners</hi>; whereas he not only asserts but largely proves, <hi>That the Pope may err, not only personally but judicially,</hi>

               <p>The case of the <hi>Schism</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> between <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatianus,</hi> and the imployment of <hi>Caldonius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> from St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> thither,<note place="margin">N. 3.</note> doth belong to the former Chapter, where it hath been fully discoursed of already, and must not be repeated here.

greatest <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in the world. Would you look on it as sufficiently proved because we asserted it? I pray think the same of us, for we are not apt to think our selves guilty of <hi>Schism</hi> at all the more, because you tell us what <hi>your assertion is</hi>; if this be your way of dealing with us, your <hi>first assertion</hi> had need be, That you are Infallible; but still that had need be more then asserted, for unless it be Infallibly proved we should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.

                  <hi>by their obstinate and pertinacious maintaining erroneous Doctrines, contrary to the Faith of the Roman or Catholick Church: by their rejecting the Authority of their lawful Ecclesiastical Superiours both immediate and mediate; by aggregating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into a separate body or company of pretended Christians, independent of any Pastours at all, that were in lawful and quiet possession of jurisdiction over them; by making themselves Pastours and Teachers of others, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Sacraments without Authority given them by any that were lawfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our assertion therefore is, that the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are guilty of this <hi>Schism,</hi> by obtruding erroneous Doctrines and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious practises, as the conditions of her <hi>Communion</hi>; by adding such <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> which are contrary to the plain rule of Faith, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the sense of the truly <hi>Catholick</hi> and not the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; by her intolerable incroachments and usurpations upon the liberties and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of particular <hi>Churches,</hi> under a vain pretence of <hi>Vniversal Pastour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>; by forcing men if they would not damn their souls by sinning against their consciences in approving the errours and corruptions of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> to joyn together for the Solemn Worship of <hi>God</hi> according to the rule of <hi>Scripture</hi> and practise of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>; and suspending Communion with that <hi>Church</hi> till those abuses and corruptions be redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. In which they neither deny obedience to any Lawful <hi>Authority</hi> over them, nor take to themselves any other Power than the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath given them, receiving their Authority in a constant Succession from the <hi>Apostles:</hi> they institute no Rites and Ceremonies either contrary to, or different from the practise of the Primitive <hi>Church</hi>; they neither exclude or dispossess others of their Lawful Power, but in case others neglect their office, they may be notwithstanding obliged to perform theirs in order to the <hi>Churches Reformation.</hi> Leaving the <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or <hi>Nation</hi> to order and dispose of such things in the <hi>Church</hi> which of right appertain unto it.

And you truly say, <hi>That Protestants were thrust out of your Church</hi>; which
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:101069:180"/>
is an Argument they did not voluntarily forsake the Communion of it, and therefore are no <hi>Schismaticks</hi>; but your carriage and practises were such as forced them to joyn together in a distinct Communion from you. And it was not we who left your <hi>Church,</hi> but your <hi>Church</hi> that left her Primitive Faith and Purity in so high a manner, as to declare all such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate who will not approve of and joyn in her greatest corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though it be sufficiently manifest that they are great recessions from the Faith, Piety, and Purity of that <hi>Roman Church</hi> which was planted by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and had so large a commendation from the Apostolical men of those first ages. Since then such errours and corruptions are enforced upon us as conditions of Communion with you, by the same reason that the <hi>Orthodox</hi> did very well in departing from the <hi>Arrians,</hi> because the <hi>Arrians</hi> were already departed from the <hi>Church</hi> by their false Doctrine; will our separation from you be justified who first departed from the Faith and Purity of the Primitive <hi>Church</hi>; and not only so, but thrust out of your <hi>Communion</hi> all such as would not depart from it as farr as you.</p>
               <p>Having thus considered and retorted your Assertions, we come to your Answers.<note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Nor</hi> (say you) <hi>does the Bishop vindicate the Protestant party, by saying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 145.</note> 
                  <hi>The cause of Schism was ours, and that we Catholicks thrust Protestants from us, because they call'd for truth and redress of abuses. For first, there can be no just cause of Schism; this hath been granted already even by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</hi> And so it is by us, and the reason is very evident for it, for if there be a <hi>just cause,</hi> there can be no <hi>Schism</hi>; and therefore what you intend by this, I cannot imagine, unless it be to free <hi>Protestants</hi> from the guilt of <hi>Schism,</hi> because they put the Main of their tryal upon the justice of the <hi>cause</hi> which moved them to forsake the Communion of your <hi>Church</hi>; or else you would have it taken for granted that ours was a <hi>Schism,</hi> and thence inferr there could be no just <hi>cause</hi> of it. As if a man being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for taking away the life of one who violently set upon him in the High-way with an intent both to rob and destroy him, should plead for himself that this could be no murther in him, because there was a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and justifiable cause for what he did; that he designed nothing but to go quietly on his road; that this person and several others violently set upon him; that he intreated them to desist, that he sought to avoid them as much as he could, but when he saw they were absolutely bent on his ruine, he was forced in his own necessary defence to take away the life of that person; Would not this with any intelligent Jury be looked on as a just and reasonable Vindication? But if so wise a person as your self had been among them, you would no doubt have better informed them; for you would very gravely have told them, All his plea went on a false supposition, that he had a <hi>just cause</hi> for what he did, but there could be <hi>no just cause for murther.</hi> Do you not see now how subtil and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent your Answer is here, by this parallel to it? For as in that case all men grant that there can be <hi>no just cause for murther,</hi> because all murther is committed without a just cause; and if there be one, it ceaseth to be murther: So it is here in <hi>Schism,</hi> which being a <hi>causeless separation</hi> from the <hi>Churches Vnity,</hi> I wonder who ever imagined there could be <hi>just cause</hi> for it. But to rectifie such gross mistakes as these are for the future, you would do well to understand that <hi>Schism</hi> formally taken alwayes imports something criminal in it, and there can be no just cause for a <hi>sin</hi>; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, there is that which (if you understand it) you would call the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:101069:180"/>
                  <hi>materiality</hi> of it which is the <hi>separation</hi> of one part of the <hi>Church</hi> from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Now this, according to the different grounds and reasons of it, becomes <hi>lawful</hi> or <hi>unlawful,</hi> that is, as the reasons do make it necessary or unnecessary, For separation is not <hi>lawful</hi> but when it is <hi>necessary:</hi> now this being capable of such a different nature that it may be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> according to its circumstances, there can be no absolute judgement passed upon it, till all those reasons and circumstances be duely examined; and if there be no sufficient grounds for it, then it is <hi>formally Schism,</hi> i. e. a culpable separation; if there be sufficient <hi>cause,</hi> then there may be a <hi>separation,</hi> but it can be no <hi>Schism.</hi> And because the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> lyes in <hi>Fundamental</hi> and <hi>necessary truths,</hi> therefore there can be no separation absolutely from the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> but what involves in it the formal guilt of <hi>Schism</hi>; it being impossible any person should have just cause to disown the <hi>Churches</hi> Communion for any thing whose belief is necessary to salvation. And whosoever doth so, thereby makes himself no member of the <hi>Church,</hi> because the <hi>Church</hi> subsists on the belief of Fundamental truths. But in all such cases wherein a division may be made, and yet the several persons divided retain the <hi>essentials</hi> of a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church,</hi> the separation which may be among any such, must be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined according to the causes of it. For it being possible of one side, that men may out of capricious humours and fancies renounce the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a <hi>Church</hi> which requires nothing but what is just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and it being possible on the other side, that a <hi>Church</hi> calling her self <hi>Catholick</hi> may so far degenerate in Faith and practise, as not only to be guilty of great errours and corruptions, but to impose them as conditions of Communion with her, it is necessary where there is a manifest separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enquire into the reasons and grounds of it; and to determine the nature of it according to the justice of the cause which is pleaded for it. And this I hope may help you a little better to understand, what is meant by such, who say, <hi>There can be no just cause of Schism</hi>; and how little this makes for your purpose.</p>
               <p>But you go on and I must follow. <hi>And to his calling for truth,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, What Hereticks ever yet forsook the Church of God, but pretended truth, and complain'd they were thrust out, and hardly dealt with, meerly because they call'd for truth and redress of abuses?</hi> And I pray, what <hi>Church</hi> was ever so guilty of errours and corruptions, but would call those <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> who found fault with her Doctrine, or separated from her Communion? It is true, <hi>Hereticks pretend truth, and Schismaticks abuses,</hi> but is it possible there should be <hi>errours</hi> and corruptions in a <hi>Churches</hi> Communion, or is it not? if not, prove but that of your <hi>Church,</hi> and the cause is at an end; if it be, we are to examine whether the charge be true or no. For although <hi>Hereticks may pretend truth,</hi> and others be deceived in judging of it, yet doubtless there is a real difference between <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>errour.</hi> If you would never have men quarrel with any Doctrine of your <hi>Church</hi> because <hi>Hereticks have pretended truth:</hi> would not the same reason hold, why men should never enquire after <hi>Truth, Reason,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>men have pretended</hi> to them all which have not had them. It is therefore a most senseless cavil to say we have no reason <hi>to call for truth</hi> because <hi>Hereticks have done so</hi>; and on the same grounds you must not be call'd <hi>Catholicks</hi> because <hi>Hereticks</hi> have been call'd so. But those who have been <hi>Hereticks</hi> were first proved to be so, by making it appear that was a certain <hi>truth</hi> which they denyed; do you the same by us; prove
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:101069:181"/>
those which we call <hi>errours</hi> in your <hi>Church</hi> to be part of the <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick Faith</hi>; prove those we account <hi>corruptions,</hi> to be parts of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship,</hi> and we will give you leave to call us <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> but not before. <hi>But,</hi> say you, <hi>He should have reflected that the Church of God is stiled a City of Truth by the Prophet,</hi> (and so it may be, and yet your Church be a fortress of Errour) <hi>And a pillar and foundation of Truth by the Apostle,</hi> (but what is this to the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> being so) <hi>And by the Fathers, a rich depository or Treasury of all Divine and Heavenly Doctrines</hi> (so it was in the sense the Fathers took the <hi>Church</hi> in, for the <hi>truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christian Church</hi>). And we may use the same expressions still of the <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>Prophets, Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> did, and nevertheless charge your <hi>Church</hi> justly <hi>with the want of truth, and opposition to the preaching of it, and on that ground</hi> justly <hi>forsake her Communion,</hi> which is so far from being <hi>inexcusable impiety and presumption,</hi> that it was only the performance of a necessary Christian duty. And therefore that <hi>Woe of scandal,</hi> his Lordship mentioned, still returns upon your party who gave such just cause of offence to the <hi>Christian</hi> world, and making it necessary for all such as aimed at the purity of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> to leave your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when it could not be enjoyed without making shipwrack both of Faith and a good Conscience. <hi>And this is so clear and undeniable</hi> (to follow you still in your own language) that we dare appeal for a tryal of our cause <hi>to any Assembly of learned Divines,</hi> or what <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Jury</hi> you please, provided they be not some of the parties accused; and because you are so willing to have <hi>Learned Divines,</hi> I hope you will believe the last <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> so far, as not to mention the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals.</hi>

               <p>What follows in Vindication of <hi>A. C.</hi> from <hi>enterfeiring and shuffling in his words,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 146.</note> 
                  <hi>because timorous and tender consciences think they can never speak with caution enough, for fear of telling a lye,</hi> will have the force of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, (being spoken <hi>of</hi> and <hi>by</hi> a <hi>Jesuite</hi>) among all those who know what mortal haters they are of any thing that looks like a lye or aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And what reason there is that, of all persons in the world, they should be judged <hi>men of timorous and tender consciences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whatever the words were which passed, you justifie <hi>A. C.</hi> in saying, <hi>That the Protestants did depart from the Church of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and got the Name of Protestants by protesting against her. For this</hi> (say you) <hi>is so apparent that the whole world acknowledgeth it.</hi> If you mean that the Communion of <hi>Protestants</hi> is distinct from yours, Whoever made scruple of confessing it? But because in those terms of <hi>departing, leaving, forsaking</hi> your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you would seem to imply that it was a <hi>voluntary act</hi> and done without any necessary <hi>cause</hi> enforcing it, therefore his Lordship denyes <hi>that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants did depart; for,</hi> saith he, <hi>departure is voluntary so was not theirs.</hi> But because it is so hard a matter to explain the nature of that separation between your <hi>Church</hi> and Ours, especially in the beginning of it, without using those terms or some like them, as when his Lordship saith, <hi>that</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>made a breach from it.</hi> It is sufficient, that we declare that by none of these expressions we mean any <hi>causeless separation,</hi> but only such acts as were necessarily consequential to the imposing your errours and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as conditions of Communion with your <hi>Church.</hi> To the latter part his Lordship answers, <hi>That the Protestants did not get that name, by Protesting against the Church of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">P. 135. n. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>but by Protesting (and that when nothing else would serve) against her errours and superstitions. Do you but remove them from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp; our Protestation is ended and our Separation too.</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:101069:181"/>
This, you think, will be answered with our old put off, <hi>That it is the common pretext of all Hereticks, when they sever themselves from the</hi> Roman-<hi>Catholick Church.</hi> If your <hi>Church</hi> indeed were what she is not, the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> we might be what we are not, <hi>Hereticks:</hi> but think it not enough to prove us <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that you call us so, unless you will likewise take it for granted, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and your <hi>Church, the Whore of</hi> Babylon, because they are as often, and as confidently call'd so. And if your <hi>Church</hi> be truly so (as she is shrewdly suspected to be) Do you think she, and all her followers, would not as confidently call such as dissented from her, <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and the using those expressions of her <hi>virulent execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against her,</hi> as you do now, supposing her not to be so. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would belong to your <hi>Church,</hi> supposing her as bad as any <hi>Protestants</hi> imagine her to be, cannot certainly help to perswade us, that she is not so bad as she is. When you say still, That <hi>Protestants did really depart from the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and in so doing, remained separate from the whole Church</hi>; you very fairly beg the thing in dispute, and think us uncivil for denying it. You know not what that passage means, <hi>That the Protestants did not voluntarily depart, taking their whole body and cause together,</hi> since there is no obscurity in the expression, but a defect elsewhere, I can only say, That his Lordship was not bound to find you an <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> as oft as you want it. But it were an easie matter to help you; for it is plain, that he speaks those words to distinguish the <hi>common cause of Protestants,</hi> from the heats and irregularities of some <hi>particular persons,</hi> whom he did not intend to justifie, such as he saith, <hi>Were either peevish, or ignorantly zealous.</hi> And if you distinguish the sense of your <hi>Church</hi> from the judgements of particular persons, I hope it may be as lawful for us to distinguish <hi>the body and cause of Protestants</hi> from the inconsiderate <hi>actings</hi> of any <hi>particular men.</hi> All that which follows about the name of <hi>Protestants,</hi> which his Lordship saith, <hi>Took its rise, not from protesting simply against the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, but against the Edict at</hi> Worms, <hi>which was for the restoring all things to their former state, without any reformation,</hi> is so plain and evident, that nothing but a mind to cavil, and to give us the same things over and over,<note place="margin">P. 147.</note> could have made you stay longer upon it. For what else means, your talk of <hi>Innovation in matters of Religion</hi> (which we say, was caused by you) <hi>and protesting against the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and consequently against all particular Visible Churches in the world, and that which none but Hereticks and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks used to do?</hi> Do you think these passages are so hard, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know what they mean, unless we have them so often over? But they are not so hard to be understood, as to be believed, and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because we see you had rather <hi>say</hi> them <hi>often,</hi> than <hi>prove</hi> them <hi>once.</hi> If <hi>the Popes professed Reformation necessary as to many abuses,</hi> I hope they are not all <hi>Schismaticks</hi> who call for the redress of abuses in your <hi>Church.</hi> But, if all the Reformation we are to expect of them, be that, which you say, <hi>was effectually ordained by the Council of</hi> Trent, if there had not been an <hi>Edict</hi> at <hi>Worms,</hi> there were the <hi>Decrees</hi> of that <hi>Council</hi> which would have made a <hi>Protestation necessary.</hi> Although we think your <hi>Church</hi> needs <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in Manners and Discipline,</hi> as much as any in the world, yet those are not the <hi>abuses</hi> mainly insisted on by the <hi>Protestants,</hi> as the grounds of their <hi>Separation,</hi> and therefore his Lordship ought to be understood, of a <hi>Reformation as to the errours and corruptions of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church</hi>; and doubtless that <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Worms</hi> which was for the <hi>restoring all things to their former state,</hi> did cut off all hopes of any such <hi>Reformation</hi> as was necessary
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:101069:182"/>
for the <hi>Protestants</hi> to return to the <hi>Roman Communion.</hi> And whatever you say, till you have proved the contrary better than as yet it is done, it will appear, that they are the <hi>Protestants who stand for the ancient and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Doctrine of the Catholick Church, against the novel and corrupt Tenets</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> And such kind of <hi>Protestation</hi> no true Christian, who measures his being <hi>Catholick,</hi> by better grounds than communion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> will ever have cause to be ashamed of.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>and Infallible (at least with a General Council) it is impossible, that Protestants, or other Sectaries, should ever find such errours or corruptions difinitively taught by him, or received by the Church, as should either warrant them to preach against her Doctrine, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to forsake her communion.</hi> We say, Your <hi>Church hath erred</hi>; you say, It is impossible <hi>she should</hi>; we offer you evident proofs of <hi>her errours</hi>; you say, <hi>She is Infallible</hi>; we say, It is impossible, that <hi>Church</hi> should be <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> which we can make appear hath <hi>been deceived</hi>; you tell us again, It is impossible <hi>she should be deceived</hi>; for, let <hi>Hereticks</hi> say what they will, <hi>she is Infallible.</hi> And if this be not a satisfactory way of answering, let the world judge. But having already pulled down that <hi>Babel</hi> of <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> this Answer falls to the ground with it; and to use your phrase, <hi>The truth is,</hi> all that you have in effect to say for your <hi>Church,</hi> is, that she is <hi>Infallible,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and by this means you think to cast the <hi>Schism</hi> upon us; and these things are great enough indeed, if you could but make any shew of proof for them; but not being able to do that, you do in effect as much as if a man in a <hi>high feaver</hi> should go about to demonstrate it was <hi>impossible</hi> for him to be <hi>sick,</hi> which, the more he takes pains to do, the more evident his distemper is to all who hear him. And it is shrewdly to be suspected, if your errours had not been great and palpable, you would have contented your selves with some thing short of Infallibility. But as the case is with your <hi>Church,</hi> I must confess it is your greatest wisdom to talk most of <hi>Infallibility</hi>; for if you can but meet with any weak enough to swallow that, all other things go down without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; but if men are left at liberty to examine particulars, they would as soon believe it was impossible for that man to <hi>fall,</hi> whom they see <hi>upon the ground,</hi> as your <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>infallible,</hi> which they find overspread with errour and corruptions.</p>
               <p>Much such another Answer you return to his Lordship's second Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is, <hi>at his calling the Christian Faith the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith:</hi> For, you say, <hi>It is no incongruity so to call it, for the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>being Head of the whole Christian or Catholick Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>the Faith approved and taught by him as Head thereof, though it be</hi> de facto <hi>the general Faith and Profession of all Christians, may yet very well be called the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith; Why? because the root, origine, and chief Foundation under Christ, of its being practised and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:101069:182"/>
believed by Christians is at</hi> Rome. But if the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> be no such thing as <hi>Head of the Christian Church</hi> (and they must have a very <hi>wide Faith,</hi> which must <hi>swallow</hi> that <hi>Vniversal Headship,</hi> with all the <hi>appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> upon your bare affirmation) if it belongs no more to him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and teach the Faith then to any other <hi>Catholick Bishop,</hi> if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Rome</hi> affords no credibility at all to the <hi>Christian Faith</hi>; then still there remains as great an incongruity as may be, in calling the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith,</hi> the <hi>Roman Faith.</hi> And as to all these my denial is as good as your affirmation; when you undertake to prove, I shall to answer.</p>
               <p>If <hi>A. C.</hi> adds <hi>the practice of the Church to the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith,</hi> I see no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is gotten by it, for the first must limit the latter,<note place="margin">P. 148.</note> and the <hi>Faith</hi> being <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> must be so too, and therefore all your cavils on that subject come to nothing.</p>
               <p>The third Exception is, <hi>against the place out of S.</hi> Bernard,<note place="margin">¬ß. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin, which, his Lordship saith, <hi>are mis-applied;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 137.</note> 
                  <hi>for neither of them</hi> (saith he) <hi>spake of the</hi> Roman; <hi>and S.</hi> Bernard <hi>perhaps neither of the Catholick, nor the</hi> Roman, <hi>but of a particular Church or Congregation. His words are, What greater pride, than that one man should prefer his judgement before the whole Congregation. Which</hi> A. C. <hi>conveniently to his purpose rendred before the whole Congregation of all the Christian Churches in the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quae major superbia quam ut unus hamo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Congregatione judicium suum praeserat, tanquam ipse solus Spiritum Dei habeat,</hi> S. Bern. Serm. 3. de Resurrect.</note> 
                  <hi>Whereas no such thing is in him as all the Christian Churches in the world.</hi> And his Lordship saith, <hi>He thinks it is plain, that he speaks both of, and to the particular Congregation, to which he was then preaching.</hi> This you deny not, but say,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>The argument holds</hi> √¢ minori ad majus, <hi>to shew the more exorbitant pride of those, who prefer their private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Opinions, before the judgement of the whole Catholick Church.</hi> The <hi>Roman Church</hi> you should have said<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for you own no <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but what is <hi>Roman,</hi> and therein the argument you mention will hold yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, against those who prefer the <hi>Novel Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ancient <hi>Apostolical Faith</hi> of the <hi>truly Catholick Church.</hi> His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship adds, <hi>That it is one thing to prefer a mans private judgement before the whole Congregation; and another, for an intelligent man in something unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, modestly to propose his doubts even to the Catholick Church. And much more may a whole National Church, nay, the whole body of Protestants do it.</hi> Now you very wisely leave out this last clause, that you might take an opportunity to declaim against <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> for want of modesty. But what pretext could there have been for such virulency, had they been guilty of what you charge them, if you would but have given us all that his Lordship said; And may not I now therefore more justly return you your own language in the same page upon a far less occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. <hi>That here's a manifest robbery of part of his Lordships words, for which you are bound to restitution. For his Lordship, as it were, foreseeing this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, warily adds that concerning a whole National Church, and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Protestants; which you for reasons best known to your self, craftily leave out. But we must excuse our adversary for this slip, though it be an unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some one; For the truth is, he had no other way to hide the guiltiness of his own pen, &amp;c.</hi> These are your own words only applied, and that much more justly to your self, for a more palpable fault in the very same page wherein you had accused his Lordship for one of that kind. But you go on further, and <hi>supposing the doubts had been modestly proposed, yet this could not at all help the Protestant cause, in regard their doubts were in points of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:101069:183"/>
Faith, already determined for such by authority of the Catholick Church; to question any of which with what seeming modesty soever is sinful, heretical, and damnable.</hi> Were it our present business, it were easie to make it appear, that the far greatest part of the matters in Controversie; were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver determined <hi>as points of Faith,</hi> before the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> and, I hope you will not say, that was before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> or any proposal of doubts? But, if they had been defined by your <hi>Church</hi> for matters of Faith, and our great doubt be, How your <hi>Church</hi> comes to have this power of <hi>determining points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> to whom should this doubt be propounded? to your <hi>Church,</hi> no doubt then we should hear from her, as now we do from you, <hi>That to question it with what seeming modesty soever, is sinful, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, ond damnable.</hi> And, Is it not then likely that your <hi>Church</hi> should ever yield to the proposal of doubts? and you do well to tell us so; for it will save <hi>Protestants</hi> a great deal of labour, when they see your <hi>Church</hi> so incurable, that she makes it <hi>sinful, heretical, and damnable,</hi> to question any thing she hath determined. Although we do with much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son assert it to be <hi>sinful, heretical, and damnable</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> to offer to obtrude erroneous Doctrines on the Faith of the <hi>Christian world,</hi> as points necessary to be believed, and to urge superstitious practices as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of communion with her.</p>
               <p>To the place of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> wherein he saith, <hi>That it is a part of most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent madness, for any man to dispute, Whether that be to be done, which is usually done in and through the whole Catholick Church of Christ.</hi> His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship answer,<note place="margin">P. 138.</note> 1. <hi>Here's not a word of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, but of that which is all over the world, Catholick, which</hi> Rome <hi>never yet was</hi>; and for all your boast of having often shewn,<note place="margin">P. 149.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Roman and the Catholick are all one</hi>; I dare leave it to the indifferent Reader, Whether you have not miserably failed in your attempts that way. 2. He answers, <hi>That</hi> A. C. <hi>applies this to the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith, whereas S.</hi> Austin <hi>speaks expresly of the rites and ceremonies of the Church, and particularly about the manner of offering upon</hi> Maundy-Thursday, <hi>whether it be in the morning, or after supper, or both.</hi> 3. <hi>Tis manifest by the words themselves, that S.</hi> Austin <hi>speaks of no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith there, Roman, nor Catholick, for he speaks of things done, and to be done, and not for things believed, or to be believed.</hi> 4. <hi>A right sober man may, without the least touch of insolency or madness, dispute a business of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with the</hi> Roman,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>either Church or Prelate, as all men know</hi> Irenaeus <hi>did with Victor.</hi> Now to all this you reply, <hi>That the argument still holds</hi> √† minori ad majus, <hi>and reaches to every person that in any matter whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obstinately opposes himself against the Church of God.</hi> And is not this an excellent way of arguing from the <hi>less to the greater,</hi> to argue from a <hi>rite</hi> or <hi>ceremony</hi> observed by the Universal <hi>Church</hi> to a <hi>matter of Faith</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> This is <hi>√† minori ad majus,</hi> with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But your Reason is as good as your Answer, which is, <hi>because there was alwaies some point or matter of Faith involved in every Vniversally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised rite or ceremony of the Church,</hi> I pray Sir then, Tell us what the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith</hi> was which lay in the offering on <hi>Maundy-Thursday</hi> in morning, or after supper? and by whom this <hi>point of Faith</hi> was determined? and and how far it is obligatory? and whether it be not <hi>sinful, heretical, and damnable,</hi> so much as modestly to doubt of it? For all this, you told us, belongs to all matters of Faith determined by the Catholick Church. What remains of this Chapter, need not hold us long, for <hi>A. C</hi>'s. illation from the <hi>Catholick Churches not erring, that therefore it cannot be lawful to
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:101069:183"/>
separate from the</hi> Roman <hi>Church,</hi> is absurd and illogical; and depends on that gross mistake that the <hi>Roman and Catholick Church</hi> are all one, which we have abundantly disproved in the precedent Chapter. What follows concerning the <hi>Catholick Churches not erring,</hi> and how far <hi>that extends,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 150, 151.</note> concerning the <hi>Catalogue of Fundamentals, and any errours admitted in the Church, being destructive to its Being, because derogatory to Gods Veracity,</hi> have been so amply discussed in their proper places, that I find no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from any new arguments here suggested, to resume the debate of them.

               <head>CHAP. III. Of keeping Faith with Hereticks.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The occasion of this Dispute. The reason why this Doctrine is not commonly defended: Yet all own such Principles from whence it necessarily follows. The matter of fact as to the Council of <hi>Constance;</hi> and <hi>John Hus</hi> opened. Of the nature of the safe-conduct granted him by the Emperour, that it was not a general one, <hi>salv√¢ justiti√¢,</hi> but particular, <hi>jure speciali;</hi> which is largely proved. The particulars concerning <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague.</hi> Of the safe-conduct granted by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Of the distinction of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Ecclesiastical Power, and that from thence it follows, that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks. <hi>Simancha,</hi> and several others fully assert this Doctrine. Of the Invitation to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the good Instructions there; and of Publick Disputation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>A. <hi>C</hi>'s Endeavour not only to charge <hi>Protestants</hi> with the guilt of <hi>Schism,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> but to justifie and clear the proceedings of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> towards them, hath led us into a new dispute, how far she is to be trusted in the greatest promises which are made to such whom she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Which is occasioned by these words of his, <hi>That after this breach was made, the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was so kind and careful to seek the Protestants, that she invited them publickly with safe conduct to</hi> Rome, <hi>to a General Council, freely to speak what they could for themselves:</hi> Or, if we take his words, as you give them us, the sense is the same to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (and therefore you impertinently cavil with his Lordship for not keeping Faith with <hi>A.C.) Which did at first seek to recall them from their Novel Opinions, and after their breach did permit, yea invite them publickly to</hi> Rome <hi>to a General Council,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which his Lordship sayes: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I think the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did carefully seek the Protestants;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 143. n. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>but I doubt it was to bring them within their net. And she invited them to</hi> Rome. <hi>A very safe place, if you mark it, for them to come to, just as the Lion (in the Apologue) invited the Fox to his own Den. Yea, but there was safe-conduct offered too: Yes, conduct perhaps, but not safe, or safe perhaps, for going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but none for coming thence.</hi> Vestigia nulla retrorsum. <hi>Yea, but it should have been to a General Council: Perhaps so. But was the conduct safe, that was given to a Council which they call General, to some others before them? No sure,</hi> John Hus, <hi>and</hi> Jerom <hi>of</hi> Prague <hi>burnt for all their safe conduct. And so long as the Jesuits write and maintain. That Faith given is not to be kept with Hereticks. And the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>leaves this lewd Doctrine uncensured (as
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:101069:184"/>
it hath hitherto done, and no exception put in of force and violence.)</hi> A. C. <hi>shall pardon us, that we come not to</hi> Rome, <hi>nor within the reach of</hi> Roman <hi>Power, what freedom of speech soever he promised us. For to what end free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of speech on their part, since they are resolved to alter nothing?

                  <note place="margin">P. 152.</note> This you call a <hi>Theme, which, for the most part, our Adversaries love to dwell upon, as thinking they have some great advantage against us therein.</hi> And, Can you blame them for insisting much on that which their lives are concerned in, and it will appear in the prosecution of this subject, that we have this great advantage against you, that we are come to understand your arts so well, as not so easily to be catched by your perfidious subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And as we understand your <hi>practices</hi> better than to rely on your <hi>promises</hi> of this nature, so we are not so ignorant of the <hi>intrigues</hi> of your proceedings, as to suppose that commonly and openly you should defend this Position, That <hi>Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> For thereby you would lose the intent and design of it; for none would be so silly as to venture themselves into the hands of such, who openly profess, <hi>They are not bound to keep Faith with them.</hi> For, Do you think that <hi>Father Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentio</hi> would ever have gone to <hi>Rome</hi> on the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> most solemnly given by <hi>Paul.</hi> 5. if he had understood beforehand, with what perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he should have been dealt with there; and all under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, That <hi>safe-conduct was given for his coming hither, but not for his going thence.</hi> Is this the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical See?</hi> Is this the <hi>Catholick and Roman Faith?</hi> If so, the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> before ever it was <hi>Christian,</hi> was much more <hi>infallible</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> than this; that never was acquainted with such a perfidious Infallibility. Well then might his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship say, <hi>The conduct might be safe for going thither, but not for coming thence.</hi> Vestigia nulla retrorsum. And so <hi>Fulgentio</hi> to his sorrow found it. We see therefore, it is very necessary for you to disown this principle as much as possible, till you have occasion to practise it, and then woe be to them to whose lot it falls to make the experiment. Though therefore both <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and privately, in word and writing,</hi> as you tell us, <hi>You teach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, That Faith is to be kept as well with Hereticks as Catholicks,</hi> yet your <hi>Adversaries</hi> have no great reason to reply on your promises; when they find your practices apparently to the contrary, and those practices built on such principles which you all own, and contend for, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, what you confidently say to the contrary, several of your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have in terms asserted it. All which shall be made good in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore, though you say it, and say it over again, those who know the ambiguity of your expressions, your many reservations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which you make, will not be very confident of the honesty of your meaning, by the fairness of your expressions. These are therefore <hi>no clamorous accusations,</hi> but very sad truths, which the experience of the world, and your dealings have too often taught us; that at last we are forced to distinguish between a <hi>Princes safc-conduct,</hi> and an <hi>Eccleasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Trepan.</hi> For no other, will that appear to be, which was granted by <hi>Pope Paul</hi> to <hi>Fulgentio,</hi> or the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> to <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague.</hi> If <hi>Christ</hi> therefore, after he had said, That <hi>they should give to</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars, had either denied the payment of <hi>tribute,</hi> or demanded it himself, <hi>Becanus</hi> might then say, That was a fit parallel for you in this Controversie, whose open actions do pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably contradict you, when you say, <hi>That Faith is to be kept with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>

                  <hi>This present Sacred Synod declareth, That by whatsoever safe-conduct, granted by the Emperour, Kings, or other Secular Princes, to Hereticks, or such as are defamed for Heresie, no prejudice can arise, no impediment can, or ought to be put to the Catholick Faith, or other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical jurisdiction, but that (notwithstanding the said safe-conduct) it may be lawful for any competent and Ecclesiastical Judge to enquire into the errours of such persons, and duly otherwaies proceed against them, and punish them so far as justice shall require, if they shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously refuse to revoke their errours; yea though they come to the place of judgement, relying upon such safe-conduct, and would not otherwise come thither; nor doth he who so promiseth, remain obliged in any thing, having done what lyes in him.</hi> Upon this decree of the <hi>Council</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> looks on himself, as absolved from his obligation, and not only concurred in the sentence against <hi>Husse,</hi> but gave order himself about his execution. The Question then is, Whether the <hi>Emperour</hi> did not break his Faith with <hi>John Husse</hi> in so doing; and, Whether the <hi>Council</hi> did not decree, that neither he, nor any else, were bound to keep it with <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> Although this case be so plain and clear to all persons, who have any sense of justice and honesty, that we dare appeal to the most indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent persons in the world, Whether it be not a notorious violation of Faith, after a most solemn promise of safe return, to proceed to judgement against the person, who came meerly relying on that promise, and the same person to be the Instrument of his execution, who gave the safe-conduct on which he trusted: And whether the declaring, that such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not obliged to keep his promise, because it is a matter of <hi>Heresie</hi> he had promised in, be not to declare, <hi>That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> Yet since no actions are so bad, if they tend to your advantage, but you will have something to blind the eyes of the simple with, we must consider what you have to plead in vindication of these proceedings. You tell us

                  <hi>That the Emperour did not break his Faith with</hi> John Husse, <hi>and that notwithstanding the safe-conduct given, he was justly burnt.</hi> Bold and daring assertions! but we must enquire into the reasons of them. Two things you seem most to rely on, and the strength of all your Answer depends on them: which being the things, <hi>Becanus,</hi> and the rest of your party insist on in this case, I shall more closely examine. The first is, <hi>From the nature of the safe-conduct given, that it was not such as could hinder justice</hi>; the second is, <hi>From the difference of the Secular and Ecclesiastical Power, and that the Emperour could make no promise in prejudice of the Churches Jurisdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, You distinguish of a <hi>safe-conduct, which,</hi> you say, <hi>may be granted two waies;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>first,</hi> jure communi, <hi>when tis given only against unjust violence,</hi> salv√¢ semper justiti√¢,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>provided alwaies that Justice be not impeached: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> jure speciali, <hi>when it secures a man against all violence whatsoever, whether just or unjust, and chiefly in that cause for which it is given. In the former manner only,</hi> you say, <hi>A safe-conduct was granted by the Emperour to</hi> John Husse, <hi>and by the Council of</hi> Constance <hi>to</hi> Hierom <hi>of</hi> Prague: <hi>In the latter sort, the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>offered safe-conduct to the Protestants in</hi> Germany, &amp;c. <hi>No Faith therefore was broken with</hi> John Husse; <hi>for, a safe-conduct was only given him</hi> jure communi, <hi>by which Justice was to remain unimpeachable, since he was only promised to be defended against unjust vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; which was performed.</hi> I grant, a <hi>safe-conduct</hi> may be given two waies; the first, is to secure men from all unjust violence, in order to a legal trial; and this is granted in such cases, when the person accused looks on the <hi>Law,</hi> as open for him as well as his <hi>Adversaries,</hi> and puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self on a fair tryal before equal and indifferent Judges: and in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the intent of the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> is expressed, <hi>Damus tibi fidem publicam causam dicendi in judicio contra vim, non contra juris executionem</hi>; as the <hi>Formula</hi> of it is in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> thence that <hi>Imperial Constitution,</hi> which prohibits that any <hi>safe-conduct</hi> be given to the accuser, or the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty person <hi>adversus publicum judicium, sed solum contra vim,</hi> against pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick justice, but only against violence: but then, these are the <hi>safe-conducts</hi> which subordinate Officers can only grant; because these have no power over the life of persons, but they are only to see justice duly administred to all persons, in order to which they may give such <hi>safe-conducts</hi> as may prevent such things, as may hinder the due execution of Justice. But then further, a <hi>safe-conduct</hi> may be given with respect to those who are to judge of the cause, <hi>i. e.</hi> in case a person avoids appearance upon fears that the persons he is summoned before, will presently cast him into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or put him to death; now, if a <hi>safe-conduct</hi> be granted by him, who hath the absolute power of life and liberty, so as to hinder the execution of any sentence passed, in this case the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> is full and absolute, and admits of no restrictions or limitations. Now this latter is plainly our present case; For <hi>John Husse</hi> had been summoned before to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> to vindicate himself in point of <hi>Heresie,</hi> but suspecting foul deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he durst not go: And, Can we in reason think he would ever have gone to <hi>Constance,</hi> if the <hi>Emperour</hi> had not granted him such a <hi>Conduct</hi> as might secure him from his fears, as to his life and liberty? And therefore, since the <hi>Emperour,</hi> to whom it only belonged to dispose of both, had granted him so express a <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> he thought he might securely go. For, To what end or purpose is a <hi>safe-conduct</hi> granted, if it be not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that which the person to whom it was given had most cause to fear? Now it is apparent, <hi>John Husse</hi> was not afraid of any unjust violence by the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:101069:185"/>
way, for he was so secure as to that, that he left his <hi>safe-conduct</hi> in the hands of his friends, till he came at <hi>Constance,</hi> as appears by the unquestionable reports of that story on all hands; which is an evident argument, that the intent of the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> was to secure him at <hi>Constance,</hi> from any injury being done him by the <hi>Council.</hi> And although the <hi>Council</hi> might take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, not only to judge of <hi>Heresie,</hi> but to condemn him for it; yet, as long as the execution of that sentence belonged to the Secular Power, he had reason to think, that whatever the <hi>Council</hi> might determine, yet the <hi>Emperours Faith</hi> being solemnly given him, he need not fear the <hi>execution</hi> of it. For that being in the <hi>Emperours</hi> power, he was bound by his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith not to give way to it. To make this clear by an Instance; It is more evident by our Laws, that one who hath taken orders at <hi>Rome,</hi> coming into the Nation, and being convicted of it, is liable to death, than it was by the <hi>Laws</hi> then in force, that such who were condemned for Heresie, should be burnt; Suppose now, that a <hi>Priest</hi> be summoned by the <hi>King</hi> to appear before his Courts of <hi>Justice,</hi> with a <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise given, that he should come, appear, and return freely, without any hinderance; Would not you, or any other <hi>Romish Priest,</hi> think your selves hardly dealt with, and that the <hi>King</hi> had broken his Faith, if he should not only suffer you to be condemned, but give express order for your execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then tell you, that the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> was to be understood <hi>salv√¢ justiti√¢,</hi> without any impeachment of <hi>Justice,</hi> and that it was only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you from all unjust violence? And, Was not the case just the same here of the <hi>Emperour Sigismund,</hi> and <hi>John Husse?</hi> Was <hi>John Husse</hi> so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as not to know they would condemn him for Heresie, when a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> had condemned him for it already? Or, Did not he know what course was like to be taken with persons so condemned? What could he then imagine to be the intent of this <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> but to secure him from all violence to be done to his person under a pretence of execution of Justice? And for all this, was not the <hi>Emperours</hi> Faith violated, when he was not only imprisoned, but burnt, by the <hi>Emperours</hi> express order, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his solemn promise that he should come, appear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn freely, without any hinderance? If this be a <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> it is only such a one as they that go to the <hi>Gallows</hi> have, a <hi>safe-conduct</hi> to <hi>execution.</hi> Besides, that this could not be such a <hi>safe-conduct, salv√¢ justiti√°,</hi> as you speak of, is manifest from the tenor and words of it. For <hi>safe-conducts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted in favour of persons, are to be taken in their largest sense, if no limitations be expressed in them; and it is a <hi>Rule</hi> among those who should, and do understand these things best, <hi>That a safe-conduct is of the nature of a Covenant, and the words of it import a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and therefore if they be general,</hi>

                  <hi>are extended as far as the words will bear. And that all the Doctors do unanimously concurr, that a general safe-conduct of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Judge, or appearing in a Court of Judicature, do import a freedom of departure and going thence.</hi> So that we see, if we take the <hi>Emperours safe-conduct</hi> in the express words of it, it imports much more than such a one as is only <hi>salv√¢ justiti√¢</hi>; because it ran in the most general and comprehensive terms, and was granted not by any subordinate <hi>Judge,</hi> but by the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who was able, as well as bound, to make it good in the most large and extensive sense. But further, if this had been granted only <hi>salv√¢ justiti√¢,</hi> so that the <hi>Council</hi> had liberty to proceed on him as they saw good, What
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:101069:186"/>
made the <hi>Emperour</hi> take their imprisonment of him so ill, as <hi>Nauclerus</hi> and others report he did, and that because of the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> he had given him? It seems the <hi>Emperour</hi> wanted <hi>Becanus,</hi> and you, to have told him, That he never granted any <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> but what had the reservation of a <hi>salv√¢ justiti√¢,</hi> and that such justice too, as his greatest enemy must shew him: If he had known this, he needed not have been troubled at that which he made account of, in granting the <hi>safe-conduct.</hi> Lastly, What need the <hi>Council</hi> have taken such pains to satisfie the <hi>Emperour,</hi> by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a decree, that neither he, nor any <hi>Prince</hi> was bound by their <hi>safe-conducts,</hi> to hinder Hereticks from being punished, if he had not thought himself obliged to do it, by the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> he had given? and if he did think so before the decree of the <hi>Council,</hi> then certainly there was no <hi>salv√¢ justiti√¢</hi> understood by him in the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> he had granted. Thus we see, how on all hands it appears, from <hi>Husse</hi>'s fears and desires, the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> power, the nature of <hi>safe-conducts,</hi> the <hi>Emperours</hi> own sense of it, and the <hi>Councils</hi> decree, that this first Answer hath no ground at all, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>safe conduct</hi> was granted <hi>jure communi,</hi> and that it was only to hinder unjust violence, and not the execution of Justice.</p>
               <p>But besides, you say, <hi>John Husse</hi> was justly burnt, for two reasons: <hi>The first is, For being obstinate in his Heresie; the second, For having fled, which the Emperour had prohibited in his safe-conduct, under pain of death.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, It is not, Whether a man, obstinate in <hi>Heresie,</hi> may be burnt, which is now the Question, although that may justly bear a dispute too: But, Whether one, suspected for <hi>Heresie,</hi> and coming to a <hi>Council</hi> with <hi>safe-conduct</hi> for coming and returning, may be burnt without violation of Faith; your first reason then, is nothing to the purpose, and your second as little: First, Because there is no certain evidence at all of <hi>Husse</hi>'s flying; it not being objected against him by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who only upbraided him with his obstinacy in his Heresie, as the cause of his execution; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, if <hi>Husse</hi> had fled, and had suffered death for that, as you say he ought to have done, he would not have suffered the death proper to <hi>Heresie,</hi> and not to flying; nor been accounted (as by all your own Authours he is) a sufferer on the account of <hi>Heresie.</hi> But this being a groundless <hi>Calumny,</hi> it needs no further confutation.</p>
               <p>But before we come to your second Answer, the case of <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> must be discussed so far as it is distinct from that of <hi>John Husse</hi>;<note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> who, it seems, was trepanned by a pretended <hi>safe-conduct</hi> granted him by the <hi>Council,</hi> and not by the <hi>Emperour, wherein,</hi> you tell us, <hi>that express clause of</hi> salv√¢ semper justiti√¢ <hi>was inserted</hi> (which is another argument that the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> of the <hi>Emperour</hi> to <hi>Husse</hi> was of another nature, because it ran in general terms, without any such clause) but poor <hi>Hierom,</hi> who, it seems, was not acquainted with the arts and subtilties of his enemies, but thought them as honest as himself, ventures to <hi>Constance</hi> upon this <hi>safe-conduct:</hi> but when he came thither, and began to understand the jugglings of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he thought to shift for himself by flight, but being taken, was burnt. So that <hi>Hierom</hi> suffered through his honest simplicity and credulity, not considering what that <hi>salv√¢ justiti√¢</hi> would mean in his case, which, as they interpreted it, was such another <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> as known <hi>Malefactors</hi> have to the place of <hi>Justice:</hi> but to call it a <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> in the sense which <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> apprehended it in, is as proper as to say, A man that is to be executed shall have a <hi>Salvo</hi> for his life. This was therefore intended, as appears by the event, as a meer trick to bring him within their power; and so all
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:101069:186"/>
such <hi>safe-conducts</hi> granted with those clauses (by such persons who are to interpret them themselves) are, and nothing else: For they are the sole Judges what this Justice shall be, Neither can you say then, That <hi>Faith</hi> was <hi>kept</hi> with <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague:</hi> for no such thing as a <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> truly so called, was intended him; and when the <hi>Emperour</hi> was sollicited to grant him one, he utterly denied it, because of the bad success he had in that of <hi>John Husse</hi>; and some of the <hi>Council</hi> being then present with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> offered to give him a <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> but they very honestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained themselves, that it was a <hi>safe-conduct</hi> for coming thither, but not for going thence again. And so it proved. So that Faith was well <hi>given</hi> to <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and as well <hi>kept</hi> to <hi>John Husse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, say you, <hi>Had the Protestants gone to the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>upon the safe-conduct granted them by that Council</hi> jure speciali, <hi>in the second manner, they could not at all have been punished under any pretence of Heresie, without manifest breach of Faith; which all Catholicks hold to be unlawful. The like may be said of the safe-conduct offered them for going to</hi> Rome. But you must better satisfie us, that you look upon this as a breach of Faith, than as yet you have done. For so are your ambiguities, in your expressions of this nature, that men who know your arts, can hardly tell when they have your right meaning. For you may look on all breach of Faith as unlawful, and yet not look on your acting contrary to your express words, in <hi>safe-conducts</hi> offered to <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to be a breach of Faith. For you may say, Faith is there only broken, where men are bound to keep it; but you are not bound to keep it with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and that because your obligation to the <hi>Church</hi> is greater than it can be to <hi>Hereticks</hi>; when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have Hereticks in your power, it is an easie matter for you to say, that, were it in any thing else, but in a matter so nearly concerning the <hi>Interest</hi> of your <hi>Holy Mother</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> you could not but observe it, but your obligation to that is so great, as destroies all other which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it: and the <hi>obligation</hi> being destroyed, there is no breach of <hi>Faith</hi> at all; and therefore you may hold all breach of Faith unlawful, and yet you may proceed against those whom you account <hi>Hereticks,</hi> contrary to all engagements whatsoever, and then say, This is no breach of Faith. And the truth is, by your Doctrines of aequivocations, and mental reservations, you have made all manner of converse in the world so lubricous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, that he who hath to deal with you, especially in matters where the interest of your <hi>Church</hi> is concerned, had need be wary, and <hi>remember to distrust,</hi> or else he may repent it afterwards. If you therefore account the <hi>Protestants crafty Foxes, in not coming to</hi> Rome, <hi>or the Council of</hi> Trent, it was, because they would not venture too near the <hi>Lions Den</hi>; but if you will not account them <hi>wise men,</hi> for refusing so fair an offer, you will give us leave to think them so, till they see better reason to trust your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. And the <hi>Council of</hi> Trent did very well to tell them in their form of <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> they would not do by them as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> did, for therein they shew, how much the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> was sunk by that, so that if that were not particularly excepted, no trust would ever be given to them more. But, supposing the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> of the <hi>Council of</hi> Trent to have been never so free from suspicion, the <hi>Protestants</hi> had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reasons not to appear there, as will be manifested afterwards.</p>
               <p>We come therefore now to your second Answer,<note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> in vindication of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> which is this, <hi>That by that decree the Council declares, that no Secular Power, how soveraign soever,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 154.</note> 
                  <hi>can hinder the proceedings of the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:101069:187"/>
Ecclesiastical Tribunal in causes of Heresie; for which there is great reason; and consequently, if the Emperour, or any other Secular Prince, grants a safe-conduct, or makes promise of any thing to the prejudice of that Jurisdiction, it shall not hold. The reason is, because 'tis a promise made of a thing not pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Jurisdiction of that Prince, nor wholly in his power to see performed.</hi> To this I answer, 1. That if I understand any thing, this is expresly to say, That no <hi>Prince is to keep Faith with Hereticks,</hi> and that is it which you are charged with; and you made use of this distinction, to free your selves from. Now that this is the plain meaning of it, thus appears; you say in the words immediately after; <hi>But the Council no where teaches, That Faith or safe-conduct given in temporal causes properly pertaining to the Princes Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, is not to be kept by all, and to all persons of what condition soever, so far as it is possible.</hi> Which is as much as to say, That in any other case but that of <hi>Heresie,</hi> they are to keep Faith, but not in that: for this of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> is that which you oppose to all <hi>Temporal Causes,</hi> and challenge it as belonging to an <hi>Ecclesiastical Tribunal</hi>; when therefore the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> decrees, That no <hi>Secular Power</hi> is obliged by any <hi>safe-conduct,</hi> to any thing which may hinder the <hi>Ecclesiastical Tribunals</hi> proceeding in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Heresie,</hi> what doth it else but declare in express terms, That <hi>Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, i. e.</hi> in any thing relating to their <hi>Heresie</hi>; for this, you say, they have nothing to do with: and therefore let <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> make never so solemn promises and engagements to men suspected of <hi>Heresie,</hi> to their peril be it, who rely upon them, for they have nothing to do to promise in such matters, and though their Faith be given never so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and solemnly, they are not bound to keep it; nay, they are bound not to keep it: for, if they should, it would be to the apparent mischief and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the <hi>Church.</hi> This necessarily follows from your own words, and the distinction here used by you. So that now we need seek no further than your self, and <hi>Becanus,</hi> for the open avowing of this Principle, That <hi>no Prince is bound to keep Faith with Hereticks</hi>; but if he doth promise <hi>safe-conduct</hi> to them though it be more than he can do, yet the <hi>Church</hi> can make that good use of it, that by that means she may get the <hi>Hereticks</hi> under her power; and when she hath them, it is but then declaring this promise to be null, and she may do with them as she pleases. Neither is it only <hi>Becanus,</hi> and you, who say this, but it is the received Principle among you, whatever you say or pretend to the contrary; I mean not, that you say in express terms, That <hi>Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> but by this distinction of the Secular and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Power, as you use it, you say that from whence it necessarily follows. But yet I answer 2. Though this distinction should be granted, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not really excuse the <hi>Emperour</hi> from violating his Faith. For, I say, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised nothing but was in his power, which was, to secure him as to life and liberty. Now, although the <hi>Emperour</hi> had suffered the <hi>Ecclesiastical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,</hi> to do what belonged to it, which was to enquire into the charge of <hi>Heresie,</hi> and to give sentence upon the person, yet the execution belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly to the <hi>Secular Power</hi>; as the <hi>Council</hi> it self acknowledged, when after the sentence of <hi>Heresie</hi> was pronounced against <hi>John Husse,</hi> there was nothing of the executive part which was pleaded, as belonging to the <hi>Church,</hi> but only degradation, and that was performed in the presence of the Council;<note place="margin">

                        </gap>c Sancta Synodus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiensis Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannem Hus, attento qu√≤d Ecclesia Dei non habeat ultra quid gerere valeat, judicio seculari relinquere, &amp; ipsum curiae seculari relinquendum sore decernit,</hi> Concil. Constant. sess. 15. p. 1056.</note> upon which the <hi>Sacred Synod declares, That they had no more to do with him, but to deliver him over to the Secular Power, and accordingly
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:101069:187"/>
decrees it to be done.</hi> Now when the <hi>Synod</hi> declares this, Is it not plain, that what concerns his life, doth properly and only belong to the <hi>Secular Power</hi>; if therefore the <hi>Emperour</hi> was bound to do all which lay in him to do, he was effectually bound to secure him as to life and liberty, for both those lay within his power. And therefore, when he gave order for his execution, he was highly guilty of the violation of his Faith; and if the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> declared him absolved as to this too, it is yet more evident, that they not only decreed, That <hi>no Faith was to be kept with Hereticks</hi> in matters concerning the <hi>Ecclesiastical Tribunal,</hi> but in such as concerned the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> which is much as to say, Not at all. And by this the vanity of this distinction of the <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Power</hi> is sufficiently manifest, and that it evidently appears, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> did decree, That <hi>no Faith was to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> And thus I have proved, that his Lordship hath not, as you calumniate him, <hi>ignorantly or maliciously wronged the Council,</hi> but that no other tolerable sense, besides that which his Lordship saith, can be made of the decree then passed; and notwithstanding your arts and distinctions, nothing can be more plain, than that <hi>John Husse</hi> was trepanned into his ruine by the Faith of the <hi>Emperour</hi> given to him. It can be therefore nothing but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther palpable ignorance, or a deceit as gross as trusting your <hi>safe-conduct</hi> in a matter of <hi>Heresie,</hi> for you so confidently to assert, <hi>That if the Relator had not mangled the words of the Council (to deceive his Reader) but set down the decree fairly and fully as it is, the business had been so clear, that it would scarce have any dispute.</hi> Whereas his Lordship only sets down the title of the decree, and so he tells you himself, and this he doth as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as may be, and whereas nothing can more evidence the juglings of the <hi>Council,</hi> than the <hi>Decree</hi> it self doth, in which nothing is more plain than that, In case of <hi>Heresie,</hi> no <hi>Prince</hi> is bound to keep Faith with any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> we proceed to other Authors, to see, whether they do not concurr with it in this Opinion.

In general you say, <hi>The Bishop was insincere or unadvised in quoting this Author.</hi> I wonder wherein:<note place="margin">P. 155.</note> I am sure, not so much as you are in your Answers to him. For, you say <hi>Simancha holds not this absolutely and universally, but only in cases, wherein that which is promised cannot be lawfully performed. Hence, say you,</hi> Simancha <hi>hath these words,</hi> Veruntamen (ut Marius Salomonius ait) promissa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Christum fides, si praestetur, perfidia est, <hi>If Faith be given against Christ, that is to the dishonour of God, or contrary to the precepts of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it were perfidiousness to observe it.</hi> But the Answer to this is easie: for it appears from <hi>Simancha</hi>'s own grounds, that he supposeth it holds universally, because Faith can never be given to Hereticks, so as that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise can be lawfully performed, because thereby he supposeth it given against <hi>Christ,</hi> and to the dishonour of <hi>God,</hi> and therefore concludes, it
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:101069:188"/>
would be perfidiousness to observe it. And this is evident from <hi>Siman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>'s own grounds, which he gives for it. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>if Faith be not kept with Tyrants, Pirats, and other Robbers, which kill the body;</hi>

                  </note> and makes use of the instance of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> to prove it. And <hi>Menochius,</hi> whom <hi>Simancha</hi> likewise cites, who was an <hi>Italian Canonist,</hi> and therefore might well know the practices of <hi>Rome</hi> in these cases, saith, <hi>That</hi> Placa <hi>expresly holds, That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks, which, he saith, he understands so, when Faith is given to the injury of the Catholick Faith:</hi> and cites <hi>Conradus Brunus to this purpose, That it is not lawful to make such agreements with Hereticks, that they may enjoy the liberty of their own sect.</hi> If therefore they must interpret, how far the Faith given tends to the prejudice of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> we see, how little se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity can be had from any solemn promise. And <hi>Menochius</hi> himself <hi>asserts the safe-conduct granted by Princes, in case of Heresie to be unlawful, because the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> (as he supposes <hi>Princes to be to the Ecclesiastical Tribunal) cannot secure them who are condemned by the Superiour, and because Kings and Emperours ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to destroy Hereticks, than to secure them. And therefore the Council of</hi> Constance <hi>did well in nulling the safe-conducts granted to Hereticks.</hi> And what now is this, but in plain terms to assert, That Faith is not to be kept with <hi>Hereticks?</hi> Neither can you say, as some do, That they are the <hi>Canonists,</hi> and not the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which assert this: for, besides that the <hi>Canonists</hi> understand well enough the intrigues and proceedings of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> although it seems they do not conceal them so much as they should do, yet they are not only these who have asserted it, but some great men of your <hi>Church,</hi> have, upon occasion, expresly said it; for we are not to expect that this should be avowed as a publick Opinion of your <hi>Church,</hi> for that were to make it unserviceable to you; but when you have those whom you call <hi>Hereticks</hi> at an advantage, then is the time to discover this. So there wanted not some to perswade <hi>Charls the fifth,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>safe-conduct</hi> given to <hi>Luther</hi> at his coming to <hi>Worms,</hi> to deal by him as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> had done by <hi>John Husse,</hi> and that upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That no Faith was to be kept with <hi>Hereticks:</hi> But the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> about him, were persons of too great honour and honesty
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:101069:188"/>
to hearken to such perfidious Councils. And no meaner a person than <hi>Cardinal Hosius,</hi> admonishes <hi>Henry King of</hi> Poland, <hi>that he ought not to keep the Faith he had given to the Protestants, and gives this reason for it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nunquam patiaris ull√¢ te ratione ad ea quae promisisti praestanda teneri; quia juramentum non debet esse vinculum iniquitatis.</hi> Hosius Cardinal. epistol. 193, 202, 220.</note> 
                  <hi>That an Oath ought to not be the bond of iniquity.</hi> And the Jesuit <hi>Possevin</hi> is reported to have given the same counsel afterwards to <hi>Stephen King of</hi> Poland. But these things are, as much as possible, kept from our view, and the Books containing such Doctrines in them, are like the <hi>Golden Legends</hi> bought up by themselves to prevent our discovery of their frauds and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture; and therefore if we cannot instance in those <hi>Jesuits,</hi> who have expresly taught this Opinion in print, yet that only argues the greater fraud and subtilty of them, who will own and practise such things, which they dare not publickly avow to the world. And yet it appears from the way used by <hi>Becanus,</hi> and you, in vindication of your selves, that you cannot possibly avoid, the asserting such things from whence it necessarily follows, <hi>That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> But because the Doctrine it self is grown a matter so odious to the world, being contrary to all principles of humanity and justice, and which, if practised by all those who call each other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> would overthrow all civil societies; therefore you dare not but in terms disown it, though it still remains among those <hi>Arcana So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietatis,</hi> those hidden works of darkness, which want only a fair opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to discover themselves. But as much as you wipe your mouth, though it be foul enough in saying, That neither the <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor all his gang, are able to name one of them of that Opinion, to make it appear, how much you have abused your self in these words; I shall make a short business of it, and name your self for <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>Becanus</hi> your Author for <hi>another,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to what goes before, for an evidence that you own those Principles from whence it unavoidably follows, That no Faith is to be kept with <hi>Hereticks.</hi>

When you therefore say, <hi>His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship would have some Atheist, Turk or Jew, to fit as indifferent persons</hi>; you shew only your Scurrility, and want of understanding. For his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship only insists on the necessity of that, to shew the uselesness of publick Disputations, where such cannot be agreed on, as in this case. And he truly saith, <hi>This is a good Answer to all such offers; that the Kings and Church of</hi> England <hi>had no reason to admit of a publick Dispute with the English Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Clergy, till they shall be able to shew it under the Seal or Powers of</hi> Rome, <hi>that that Church will submit to a Third, who may be an indifferent Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and them; or to such a General Council as is after mentioned</hi> (not such a one as you would have, wherein the <hi>Pope should sit as Head of the Church,</hi> for that is to make the greatest Criminal, Judge in his own cause.<note place="margin">P. 185.</note>) <hi>And this,</hi> saith he, <hi>is an honest, and, I think, a full Answer.

               <head>CHAP. IV. The Reformation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> justified.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> guilty of Schism, by unjustly casting Protestants out of Communion. The Communion of the Catholick and particular Churches distinguished. No separation of Protestants from the Catholick Church. The Devotions of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> compared. Particular Churches Power to reform themselves in case of general Corruption, proved. The Instance from the Church of <hi>Judah</hi> vindicated. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> paralleld with the ten Tribes. General Corruptions make Reformation the more necessary. Whether those things we condemn as errours, were Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tenets at the time of the Reformation. The contrary shewed, and the difference of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> before and since the Reformation. When things may be said to be received as Catholick Doctrines. How far parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches Power to reform themselves extends. His Lordships In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances for the Power of Provincial Councils in matters of Reformation vindicated. The particular case of the Church of <hi>England</hi> discussed. The proceedings in our Reformation defended. The Church of <hi>England</hi> a true Church. The National Synod. <hi>1562.</hi> a lawful Synod. The Bishops no intruders in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time. The justice and moderation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Reformation. The Popes Power here, a forcible fraudulent usurpation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus far examined your Doctrine, of keeping Faith with <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> we now return to the main business concerning <hi>Schism.</hi> And his Lordship saying,<note place="margin">P. 146. sect. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is difference between departure out of the Church, and causeless thrusting from you; and therefore denying that it is in your power to thrust us out of the Church</hi>; You answer by a Concession, <hi>That we were thrust out from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but that it was not without cause:</hi> Which,<note place="margin">P. 185. n. 1.</note> that you might not seem to say <hi>gratis,</hi> you pretend to assign the causes of our expulsion. So that by your own confession the present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision or separation lyes at the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>'s door, if it be not made evident that there were most just and sufficient reasons for her casting the <hi>Protestants</hi> out of her communion. If therefore the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did thrust the <hi>Protestants</hi> from her communion, for doing nothing but what became them as members of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> then that must be the <hi>Schismatical</hi> party, and not the <hi>Protestants.</hi> For, supposing any <hi>Church</hi> (though pretending to be never so <hi>Catholick</hi>) doth restrain her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion within such narrow and unjust bounds, that she declares such excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, who do not approve all such errours in doctrine, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in practice, which the Communion of such a <hi>Church</hi> may be liable to, the cause of that division which follows, falls upon that <hi>Church</hi> which exacts those conditions from the members of her Communion: That i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>, when the errours and corruptions are such as are dangerous to salvation. For in this case, that <hi>Church</hi> hath first divided her self from the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; for, the Communion of that lying open and free to all, upon the necessary conditions of Christian Communion, whatever <hi>Church</hi> takes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her to limit and inclose the bounds of the <hi>Catholick,</hi> becomes thereby divided from the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> and all such who disown such an unjust <hi>inclosure,</hi> do not so much divide from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:101069:190"/>
of that <hi>Church</hi> so inclosing, as return to the Communion of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> and <hi>Vniversal Church.</hi> The <hi>Catholick Church</hi> therefore lyes open and free, like a <hi>Common-Field</hi> to all Inhabitants; now if any particular number of these Inhabitants should agree together, to enclose part of it, without consent of the rest, and not to admit any others to their right of <hi>Common,</hi> without consenting to it, which of these two parties, those who deny to yield their consent; or such who deny their rights if they will not, are guilty of the violation of the publick and common rights of the place? Now this is plainly the case between the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Ours; the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> lyes open to all such who own the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and are willing to joyn in the profession of them: Now to these your <hi>Church</hi> adds many particular Doctrines, which have no foundation in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or the consent of the Primitive <hi>Church</hi>; these, and many superstitious practises, are enjoyned by her, as conditions of her Communion, so that all those are debarred any right of Communion with her, who will not approve of them; by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, your <hi>Church</hi> is guilty of the first violation of the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>; and whatever number of men are deprived of your Communion, for not consenting to your usurpations, do not divide themselves from you, any further than you have first separated your selves from the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> And when your <hi>Church</hi> by this act is already separated from the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> the disowning of those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your <hi>Church</hi> is become <hi>Schismatical,</hi> cannot certainly be any culpable separation. For, whatever is so, must be from a <hi>Church</hi> so far as it is <hi>Catholick</hi>; but in our case it is from a <hi>Church</hi> so far only as it is not <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, i. e.</hi> so far as it hath divided her self from the Belief and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Vniversal Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But herein a great mistake is committed by you, when you measure the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by the judgement of all,<note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> or most of the particular <hi>Churches</hi> of such an <hi>Age,</hi> which supposes that the Church of some <hi>one particular Age,</hi> must of necessity be preserved from all errours and corruptions, which there is no reason or necessity at all to assert; and that is all the ground you have for saying,<note place="margin">P. 159.</note> 
                  <hi>That the separation of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants was not only from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but (as</hi> Calvin <hi>confesseth</hi>) √† toto mundo, <hi>from the whole Christian world, and such a separation necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves separation from the true Catholick Church.</hi> Now to this, we answer two things. 1. That we have not separated from the whole <hi>Christian World</hi> in any thing wherein the whole <hi>Christian World</hi> is agreed; but to disagree from the particular <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Christian World</hi> in such things wherein those <hi>Churches</hi> differ among themselves, is not to separate from the <hi>Christian World,</hi> but to disagree in some things from such particular <hi>Churches.</hi> As I hope you will not say, That man is divided from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, who doth in some feature or other differ from any one particular man; but, although he doth so, he doth not differ from any in those things, which are common to all; for that were to differ from all; but when he only differs from one in the colour of his eyes, from another in his complexion, another in the air of his countenance, and so in other things; this man, though he should differ from every particular man in the world in something or other, yet is a man still as well as any, because he agrees with them in that in which they all agree, which is, Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and differs only in those things wherein they differ from each other. And therefore from the disagreement of the <hi>Protestants</hi> from any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:101069:191"/>
                  <hi>Church,</hi> it by no means follows, that they separated from the whole Christian World, and therefore from the true <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> 2. The Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is not to be measured by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinions and practices of all, or any particular <hi>Churches,</hi> but by such things which are the proper <hi>Foundations</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> For there can be no separation from the true <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but in such things wherein it is <hi>Catholick</hi>; now it is not <hi>Catholick</hi> in any thing, but what properly relates to its Being and Constitution. For whatever else there is, however universal it may be, is extrinsecal to the nature and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and therefore supposing a separation from the <hi>Church,</hi> in what is so extrinsecal and accidental, it is no proper separation from the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> As for Instance; supposing all men were agreed, that some particular <hi>habit</hi> should be worn all over the world, will you say, That any number of men who found this habit extremely inconvenient for them, and therefore should disuse it, did on that account separate from humane nature, and ceased to be men by it? Such is the case of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Churches</hi> laying aside some customes or ceremonies, which in some one age of the <hi>Church,</hi> or more, the greatest part of <hi>Christian Churches</hi> were agreed in the practice of; for, although this general practice should make men more diligent in enquiry, and careful in what they did; yet if such a <hi>Church</hi> having power to govern it self, see reason to alter it, it doth not separate from the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> therein, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not cease to be a <hi>Church.</hi> For there is no culpable separation from the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> but what relates to it properly as <hi>Catholick</hi>; now that doth not relate to it as <hi>Catholick,</hi> which it may be <hi>Catholick</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, now certainly you cannot have so little reason as to assert, that the <hi>Church</hi> cannot be <hi>Catholick</hi> without such extrinsecal and accidental agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And from hence it follows, That no <hi>Church</hi> can be charged with a separation from the true <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but what may be proved to separate it self in some thing necessary to the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; and so long as it doth not separate as to these essentials, it cannot cease to be a true member of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> If you would therefore prove, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> upon the Reformation, is separated from the true <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; you must not think it enough to say, (which as weakly as commonly is said) <hi>That no one particular Church can be named, which in all things agreed with it</hi>; for that only proves, that she differed from particular <hi>Churches</hi> in such things wherein they differed from each other, but that she is divided from all Christian <hi>Churches</hi> in such things wherein they are all agreed, and which are essential to the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi>; when you have proved this, you may expect a further Answer.</p>
               <p>This then can be no cause why your <hi>Church</hi> should expel the <hi>Protestants</hi> out of her Communion,<note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> but it shews us sufficient cause to believe that your <hi>Church</hi> had separated her self from the Communion of the <hi>Catholick.</hi> For which we must further consider, that although nothing separates a <hi>Church</hi> properly from the <hi>Catholick,</hi> but what is contrary to the <hi>Being</hi> of it; yet a <hi>Church</hi> may separate her self from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> by taking upon her to make such things the necessary conditions of her Communion, which never were the conditions of Communion with the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> As for Instance, Though we should grant, <hi>Adoration of the Eucharist, Invocation of Saints,</hi> and <hi>Veneration of Images</hi> to be only superstitious practices taken up without sufficient grounds in the <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:101069:191"/>
yet since it appears, that the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> was free for many hundred years, without approving or using these things; that <hi>Church</hi> which shall not only publickly <hi>use,</hi> but <hi>enjoyn</hi> such things upon pain of excommunication from the <hi>Church,</hi> doth, as much as in her lyes, draw the bounds of <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> within her self, and so divides her self from the <hi>true Catholick Church.</hi> For, whatever <hi>confines,</hi> must likewise <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi> the <hi>Church</hi>; for by that confinement a separation is made between the part confined, and the other, which separation must be made by the party so limiting <hi>Christian</hi> Communion. As it was in the case of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,</hi> who were therefore justly charged with <hi>Schism,</hi> because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> within their own bounds: And if any other <hi>Church</hi> doth the same which they did, it must be liable to the same charge which they were. The summ then of this discourse is, That the <hi>Being</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> lyes in <hi>Essentials,</hi> that for a particular <hi>Church</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree from all other particular <hi>Churches</hi> in some extrinsecal and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal things, is not to separate from the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> so as to cease to be a <hi>Church</hi>; but still, whatever <hi>Church</hi> makes such extrinsecal things the necessary conditions of Communion, so as to cast men out of the <hi>Church,</hi> who yield not to them, is <hi>Schismatical</hi> in so doing; for it thereby divides it self from the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>: and the separation from it, is so far from being <hi>Schism,</hi> that being cast out of that <hi>Church</hi> on those terms only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns them to the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> On which grounds it will appear, that yours is the <hi>Schismatical Church,</hi> and not ours. For, although before this imposing humour came into particular <hi>Churches, Schism</hi> was defined by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and others, to be <hi>a voluntary departure out of the Church,</hi> yet that cannot in reason be understood of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but the <hi>true Catholick Church</hi>; for not only persons, but <hi>Churches</hi> may depart from the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; and in such cases, not those who depart from the Communion of such <hi>Churches,</hi> but those <hi>Churches,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the <hi>Catholick,</hi> are guilty of the <hi>Schism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things I thought necessary to be further explained, not only to shew, how false that imputation is, of our <hi>Churches</hi> departing from the true <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but with what great reason we charge your <hi>Church</hi> with departing from the Communion of it; and therefore not those whom you thrust out of Communion, but your <hi>Church</hi> so thrusting them out, is apparently guilty of the present <hi>Schism.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">P. 147. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>but that some of the errours of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church were dangerous to salvation. For it is not every light errour in disputable Doctrine and points of curious speculation, that can be a just cause of separation, in that admirable body of Christ, which is his Church, or of one member of it from another. But, that there are errours in Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and some of them such as most manifestly endanger salvation in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>is evident to them that will not shut their eyes. The proof</hi> (his Lordship saith) <hi>runs through the particular points, and so is too long for this discourse.</hi> Now to this you manfully answer, <hi>That in vain do they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reform the Church of what she can never be guilty.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 160.</note> Which, if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on your <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> (which is largely disproved already) must needs fall to the ground with it. And it is an excellent Answer when a <hi>Church</hi> is charged actually with erring, to say, <hi>She doth not erre,</hi> because <hi>she cannot:</hi> Which is all that you give us here. But if you prove it no better than you have done, the <hi>Heretical</hi> and <hi>Schismatical obstinacy</hi> is like to be found in that <hi>Church</hi> which in her errours challenges <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Question now comes to this, <hi>Whether, errours being supposed in the Doctrine, and corruptions in the Communion of a Church, when the General Church would not reform, it was not lawful for particular Churches to reform themselves?</hi> To this his Lordship answers affirmatively, in these words. <hi>Is it then such a strange thing, that a particular Church may reform it self, if the general will not?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 149. sect. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>I had thought, and do so still, that in point of Reformation of either Manners or Doctrine, it is lawful for the Church, since Christ, to do as the Church before Christ did, and might do. The Church before Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of Jews and Proselytes: This Church came to have a separation, upon a most ungodly Policy of</hi> Jeroboams, <hi>so that it never pieced together again. To a Common Council to reform all, they would not come. Was it not lawful for</hi> Judah <hi>to reform her self, when</hi> Israel <hi>would not joyn? Sure it was, or else the Prophet deceives me, that sayes expresly, Though</hi> Israel <hi>transgress, yet let not Judah sin.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 4.15.</note> 
                  <hi>And S.</hi> Hierom <hi>expounds it of this very particular sin of Heresie and Errour in Religion.</hi> After which he proves, <hi>That</hi> Israel, <hi>during this Separation, was a true Church,</hi> which we shall insist on, when we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered what Answer you return to his Lordships Argument; which lyes in these two things; First, <hi>That</hi> Judah <hi>did not reform her self.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That</hi> Judah <hi>is not the Protestant party,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 160. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>as his Lordship supposeth it to be.</hi> First, You say, <hi>Judah did not reform her self. For</hi> Juda <hi>being the orthodox Church, united with her Head the High Priest, and not tainted with any Doctrinal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, What need was there of her Reformation? And so the meaning of that place, Though</hi> Israel <hi>transgress, yet let not</hi> Juda <hi>sin, is rather against, than for him, because the sense is rather, Let not</hi> Juda <hi>fall into Schism, though</hi> Israel <hi>does, than, let</hi> Judah <hi>reform her self.</hi> But if it appears that <hi>Judah</hi> had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions crept into her, as well as <hi>Israel</hi> had, though not so great, and
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:101069:193"/>
universal, then it follows, that by these words <hi>Judah</hi> had power to reform her self. And the antecedent is clear to any one who takes the pains to read the Scripture, and compare the places in it, more than it seems you do. For,<note place="margin">Hos. 6.4.7.</note> Doth not this very Prophet check <hi>Judah</hi> as well as <hi>Israel for transgressing Gods Covenant?</hi> Doth he not say,<note place="margin">Hos. 12.2.</note> 
                  <hi>That God had a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie with</hi> Judah, <hi>and would punish</hi> Jacob <hi>according to his waies?</hi> And for all this, Was there no need of Reformation in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Judah?</hi> Indeed in one place it is said, <hi>That</hi> Judah <hi>ruleth with God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 11.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and is faithful with his Saints</hi>; but then that is to be understood of <hi>Judah,</hi> when she had reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her self in the daies of <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> for surely you will not say, That <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> did not stand in need of Reformation, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> began his Reign; for it is said of him, <hi>That he removed the high places, and brake the Images, and cut down the groves.</hi> And were not these,<note place="margin">2 King 18.4.</note> things which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reformation, think you? If we consider the times of those three <hi>Kings</hi> before <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in which <hi>Hosea</hi> prophesied; we shall see,<note place="margin">Hos. 1.1.</note> what need there was of Reformation among them, and those were <hi>Vzziah, Jotham,</hi> and <hi>Ahaz</hi>; of the time of <hi>Vzziah</hi> called <hi>Azariah,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Kings</hi> it is said, <hi>That the high places were not removed, but the people sacrificed and burnt Incense still on the high places</hi>;<note place="margin">2 King. 15.4. v. 35.</note> the same is affirmed of the time of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> in the same Chapter; so that though these <hi>Princes</hi> were good them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet there were many <hi>corruptions</hi> still among the people. But of <hi>Ahaz</hi> it is said expresly, <hi>That he walked in the way of the Kings of</hi> Israel; <hi>and he sacrificed and burnt Incense in the high places, and on the hills,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 16.3, 4</note> 
                  <hi>and under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rygreen tree.</hi> Chuse now which of these three you please (for it is most improbable those words, considering the long time of <hi>Hosea</hi>'s Prophecy, should be spoken in the time of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the last of the four <hi>Kings</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied under) And will you tell us again, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Judah <hi>needed no Reformation?</hi> But you offer at a reason for it, <hi>Because she was united with her Head the High-Priest at</hi> Hierusalem. So then, belike as long as <hi>Judah</hi> and the <hi>High-Priest</hi> were united, she could be guilty of no Doctrinal Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: No, not although she should pronounce <hi>Christ</hi> a blasphemer, and condemn him to be crucified as a malefactor; for then certainly <hi>Judah</hi> and the <hi>High-Priest</hi> were united. But, I know you will say, <hi>You spake this of the time before the Messias was come.</hi> And was it then true,<note place="margin">2 King. 16.10, 11.</note> that <hi>as long as</hi> Judah <hi>was united with her Head, the High-Priest, there was no need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?</hi> What think you then of the time of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> when <hi>Vzziah</hi> the <hi>Priest built an Altar at the command of</hi> Ahaz, <hi>according to the pattern of the Altar of</hi> Damascus, contrary to Gods express Law: yet, according to you, <hi>as long as</hi> Judah <hi>was united with her Head, the High-Priest,</hi> there was nothing which needed Reformation. And, although it be plainly affirmed, that <hi>Judah kept not the commands of the Lord their God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 17.19.</note> 
                  <hi>but walked in the statutes of</hi> Israel <hi>which they had made</hi>; yet you, who, it seems, knew <hi>Judah</hi>'s Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency better than <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Prophets</hi> did, say very magisterially, That as long as she was united with her Head the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> What need, I pray, was there of her Reformation? And this being the case of <hi>Judah,</hi> I may easily grant you, <hi>That</hi> Judah <hi>is not the Protestant party, but that of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church,</hi> i. e. <hi>while</hi> Judah <hi>was under her corruptions; and yet, you say, She needed no Reformation,</hi> she is the fittest parallel you could think of for your <hi>Church</hi>; but we pretend to no parallel between <hi>Judah</hi> and the <hi>Protestant</hi> party, in <hi>not needing a Reformation,</hi> but in her <hi>power</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her self. Which we say still, that she had, <hi>though</hi> Israel <hi>would not joyn with her,</hi> by virtue of these words of the <hi>Prophet, Though</hi> Israel <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:101069:194"/>
yet let not</hi> Judah <hi>sin:</hi> thereby manifesting, that though the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part was degenerated in the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> yet <hi>Judah</hi> might prevent the same in her self, by reforming those abuses which were crept among them; And therefore the sense of those words, <hi>Let not</hi> Judah <hi>sin,</hi> must in this case imply <hi>a power to reform her self.</hi> If therefore we speak of <hi>Judah degenerated,</hi> we grant the parallel lyes wholly between <hi>Judah</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; for, although there were great corruptions in <hi>Judah,</hi> and as great in your <hi>Church,</hi> yet with the same reason you say, That <hi>neither needed Reformation</hi>: But if we speak of <hi>Judah reforming her self</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> then we say, The parallel lyes between <hi>Judah,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant party</hi>; whatever you say to the contrary.

Who are of</hi> Jeroboams <hi>Cabal?</hi> Even they who set up the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel:</hi> Such who worship <hi>Images</hi> instead of the true <hi>God</hi>; though they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them only as <hi>Symbols</hi> of the <hi>Divine Presence</hi>; for no more did <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> intend by their <hi>Calves,</hi> and there is no pretence which you use to justifie your selves from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but will excuse <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> and the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> from it. If the <hi>Protestant party</hi> then be <hi>Judah</hi>; it is easie finding out the revolted <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> and <hi>Jeroboams Cabal,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> answering to this, as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth to the other. <hi>But we cannot be</hi> Judah, <hi>because we left the Catholick</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>that is</hi> Rome <hi>the City of Peace:</hi> By whom, I pray, was <hi>Rome christened,</hi> The <hi>Catholick Jerusalem?</hi> For if we consider the worship there used, and the politick ends of it, it much more looks like <hi>Samaria,</hi> or <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> If <hi>Rome</hi> be our <hi>Catholick Jerusalem,</hi> shew us, When <hi>God</hi> made choice of that, for the peculiar place of his <hi>Worship?</hi> Where we are commanded to resort thither for Divine Worship? When <hi>God</hi> placed his <hi>Name</hi> there, as he did of old in <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> When you have shewed us these things, we may think the worse of our selves for leaving <hi>Rome,</hi> but not before. And, let the world judge, Whether it be more likely one should meet with the worship of <hi>Golden Calves</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or among the <hi>Protestants?</hi> It is you who have found out <hi>new Sacrifices, new Objects of Worship, new Rites and Ceremonies</hi> in it, <hi>new Altars,</hi> and consequently <hi>new Priests</hi> too; and yet for all this, you must be <hi>orthodox</hi> Judah, <hi>which needed no Reformation?</hi> And who, I pray, do in point of obedience most resemble the <hi>ten Tribes?</hi> Have not you set up a <hi>spiritual Jeroboam,</hi> as a new <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>David?</hi> And that you may advance the Interest of this <hi>spiritual Head,</hi> you raise his authority far above that of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Temporal Princes,</hi> whom you ought to be subject to; declaring it in his power to excommunicate, depose, and absolve subjects from obedience to them. And therefore is not the parallel between the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> very pat, and much to the purpose? But when you would seem to return this upon us by a false and scurrilous parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jeroboam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 161:</note> and that <hi>excellent Princess Queen Elizabeth</hi> in the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> you only betray the badness of your cause, which makes detractions so necessary to maintain it: For as her <hi>title</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> was undoubted, so her <hi>proceedings</hi> in the <hi>Reformation</hi> were such as are warranted by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Nation</hi>; and her carriage in her reign towards <hi>Jesuits</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> no other than what the apparent necessity of her own and her <hi>Kingdoms</hi> preservation put her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if she must be accounted like <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> for <hi>banishing Priests and Jesuits</hi> often convicted of treasonable practices, upon pain of death if they

were found in <hi>England</hi>; What must we think of the <hi>Catholick Jerusalem the City of Peace,</hi> that sweet and gentle Mother the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that hath carried her self so peaceably towards those who have dissented from her? Witness the blood of so many hundred thousands which she hath imbrued her hands in, meerly for opposing her doctrines and superstitions; witness that excellent <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Humanity</hi> the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> and the easie <hi>Lessons</hi> she teaches those who come under her discipline there; witness the <hi>proceedings</hi> in <hi>England</hi> in the daies of <hi>Queen Mary</hi>; and then let any judge if the parallel must be carried by cruelty towards dissenters, which of their two <hi>Reigns</hi> came the nearest that of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> The only true words then that you say, are, <hi>but enough of this parallel</hi>; and more than enough too of such impudent slanders against the memory of that <hi>famous Queen:</hi> But your <hi>Church</hi> would have been more unlike the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> if there had not been a <hi>lying Prophet</hi> there.</p>
               <p>You dispute very manfully against his Lordship, for asserting, <hi>That</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>remained a Church after the separation between</hi> Judah <hi>and the ten Tribes</hi>;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and yet, after you have spent many words about it, you yield all that he asserts; when you say,<note place="margin">P. 162.</note> 
                  <hi>That in a general sense they were called the people of God, as they were</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed, according to the flesh, by reason of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to</hi> Abraham, <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</hi> And what is there more than this, that his Lordship contends for? for he never dreamt that the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> were <hi>Abraham's seed according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>; but only sayes, <hi>That there was salvation for those thousands that had not bowed their knees to</hi> Baal, <hi>which cannot be in the ordinary way where there is no Church.</hi> And if, as you say, <hi>Abrahams seed only according to the Spirit,</hi> i. e. the <hi>faithful</hi> make <hi>the true Church</hi>; then it follows, Where there were so many faithful, there must needs be a <hi>true Church.</hi> And thus for any thing you have said to the contrary, his Lordships argument from the case of <hi>Judah</hi> holds for every particular <hi>Churches</hi> power to reform it self, when the <hi>General</hi> will not reform.</p>
               <p>His Lordship further argues,<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That to reform what is amiss in Doctrine or Manners, is as lawful for a particular Church,</hi>

                  <hi>as it is to publish and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate any thing that is Catholick in either. And your Question,</hi> Qu√¥ ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice? <hi>lies alike against both. And yet, I think,</hi> saith he, <hi>It may be proved, that the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and that as a particular Church, did promulgate an orthodox truth, which was not then Catholickly admitted in the Church; namely, the procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son. If she erred in this fact, confess her errour; if she erred not, Why may not another particular Church do as she did?</hi> From whence he inferrs, <hi>That if a particular Church may publish any thing that is Catholick where the whole Church is silent; it may reform any thing that is not Catholick, where the whole Church is negligent, or will not.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 162<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> n. 3.</note> Now to this you answer, 1. <hi>That this procession from the Son, was a truth alwaies acknowledged in the Church</hi>; but what concerns that,<note place="margin">P. 164.</note> 
                  <hi>and the time of this Article being inserted into the Creed,</hi> have been so amply discussed already, that I shall not cloy the reader with any repetition, having fully considered whatever you here say concerning the Article it self<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  <note place="margin">P. 163.</note> or its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Creed. 2. You answer, <hi>That the consequence will not hold, that if a particular Church may in some case promulgate an orthodox truth, not as yet Catholickly received by the Church, then a particular Church may repeal, or reverse any thing that the whole Church hath already Catholickly and definitively received? Surely no. Yet this</hi> (say you) <hi>is his Lordships, and the Protestants case.</hi> You do well to mention an <hi>egregious fallacy</hi> presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:101069:195"/>
these words; for surely this is so. For doth his Lordship parallel the <hi>promulgating</hi> something <hi>Catholick,</hi> and <hi>repealing</hi> something <hi>Catholick</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Surely no. But the <hi>promulgating</hi> something true, but not <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi> received with the <hi>reforming</hi> something not <hi>Catholick.</hi> Either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had a mind to abuse his Lordships words, or to deceive the reader by beging the thing in Question, <hi>viz. that all those which we call for a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, were things Catholickly and definitively received by the whole Church:</hi> which you know we utterly deny. But you go on, and say, <hi>That thence it follows not, that a particular Church may reform any thing that is not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, where the whole Church is negligent, or will not, because this would suppose errour, or something uncatholick, to be taught or admitted by the whole Church.</hi> To put this case a little more plainly by the former Instance; Suppose then that the Worship of <hi>God</hi> under the symbols of the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> had been received generally as the visible worship of the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as well as the rest; Doth not this Answer of yours make it impossible that ever they should return to the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>God?</hi> For this were to call in question the truth of <hi>Gods Promise</hi> to his <hi>Church</hi>; and <hi>to suppose something not Catholick to be received by the whole Church.</hi> And so the greater the <hi>corruptions</hi> are, the more impossible it is to cure them; and in case they spread generally, no attempts of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation can be lawful: which is a more false and paradoxical Doctrine than either of those which you call so. And the truth is, such pretences as these are, are fit only for a <hi>Church</hi> that hateth to be reformed; for if something not good in it self, should happen in any one age to overspread the visible Communion of all particular <hi>Churches,</hi> this only makes a Reformation the more necessary; so far is it from making it the more disputable. For thereby those corruptions grow more dangerous, and every particular <hi>Church</hi> is bound the more to regard its own security in a time of general Infection. And if any other <hi>Churches</hi> neglect themselves, What reason is it that the rest should? For, any or all other particular <hi>Churches</hi> neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty, is no more an argument, that no particular <hi>Church</hi> should reform it self, than that if all other men in a <hi>Town</hi> neglect preserving themselves from the Plague, then I am bound to neglect it too. But you answer, 3. <hi>That all this doth not justifie the Protestants proceedings, because they promulged only new and unheard of Doctrines, directly contrary to what the Catholick Church universally held and taught before them for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Truths.</hi> This is the great thing in Question; but I see, you love best the lazy trade of begging things, which are impossible to be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved.</p>

                  <hi>For about the year of our Lord</hi> 1517. <hi>when their pretended Reformations began,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>was not the real presence of our Saviours body and blood in the Eucharist, by a true substantial change of Bread and Wine, generally held by the whole Church? Was not the real Sacrifice of the Mass then generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? Was not Veneration of Holy Images, Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, Praying for the dead, that they might be eased of their pains, and receive the full remission of their sins generally used and practised by all Christians? Was not Free will, Merit of good works, and Justification by Charity, or inherent Grace, and not by Faith only, universally taught and believed in all Churches of Christendom? Yea even among those who in some few other points dissented from the Pope, and the Latin Church? To what purpose then doth the Bishop urge, that a particular Church may publish any thing that is Catholick? This
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:101069:195"/>
doth not justifie at all his Reformation; he should prove that it may not only add, but take away something that is Catholick from the Doctrine of the Church; for this the pretended Reformers did, as well in</hi> England <hi>as elsewhere.</hi> His Lordship never pretends, much less disputes, that any particular <hi>Church</hi> hath a power to take away any thing that is truly <hi>Catholick</hi>; but the ground why he supposeth, such things as those mentioned by you, might be taken away, is, because they are not <hi>Catholick</hi>; the Question then is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, Whether they were <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> or not: this you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove by this <hi>medium, Because they were generally held by the whole Church at the time of the Reformation.</hi> To which I answer, 1. If this be a certain measure to judge by, what was <hi>Catholick</hi> and what not; then what doth not appear to have been <hi>Catholick</hi> in this sense, it was in our <hi>Churches</hi> power to reject, and so it was lawful to reform our selves as to all such things which were not at the time of the <hi>Reformation</hi> received by the whole <hi>Church.</hi> And what think you now of the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> the <hi>necessity of Coelibate in the Clergy, Communion in one kind, Prayer in an unknown tongue, Indulgences, &amp;c.</hi> Will you say, That those were generally received by the <hi>Church</hi> at the time of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If you could have said so, no doubt you would not have omitted such necessary points, and some of which gave the first occasion to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> If then these were not <hi>Catholickly</hi> received, a particular <hi>Church</hi> might without <hi>Schism</hi> reject them, and so the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is sufficiently vindicated from <hi>Schism</hi> by your self, as to these points here mentioned; which you willingly omitted, because you could not but know how far they were from being universally received in all <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Christendom?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to those things which you insist on, you give no sufficient evidence at all, that they were received by the <hi>whole Church as Catholick Doctrines.</hi> For, so far it is from appearing, that these were held as <hi>Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> by all <hi>Churches</hi> in the Christian world (for then you do most unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably condemn the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Abyssine Churches, &amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Schism,</hi> if they owned all <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi>; and they must do so, if they agreed with your <hi>Church</hi> in all these things which are the only Doctrines you mention as <hi>Catholick,</hi> in opposition to such whom you condemn for <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Schism</hi>; and if the agreement of all <hi>Churches</hi> be the measure of what is <hi>Catholick,</hi> then those Doctrines cannot be so, which those great <hi>Churches</hi> differ from you in, by your own argument) but, so far is it, I say, from appearing, that these were held so by all <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> that you cannot prove they were so held in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> her self, before the Reformation. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> I take here in the largest sense, as it takes in all such who were the visible members of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Now, I hope you will not say, that such <hi>Doctrines</hi> are received as <hi>Catholick Doctrines,</hi> which are imbraced only by a party in <hi>your Church,</hi> another party opposing it, both which still remain members of your Communion; for whatever is received as a <hi>Catholick Doctrine</hi> (according to you) is so received, that those who deny or doubt of it, do thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no members of the visible Communion of that <hi>Church</hi>; which is by the <hi>Churches</hi> so declaring her self in those points, that she admits none to her Communion, but upon the acknowledgement of them. Now, Will you say, This was the case of your <hi>Church,</hi> as to these Doctrines at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Reformation?</hi> Were <hi>Transubstantiation, real Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass, Veneration of Images, Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> so defined

then by your <hi>Church</hi> to be Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> that whoever did not assent to them, was declared excommunicate, and cast out of your <hi>Church?</hi> If not, it is impossible, upon your own grounds, to prove, that these were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally held and believed as <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi> I do not say, As <hi>truly Catholick Doctrines</hi> in themselves; for, whatever your <hi>Church</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines concerning them, they are not more or less so in themselves for your <hi>Churches</hi> definition; but, I say, you cannot assert that these were held by your <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Catholick Doctrines,</hi> till they were defined to be such. For, according to your principles, that which differenceth a <hi>Catholick Doctrine</hi> from a particular Opinion, is the <hi>Churches Definition</hi>; before then the <hi>Church</hi> had passed a definition in these points, they could not be held as <hi>Catholick Doctrines.</hi> To make this somewhat clearer, because it is necessary for undeceiving those who are told, as you tell us here, That at the Reformation we rejected such things which were universally own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Catholick Doctrines,</hi> which is so far from being true, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should be owned for such by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> upon your own principles. For, I pray, tell us, Are there not several sorts of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among you at this day, none of which are pretended to be <hi>Catholick Doctrines?</hi> and this you constantly tell us, when we object to you your dissentions about them. As for Instance, the <hi>Popes personal Infallibility,</hi> the <hi>Superiority of Pope over General Councils,</hi> the <hi>Immaculate Conception</hi> of the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> the Disputes about <hi>Praedestination, &amp;c.</hi> when we tell you of your differences in these points, you answer, That these hinder not the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> because these are only in matters of Opinion; and that it is not <hi>de fide,</hi> that men should hold either way. When we demand the reason of this difference concerning these things, your Answer is, <hi>That the Church hath defined some things to be believed, and not others; that what the Church hath defined, is to be looked on as Catholick Doctrine, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyers of it are guilty of Heresie; but where the Church hath not defined, those are not Catholick Doctrines, but only at best but pious Opinions, and men may be good Catholicks, and yet differ about them.</hi> I pray, tell me, Is this your Doctrine, or, is it not? If not, there may be <hi>Hereticks</hi> within your <hi>Church,</hi> as well as without: if it be your Doctrine, apply it to the matters in hand. Were these things defined by the <hi>Church</hi> at the beginning of the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> If they were, produce those <hi>Definitions</hi> for all those things which you say were owned as <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> then: that we may see, that at least in the judgement of your <hi>Church</hi> they were accounted so. Tell us, when and where those Doctrines were defined before the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi> and, I hope you will not say, that was before the beginning of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> If then there were no such definitions concerning them, they could not by your <hi>Church</hi> be accounted as <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi>; at the most, they could be but only <hi>pious Opinions,</hi> as that of the <hi>Popes Infallibility</hi> among you is, and consequently men might be <hi>Catholicks</hi> still, though they dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or denied them. And how then come the <hi>Protestants</hi> to be accounted <hi>Hereticks</hi> in their <hi>Reformation,</hi> if upon your own principles, those things which they denied were then no <hi>Catholick Doctrines:</hi> Though you should therefore prove more than you have done, That these points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> were generally received at the time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> yet that by no means proves that they were <hi>Catholick Doctrines,</hi> unless you make it impossible that meer <hi>Opinions</hi> should be generally received in your <hi>Church.</hi> For, if any thing may be generally received in the nature of an <hi>Opinion,</hi> you cannot prove from the bare general reception, that it was a <hi>Catholick
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:101069:196"/>
Doctrine:</hi> unless you would attempt to prove it by the notion under which it was received, Whether as an Opinion, or a <hi>Catholick Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then you must remember to prove these things, 1. That all those who did receive it, received it under that <hi>notion</hi>; as for instance,<note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> In any one of those Articles by you mentioned, <hi>Transubstantiation, Invocation of Saints, &amp;c.</hi> you must first prove, That all who were in your <hi>Churche's</hi> Communion did believe those things; which it is impossible for you to do, unless you could prove, that none could be of your <hi>Church,</hi> unless they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them; which is again impossible to be done, unless your <hi>Church</hi> had so defined those things, that they ceased to be members of it who did not believe them. Thus, we see, your first task is rendred impossible, <hi>viz.</hi> to know, Whether all in your <hi>Church</hi> held these Doctrines or no; but, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you knew this, it falls short of your purpose, unless you can prove, that all those who held these things, did not hold them as bare Opinions, but as <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi>; and this is again as impossible as the former; for, How can you tell, whether they judged these things to be so, unless you knew what their <hi>Rule</hi> was whereby they judged of <hi>Catholick Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines</hi>? If you knew their Rule, How can you tell, Whether they made a right <hi>Vse</hi> of it or no? or, Whether they made any Use at all of it? or, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did not take up such Opinions by prejudice, education, the judgement of others, and several other waies, without examining of what nature or importance the things were. If you think you have a certain Rule to judge of <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> by, you must prove that they had the same Rule, and looked upon it as such too: otherwise they might not use it for those ends, nor be governed at all by it. When you will therefore prove any Doctrines to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> by being generally received, you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what brave impossibilities you have undertaken. But, suppose you could master this too, and prove, that men generally received these as <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi>; yet, before you can prove, that these are <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> from thence, you have a further task yet upon you, which is, to prove it impossible that these men should be <hi>out</hi> in their judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of an Opinion, and that they could not look on any thing as a <hi>Catholick Doctrine,</hi> but what was really so. For, if they may be mistaken in their judgement, we are as far to seek as ever, for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what are <hi>Catholick Doctrines,</hi> and what not. You must therefore prove the judgement of all these persons <hi>infallible</hi> concerning what are <hi>Catholick Doctrines,</hi> and what not: And by that time, the <hi>Pope</hi> will return you little thanks for your pains, in making every member of your <hi>Church</hi> as <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> as himself. If it be then so impossible to prove, that these were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as <hi>Catholick Doctrines,</hi> either from any definition of your <hi>Church,</hi> or from the general reception of them among the members of it, you see, what little reason you had to say, <hi>That the Protestants at the beginning of the Reformation, did take away something that was Catholick from the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church.</hi> Which is notoriously false and inconsistent with your own principles. If we should therefore grant, that <hi>Transubstantiation, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, &amp;c. were generally owned in your Church at the time of the Reformation,</hi> the utmost you can prove, is, only that they were owned as <hi>particular Doctrines</hi> by particular men, but not that they were owned as the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrines</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore we deny not, but that <hi>party</hi> and <hi>faction</hi> in your <hi>Church</hi> which owned and contended for these, had got the upper-hand of the other, before the time of the Reformation, so that those who doubted of, or denied them, durst not appear so publickly as

their adversaries did; but they were but a <hi>party,</hi> and a <hi>faction</hi> still, and there were many outward members of your <hi>Church,</hi> who groaned under the abuses and tyrannies of the prevailing <hi>faction,</hi> and call'd loud for a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> As appeared not only by the open testimonies of some against such Doctrines; the sad complaint of others for want of Reformation; but by the general sense of the necessity of it, at the time when it was set upon, the great applause it met with among all persons who allowed themselves liberty to enquire into things, the general consent of the main bodies of those who set about reforming themselves in the main Articles of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>unanimous opposition</hi> to those erroneous Opinions which you call <hi>Catholick Doctrines.</hi> So that these were not at the time of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, so much as the owned <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; but the Opinions of a <hi>prevailing Faction</hi> in it: and therefore the disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, is no rejecting any thing <hi>Catholick,</hi> but rejecting the opinions and practices of a tyrannical and usurping Faction. There must be then a great deal of difference put between the State and Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the beginning of the Reformation, and since, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> For then these <hi>Doctrines</hi> were owned by a <hi>Faction,</hi> but yet there might have been communion with that <hi>Church,</hi> without believing them to be <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi>; and no doubt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pious souls went to Heaven without believing any of these things, (<hi>viz.</hi> such who believed and improved the common principles of <hi>Christianity,</hi> without regarding the erroneous Doctrines, or superstitious Practices of those among whom they lived) but upon the first stirrings towards a <hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was so far from reforming the abuses which were complained of, that they sought to inforce them with the greatest severity upon all persons, thundering out Excommunications against all such who should question or dispute them. By which means those who might have lived peaceably before within the external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that <hi>Church,</hi> without consenting to the errours of it, are now forced out of it, unless they would approve of such things which their consciences detested; in comparison with the peace of which, they accounted not their lives to be dear to them, as many thousands of them made it appear in several Countries. This is the true and just account of the state of things at the beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi>; but afterwards, when, through the necessity of the <hi>Pope's</hi> affairs, a <hi>Council</hi> was summoned, and all the arts imaginable were made use of, to steer that grand affair for the <hi>Interess</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; a new <hi>scene</hi> of affairs appears in the <hi>Christian</hi> world: those Doctrines which before were owned only by particular men, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> to be the <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and all those <hi>Anathematized</hi> who will not own them. By which means the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is become it self that <hi>party</hi> and <hi>faction,</hi> which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed in it before but with reluctancy and opposition; and now, none are looked on as members of that <hi>Church,</hi> but such as own the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of that <hi>Council</hi> in point of Doctrine. Which makes it vastly to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from what it was before, as to the terms of its Communion, and the state of the persons who remain in it; who can neither enjoy that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in judgement which they might use before, nor yet can pretend those excuses for not knowing the errours and corruptions of that <hi>Church,</hi> which might have prevented obstinacy in them before. So that upon the whole it appears, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> were so far from taking away any thing that was received as a <hi>Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:101069:197"/>
by all <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> that they did not reject any thing which could be looked on as the <hi>Catholick Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; and consequently that the <hi>Protestants</hi> were so far from a wilful separation from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were driven out by a prevalent <hi>Faction,</hi> which imposed those things which had been before only the errours of particular persons, as the <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> and the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary conditions of Communion with her.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I may answer yet further, That it is not enough to prove any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> that it was generally received by <hi>Christian Churches</hi> in any one <hi>Age</hi>; but it must be made appear, to have been so received from the <hi>Apostles times.</hi> So that if we should grant, that these <hi>Doctrines</hi> were owned for <hi>Catholick,</hi> not only by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but all other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches</hi> (so far as it can be discerned by their Communion) yet this doth not prove these Doctrines so owned to be <hi>truly Catholick,</hi> unless you can first prove, that all the <hi>Christian Churches of one Age</hi> can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Doctrine to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> which is not so. You see therefore your task increases further upon you: for, it is not enough to say, That <hi>A. D.</hi> 1517. such and such Doctrines were looked on as <hi>Catholick,</hi> and therefore they were so; but that for 1517. years, successively from the <hi>Apostles</hi> to that time, they were judged to be so, and then we shall more easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you. When you will therefore prove <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mass, Image-worship, Invocation of Saints,</hi> or any other of the good Doctrines mentioned by you, in a constant tradition from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times to have been looked on as <hi>Catholick Doctrines,</hi> you may then say, That <hi>Protestants</hi> in denying these, did take away something <hi>Catholick</hi> from the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi>; but, till that time, these Answers may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly suffice.</p>
               <p>We now come closer to the business of the <hi>Reformation</hi>; but,<note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note> before we examine the particulars of it, the <hi>general grounds</hi> on which it proceeded, must somewhat further be cleared, which his Lordship tells you, are built <hi>upon the power of particular Churches reforming themselves, in case the whole Church is negligent, or will not</hi>; to which you say,<note place="margin">P. 164. n. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That you grant in effect as great power as the Bishop himself does, to particular Churches, to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Provincial Councils, in reforming errours and abuses either of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or practice: only we require that they proceed with due respect to the chief Pastor of the Church, and have recourse to him in all matters and decrees of Faith, especially when they define or declare points not generally known and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be Catholick Truths.</hi> What you grant <hi>in effect</hi> at first, you <hi>in effect</hi> deny again afterwards. For the Question is about Reformation of such errours and abuses as may come from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; and when you grant a power to reform only, in case the <hi>Pope</hi> consent, you grant no power to reform at all. For the experience of the world hath sufficiently taught us, How little his consent is to be expected in any thing of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. For his Lordship truly saith, in Answer to <hi>Capellus,</hi> who denies particular <hi>Churches</hi> any power of making <hi>Canons</hi> of Faith, without consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Roman See,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 151. n. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>That as</hi> Capellus <hi>can never prove that the</hi> Roman <hi>See must be consulted with before any Reformation be made: So it is as certain, that, were it proved and practised, we should have no Reformation. For it would be long enough before the Church should be cured, if that See alone should be her Physitian, which in truth is her disease.</hi> Now to this you say, <hi>That even</hi> Capellus <hi>himself requires this:</hi> as though <hi>Capellus</hi> were not the man whom his Lordship answers as to this very thing. But besides you say,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:101069:198"/>
                  <hi>The practise of the Church is evident for it, in the examples of the Milevitan and Carthaginian Councils, which, as St.</hi> Austin <hi>witnesseth, sent their decrees touching Grace, Original sin in Infants, and other matters against</hi> Pelagius, <hi>to be confirmed by the Pope:</hi> but what is all this to the business of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that nothing of that nature is to be attempted without the <hi>Popes</hi> consent? That these <hi>Councils</hi> did by <hi>Julius</hi> an <hi>African Bishop</hi> communicate their decrees to <hi>Pope Innocent,</hi> Who denyes? but, what is it you would thence infer to your purpose? for the utmost which can be drawn hence, is, that they desired the <hi>Pope</hi> to contribute his assistance in condemning <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Coelestius</hi>; by adding the authority of the <hi>Apostolical See</hi> to their decrees: that so by the consent of the <hi>Church</hi> that growing Heresie might the more easily be suppressed. And who denyes but at that time the <hi>Roman Church</hi> had great reputation, (which is all that <hi>Authority</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes) and by that means might be more serviceable in preventing the growth of <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> if it did concur with the <hi>African Councils</hi> in condemning that Doctrine. But because they communicated their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> desiring his consent with them, that therefore no reformation should be attempted in the <hi>Church</hi> without the consent of the <hi>Pope</hi> is a very far-fetched inference; and unhappily drawn from those <hi>African Fathers,</hi> who so stoutly opposed <hi>Zosimus, Innocents</hi> Successour, in the case of <hi>Appeals</hi> about the business of <hi>Apiarius.</hi> Did they, think you, look on themselves as obliged to do nothing in the reforming the <hi>Church</hi> without the <hi>Popes</hi> authority, who would by no means yield to those en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of power, which <hi>Zosimus</hi> would have usurped over them? Nay it appears, that, till the <hi>African Fathers</hi> had better informed him, <hi>Zosimus</hi> did not a little favour <hi>Coelestius</hi> himself, and in case he had gone on so to do, do you think they would have thought themselves ever the less obliged to reform their <hi>Churches</hi> from the <hi>Pelagian Heresie</hi> which began to spread among them? And in this time of the Controversie between <hi>Zosimus</hi> and them, though they carried it with all fairness towards the <hi>Roman See,</hi> yet they were still careful to preserve and defend their own priviledges; and in case the <hi>Pope</hi> should then have challenged that power over them, which he hath done since, no doubt they would not have struck at calling such incroachments <hi>The disease of the Church,</hi> (without any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsomness or incivility) and would have been far from looking on him as the only <hi>Physitian</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>To that pretence, <hi>That things should have been born with, till the time of a General Council,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> his Lordship answers: <hi>First, 'tis true, a General Council, free and entire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 152. n. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>would have been the best remedy, and most able for a Gangrene that had spread so far, and eaten so deep into Christianity. But what? should we have suffered this Gangrene to endanger life and all, rather then be cured in time by a Physitian of weaker knowledge, and a less able hand? Secondly we live to see since, if we had stayed and expected a General Council, what manner of one we should have had if any. For that at Trent was neither General nor free. And for the errours which</hi> Rome <hi>had contracted, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them, it cured them not. And yet I much doubt, whether ever that Council (such as it was) would have been call'd, if some Provincial and Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Synods under Supreme and Regal power, had not first set upon this great work of Reformation; which I heartily wish had been as orderly and happily pursued as the work was right Christian and good in it self. But humane frailty and the heats and distempers of men, as well as the cunning of the Devil would not suffer that. For even in this sense also the wrath of man doth not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:101069:198"/>
the will of God, St.</hi> James 1.20. <hi>but I have learnt not to reject the good, which God hath wrought, for any evil which men may fasten upon it.</hi> Now to this you answer, 1. By a fair Concession again, <hi>that a Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is the next Chirurgion, when a Gangrene endangers life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 165.</note> 
                  <hi>but still the Popes assistance is required:</hi> For fear the <hi>Chirurgion</hi> should do too much good of himself, you would be sure to have the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Physitian</hi> to stand by, whom you know too much concerned in the maladies of the <hi>Church,</hi> to give way to an effectual cure. 2. But you say further, <hi>That the most proper expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is an Oecumenical Council</hi>; and this you spoil again, with saying; <hi>Such as the Council of Trent was.</hi> For what you say in vindication of that being <hi>General and free,</hi> we shall consider in the <hi>Chapter</hi> designed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. What you object against our <hi>National Synod</hi> 1562. will be fully answered before the end of <hi>this</hi>; which that we may make way for, we must proceed to the remainder of these general grounds; in which his Lordship proves, <hi>That when the Vniversal Church will not, or for the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the times cannot obtain and settle a free General Council, 'tis lawful,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 152. n. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>nay sometimes necessary to reform gross abuses by a National or a Provincial.</hi> To this you answer in General,<note place="margin">P. 166. n. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>That you deny not but matters of less moment as concerning rites and ceremonies, abuses in manners and discipline, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by particular Councils, without express leave of the Pope; but that in matters of great moment concerning the Faith and publick Doctrine of the Church, Sacraments, and whatever else is of Divine Institution, or universal obligation, particular Councils, (if they duly proceed) attempt nothing without recourse to the Sea Apostolick, and the Pope's consent either expresly granted or justly presumed.</hi> Fair hopes then there are of a cure when the <hi>Imposthume</hi> gathers in the <hi>Head!</hi> we are indeed by this put into a very good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if a small matter hurts a <hi>Church</hi> she hath her hands at liberty to help her self; but if one comes to <hi>ravish</hi> her, her hands are tyed, and by no means must she defend her self. For in case, say you, it be <hi>any matter of great moment, it must be left to the Pope, and nothing to be done without his consent</hi>; no not although the main of the distempers come through him. But thanks be to <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Church</hi> is not committed to the hands of such a merciless <hi>Physitian,</hi> who first causeth the <hi>malady</hi> and then forbids the <hi>cure:</hi> we know of no such obligation we have, to <hi>sleep</hi> in St. <hi>Peters Church,</hi> as of old they did in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> in hopes of a <hi>cure. God</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted every <hi>National Church</hi> with the care of her own safety, and will require of her an account of that power he hath given to that end. It will be little comfort to a <hi>Church</hi> whose <hi>members rot</hi> for want of a <hi>remedy,</hi> to say, <hi>The Pope will not give leave</hi> or else it might have been cured. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where it is that any <hi>Christian Church</hi> is commanded to wait the <hi>Popes</hi> good leasure for reforming her self? Whence doth he derive this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and sole power of reforming <hi>Churches?</hi> But that must be afterwards examined. But is it reasonable to suppose that there should be <hi>Christian Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Christian Bishops</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> and yet these so tyed up that they can do nothing in order to the <hi>Churches</hi> recovery though the distempers be never so great and dangerous? Do we not read in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Churches</hi> that the Government of them was in themselves, without any the least mention of any <hi>Oecumenical Pastour</hi> over all? if any abuses were among them, the particular <hi>Governours</hi> of those <hi>Churches</hi> are check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rebuked for it, and commanded to exercise their power over offenders? and must the encroachments of an usurped and arbitrary power in the <hi>Church</hi> hinder particular <hi>Churches</hi> from the exercise of that
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:101069:199"/>
full power which is committed to the <hi>Governours</hi> of them? Neither is this only a Right granted to a <hi>Church</hi> as such, but we find this power practised and asserted in the history of the <hi>Christian Churches</hi> from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. For no sooner did the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> begin to encroach, but other <hi>Bishops</hi> were so mindful of their own priviledges and the <hi>Interess</hi> of their <hi>Churches,</hi> that they did not yield themselves his <hi>Vassals,</hi> but disputed their <hi>rights</hi> and withstood his usurpations. As hath partly appeared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and will do more afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 11.</note>And that particular <hi>Churches</hi> may reform themselves, his Lordship pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth several Testimonies; The first is of <hi>Gerson,</hi> who tells us plainly, <hi>That he will not deny,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 153.</note> 
                  <hi>but that the Church may be reformed by parts. And that this is necessary; and, that to effect it, Provincial Councils may suffice, and in some things Diocesan.</hi> And again, <hi>Either you should reform all estates of the Church in a General Council, or command them to be reformed in Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Councils:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 167.</note> 
                  <hi>But all this,</hi> you say, <hi>doth not concern matters of Faith, but only personal abuses</hi>; But I pray what ground is there that one should be reformed and not the other? Is it not the reason why any reformation is necessary, that the <hi>Churches</hi> purity and safety should be preserved? and is not that as much or more endangered by erroneous doctrines then by personal abuses? Will not then the parity of reason hold proportionably for one as well as the other? that if the <hi>Church</hi> may be reformed by parts as to lesser abuses, then much more certainly as to greater. <hi>Besides,</hi> you say, <hi>Gerson allowed no Schismatical Reformations against the Churches head</hi>; neither do we plead for any such; but then you must shew, Who the <hi>Churches head</hi> is, and, By what right he comes to be so; otherwise the cause of the <hi>Schism</hi> will fall upon him who pretends to be the <hi>head</hi> to direct others, and is as corrupt a <hi>member</hi> as any in the body. But his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship adds,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>This right of Provincial Synods, that they might decree in causes of Faith, and in cases of Reformation, where corruptions had crept into the Sacraments of Christ, was practised much above a thousand years ago by many, both National and Provincial Synods.</hi> For which he first instanceth in the <hi>Council at</hi> Rome <hi>under Pope</hi> Sylvester <hi>An.</hi> 324. <hi>condemning</hi> Photinus <hi>and</hi> Sabellius, <hi>whose heresies were of a high nature against the Faith</hi>; but here you say, <hi>The very title confutes his pretence, for it was held under the Pope and therefore not against him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But however, whether with the <hi>Pope</hi> or against him, it was no more then a <hi>Provincial Synod</hi>; and this decreed something in matters of Faith, though according to your own Doctrine the <hi>Pope</hi> could not be Infallible there: for you restrain his <hi>Infallibility</hi> to a <hi>General Council,</hi> and do not assert that it belongs to the particular <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> As well then may any other Provincial <hi>Synod</hi> determine matters of Faith, as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> since that hath no more Infallibility belonging to it as such then any other particular <hi>Church</hi> hath; and the <hi>Pope</hi> himself you say may erre when he doth not define matters of Faith in a <hi>General Council.</hi> To his Lordships second instance <hi>of the Council of</hi> Gangra <hi>about the same time condemning</hi> Eustathius <hi>for his condemning marriage as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi>; you answer to the same purpose, <hi>That</hi> Osius <hi>was there Pope</hi> Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester's <hi>Legat</hi>; but what then? if the <hi>Pope</hi> had been there himself he had not been Infallible, much less certainly his <hi>Legat</hi> who could have only a <hi>Second-hand Infallibility.</hi> To the third of the <hi>Council of</hi> Carthage <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning rebaptization about</hi> 348. you grant, <hi>That it was assembled by</hi> Gratus <hi>Bishop of</hi> Carthage, <hi>but that no new Article was defined in it, but only the perpetual tradition of the Church was confirmed therein.</hi> Neither do we
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:101069:199"/>
plead for any power in <hi>Provincial Councils</hi> to define any <hi>new Articles of Faith,</hi> but only to revive the old, and to confirm them in opposition to any <hi>Innovations</hi> in point of Doctrine; and as to this we profess to be guided by the sense of <hi>Scripture</hi> as interpreted by the unanimous consent of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and the <hi>four first General Councils.</hi> To the fourth of the <hi>Council of Aquileia A. D.</hi> 381. <hi>condemning</hi> Palladius <hi>and</hi> Secundinus <hi>for embracing the Arrian Heresie, St.</hi> Ambrose <hi>being present</hi>; you answer, <hi>That they only condemned those who had been condemned already by the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council; and, St.</hi> Ambrose <hi>and other Bishops of</hi> Italy <hi>being present, Who can doubt but every thing was done there by the Popes authority and consent?</hi> But if they only enforced the decrees of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> What need of the <hi>Pope's</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to do that? And do you think that there were no <hi>Provincial Councils</hi> in that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which was particularly distinguished from the <hi>subur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicarian Churches</hi> under the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent either by himself or Legats? If you think so, your thoughts have more of your <hi>will</hi> then <hi>understanding</hi> in them. But if this <hi>Council</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded according to that of <hi>Nice,</hi> Will it not be as lawful for other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial <hi>Councils</hi> to reform particular <hi>Churches,</hi> as long as they keep to the Decrees not barely of <hi>Nice,</hi> but of the four <hi>General Councils,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> looks on, as her duty to do. In the two following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the second <hi>Council of</hi> Carthage <hi>declaring in behalf of the Trinity, and the Milevitan Council about the Pelagian Heresie</hi>; you say, <hi>The Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>were consulted:</hi> But what then? Were they consulted as the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or only as eminent <hi>members</hi> of it in regard of their Faith and Piety? Prove the former when you are able; and as to the latter it depends upon the continuance of that Faith and Piety in them; and when once the reason is taken away, there can be no necessity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the same resort.

                  <hi>That appears by a Book subscribed by the Bishops in</hi> Henry <hi>the eighths time. And by the Records in the Archbishops office, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly kept and to be seen. In the Reformation which came after, our Princes had their parts, and the Clergy theirs. And to these two principally the power and direction for Reformation belongs. That our Princes had their parts, is manifest by their calling together of the Bishops, and others of the Clergy, to consider of that which might seem worthy Reformation. And the Clergy did their part: for, being thus call'd together by Regal power, they met in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synod of sixty two. And the Articles there agreed on were afterwards confirmed by acts of State, and the Royal assent. In this Synod, the Positive truths which are delivered are more then the Polemicks. So that a meer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny it is, that we profess only a Negative Religion. True it is, and we must thank</hi> Rome <hi>for it, our Confession must needs contain some Negatives. For we cannot but deny that Images are to be adored. Nor can we admit maimed Sacraments. Nor grant Prayers in an unknown tongue. And in a corrupt time or place, 'tis as necessary in Religion to deny falshood, as to assert and vindicate Truth. Indeed this latter can hardly be well and sufficiently done but by the former, an Affirmative verity being ever included in the Negative to a falshood. As for any errour which might fall into this (as any other Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) if any such can be found; then I say, and 'tis most true, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, especially in cases of Religion, is so difficult a work, and subject to so many Pretensions, that 'tis almost impossible but the Reformers should step too far, or fall too short in some smaller things or other, which in regard of the far greater benefit coming by the Reformation it self, may well be passed over and born withall. But if there have been any wilfull and gross errours, not so much in opinion as in Fact (Sacriledge too often pretending to Reform Superstition) that's the crime of the Reformers, not of the Reformation; and they are long since gone to God to answer it, to whom I leave them.</hi>

                  <hi>left the Pope in possession of all that he could rightly challenge.</hi> (Which is a concession we shall make more use of afterwards.) Surely then this could not unchurch them. Or, Was it the proceedings of the <hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s time? The <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> could not be it neither now; for that was asserted under a more moderate title in her time, than in her Fathers. Was it the <hi>Vse</hi> of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the <hi>English tongue?</hi> Surely not; when <hi>Pius the fourth</hi> offered to confirm it, as is credibly reported from <hi>Vincentius Parpalia,</hi> whom that <hi>Pope</hi> imployed on a <hi>Message</hi> to <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> with terms of Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

                  <hi>That the Reformation was not managed by a lawful power, nor carried on in a due manner</hi>; for you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to prove, that the <hi>National Synod</hi> 1562. <hi>was no lawful Synod,</hi> in these words. <hi>For is it not notorious, that pretended Synod</hi> A.

                  <hi>that they all by force intruded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, both into the Sees of other lawful Bishops, and into the cures of other lawful Pastors, quietly and Canonically possessed of them before the said intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:101069:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
English Nation?</hi> Two things you object as the great reasons why those persons who sate in the Convocation, <hi>A.</hi> 1562. could make no lawful Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and those are <hi>Intrusion,</hi> and want of a lawful <hi>Mission:</hi> which shall be particularly examined. The first charge is of <hi>Intrusion,</hi> which you would seem to aggravate by several circumstances, <hi>that they intruded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> and that <hi>by force</hi>; and not some, but <hi>all</hi>; and that <hi>into the Sees of other lawful Bishops, and cures of lawful Pastors.</hi> But how true these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances are, must appear by a true account of the matters of fact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to these things in the beginning of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign. How false that is, That <hi>all intruded themselves,</hi> is notorious to any one who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands any thing of those times; For this <hi>Convocation</hi> was held in the fifth year of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and in the fifth of her Reign: Of 26 Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches, there were but fourteen or fifteen Bishops then living in <hi>England.</hi> For the <hi>Sees</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> fell vacant <hi>A.</hi> 1557. and were not supplied in the time of <hi>Queen Mary. Hereford, Bristow, Bangor,</hi> were vacant by the death of the several <hi>Bishops</hi> some weeks before <hi>Queen Mary. Canterbury</hi> by the death of <hi>Cardinal Pool,</hi> the same day with the <hi>Queen. Norwich</hi> and <hi>Gloucester</hi> a few weeks after her; and so likewise <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, Worcester,</hi> and S. <hi>Asaph</hi> became vacant by the voluntary exile of <hi>Pates</hi> and <hi>Goldwell,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> thereof; so that but fifteen <hi>Bishops</hi> were then living and remaining in <hi>England.</hi> And, Were all those who supplied these vacant Sees, <hi>Intruders?</hi> A strange kind of <hi>Intrusion</hi> into dead mens places! So then, this circumstance is notoriously false, <hi>That they All by force intruded themselves into the Sees of other lawful Bishops.</hi> But let us see, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the other are more justly charged with a forcible Intrusion into the <hi>Sees</hi> of the other <hi>Bishops.</hi> For which we must consider what the <hi>proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> were in reference to them: It appears then, that in the first year of the <hi>Queen,</hi> the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> formed and enjoyned in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. was in the first <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> revived for the better securing the <hi>Queen</hi> of the <hi>Fidelity</hi> of her subjects; but yet it was so revived, that several considerable passages in the Act concerning it, were upon mature deliberation mitigated, both as to the <hi>Queens</hi> title which was not <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> but Supreme Governour; a title which <hi>Queen Mary</hi> had used before, as appears by an Act passed in the third Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Parliament in her time: and likewise as to the penalty; for, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Stat.</hi> 28. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 10. was so very severe, <hi>That whosoever did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol the authority of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>was, for the first offence, within the compass of a</hi> Praemunire, <hi>and for refusing to take the Oath, was guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; it passed now in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s time, only with this penalty, <hi>That such who refused it, should be excluded such places of honour and profit, as they held in the Church or Common-wealth; and that such as should maintain or defend the authority, preheminence, power, or jurisdiction, Spiritual or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical of any forein Prince, Prelate, Person, State, or Potentate whatsoever, should be three times convicted before he suffered the pains of death.</hi> Upon the expiring of the <hi>Parliament, Commissioners</hi> were appointed to require the <hi>Bishops</hi> to take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> according to the <hi>Law</hi> made to that purpose, which being tendred to them, they all (<hi>Kitchin</hi> of <hi>Landaffe</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted) unanimously refused it, although they had taken it before as <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Bishops,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. or <hi>Edward</hi> 6. But whether by some secret intimations from <hi>Rome,</hi> or their own obstinacy, they were resolved rather to undergo the penalty of the <hi>Law,</hi> than to take it now; and accordingly before the end of that year they were deprived of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:101069:201"/>
their <hi>Bishopricks.</hi> So that the Question about the <hi>Intrusion</hi> of those <hi>Bishops,</hi> who came into their <hi>Sees,</hi> depends upon the <hi>legality</hi> of the <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of these. And certainly, whosoever considers their former car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards the <hi>Queen,</hi> in refusing to assist at her <hi>Coronation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Watson.</hi>
                  </note> and some of them threatning to excommunicate her instead of disputing at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> as they had solemnly engaged to do, joyned with this contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in refusing the <hi>Oath,</hi> will find that these persons did not unjustly suffer this <hi>deprivation.</hi> For which I need not run out into the <hi>Princes</hi> power over <hi>Ecclesiastical persons</hi>; for you have given a sufficient reason for it your self in that acknowledgement of yours, <hi>That the Bishops, and the King too</hi> (meaning <hi>King Henry) left the Pope in possession of all he could rightly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</hi> If this be true, that notwithstanding the <hi>Stat.</hi> 28. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> then taken, the <hi>Pope</hi> might injoy all that belonged to him of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> he might then do the same, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this Oath in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s time, which was only reviving the former with some mitigation; and what could it be then else but obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and contumacy in them to refuse it? And therefore the plea which you make for those whom you call the <hi>Henry-Bishops,</hi> will sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn these present <hi>Bishops,</hi> whom we now speak of. For if those <hi>Bishops</hi> only renounced the <hi>Popes Canonical and acquired Jurisdiction here in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as you say, <hi>i. e. that Authority and Jurisdiction in Ecclesiastical matters, which the Pope exercised here by virtue of the Canons, Prescription, and other titles of humane right, and gave it to the King; yet they never renounced or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of that part of his authority, which is far more intrinsecal to his office, and of Divine Right; they never denied the Popes Soveraign Power to teach the Vniversal Church, and determine all Controversies of Faith whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in a General Council.</hi> If these things, I say, be true, which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently assert, the more inexcusable were these <hi>Bishops</hi> for refusing that Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> which they had not only taken in <hi>King Henry</hi>'s time, but which, by your own confession, takes away nothing of the <hi>Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in relation to the whole Catholick Church.</hi> And by this means their obstinacy appeared so great, as might justly deserve a deprivation. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly in the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> to assert their own rights in opposition to any <hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Prescriptions</hi> whatsoever of meerly humane right. So that by your own confession, the more excusable the <hi>Henry-Bishops</hi> were, as you call them, the less excusable the <hi>Mary-Bishops</hi> were (as, to follow you, we must call them) in refusing the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> when tendred to them. Was it lawful then in <hi>King Henry</hi>'s time, to take this <hi>Oath</hi> or not? If not, then <hi>King Henry's Bishops</hi> are infinitely to blame for taking it, and you for defending them: If it was lawful then, why not in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s time? Had she not as much reason to impose it as her <hi>Father?</hi> Had she not as much power to do it? When one of the chief refusers, <hi>Heath, Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and then <hi>L. Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> did, upon the first notice of the death of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> declare to the House of <hi>Commons, That the succession of the Crown did of right belong to the Princess</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>whose title they conceived to be free from all legal Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions</hi>; this could be then no plea at all for them. So that if any persons through the greatest obstinacy, might be deprived by a <hi>Prince</hi> of their <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> preferments, these might; and when you can prove, that in no case a <hi>Prince</hi> hath power to deprive <hi>Ecclesiastical persons,</hi> you will say more to your purpose than yet you have done. But till you have done that, it remains clear, that these Bishops were justly deprived; and if so,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:101069:202"/>
What was to be done with their vacant <hi>Sees?</hi> Must they be kept vacant still? or such be put into them who were guilty of the same fault with themselves, in refusing the <hi>Oath,</hi> when tendred to them? If not such, then it was necessary that other fit persons should be legally consecrated and invested in them: And so they were, the places being supplied by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons; the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being consecrated by a Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal number of <hi>Edward-Bishops,</hi> and the rest duly consecrated by other hands. And for all this, <hi>Must all these persons be intruders, and intrude themselves by force, and that into the places of other lawful Bishops?</hi> When so many <hi>Sees</hi> were actually vacant, and the rest by due form of <hi>Law,</hi> into which other <hi>Bishops</hi> were elected, and legally consecrated, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the putid <hi>Fable</hi> of the <hi>Nags-Head</hi> ordination, which hath so often and so evidently been disproved, that I am glad to find you have so much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, as not to mention it. These <hi>Bishops</hi> being thus legally invested in their places, To whom did the care and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>English Church</hi> belong? to <hi>these,</hi> or to <hi>those</hi> who were justly deprived? If to <hi>these,</hi> Were not they then the due representatives of the <hi>English Church</hi> in a <hi>National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> who with those of the lower <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Convocation,</hi> make up a true <hi>National Council?</hi> And if so, it belonged to them as such, to consider what appertained to the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For they undertook not to prescribe to the whole world, that they leave to the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (not as legally belonging to them, but arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly usurped by them) but to draw up <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> which should be owned by all such who enjoyed any place of <hi>Trust</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> So that in all this they were neither <hi>intruders,</hi> neither did they act any thing beyond their <hi>place</hi> and <hi>authority.</hi> But you would seem to quarrel <hi>with their Vocation, Mission, and Jurisdiction, as though it were not lawful,</hi> i. e. <hi>Canonical and Just</hi>; all these are your own words, and they are but words; for not one syllable like a proof is suggested. I tell you then (not to spend time in a needless vindication of the Vocation of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> when you give us no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to question it) that by the same arguments that you can prove that you have any lawful <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> it will appear that we have too.

came into it in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and if you can make it appear that he had a just claim, it will be easie proving them guilty of a fault who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned it. But, Whether it were a <hi>fault</hi> in them or no, I am sure it is <hi>one</hi> in you, to lay such things, and so many to our <hi>charge,</hi> and not offering to give evidence for one of them. But I must consider the Infallibility of your <hi>Church</hi> lyes in <hi>dictating,</hi> and not <hi>proving.</hi> Thus then, for any thing which you so much as seem to say to the contrary, the proceedings of the <hi>Reformation</hi> were very regular and just, being built on sufficient grounds, managed in a legal manner, and carried on with due moderation. Which are the highest commendations can be given to a work of <hi>Reformation</hi>; and do with the greatest right belong to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> of any <hi>Church</hi> in the Christian world. There remains nothing now which you object against our <hi>Reformation,</hi> but some faults of the <hi>Reformers</hi>; as to which his Lordship had already said, <hi>If any such be found, they are the crimes of the persons, and not of the Reformation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 170.</note> 
                  <hi>and they are long since gone to God to answer it, to whom I leave them.</hi> Which Answer so full of justice and modesty, one would have thought, should have been sufficient for any reasonable man; but you are not satisfied with it. <hi>For you will have those faults to come from the principles of the Reformation, and that they did not belong to the persons of the Reformers, but are entailed on their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</hi> But a short Answer will suffice for both these: shew us, What avowed principles of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> tend to any real <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you charge any thing of that nature, as flowing from the <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And if you can prove the <hi>Successors</hi> of the <hi>Reformers</hi> to continue in any <hi>Sacrilegious Actions,</hi> let those plead for them who will, I shall not; but leave them, as his Lordship did, <hi>to answer such things to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Memorandum,</hi> which his Lordship concludes this discourse with, <hi>That he spake at that time of the General Church, as it was for the most part forced under the Government of the</hi> Roman <hi>See: not doubting,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 156. n. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>but that as the Vniversal Catholick Church would have reformed her self, had she been in all parts freed of the</hi> Roman <hi>Yoke; so, while she was for the most in these Western parts under that Yoke, the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was, if not the only, yet the chief hinderance of Reformation:</hi> You answer with some stomach; <hi>By what force I pray? Is it possible? or,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Can it enter into the judgement of any reasonable man, that a single Bishop, of no very large Diocese, should be able by force, to bring into subjection so many large Provinces of Christendom, as confessedly did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Popes Power, when the pretended Reformation began?</hi> But, What reasonable man can imagine, that a <hi>single Bishop</hi> indeed of no very large <hi>Diocese</hi> (if kept within his bounds) should, in progress of time, extend his <hi>power</hi> so far as the <hi>Pope</hi> did, but by one of these two means, <hi>force,</hi> or <hi>fraud?</hi> And since, you seem to be so much displeased at the <hi>former,</hi> I pray take the <hi>latter</hi>; or rather, the conjunction of both together. For that there was <hi>force</hi> used, appears by the manifold resistance which was made to the encroachments of the <hi>Popes</hi> power; and the sad <hi>complaints</hi> of the <hi>usurpations</hi> and <hi>abuses</hi> which were in it; and these abundantly delivered <hi>by Classical Authors of both the present and precedent times:</hi> and (to use more of your own words) <hi>all Ecclesiastical Monuments are full of them</hi>; so that this is <hi>no false calumny, or bitter Pasquil</hi> (as you call it) but a very plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent truth.

               <head>CHAP. V. Of the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches Authority.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Question concerning the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Authority entred upon. How far our Church, in reforming her self, condemns the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope's equality with other Patriarchs, asserted. The Arabick Canons of the Nicene Council proved to be supposititious. The Polity of the Ancient Church discovered from the sixth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> The Rights of Primates and Metropolitans settled by it. The suitableness of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, to the Civil Government. That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had then a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Jurisdiction within the suburbicary Churches; as Primate of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Diocese. Of the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Priviledge; that it was not peculiar, but common to all Primates of Dioceses. Of the Pope's Primacy according to the Canons; how far pertinent to our dispute. How far the Pope's Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requisite to new elected Patriarchs. Of the Synodical and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letters. The testimonies of <hi>Petrus de Marc√¢</hi> concerning the Pope's Power of confirming and deposing Bishops. The Instances brought for it, considered. The case of <hi>Athanasius</hi> being restored by <hi>Julius,</hi> truly stated. The proceedings of <hi>Constantine</hi> in the case of the Donatists cleared, and the evidence thence against the Pope's Supremacy. Of the Appeals of Bishops to <hi>Rome,</hi> how far allowed by the Canons of the Church. The great case of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals between the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Bishops discussed. That the Appeals of Bishops were prohibited, as well as those of the inferiour Clergy. <hi>T. C</hi>'s. fraud in citing the Epistle of the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, for acknowledging Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to <hi>Rome.</hi> The contrary manifested from the same Epistle to <hi>Boniface,</hi> and the other to <hi>Coelestine.</hi> The exemption of the Ancient Britannick Church from any subjection to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> asserted. The case of <hi>Wilfrids</hi> Appeal answered. The Primacy of <hi>England</hi> not derived from <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Grant to <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk. The Ancient Primacy of the Britannick Church not lost upon the Saxon Conversion. Of the state of the <hi>African</hi> Churches, after their denying Appeals to <hi>Rome.</hi> The rise of the Pope's Greatness under Christian Emperours. Of the Decree of the Sardican Synod, in case of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals: Whether ever received by the Church: No evidence thence of the Pope's Supremacy. <hi>Zosimus</hi> his forgery in sending the Sardican Canons instead of the Nicene. The weakness of the pleas for it, manifested.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note>THat which now remains to be discussed in the <hi>Question</hi> of <hi>Schism,</hi> is, concerning the Authority of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be so large and extensive, as to bind us to an universal submission, so that by renouncing of it, we violate the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and are thereby guilty of <hi>Schism?</hi> But, before we come to a particular discussion of that,<note place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> we must cast our eyes back on the precedent Chapter, in which the title promiseth us, <hi>That Protestants should be further convinced of Schism</hi>; but upon examination of it, there appears not so much as the shadow of any new matter, but it wholly depends upon principles already refuted, and so contains a bare repetition of what hath been abundantly answered in the first part. So your first Section hath no more of strength, than what lyes in your <hi>Churches Infallibility:</hi> For, when you would plead, <hi>That though the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>be the accused party, yet she may judge in her own cause</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 171, 172.</note> you do it upon this ground, <hi>That you had already proved the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:101069:203"/>
                  <hi>Church to be infallible, and therefore your Church might as well condemn her accusers, as the Apostles theirs; and that Protestants not pretending In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility cannot rationally be permitted to be Accusers and Witnesses against the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> Now, What doth all this come to, in case your <hi>Church</hi> be not infallible, as we have evidently proved she is not, in the <hi>first part</hi>; and that she is so far from it, that she hath most grosly erred, as we shall prove in the <hi>third part?</hi> Your second Section supposes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact evident,<note place="margin">P. 173.</note> 
                  <hi>That Protestants did contradict the publick Doctrine and belief of all Christians generally throughout the world,</hi> which we have lately proved to be an egregious falsity, and shall do more afterwards. The cause of the <hi>Separatists,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is vastly different, Whether wee look on the authority, cause, or manner of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and in your other Instances you still beg the Question, <hi>That your Church is our Mother-Church, and therefore we are bound to submit to her judgement, though she be the accused party.</hi> But as to this whole business of <hi>Qu√¥ Judice,</hi> nothing can be spoken with more solidity and satisfaction, than what his Lordship saith. <hi>If it be a cause common to both, as certain it is here (between the Protestant and</hi> Roman <hi>Church) then neither part alone may be Judge; if neither alone may judge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 157.</note> 
                  <hi>then either they must be judged by a third, which stands indifferent to both, and that is the Scripture: or if there be a jealousie, or a doubt of the sense of the Scripture, they must either both repair to the Exposition of the Primitive Church, and submit to that; or both call and submit to a General Council, which shall be lawfully called, and fairly and freely held with indifferency to all parties; and that must judge the Difference according to Scripture, which must be their Rule as well as private mens.</hi> When you either attempt to shew the unreasonableness of this, or substitute any thing more reasonable instead of it, you may expect a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Answer to the Question, <hi>Qu√¥ Judice?</hi> as far as it concerns the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between your Church, or ours. The remainder of this <hi>whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is only a repetition of somewhat concerning <hi>Fundamentals,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ad p. 181.</note> and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expatiating in words, without the addition of any more strength from reason or authority <hi>upon the Churches Infallibility being proved from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>; which having been throughly considered already, and an account given, not only of the meaning of those places (one excepted, which we shall meet with again) but of the reason, Why the sense of them as to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> should be restrained to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> I find no sufficient motive inducing me to follow you, in distrusting the Readers memory, and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing on his patience, so much as to inculcate the same things over and over, as you do. Passing by therefore the things already handled, and leaving the rest (if any such thing appear) to a more convenient place, where these very places of Scripture are again brought upon the stage in the Questions of the <hi>Pope's Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> I come to your following <hi>Chapter,</hi> in which you enter upon the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Churches Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That which his Lordship hath long insisted on,<note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> and evidently prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, <hi>The Right which particular Churches have to reform themselves, when the General Church cannot for impediments, or will not for negligence do it.</hi> And your Answers to his proofs have had their weakness sufficiently laid open; the only thing here objected further, is, <hi>Whether in so doing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches do not condemn others of Errours in Faith?</hi> To which his Lordship answers, <hi>That to reform themselves, and to condemn others,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 166.</note> 
                  <hi>are two different works, unless it fall out so, that by reforming themselves, they do
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:101069:204"/>
by consequence condemn any other, that is guilty in that point, in which they reform themselves; and so far to judge and condemn others, is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but necessary. A man that lives Religiously doth not by and by sit in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and condemn with his mouth all prophane livers: but yet while he is silent, his very life condemns them.</hi> To what end his Lordship produceth this Instance, any one may easily understand; but you abuse it, as though his Lordship had said, <hi>That Protestants only by their Religious lives do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your Church</hi>; and upon this run out into a strange declamation about <hi>Who the men are that live so Religiously?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 182. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>They who to propagate the Gospel the better, marry wives contrary to the Canons and bring Scripture for it?</hi> Yes surely, much more then they who to propagate your <hi>Church,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>Concubines</hi>; for which if they can bring some <hi>Canons</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> I am sure they can bring no <hi>Scripture</hi> for it. <hi>They who pull down Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries both of Religious men and women?</hi> I see, you are still as loth to part them, as they are to be parted themselves; but if all their <hi>lives</hi> be no more Religious then the most of them have been; the pulling of them down might be a greater act of <hi>Religion</hi> then living in them. <hi>They who cast Altars to the ground?</hi> More certainly then they who worshipped them. <hi>They who partly banish Priests, and partly put them to death?</hi> Or they who commit treasons and do things worthy of death? But you are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less very Religious and tender-hearted men, whose consciences would never suffer you to banish or put any to death for the sake of <hi>Religion</hi>; no not in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time here in <hi>England! They who deface the very Tombs of Saints, and will not permit them to rest even when they are dead?</hi> Or they who profess to worship dead Saints, and martyr living ones with Fire and Faggot? If this be your <hi>religious living,</hi> none who know what Religion means will be much taken with it. I shall easily grant that <hi>you stick close to the Pope,</hi> but are therein far enough from the Doctrine or life of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> If any of you <hi>have endured Sequestrations, Imprisonments, Death it self,</hi> I am sure it was not for any good you did; not for the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> but if you will, for some <hi>Catholick Treasons,</hi> such as would have enwrapt a <hi>whole Nation</hi> in misery. If this be <hi>your suffering persecution for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sake,</hi> you will have little cause to rejoyce in your Fellow-sufferers. But if you had not a mind to calumniate us, and provoke us to speak sad truths of you, all this might have been spared; for his Lordship only chose this <hi>Instance,</hi> to shew that a Church or person may be condemned <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially,</hi> which was not <hi>intentionally.</hi> But you say, <hi>Our Church hath formally condemned yours, by publick and solemn censures in the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles.</hi> Doth his Lordship deny that our <hi>Church</hi> in order to our own reformation hath condemned many <hi>things</hi> which your <hi>Church</hi> holds? No, but that our <hi>Churches</hi> main intention was to reform it self; but, considering the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and degeneracy of your <hi>Church,</hi> she could not do it, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially condemning yours: and, that she did justly in so doing, we are ready on all occasions to justifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note>But his Lordship asks, <hi>If one particular Church may not judge or condemn another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 167.</note> 
                  <hi>What must then be done where particulars need reformation?</hi> To which his Adversary gives a plain Answer, <hi>That particular Churches must in that case (as</hi> Irenaeus <hi>intimateth) have recourse to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which hath more powerful principality; and to her Bishop, who is the chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour of the whole Church, as being St.</hi> Peters <hi>Successour,</hi> &amp;c. This is the rise and occasion of the present Controversie. To this his Lordship Answers, <hi>That it is most true indeed; the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath had, and hath yet, more
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:101069:204"/>
powerful Principality, then any other particular Church. But she hath not this power from Christ. The</hi> Roman <hi>Patriarch by Ecclesiastical constitutions might perhaps have a Primacy of order: but for principality of power, the Patriarchs were as even, as equal, as the Apostles were before them. The truth is, this more powerful Principality the</hi> Roman <hi>Bishops got under the Emperours, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they became Christian; and they used the matter so, that they grew big enough to oppose, nay to depose the Emperours, by the same power which they had given them. And after this, other particular Churches, especially here in the West, submitted themselves to them for Succour and Protections sake. And this was one main cause that swel'd</hi> Rome <hi>into this more powerful Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not any right given by Christ to make that Prelate, Pastour of the whole Church.</hi> To this you Answer, <hi>That to say that the</hi> Roman <hi>Churches Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality is not from Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 183.</note> 
                  <hi>is contrary to St.</hi> Austin <hi>and the whole</hi> Milevitan <hi>Council, who in their Epistle to</hi> Innocent <hi>the first profess that the Popes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is grounded upon Scripture and consequently proceeds from Christ.</hi> But whoever seriously reads and throughly considers that Epistle will find no such thing as that you aim at there.<note place="margin">

But we,</hi> say they, <hi>do suppose that through the mercy of our Lord Christ assisting you, those which hold such perverse and pernicious principles may more easily yield by your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority drawn out of Scripture.</hi> Where they do not in the least dream of his <hi>Authority</hi> as <hi>Vniversal Pastor being grounded on Scripture,</hi> but of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> with his Authority drawn out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that is, to that Authority which he had in the <hi>Church,</hi> by the reputation of the <hi>Roman See,</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> being added, which was so clear against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> or both these going together were the most probable way to suppress their Doctrine. And it hath been sufficiently proved by others, by very many instances of the writers about that Age, that <hi>Authoritas</hi> was no more then <hi>Rescriptum</hi>; as particularly appears by many passages in <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epistles, in which sense no more is expressed by this, than, that by the <hi>Pope's</hi> Answer to the <hi>Council</hi> drawn out of the <hi>Authority of Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians</hi> might more probably be suppressed. But what is this to an <hi>Vniversal Pastorship</hi> given by <hi>Christ</hi> to him; any otherwise then to those who sat in any other <hi>Apostolical Sees?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But your great quarrel is against his Lordship, for making all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs even and equal, as to <hi>Principality of power:</hi> and when he saith, <hi>Equal as the Apostles were,</hi> you say, <hi>that is aequivocal; for though the Apostles had equal jurisdiction over the whole Church, yet St.</hi> Peter <hi>alone had jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Apostles</hi>; but this is neither proved from <hi>John</hi> 21. nor is it at all clear in <hi>Antiquity</hi> as will appear when we come to that Subject.</p>
               <p>But this assertion of the <hi>equality of Protestants</hi> is so destructive to your pretensions in behalf of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> that you set your self more particularly to disprove it; which you offer to do by two things. 1. <hi>By a Canon of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council.</hi> 2. <hi>By the practise of the ancient Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 184.</note> You begin with the first of them, and tell us, <hi>That 'tis contrary to the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>In the third Canon whereof, which concerns the jurisdiction

of Patriarchs, the Authority (or Principality if you will) of the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>is made the Pattern, and Model of that Authority and Jurisdiction which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs were to exercise over the Provincial Bishops. The words of the Canon are these.</hi> Sicque praeest Patriarcha iis omnibus, qui sub ejus potestate sunt, sicut ille qui tenet sedem Romae, caput est &amp; princeps omnium Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcharum, <hi>The Patriarch</hi> (say they) <hi>is in the same manner over all those that are under his Authority, as he who holds the See of</hi> Rome <hi>is head and Prince of the Patriarchs.

Upon this they declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves willing to yield to what should appear to be determined by the <hi>Nicene Canons</hi>; thence they propound that a more exact search might be made into the authentical <hi>Copies</hi> of them: for they profess no such thing at all to appear, in all the <hi>Greek copies</hi> which they had among them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Caecilianus</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> were present in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> and brought home those Copies which were preserved in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Africa.</hi> For in all the <hi>subscriptions</hi> of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> whether <hi>Arabick</hi> or others, the name of <hi>Caecilian</hi> appears; now <hi>Caecilian</hi> was immediate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor in <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Aurelius</hi> who presided in that <hi>Council</hi> wherein these things were debated.

because it is the <hi>first</hi> that ever was made by the <hi>ancient Church</hi> for regulating the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> over each other; which there was like to be now more contest about, not only by reason of the <hi>Churches</hi> liberty under <hi>Constantine,</hi> but because of the new <hi>disposition</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> by him, which was made not long before the sitting of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> But the particular occasion of this <hi>Canon</hi> is generally supposed to be this. <hi>Meletius</hi> an ambitious <hi>Bishop</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> much about the time that <hi>Arrius</hi> broached his Heresie at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> takes upon him to ordain <hi>Bishops</hi> and others in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> without the consent of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This case being brought before the <hi>Nicene Fathers,</hi> they pronounce these ordinations <hi>null,</hi> depose <hi>Meletius,</hi> and, to prevent the like practises for the future, do by this <hi>Canon</hi> confirm the ancient <hi>customs</hi> of that nature in the <hi>Church</hi>; so that the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> should enjoy as full right and power over the Provinces of <hi>Aegypt, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> as the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had over those subject to him, as likewise <hi>Antioch</hi> and other <hi>Churches</hi> should enjoy their former <hi>priviledges.</hi> Where we plainly see that the ground of this extent of power is not attributed to any <hi>Divine right</hi> of the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> or any other <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> but to the <hi>ancient custome</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; whereby it had obtained that such <hi>Churches</hi> that were deduced (as it were so many <hi>colonies</hi>) from the <hi>Mother-Church,</hi> should retain so much respect to and dependence upon her, as not to receive any <hi>Bishop</hi> into them without the consent of that <hi>Bishop</hi> who governed in the <hi>Metropolis.</hi> Which was the prime reason of the subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of those lesser <hi>Churches</hi> to the <hi>Metropolis:</hi> And this custome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn down from the first plantation of <hi>Churches,</hi> and likewise much conducing to the preserving of <hi>unity</hi> in them, these <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> saw <hi>no reason</hi> to alter it, but <hi>much</hi> to confirm it. For otherwise, there might have been continual bandying and opposition of lesser <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> against the greater; and therefore the <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> did call for this subordination; which could not be better determined then by the ancient custome which had obtained in the sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Churches.</hi> It being found most convenient that the <hi>Churches</hi> in their subordination should be most agreeable to the civil <hi>disposition</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> And therefore for our better understanding the force and effect of this <hi>Nicene Canon,</hi> we must cast our eye a little upon the <hi>civil disposition</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> by <hi>Constantine,</hi> then lately altered from the former disposition of it under <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Adrian.</hi> He therefore distributed the administration of the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> under four <hi>Praefecti Praetorio</hi>; but for the more convenient management of it, the whole body of the <hi>Empire</hi> was cast into several <hi>Jurisdictions</hi> containing many <hi>Provinces</hi> within them which were in the Law call'd <hi>Dioeceses</hi>; over every one of which there was appointed a <hi>Vicarius,</hi> or <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> to one of the <hi>Praefecti Praetorio,</hi> whose residence was in the chief City of the <hi>Diocese,</hi> where the <hi>Praetorium</hi> was, and justice was administred to all within that <hi>Diocese,</hi> and thither <hi>appeals</hi> were made.

Is it possible to conceive when the <hi>Canon</hi> makes use of the parallel of the <hi>Roman Bishop,</hi> and makes that the ground <hi>why the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>should enjoy full power over those Provinces, because the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>did so</hi>; that the meaning should be, <hi>That he gave the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>power to govern those Provinces?</hi> They who can believe such things, may easily find arguments for the <hi>Pope's unlimited Supremacy</hi> every where.

Yes,</hi> it may be you will reply, <hi>He had limits as a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, but not as Head of the Church.</hi> Grant me then, that he had limits as <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and then prove you, that ever he had any unlimited power acknowledged as <hi>Head of the Church.</hi> Would they ever have made such an instance in him, without any discrimination of his <hi>several capacities,</hi> if they had known any other <hi>power</hi> that he had, but only as a <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</hi> Nay, might not the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> be rather supposed to have the greater <hi>power,</hi> because their <hi>Provinces</hi> were much larger here than his. And although <hi>Bellarmin</hi> useth that as his great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, Why <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his exposition cannot hold, <hi>Because the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>would have a lesser Diocese assigned him, than either the Bishops of</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, <hi>or</hi> Alexandria; yet when we consider, What hath been said alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the agreement of the <hi>Civil and Ecclesiastical Government,</hi> a sufficient account may thence be given of it. For as the <hi>Praefectus Augustalis</hi> had all the Provinces of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for his <hi>Diocese,</hi> so had the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; and, as the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> had that which was properly called the <hi>Orient,</hi> containing fifteen <hi>Provinces</hi> under him, so had the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi>; and by the same proportion, the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did correspond to the <hi>Diocese</hi> of the <hi>Roman Lieutenant,</hi> which was over those ten <hi>Provinces,</hi> which were subject to his <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> as it was distinct from the <hi>Diocese</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> which was under that <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> whose residence was at <hi>Milan.</hi> Here we see then a parity of reason in all of them: and therefore I cannot but think that the true account of the <hi>Suburbicary Churches</hi> in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his exposition of this <hi>Canon,</hi> is, that which we have now set down, <hi>viz.</hi> those <hi>Churches</hi> which lay within the ten <hi>Provinces</hi> subject to the <hi>Roman Lieutenant.</hi> But of them more afterwards. That which I now insist on, is, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had then a <hi>limited Jurisdiction,</hi> as other <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> and <hi>Primats</hi> had. Nay, if we should grant that the <hi>title</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Paschasinus</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to this <hi>Canon,</hi> were not such a <hi>forgery</hi> as that of <hi>Zosimus,</hi> yet the most that it could prove, was only this, That the <hi>Roman Church</hi> had alwaies the <hi>primacy</hi> within her <hi>Diocese,</hi> i. e. <hi>all Metropolitical power</hi>; but not that it had an <hi>unlimited primacy</hi> in the whole <hi>Church,</hi> which was a thing none of those <hi>Fathers</hi> who lived in the time of the four <hi>Councils,</hi> did ever acknowledge; but alwaies opposed any thing tending to it, as appears by those very proceedings of <hi>Paschasinus</hi> at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and by the <hi>Canons</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> and of the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:101069:208"/>
                  <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And it is a rare Answer to say, <hi>That those Canons are not allowed by the</hi> Roman <hi>Church</hi>; for by that very Answer it appears, that they did oppose the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> or else doubtless they would have been allowed there. But that the <hi>Pope's Metropolitical Power</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the <hi>Roman Diocese,</hi> so as not to extend to the <hi>Italick,</hi> we have this pregnant evidence, that it appears by the occasion of the <hi>Nicene Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> that the main Power contested for, was that of <hi>Ordination</hi>; and it is evident by <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Synesius</hi> his Epistles,<note place="margin">Theodoret. l. 1. c 9.

                  <hi>That the Britannick Church might plead the Cyprian priviledge, that it was subject to no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch. And, although this priviledge was taken away by force and tumult, yet being restored by the consent of the Kingdom, in</hi> Henry 8. <hi>time, and quietly enjoyed since, it ought to be retained for peace sake, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Catholicism, and the brand of Schism.</hi> If so, certainly it can be no <hi>Schism,</hi> to withdraw from the usurped Authority of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> But, these things have been more largely insisted on by others, and therefore I pass them over.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From thence it follows, that there was then an <hi>equality,</hi> not only among the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> (whose name came not up till some time after the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi>) but among the several <hi>Primates</hi> of <hi>Dioceses,</hi> all enjoying equal power and authority over their respective <hi>Dioceses,</hi> without subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to each other. But here it is vehemently pleaded by some, who yet are no <hi>Friends</hi> to the unlimited power of the <hi>Roman Bishop, That it is hardly conceivable, that he should have no other power in the Church, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Head of the</hi> Roman <hi>Diocese, and that it appears by the Acts of the Church he had a regular preheminence above others in ordering the Affairs of the Church.</hi> To which I answer, 1. If this be granted, it is nothing at all to that <hi>Vniversal Pastorship</hi> over the <hi>Church,</hi> which our <hi>Adversaries</hi> contend for, <hi>as due by divine right, and acknowledged to be so by consent of the Church.</hi> Let the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> then quit his former plea, and insist only on this, and we shall speedily return an Answer, and shew, How far this <hi>Canonical Primacy</hi> did extend. But, as long as he challengeth a <hi>Supremacy</hi> upon other grounds, he forfeits this <hi>right,</hi> whatever it is, which comes by the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> 2. What meerly comes by the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> cannot bind the <hi>Church</hi> to an absolute submission, in case that authority be abused to the <hi>Churches</hi> apparent prejudice. For the <hi>Church</hi> can never give away her <hi>Power</hi> to secure her self against whatever incroachments tend to the <hi>injury</hi> of it. This power then may be rescinded by the parts of the <hi>Church,</hi> when it tends to the mischief of it. 3. This <hi>Canonical prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> is not the main thing we dispute with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; let her
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:101069:209"/>
reform her self from all those errours and corruptions which are in her communion, and reduce the <hi>Church</hi> to the primitive purity and simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith and Worship, and then see if we will quarrel with the <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> according to the <hi>Canons,</hi> or any regular prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence in him meerly in order to the <hi>Churches</hi> Peace and Unity. But this is not the case between us and them, they challenge an <hi>unlimited power,</hi> and that by <hi>divine right,</hi> and nothing else will satisfie them but this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be neither any ground in <hi>Scripture</hi> for it, nor any evidence of it in the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Church.</hi>

in their <hi>power</hi> to do it, and that the <hi>Canons</hi> had given them right to do it, but least of all certainly that they had a <hi>Divine right</hi> for it, which never was in the least acknowledged by the <hi>Church</hi> as to a deposition of <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> which you contend for.

               </p>
               <p>But we must see whether you have any better success in proving his power to restore such as were deposed; for which you only instance in <hi>Athanasius and Paulus restored by Julius</hi>; whose case must be further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, which, in short, is this: <hi>Athanasius</hi> being condemned by the <hi>Synods</hi> of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> goes to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he and <hi>Paulus</hi> are received into Communion by <hi>Julius,</hi> who would not accept of the Decree of the <hi>Eastern Bishops</hi> which was sent after him to <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>Pope Julius</hi> did not formally offer to restore <hi>Athanasius</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> but only owned and received him into <hi>Communion</hi> as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that because he looked on the proceedings as unjust in his condemnation.

In which passage,</hi> saith his Lordship, <hi>there are very many things observable. As first, That the Roman Prelate came not in till there was leave for them to go to Transmarine Bishops. Secondly, That if the Pope had come in without this leave, it had been an Vsurpation. Thirdly, That when he did thus come in, not by his own Authority, but by Leave, there were other Bishops made Judges with him. Fourthly, That these other Bishops were appointed and sent by the Emperour and his power; that which the Pope least of all will endure. Lastly, Lest the Pope and his Adherents should say, this was an Vsurpation in the Emperour, St.</hi> Austin <hi>tells us a little before in the same Epistle still, that this doth chiefly belong</hi> ad curam ejus, <hi>to the Emperours care and charge,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>First, You give no satisfactory account at all, Why, if the <hi>Popes Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Pastourship</hi> had been then owned, the first <hi>appeal</hi> on both sides was not made to the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome; for in so great a <hi>Schism</hi> as that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the different parties of <hi>Caecilian</hi> and <hi>Majorinus,</hi> To whom should they have directly gone but to <hi>Melchiades</hi> then <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> How comes it to pass that there is no mention at all of his <hi>judgement</hi> by either party, till <hi>Constantine</hi> had appointed him to be one of the <hi>Judges?</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> indeed pleads in behalf of <hi>Caecilian,</hi> why he would not be judged by
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:101069:211"/>
the <hi>African Synod of LXX. Bishops, that there were thousands of his Colleagues on the other side the Sea, whom he might be tryed by?</hi> But why not by the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>alone,</hi> if the <hi>Vniversal Pastorship</hi> did belong to him?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. ep.</hi> 162.</note> But your Narrative gives us a rare account, why the <hi>Donatists</hi> did not go to the <hi>Pope</hi> before they went to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> viz. <hi>That they durst not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there, or else knew it would be to little purpose.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 185.</note> But by what Arguments do you prove <hi>they durst not appear there before,</hi> when we see they went readily thither <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> had appointed <hi>Rome</hi> for the place, where their cause was to be heard; if they thought it were to so little purpose? For we see the <hi>Donatists</hi> never except against the <hi>place</hi> at all, or the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; but upon the command of <hi>Constantine</hi> made known to them by <hi>Analinus</hi> the <hi>Proconsul</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> ten of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty go to <hi>Rome</hi> to negotiate their affairs before the <hi>Delegates.</hi> This is but therefore a very lame account, why the <hi>first appeal</hi> should be to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> and not to the <hi>Pope,</hi> if he had been then known to be the <hi>Vniversal Pastour</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But say you further, <hi>The Emperour disliked their proceedings and told them expresly, That it belonged not to him, neither durst he act the part of a Judge in a cause of Bishops.</hi> But on what grounds <hi>he durst not do it,</hi> we may easily judge by his undertaking it at last, and passing a final judgement in this <hi>cause</hi> himself after the <hi>Councils at</hi> Rome, <hi>at</hi> Arles, could not put an end to it. If <hi>Constantine</hi> had judged it <hi>unlawful,</hi> could their importunity have excused it? and could it be any other then <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi> were the <hi>Vniversal Pastour</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> Do you think it would be accounted a sufficient plea among you now, for any <hi>Prince</hi> to assume to himself the judgement of any cause already determin'd by the <hi>Pope,</hi> because of the <hi>importunity</hi> of the persons concerned in it? Indeed <hi>Constantine</hi> did at first prudently wave the business himself, and that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the rather because the <hi>Donatists</hi> in their Petition had intreated that some of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Gaul</hi> might umpire the business; either because that was then the place of the <hi>Emperours</hi> residence, or else that <hi>Gaul</hi> under <hi>Constantius</hi> had escaped the late persecution, and therefore were not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the suspicion of those crimes whereof <hi>Caecilian</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> of <hi>Aptung</hi> were accused. But however though <hi>Constantine</hi> did not sit as <hi>Judge</hi> himself, he appointed <hi>Marinus, Rheticius,</hi> and <hi>Maternus,</hi> to joyn with <hi>Melchiades</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the determining this case. <hi>But this he did,</hi> you say, <hi>to comply with the Donatists.</hi> What, to joyn other <hi>Bishops</hi> with the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in equal power for deciding Controversies? and all this meerly to comply with the <hi>Schismatical Donatists?</hi> was this, think you, becoming one who believed the <hi>Popes Vniversal Pastourship by Divine Right?</hi> Well fare then the Answer of others who love to speak plain truths, and impute all these proceedings to <hi>Constantines</hi> Ignorance of his duty, being yet but a <hi>Catechumen</hi> in <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and therefore did, he knew not what: But methinks the <hi>Vniversal Pastour</hi> or some of those nineteen <hi>Bishops</hi> who sat at <hi>Rome</hi> in this business, or of those two hundred whom you say met afterwards at <hi>Arles</hi> about it, should have a little better instructed him in his duty; and not let him go so far on in it, as from delegating <hi>Judges</hi> to hear it, and among them the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to resume it afterwards himself both to hear and determine it. <hi>If the Emperour had</hi> (as you say) <hi>protested against this as in it self unlawful,</hi> would none of the <hi>Bishops</hi> hinder him from doing it?<note place="margin">P. 186.</note> But where doth <hi>Constantine</hi> profess against it <hi>as in it self unlawful?</hi> if so, no circumstances, no importunities could ever make it lawful: Unless you think the <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:101069:212"/>
of <hi>Josephs Mistress</hi> would have made <hi>adultery</hi> no <hi>sin</hi> in him. If <hi>Constantine said he would ask the Bishops pardon in it,</hi> that might be, as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them as the more competent <hi>Judges,</hi> but not thinking it <hi>unlawful in it self</hi> for him to do, as you say.</p>
               <p>Well but you tell us, <hi>It was rather the justice and moderation of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prelate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that he came not in before it was due time, and the matter order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought before him.</hi> I am very much of your mind in this, and if all <hi>Popes</hi> since <hi>Melchiades</hi> had used <hi>the same justice and moderation,</hi> to have staid till things had been orderly brought to them, and not usurped upon the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of other <hi>Churches,</hi> things had been in a far better condition in the Christian world then they are. Had there been none but such as <hi>Melchiades,</hi> who shewed so much Christian prudence and moderation in the management of this business, that great <hi>Schism,</hi> which your <hi>Church</hi> hath caused by her arrogant pretences, might have been prevented. But how come you to know, <hi>that this case did properly belong to the Popes cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance?</hi> who told you this? to be sure not the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> who in his Epistle to <hi>Miltiades,</hi> extant in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> intimates no such thing; but only writes to him as one <hi>delegated</hi> to hear that cause with the other <hi>Bishops</hi> and gives him <hi>Instructions</hi> in order to it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euseb. l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> Do the <hi>Donatists</hi> or their <hi>Adversaries</hi> mention any such thing? Doth the <hi>Pope</hi> himself ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press or intimate it? It seems, he wanted your <hi>information</hi> much at that time. Or it may be, like the late Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> in the case of the five <hi>propositions,</hi> he might say, <hi>he was bred no Divine,</hi> and therefore might the less understand his duty. But can it possibly enter into your head, <hi>that this case came to the Pope at last by way of regular appeal,</hi> as you seem to assert afterwards. Is this the way of <hi>appeals</hi> to go to the <hi>Emperour</hi> and Petition him to appoint <hi>Judges</hi> to hear the case? If the case of <hi>appeals</hi> must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined from these <hi>proceedings,</hi> to be sure, the <hi>last resort</hi> will be to the <hi>Emperour</hi> himself, as well as the <hi>first appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether <hi>the</hi> African <hi>Bishops gave leave to the Donatists to be heard by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Bishops, or they took it themselves,</hi> is not much material; because the <hi>Schism</hi> was so great at home, that there was no likelihood of any ending the Controversie by standing to a fair <hi>arbitration</hi> among themselves. And therefore there seemed a necessity on both sides of referring the business to some unconcerned persons who might hear the <hi>Allegations</hi> and judge indifferently between them. And no other way did the nineteen <hi>Bishops</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> proceed with them, but as indifferent Arbitrators; and therefore the Witnesses and Allegations on both sides were brought before them; but we read of no <hi>power</hi> at all challenged absolutely to bind the persons to the judgement of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the final judgement in the case.<note place="margin">P. 187.</note> The Question, <hi>Whether the Pope had usurped this power or no,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon the <hi>Donatists Question, Whether</hi> Melchiades <hi>ought to have undertaken the judgement of that cause which had been already determined by a Synod of LXX. Bishops in</hi> Africk? But upon St. <hi>Augustines</hi> Answer, who justifies the lawfulness of his doing it, because he was thereto appointed by the <hi>Emperour.</hi> But when you say, <hi>St.</hi> Austin <hi>gives this answer only</hi> per <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>by way of condescension to his adversaries way of speaking:</hi> you would do well to prove elsewhere from St. <hi>Austin</hi> that when he lay's aside his <hi>Rhetorick</hi> he ever speaks otherwise, but that it would have been an <hi>Vsurpation</hi> in the <hi>Pope</hi> to challenge to himself the hearing of those <hi>causes</hi> which had been determined by <hi>African Bishops.</hi> But what St. <hi>Augustines</hi> judgement as well as the other <hi>African Fathers</hi> was in this point abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:101069:212"/>
appears from the Controversies between them and the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the case of <hi>Appeals.</hi> It sufficiently appears already, <hi>That neither our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, nor the Canons of the Vniversal Church gave the Pope leave to hear and judge the causes of St.</hi> Athanasius <hi>and other Patriarchs and Bishops of the Church</hi>; and therefore you were put to your shifts when you run thither for security. But that which follows is notoriously false, <hi>That when he did so interpose, no man (no not the persons themselves who were interessed and suffered by his judgement) complained or accused him of usurpation</hi>; when in the case of <hi>Athanasius</hi> it is so vehemently pleaded by the <hi>Eastern Bishops</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> had nothing at all to do in it; but they might as well call in Question what was done at <hi>Rome,</hi> as he what was done at <hi>Antioch.</hi> Nay name us any one cause in that age of the <hi>Church,</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi> did offer to meddle in matters determined by other <hi>Bishops,</hi> which he was not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in, and the persons concern'd did not complain and accuse him of meddling with what he had no right to, which are but other words for <hi>Vsurpation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You say, <hi>The Bishops whom the Emperour sent as Judges with the Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>were an inconsiderable number to sway the sentence.</hi> It seems <hi>three to one</hi> are with you an inconsiderable number. But say you, <hi>The Pope to shew his authority added fifteen other Bishops of</hi> Italy <hi>to be his Colleagues and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in the business.</hi> Either these fifteen <hi>Bishops</hi> were properly <hi>Judges</hi> in the cause, or only <hi>assistants</hi> for better management and speedier dispatch; if they were <hi>Judges,</hi> how prove you that <hi>Constantine</hi> did not appoint them, if they were only <hi>assistants</hi> and <hi>suffragans</hi> to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is most probable (except <hi>Merocles</hi> Bishop of <hi>Milan</hi>) what <hi>authority</hi> did the <hi>Pope</hi> shew in calling his <hi>Suffragans</hi> to his <hi>assistance</hi> in a matter of that nature, which required so much examination of <hi>Witnesses.</hi> But the <hi>Pope</hi> had more effectually shewn his authority if he had refused the <hi>Bishops</hi> whom <hi>Constantine</hi> sent; and told him he medled with that which did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him, to appoint any <hi>Judges</hi> at all in a matter of <hi>Ecclesiastical Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,</hi> and that it was an unsufferable presumption in him to offer to send three underling <hi>Bishops</hi> to sit with him in deciding Controversies; as though he were not the <hi>Vniversal Pastour</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> himself, <hi>to whom alone by Divine right</hi> all such things did belong. Such language as this would have become the <hi>Head of the Church</hi>; and in that indeed he had shewn his authority. But for him sneakingly to admit other <hi>Bishops</hi> as <hi>joynt-commissioners,</hi> forsooth, with him; and that by the <hi>Emperours</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment too; What did he else but betray the <hi>rights</hi> of his <hi>See,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his <hi>Infallible Headship</hi> to great contempt? Do you think that <hi>Pope Hildebrand</hi> or any of his <hi>Successours</hi> would have done this? No, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood their power far better then so; and the <hi>Emperour</hi> should have known his own, for offering such an <hi>Affront</hi> to his <hi>Holiness.</hi> And if his <hi>Bay-leaves</hi> did not secure him, the <hi>Thunder-bolts</hi> of Excommunication might have lighted on him to his prejudice. For shame then never say, <hi>That Pope</hi> Miltiades <hi>shewed his authority</hi>; but rather give him over among those <hi>good Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> but <hi>bad Popes,</hi> who knew better how to suffer <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> then assert the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Roman See.</hi> I pray imagine but <hi>Paul</hi> 5. or any other of our stout-spirited Popes in <hi>Miltiades</hi> his place, Would they have taken such things at <hi>Constantines</hi> hands as poor <hi>Miltiades</hi> did? and, for all that we see, was very well contented too; and thought he did but his duty in doing what the <hi>Emperour</hi> bid him.

the <hi>Infallible judgement</hi> of the <hi>Roman See,</hi> to be resumed again, and handled in another <hi>Council,</hi> as though there could be any suspicion that all things were not rightly carried there? and that after all this too, the <hi>Emperour</hi> should undertake to give the final decision to it? would these things have been born with by any of our <hi>Infallible Heads</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> But good <hi>Miltiades</hi> must be excused, he went as far as his knowledge car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him, and thought he might do good service to the <hi>Church</hi> in what he did; and that was it he looked at more then the <hi>grandeur</hi> of his <hi>See.</hi> The good <hi>Bishops</hi> then were just crept out of the <hi>Flames</hi> of persecution, and they thought it a great matter that they had <hi>liberty</hi> themselves, and did not much concern themselves about those <hi>Vsurpations</hi> which the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ease</hi> of the following ages gave occasion for. They were sorry to see a <hi>Church</hi> that had survived the cruel <hi>Flames</hi> of <hi>Dioclesians</hi> perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, so suddenly to feel <hi>new ones</hi> in her own bowels; that a <hi>Church</hi> whose constitution was so strong as to endure <hi>Martyrdomes,</hi> should no sooner be at ease but she begins to putrifie, and to be <hi>fly-blown</hi> with heats and divisions among her members; and that her own <hi>Children</hi> should rake in those wounds, which the violence of her professed enemies had caused in her; and therefore these good <hi>Bishops</hi> used their care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry to close them up; and rather rejoyced they had so good an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> who would concern himself so much in healing the <hi>Churches breaches,</hi> then dispute his <hi>Authority</hi> or disobey his <hi>Commands.</hi> And if <hi>Constantine doth express himself unwilling to engage himself to meddle in a business concerning the Bishops of the Church,</hi> it was out of his tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to those <hi>Bishops</hi> who had manifested their piety and sincerity so much in their late persecutions, and not from any <hi>Question</hi> of his own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it.

                  <hi>that Bishops had power in their own causes to appeal to</hi> Rome. This answer of yours necessarily leads us to the debates of the great case of appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged between the <hi>African Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which we shall easily discover the <hi>weakness</hi> of your answer, and the most palpable <hi>fraud</hi> of your citation; by which we may see, What an excellent cause you have to manage, which cannot be defended but by such <hi>frauds</hi> as here you make use of, and hope to impose upon your Reader by. Your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer therefore in the general, is, <hi>That the Laws concerning appeals, did only concern inferiour Clergy-men; but that Bishops were allowed to appeal to</hi> Rome, <hi>even by the Council of</hi> Africk, <hi>which not only decreed it, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it in an Epistle to Pope</hi> Boniface. And therefore for our through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the truth in this case, those proceedings of the <hi>African Church</hi> must be briefly explained, and truly represented. Two occasions the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> had to determine in the case of <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>; the first in the <hi>Milevitan,</hi> the second in the <hi>Carthaginian Councils:</hi> in both which we have several things very considerable to our purpose. In the <hi>Milevitan Council</hi> they decree, <hi>That whosoever would appeal beyond the Sea, should not be received into Communion by any in</hi> Africa; which decree is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by some to be occasioned by <hi>Coelestius,</hi> having recourse to <hi>Pope Zosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> after he had been condemned in <hi>Africa.</hi> No doubt, those prudent <hi>Bishops</hi> began to be quickly sensible of the monstrous inconvenience which would speedily follow upon the permission of such <hi>appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>; for by that means they should never preserve any discipline in their <hi>Churches,</hi> but every person, who was called in <hi>Question</hi> for any crimes,<note place="margin">

Can. 28.</note> would slight the <hi>Bishops</hi> of those <hi>Churches,</hi> and presently appeal to <hi>Rome.</hi> To prevent which mischief, they make that <hi>excellent Canon,</hi> which allows only liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of appealing to the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> or to the <hi>Primates</hi> of their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> but absolutely forbids all forein appeals. All the difficulty is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>Canon</hi> only concerned the <hi>Inferiour Clergy,</hi> as you say, (and which is all that the greatest of your side have said in it) or, Whether it doth not take away all appeals of <hi>Bishops</hi> too. For which we need no more than produce the <hi>Canon</hi> it self, as it is extant in the authentick collection of the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>African Church.</hi> In which is an express clause, <hi>declaring
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:101069:214"/>
that the same thing had been often determined in the case of Bishops.</hi> Which, because it strikes home, therefore <hi>Perron</hi> and others have no other shift, but to say, That this clause was not in the original <hi>Milevitan Canons,</hi> but was inserted afterwards. But why do not they, who assert such bold things, produce the true authentick Copy of these <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levitan Canons?</hi> that we may see, What is genuine, and what not: But, suppose we should grant, that this clause was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted afterwards, it will be rather for the advantage, than prejudice of our cause. For which we must consider, that in the time of <hi>Aurelius Bishop</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> there had been very many <hi>Councils</hi> celebrated there: no fewer than seventeen <hi>Justellus</hi> and others reckon. But a general <hi>Council</hi> meeting at <hi>Carthage</hi> A. D. 419. (which was about three years after that <hi>Milevitan Council</hi> which was held 416. as appears by the Answer of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> to it, <hi>A. D.</hi> 417.) at the end of the first Session they reviewed the <hi>Canons</hi> of those lesser <hi>Councils,</hi> and out of them all composed that <hi>Codex Canonum Ecclesiae Africanae,</hi> as <hi>Justellus</hi> at large proves in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his edition of it. So that if this clause were inserted, it must be inserted then, for it is well known, that the case of <hi>Appeals</hi> was then at large debated; and by that means it received a more general authority by passing in this <hi>African Council.</hi> And hence it was that this <hi>Canon</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with this clause into the <hi>Greek Churches</hi>; for <hi>Balsamon</hi> and <hi>Zonaras</hi> both acknowledge it; and not only they, but many ancient <hi>Latin Copies</hi> had it too, and is so received and pleaded by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Rhemes</hi>; as <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus,</hi> and others, have already proved. But <hi>Gracian</hi> hath helped it well out, for he hath added a brave Antidote at the end of it, by putting to it a very useful clause, <hi>Nisi forte Romanam Sedem appellaverit</hi>; by which the <hi>Canon</hi> makes excellent sense, that none shall appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> unless they do appeal to <hi>Rome</hi>; for none who have any understanding of the state of those <hi>Churches</hi> at that time, do make the least Question, but the intent of the <hi>Canon</hi> was to prohibit appeals to <hi>Rome</hi>; but then, say they, They were only <hi>the appeals of the Inferiour Clergy, which were to be ended by the Bishops of their own Province.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Answer is very unreasonable on these accounts. 1. If Appeals do of right belong to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 13.</note> as <hi>Vniversal Pastor of the Church,</hi> then, Why not the <hi>Appeals</hi> of the <hi>Inferiour Clergy,</hi> as well as <hi>Bishops?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if <hi>Appeals</hi> were challenged only by virtue of the <hi>Canons,</hi> and those <hi>Canons</hi> limit one, and not the other (as the most eager pleaders for <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi> in that age, pleaded only the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for them) then there might be some reason, Why one should be restrained, and not the other; but if they belong to him by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> then all Appeals must necessarily belong to him. 2. If <hi>Appeals</hi> belong to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Pastor,</hi> then no <hi>Council</hi> or persons had any thing to do to determine who should appeal, and who not. For this were an usurping of the <hi>Pope's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,</hi> for he to whom only <hi>the right of Appeals</hi> belongs, can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Who should appeal, and who not; and where, and by whom those Controversies should be ended. So that the very act of the <hi>Council</hi> in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to limit Appeals, implies that they did not believe any such <hi>Vniversal Pastorship</hi> in the <hi>Pope</hi>; for, had they not done so, they would have waited his judgement, and not offered to have determined such things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 3. The <hi>Appeals</hi> of the upper and inferiour <hi>Clergy,</hi> cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be separate from each other. For the Appeal of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the impeachment of the <hi>Bishop</hi> for some wrong done to him, as in the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:101069:214"/>
case of <hi>Apiarius</hi> accusing <hi>Vrban</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Sicca</hi> for excommunicating him. So that the <hi>Bishop</hi> becomes a party in the <hi>Appeal</hi> of a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> And if <hi>Appeals</hi> be allowed to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> it is supposed to be in his favour, for clearing of his right the better; and if it be denied to the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> it would savour too much of injustice and partiality. 4. The reason of the <hi>Canon</hi> extends to one as well as the other, which must be supposed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all those troubles and inconveniencies which would arise from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>; and, would not these come as well by the <hi>Appeals</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> as of <hi>Inferiour Clergy</hi>? Nay, Doth not the <hi>Canon</hi> insist on that, that no <hi>Appeals</hi> should be made from the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> or the <hi>Primates</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi>; but, in case of <hi>Bishops</hi> Appeals, this would be done as well as the other: and therefore they are equally against the reason and design of the <hi>Canon.</hi> 5. The case of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> may be as great and considerable as that of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and as much requiring the judgement of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Pastor of the Church.</hi> As, for instance, that very case which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably gave occasion to the <hi>Milevitan Canon, viz.</hi> the going of <hi>Coelestius</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> being condemned of Heresie in <hi>Africa</hi>: Now, What greater cause could there be made an Appeal to <hi>Rome</hi> in, than in so great a matter of <hi>Faith</hi> as that was, about the necessity of <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Concord. Sacerdot. &amp; Imp. l. 7. c. 13. sect. 6, 7, 9.</note> And therefore <hi>Petrus de Marc√°</hi> proves at large against <hi>Perron,</hi> that in the Epistle of <hi>Innocent</hi> to <hi>Victricius,</hi> where it is said, <hi>That the greater causes must be referred to the Apostolick See,</hi> is not to be understood only of the <hi>causes of Bishops,</hi> but may referr to the <hi>causes</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> too, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they either concern <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> or some <hi>doubtful piece of Church-discipline.</hi> 6. The <hi>Pope,</hi> notwithstanding this <hi>Canon,</hi> looked on himself as no more hindred from receiving the Appeals of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> than those of <hi>Bishops.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any difference had been made by any act of the <hi>Church,</hi> surely the <hi>Pope</hi> would have remanded <hi>Presbyters</hi> back to their own <hi>Provinces</hi> again; but, instead of that, we see, he received the Appeal of <hi>Apiarius.</hi> But, for this, a rare Answer is given, <hi>viz. that though the Presbyters were forbidden to appeal, yet the Pope was not forbidden to receive them, if they did appeal.</hi> But, to what purpose then were such prohibitions made, if the <hi>Pope</hi> might by his open incouragement of them upon their Appeals to him, make them not value such <hi>Canons</hi> at all; for they knew, if they could but get to <hi>Rome,</hi> they should be received for all them.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all which hath been said, you tell us, <hi>That in the Council of</hi> Africk <hi>it was acknowledged,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>that Bishops had power in their own cause, to appeal to</hi> Rome; for which you cite in your Margent, <hi>part of an Epistle of the Council to</hi> Boniface. But, with what honesty and integrity you do this, will appear by the story. <hi>Apiarius</hi> then appealing to <hi>Zosimus,</hi> he sends over <hi>Faustinus</hi> to <hi>Africa,</hi> to negotiate the business of <hi>Appeals,</hi> and to restore <hi>Apiarius,</hi> for which he pleads the <hi>Nicene Canons</hi> (an account of which will be given afterwards) the <hi>Fathers</hi> all protest they could find no such thing there, but they agree to send Deputies into the <hi>East,</hi> to fetch the true <hi>Canons</hi> thence (as hath been related already) in the mean time <hi>Zosimus</hi> dyes, and <hi>Boniface</hi> succeeds him; but for the better satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Council of Carthage</hi> dispatch away a Letter to <hi>Boniface,</hi> to give him an account of their proceedings; in which Epistle (extant in the <hi>African Code</hi> of <hi>Canons</hi>) after they have given an account of the business of <hi>Apiarius,</hi> they proceed to the instructions which <hi>Faustinus</hi> brought with him to <hi>Africa,</hi> the chief of which is that concerning <hi>Appeals</hi> to be made to <hi>Rome,</hi> and then follow those words which you quote, in which they

Carthag. Epist. ad Caelestinum.</note> and giving so great light to our present Controversie, I shall at large recite and render it, so far as concerns this business. <hi>After our bounden duty of Salutation, we earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, that hereafter you admit not so easily to your ears those that come from hence, and that you admit no more into communion, those whom we have cast out: for your Reverence will easily perceive, that this is forbid by the Council of</hi> Nice. <hi>For if this be taken care for, as to the Inferiour Clergy and Laity, How much more would it have it to be observed in Bishops; that so they who are in their own Province suspended from communion, be not hastily or unduly admitted by your Holiness. Let your Holiness also reject the wicked refuges of Priests and Inferiour Clerks; for no Canon of the Fathers hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that from the Church of</hi> Africk; <hi>and the decrees of</hi> Nice <hi>hath subjected both the Inferiour Clergy, and Bishops, io their Metropolitans. For they have most wisely and justly provided, that every business be determined in the place where it begun: and that the Grace of the Holy Spirit will not be wanting to every Province, that so equity may be prudently discovered, and constantly held by Christ's Priests. Especially seeing that it is lawful to every one, if he be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, to appeal to the Council of the Province, or even to an Vniversal Council. Vnless perhaps some body believe that God can inspire to every one of us, the justice of examination of a cause, and refuse it to a multitude of Bishops assembled in Council. Or, How can a judgement made beyond the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:101069:215"/>
Sea be valid, to which the persons of necessary witnesses cannot be brought, by reason of the infirmity of their sex and age, or of many other intervening im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments. For this sending of men to us from your Holiness, we do not find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by any Synod of the Fathers. And as for that which you did long since send to us by</hi> Faustinus <hi>our Fellow-Bishop, as belonging to the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>we could not find it in the truest Copies of the Council, sent by holy</hi> Cyril <hi>our Colleague, Bishop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and by the venerable</hi> Atticus <hi>Bishop of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople: <hi>which also we sent to your predecessor</hi> Boniface, <hi>of happy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by</hi> Innocent <hi>a Presbyter, and</hi> Marcellus <hi>a Deacon. Take heed also of sending to us any of your Clerks for executors, to those who desire it, lest we seem to bring the swelling pride of the world into the Church of Christ, which beareth the light of simplicity, and the brightness of humility before them that desire to see God. And concerning our Brother</hi> Faustinus (Apiarius <hi>being now for his wickedness cast out of the Church of Christ) we are confident, that our brotherly love continuing through the goodness and moderation of your Holiness,</hi> Africa <hi>shall no more be troubled with him.</hi> Thus I have at large produced this noble Monument of the prudence, courage, and simplicity of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Fathers</hi>; enough to put any reasonable man out of the fond conceit of an <hi>Vniversal Pastorship</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> I wonder not that <hi>Baronius</hi> saith, <hi>There are some hard things in this Epistle,</hi> that <hi>Perron</hi> sweats and toils so much to so little purpose, to enervate the force of it; for, as long as the records of it last, we have an impregnable Bulwark against the <hi>Vsurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And methinks you might blush for shame to produce those <hi>African Fathers,</hi> as determining the Appeals of <hi>Bishops</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> who, with as much evidence and reason, as courage and resolution, did finally oppose it. What can be said more convincingly against these <hi>Appeals,</hi> than is here urged by them: That they have neither authority from <hi>Councils,</hi> nor any <hi>Foundation</hi> in <hi>Justice and Equity</hi>; that <hi>God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> was as well in <hi>Africk</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> (no doubt then they never imagined any <hi>Infallibility</hi> there) that the proceedings of the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> were so far from the <hi>simplicity</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that they tended only to nourish <hi>swelling pride,</hi> and <hi>secular ambition</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> That the <hi>Pope</hi> had no authority to send <hi>Legats</hi> to hear causes, and they hoped they should be no more troubled with such as <hi>Faustinus</hi> was. All these things are so evident in this testimony, that it were a disparagement to it to offer more at large to explain them. I hope then, this will make you sensible of the injury you have done the <hi>African Fathers,</hi> by saying, that they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, the causes of <hi>Bishops</hi> might be heard at <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <hi>viz. that the Patriarch is to put a final end to those cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which come before him by Appeal from Bishops and Arch-Bishops,</hi> is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same, that it speaks only of the <hi>Inferiour Clergy,</hi> and therefore is taken off already. <hi>But you wonder his Lordship should expose to view the following words of S.</hi> Gregory, <hi>where there is neither Metropolitan, nor Patriarch of that Diocese, there they are to have recourse to the See Apostolick, as being the Head of all Churches. Then surely it follows, say you, the Bishop of</hi> Rome<hi>'s Jurisdiction, is not only over the Western, and Southern Provinces, but over the whole Church, whither the Jurisdiction of Patriarchs and Metropolitans never extended.</hi> See how well you make good the common saying, That <hi>Ignorance is the cause of Admiration</hi>; for, Wherefore should you <hi>wonder</hi> at his Lordships producing these words; if you had either understood, or considered the abundant Answers which he gives to them?<note place="margin">P. 171.</note> 1. <hi>That if
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:101069:216"/>
there be a Metropolitan, or a Patriarch, in those Churches, his judgement is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and there ought to be no Appeal to</hi> Rome. 2. <hi>It is as plain, that in those ancient times of Church-Government,</hi> Britain <hi>was never subject to the See of</hi> Rome (of which afterwards.) 3. <hi>It will be hard for any man to prove, that there were any Churches then in the world, which were not under some ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Patriarch or Metropolitan.</hi> 4. <hi>If any such were, 'tis</hi> gratis dictum, <hi>and impossible to be proved, that all such Churches, where-ever seated in the world, were obliged to depend on</hi> Rome. And, Do you still wonder why his Lordship produces these words? I may more justly <hi>wonder</hi> why you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no Answer to what his Lordship here sayes. But still the <hi>Caput omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Ecclesiarum</hi> sticks with you; if his Lordship hath not particularly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to that, it was, because his whole discourse was sufficient to a man of ordinary capacity, to let him see, that no more could be meant by it, but some <hi>preheminence</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> above others in regard of <hi>order</hi> and <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> but no such thing as <hi>Vniversal Power and Jurisdiction</hi> was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from it. And if <hi>Gregory</hi> understood more by it, as his Lordship saith, 'Tis <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> himself was not a person to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his own cause. But now, as you express it, <hi>his Lordship takes a leap from the Church of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">P. 188.</note> 
                  <hi>to the Church of</hi> England: No, neither his Lordship, nor we, take a <hi>leap</hi> from thence hither; but you are the men who <hi>leap</hi> over the <hi>Alps,</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> We plead as his Lordship doth truly, <hi>That in the ancient times of the Church,</hi> Britain <hi>was never subject to the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>but being one of the Western Dioceses of the Empire, it had a Primate of its own.</hi> This, you say, his Lordship should have proved,<note place="margin">P. 189.</note> and not meerly said. But, What an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man are you, who would put his Lordship to prove <hi>Negatives</hi>; if you challenge a right which the <hi>Pope</hi> hath over us, it is your business to prove it; his Lordship gave a sufficient reason for what he said, <hi>in saying that</hi> Britain <hi>was one of the Dioceses of the Empire, and therefore had a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of her own.</hi> This you deny not, but say, this only proves, <hi>That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Clergy could not appeal to</hi> Rome. What again? but this subterfuge hath been prevented already. But to pass by what without any shadow of proof you say <hi>of the Patriarch of</hi> Constantinople<hi>'s being subject to the Pope; and Pope</hi> Urban<hi>'s calling</hi> Anselm <hi>the Patriarch of the other world</hi>; which we are far from making the least ground to make <hi>Canterbury</hi> a <hi>Patriarchal See</hi>; which, as far as concerns the rights of <hi>Primacy,</hi> was so long before the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> of <hi>Bar</hi> in <hi>Apulia</hi>; we come to that which is more material, <hi>viz.</hi> your attempt to prove, <hi>That</hi> Britain <hi>was anciently subject to the See of</hi> Rome; for which you instance <hi>in</hi> Wilfrid <hi>Arch-Bishop of</hi> York <hi>appealing to</hi> Rome, <hi>about</hi> A.

                  <hi>and so being a second time expelled, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed as formerly, and was again restored.</hi> To which I shall return you a clear and full Answer in the words of another <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> the late learned <hi>L.

                     <hi>that a person twice condemned by the whole Council of the</hi> English <hi>should be restored upon the Popes letter.</hi> If they had believed the <hi>Pope</hi> to be their competent Judge, either as Universal <hi>Monarch,</hi> or so much as <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Brittain,</hi> or any more then an honourable <hi>Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> (which all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were, even without the bounds of their proper jurisdictions) How comes it to pass that two <hi>Kings</hi> successively, and the great <hi>Councils</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the other Archbishop <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> with all the prime <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> and the flower of the <hi>English Clergy,</hi> did so long and so resolutely oppose so many sentences and messages from <hi>Rome,</hi> and condemn him twice whom the <hi>Pope</hi> had absolved? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that <hi>Wilfride</hi> was an <hi>Archbishop,</hi> not an <hi>Inferiour Clerk</hi>; and if an appeal from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> had been proper or lawful in any case, it had been so in this case. But it was otherwise determined by those who were most concerned. <hi>Malmsbury</hi> supposeth, either by <hi>Inspiration,</hi> or upon his own head, that the <hi>King</hi> and the Archbishop <hi>Theodore,</hi> were smitten with remorse before their deaths, for the injury done to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fride,</hi> and the slighting the <hi>Popes</hi> sentence, letter, and <hi>Legats.</hi> But the contrary is most apparently true; For first, it was not King <hi>Alfrede</hi> alone, but the great <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> also; not <hi>Theodore</hi> alone, but the main body of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that opposed the <hi>Popes</hi> letter, and the restitution of <hi>Wilfride</hi> in that manner as it was decreed at <hi>Rome.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, after <hi>Alfrede</hi> and <hi>Theodore</hi> were both dead, we find the <hi>Popes</hi> sentence, and <hi>Wilfrides</hi> restitution, still opposed by the surviving <hi>Bishops</hi> in the <hi>Raign</hi> of <hi>Alfredes</hi> son. To clear the matter past contradiction, let us consider the ground of this long and bitter contention; <hi>Wilfride</hi> the <hi>Archbishop</hi> was become a great <hi>Pluralist,</hi> and had ingrossed into his hands too many Ecclesiastical Dignities. The <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> thought fit to deprive him of some of them, and to confer them upon others. <hi>Wilfride</hi> appealed from their sentence to <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> gave sentence after sentence in favour of <hi>Wilfride.</hi> But for all his sentences, he was not, he could not be restored, untill he had quitted two of his Monasteries which were in Question, <hi>Hongestilldean,</hi> and <hi>Ripon,</hi> which of all others he loved most dearly, and where he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards interred. This was not a Conquest, but a plain waving of his sentences from <hi>Rome,</hi> and yielding of the <hi>Question</hi>; for those had been the chief causes of the Controversie. So the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> after <hi>Alfredes</hi> death still made good his conclusion, That it was against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that a person twice condemned by the whole <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>English,</hi> should be restored upon the <hi>Popes Bull.</hi> And as he did not, so neither did they give any assent to the <hi>Popes Legation.</hi>

                  <hi>of the Primacy of</hi> Canterbury; <hi>in this Letter and Mandate of the Pope it is

founded; nor can it with any colour of reason be drawn from other origin. And by vertue of this Grant, have all the succeeding Bishops of that See enjoyn'd the Dignity and Authority of Primats of this Nation.</hi> From whence you very civilly charge his Lordship, <hi>either with gross Ignorance if he knew it not; or with great Ingratitude if he knew it.</hi> To which I Answer; that his Lordship knowing this no doubt very well, that <hi>Gregory</hi> sent <hi>Austin</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. could not from thence think himself bound to submit to the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi>; and it had been more pertinent to your purpose, not to charge him with <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> but with <hi>Disobedience.</hi> For that was it which you ought to prove hence, that the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ought still to be subject to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> because <hi>Gregory</hi> 1. <hi>made</hi> Augustine <hi>the first Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury. A wonderful strong Argument no doubt! which out of charity to you, we must further examine; for you tell us, <hi>The Original Charter of the Primacy of</hi> Canterbury <hi>is contained in that Grant.</hi> To satisfie you as to this, two things are to be considered, the <hi>Primacy</hi> it self, and the <hi>exercise</hi> of it by a particular person in some particular place. If you speak of the <hi>Primacy</hi> it self, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent right</hi> of Governing the <hi>Churches</hi> within the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> then we utterly deny that this was contained in that Grant. For <hi>Britain</hi> having been a <hi>Province</hi> before, in which <hi>Bishops</hi> did Govern Independently on any <hi>Forrein Bishop,</hi> no Forrein <hi>Bishops</hi> could take away that <hi>Priviledge</hi> from it. I will not stand here to deduce the History of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> before <hi>Augustines</hi> coming into <hi>England</hi>; but it is as certain that there were such, as it is that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ever came hither. For not only all our own Historians and <hi>Bede</hi> himself confess it; but it is most evident from the subscriptions of three of them to the <hi>first Council</hi> of <hi>Arles, Eborius</hi> of <hi>York, Restitutus</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Adelfius de civitate Coloni√¢ Londinensium</hi> (which some will have to be a mistake for <hi>Colonia Camaloduni,</hi> whether by that, <hi>Colchester, Maldon,</hi> or <hi>Winchester</hi> be meant as it is differently thought) from the presence of some of them at the <hi>Sardican Synod</hi> and the <hi>Council of Ariminum,</hi> as appears by <hi>Athanasius</hi> and others; but this I suppose you will not deny, that there were <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>England</hi> before <hi>Austin</hi> came. And, that these <hi>Bishops</hi> had then no dependence on the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> if it were not sufficiently evident from other Arguments, the relation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in <hi>Bede</hi> himself between <hi>Austin</hi> and them, about submission, would abundantly discover, as likewise that there was then an <hi>Archbishop</hi> with <hi>Metropolitical power</hi> over them, whose ancient seat had been <hi>Caerleon.</hi> But I consider not this <hi>Primacy</hi> now as in any particular place, but in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as belonging to the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> which I say had a <hi>Primacy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, (whether at <hi>York</hi> or <hi>London</hi> is not material) at the time of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> (according to what hath been formerly said about the state of <hi>Churches</hi> then) now the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> takes care <hi>that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of all Churches should be preserved,</hi> i. e. That where there had been a <hi>Primacy</hi> it should so continue. Now therefore I ask, How came this priviledge of <hi>Britain</hi> to be lost, which was not only confirmed with others by the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> but by that of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in which the ancient priviledges of Churches are secured? what right had <hi>Austin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> to cassate the ancient <hi>Metropolitical power</hi> of the <hi>Britannick Church,</hi> and to require absolute subjection to himself? If the <hi>Pope</hi> made him <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by what right was he <hi>Primate</hi> over the <hi>Britain Church?</hi> How came the <hi>Archbishop</hi> then in being to lose his <hi>Primacy</hi> by <hi>Austins</hi> coming into <hi>England?</hi> Was it because the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> was
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:101069:217"/>
then over-run with <hi>Pagan-Saxons,</hi> and the visible power of it confined to a narrow compass? Yet I doubt not, but there were many <hi>Brittish Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> living here among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> though oppressed by them, as they were after by the <hi>Normans</hi> (for, Where is it that any conquest hath carried away all the inhabitants?) and that these did many of them retain their <hi>Christianity,</hi> though not daring publickly to own it, there are many not improbable circumstances to lead us to suppose. But we will grant that the face of the <hi>Britannick Church</hi> was only in <hi>Wales</hi>; what follows thence? that the whole <hi>Province</hi> had lost its right? Let us suppose a case like this; as that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> should be over-run with a Barbarous people (as it was by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi>) and the inhabitants destroyed; these Barbarous people continuing in possession of it, and that a <hi>Bishop</hi> should have been sent from <hi>Britain</hi> to convert them to the Faith, and upon their Conversion to <hi>Govern</hi> those <hi>Churches,</hi> and should be made <hi>Bishop</hi> of that place by the <hi>Brittish Bishops</hi>; Whether would he be bound to continue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in subjection to them or no? If not; but you say, <hi>by his succession in the See of</hi> Rome <hi>he enjoyes the priviledges of that See, though the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants be altered</hi>; the same I say of the <hi>Britannick Churches,</hi> though the inhabitants were altered, and <hi>Saxons</hi> succeeded the <hi>Britains,</hi> yet the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the <hi>Church</hi> remains still as to its Primacy and Independency. And therefore the <hi>Popes</hi> making <hi>Augustine</hi> Archbishop, so as to give him withall the <hi>Primacy</hi> over the <hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> was an <hi>Vsurpation</hi> upon the <hi>rights</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> which had an absolute and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent <hi>Primacy</hi> within it self; as it was in the case of the <hi>Cyprian Bishop.</hi> As supposing those ancient Sects of <hi>Churches</hi> which are over-run with <hi>Turks</hi> should again be converted to <hi>Christianity,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> of those <hi>Churches</hi> as of <hi>Ephesus</hi> or the like would enjoy the same rights which the ancient <hi>Bishops</hi> had; so we say it was in our case, though the Nation was then over-spread with <hi>Paganism,</hi> yet <hi>Christianity</hi> returning, the priviledges of our <hi>Churches</hi> did return with it; and whosoever were rightly conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated <hi>Bishops</hi> of them would enjoy the same <hi>rights</hi> which they did before. So that <hi>Gregory</hi> might make <hi>Austin</hi> a <hi>Bishop</hi> and send him to convert this Nation, by which he was capable to Govern the <hi>Churches</hi> here which he did convert, but he could not give to him the <hi>right</hi> over these <hi>Churches,</hi> which <hi>Gregory</hi> had no power over himself; neither could <hi>Austin</hi> or any other <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> give away the <hi>Primacy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himself to the <hi>Roman See.</hi> What therefore is <hi>Gregories Grant</hi> to <hi>Austin,</hi> to the <hi>Primacy</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> If you ask then, How the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> come to be <hi>Primates</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> I Answer, 1. This <hi>Primacy</hi> must be lodged somewhere; and it is not unalterably fixed to any certain place, because the <hi>Primacy</hi> belongs to the <hi>Church</hi> and not to a particular <hi>See.</hi> 2. It is in the power of <hi>Princes</hi> to fix the <hi>Metropolitan See</hi> in what place is judged most convenient; thence have been the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent removes of <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Archiepiscopal See</hi>'s; as is evident in many examples in <hi>Ecclesiastical history,</hi> particularly in <hi>Justiniana Prima</hi> made a <hi>Metropolis</hi> by <hi>Justinian.</hi> 3. Where ever the <hi>Primacy</hi> is lodged it retains its <hi>ancient priviledges</hi>; so that there is no need of a succession of our <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops</hi> from the <hi>Brittish Archbishops</hi> of <hi>Caerleon</hi> to preserve the <hi>Brittish Primacy</hi>; but that <hi>See</hi> being removed by the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi>; the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> still remains the same, that it was in the <hi>Brittish Metropolitans.</hi> And thus I hope I have shewn you, that the <hi>Original Charter of the Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury's <hi>Primacy,</hi> was not contained in the <hi>Popes</hi> grant to <hi>Austin.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">P. 172.</note> 
                  <hi>set themselves to assert their own liberties, and held it out stoutly against</hi> Zozimus, Boniface 1, <hi>and</hi> Caelestine 1. <hi>who were successively Bishops of</hi> Rome. <hi>At last, it was concluded in the sixth Council of</hi> Carthage, <hi>(wherein were assembled two hundred and seventeen Bishops, of which St.</hi> Augustine <hi>himself was one) that they would not give way to such a manifest encroachment upon their rights and liberties; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon gave present notice to</hi> Caelestine <hi>to forbear sending his Officers amongst them, lest he should seem to induce the swelling pride of the World into the Church of Christ. And this is said to have amounted into a formal separation from the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and to have continued for the space of somewhat more then one hundred years. For which his Lordship produceth two publick instruments extant among the ancient Councils; the one an Epistle from</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface 2. <hi>in whose time the reconciliation to</hi> Rome <hi>is said to be made by</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalius <hi>then Bishop of</hi> Carthage; <hi>but the separation,</hi> instigante Diabolo, <hi>by the Temptation of the Devil. The other is an</hi> exemplar precum, <hi>or Copy of the Petition of the same</hi> Eulalius, <hi>in which he damns and curses all those his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours which went against the Church of</hi> Rome. <hi>Now his Lordship urges from hence; Either these Instruments are true, or false. If they be false, then</hi> Boniface 2. <hi>and his Accomplices at</hi> Rome, <hi>or some for them are notorious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and that of Records of great consequence to the Government and peace of the whole Church of Christ, and to the perpetual Infamy of that See, and all this foolishly and to no purpose: On the other side, if these instruments be true; then 'tis manifest that the Church of</hi> Africk <hi>separated from the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>which separation was either unjust, or just; if unjust then St.</hi> Austin, Eugenius, Fulgentius, <hi>and all those Bishops and other Martyrs which suffered in the Vandalike persecution, dyed in actual and unrepented Schism, and out of the Church; If it were just, then is it far more lawful for the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>by a National Council to cast off the Popes Vsurpation, as she did, than it was for the</hi> African <hi>Church to separate; because then the</hi> African <hi>Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted only against the Pride of</hi> Rome <hi>in case of Appeals, and two other Canons less material; but the Church of</hi> England <hi>excepts (besides this grievance) against many corruptions in Doctrine, with which</hi> Rome <hi>at that time was not tainted. And St.</hi> Austin <hi>and those other famous men durst not thus have separated from</hi> Rome, <hi>had the Pope had that powerful Principality over the whole Church of Christ, and that by Christs own Ordinance and Institution as</hi> A.

                  <hi>but are very willing to think them forgeries; but you say, the Schismatical separation of the</hi> African <hi>Church from the</hi> Roman <hi>is inconsistent with the truth of story, and confuted by many pregnant and undeniable instances, which prove that the</hi> Africans <hi>notwithstanding the context in the sixth Council of</hi> Carthage <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of Appeals, were alwayes in true Catholick Communion with the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, even during the term of this pretended separation.

To all which I Answer; that either the <hi>African Fathers</hi> did persist in the decree of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> or they did not: if they did persist in it, and no separation followed; then the casting off the <hi>Vsurpations</hi> of the

                  <hi>Roman See</hi> cannot incur the guilt of <hi>Schism</hi>; for these <hi>African Bishops</hi> did that, and it seems continued still in the <hi>Roman Communion</hi>; by which it is evident that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was not so far degenerated then as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, or that the Authority of those persons was so great in the <hi>Church,</hi> that the <hi>Roman Bishops</hi> durst not openly break with them, which is a sufficient account of what <hi>Caelestine</hi> saith concerning St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that he lived and dyed in the Communion of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> If you say the reason why they were in Communion with the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was because they did not persist; you must prove it by better instances then you have here brought; for some of them are sufficient proofs of the contrary.

Did not the <hi>African Bishops</hi> of <hi>Mauritania Caesariensis</hi> excommunicate him notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that appeal, and ordained another in his place; and therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> very fairly sends him back to be tryed by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi> Which instance as it argues the <hi>Popes</hi> willingness to have brought up Appeals among them, so it shews the continuance of their stoutness in opposing them.

                     <hi>Greg. l.</hi> 1 <hi>ep.</hi> 75</note> though in his time the business of Appeals was much promoted at <hi>Rome</hi>; yet he dares not challenge them from the Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> but yields to them the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those priviledges which they said they had enjoyed from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. And the testimonies of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> imply no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of subjection to <hi>Rome,</hi> but a <hi>Praeeminence</hi> which that <hi>Church</hi> had above all others, which it might have without the other; as <hi>London</hi> may I hope be the <hi>Head-City</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and yet all other Cities not express subjection to it. But if after that <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> did by degrees encroach upon the liberties of the <hi>African Churches,</hi> there is this sufficient account to be given of it; that as the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops were alwayes watchful to take advantages to inhance their power, and that especially when other <hi>Churches</hi> were in a suffering condition, so a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity fell out for them to do it in <hi>Africa</hi>; For not long after that <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> fell out that dismal persecution of the <hi>African Churches</hi> by the irruption of the <hi>Vandals</hi>; in which all the Catholick Bishops were banished out of <hi>Africa,</hi> or lived under great sufferings; and by a strict edict of <hi>Gensericus,</hi> no new Bishops were suffered to be ordained in the places of the former. This now was a fair opportunity for the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to advance his Authority among the suffering Bishops; St. <hi>Peters</hi> pretended <hi>Successour</hi> loving to <hi>fish</hi> in troubled waters, and it being fatal to <hi>Rome</hi> from the first Foundation of it, to advance her self by the <hi>ruins</hi> of other places.</p>

                  <hi>For the calling and Authority of Bishops over the Inferiour Clergy, that was a thing of known use and benefit for preservation of Vnity and Peace in the Church. Which was confessed by St.</hi> Hierom <hi>himself, and so settled in mens minds from the very Infancy of the Church, that it had not been to that time contradicted by any. The only difficulty then was to accommodate the places and preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bishops, among themselves, for the very necessity of order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To do this the most equal and impartial way was, that as the Church is
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:101069:219"/>
in the Common-wealth, not the Common-wealth in it, (as</hi> Optatus <hi>tells us) So the Honours of the Church should follow the Honours of the State; and so it was insinuated if not ordered (as appears) by the Canons of the Councils of</hi> Chalcedon <hi>and</hi> Antioch. <hi>And this was the very Fountain of the Papal Greatness; the Pope having his Residence in the great Imperial City. But Precedency is one thing, and Authority another; It was thought fit therefore, that among Bishops there should be a certain subordination and subjection. The Empire therefore being cast into several Divisions (which they call'd Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses) every Diocese contained several Provinces, every Province several Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks; The chief of a Diocese was call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and sometimes a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch; the chief of a Province a Metropolitan; next the Bishops in their sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Dioceses (as we now use that word), among these there was effectual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection respectively grounded upon Canon, and Positive Law, in their several Quarters; but over them, none at all: all the Difference there, was but</hi> Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary <hi>not</hi> Authoritative. To all this part of his Lordships Discourse, you only say, <hi>That it is founded upon his own conjectural presumptions more then upon any thing else;</hi>

                  <hi>and that you have shewed a far different Fountain of the Popes Authority from</hi> Tu es Petrus, &amp; super hanc Petram, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what you say, is, That his Lordships Discourse hath too much Truth and Reason to be Answered solidly; but because it is against the <hi>Popes</hi> interest you defie him, and cross your self, and cry, <hi>Tu es Petrus, &amp;c.</hi> and think, this will prevent its doing you any harm.

                  <hi>is to overthrow the Pope's Supremacy, by shewing, it was not lawful to appeal to</hi> Rome; <hi>but Catholick Authours</hi> (to be sure you are in the number) <hi>frame an unanswerable argument for his Supremacy, even from the contrary, thus; it was ever held lawful to appeal to</hi> Rome <hi>in Ecclesiastical affairs, from all the parts of Christendom; therefore, say they, The Pope must needs be Supreme Judge in Ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This is evidenced out of the</hi> 4, <hi>and</hi> 7, <hi>Canons of the Council of</hi> Sardica, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted anciently an Appendix of the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>and often cited as the same with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Will you give us leave to come near and handle this <hi>unanswerable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> a little? for persons of your profession use to be very shie of that. But however, since it is exposed to common view, we may take leave to do it. And seriously, upon consideration of all the parts and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, I am of your mind, without flattering you, that it is <hi>an unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable argument,</hi> but quite to another purpose than you brought it for, even against the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> as I shall presently discover; so that <hi>those Catholick Authors</hi> have served you just as <hi>Lazarillo</hi> did his blind Master, in bidding him leap over the water, that he might run his head full butt against the tree. For that which your best <hi>Authors</hi> shun as much as may be, and use their best arts to get besides it, you run blindly, and therefore boldly upon it, as though it were an excellent argument to your purpose. You say, The evidence for Appeals, is from the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Sardican Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> but if this be an unanswerable argument for the <hi>Pope's Supremacy.</hi> 1. How come these <hi>Appeals</hi> to be pleaded from the <hi>Sardican Synod?</hi> 2. How come <hi>these Appeals</hi> to be denied, notwithstanding the <hi>Canons</hi> of it? The former will prove that the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> if granted from hence, was not acknowledged from <hi>Divine Right</hi>; the latter, that it <hi>was not universally acknowledged by the Church after</hi>; and therefore both of them will make an <hi>unanswerable argument</hi> against that which you would prove, <hi>viz. the Pope's Supremacy.</hi> First, If the <hi>Pope's Supremacy</hi> be evidenced from hence. 1. How comes it at all to depend on the <hi>Canons?</hi> 2. Why no sooner than the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Sardica?</hi> 3. Why not at all mentioned in them? 1. How comes the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> if of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> to depend at all upon the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> We had thought it had been much more to your purpose, not to have mentioned any <hi>Canons</hi> at all of the <hi>Church</hi> about it, but to have produced evidences, that this was constantly acknowledged as of <hi>Divine Institution.</hi> But we must bear with you, in not producing that which is not to be found. For nothing can be more apparent, than that when the <hi>Popes</hi> began to pierk up, they pleaded nothing but some <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for what they did, as <hi>Julius</hi> to the <hi>Oriental Bishops, Zosimus</hi> to the <hi>African,</hi> and so others. If it had been ever thought then, that this <hi>Supremacy</hi> was of <hi>Divine Right</hi>; What senseless men were these, to make use of the worst pleas, and never mention the best. For, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing they had such a <hi>Supremacy</hi> granted them by the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:101069:220"/>
Doth not this imply that their authority did depend upon the <hi>Churches</hi> grant? and, what the <hi>Church</hi> might give for her own conveniency, she might take it away, when she saw it abused to her apparent prejudice. And therefore if they had thought that <hi>God</hi> had commanded all <hi>Churches</hi> to be subject to them, it was weakly done of them to plead nothing but the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> for it. 2. Why no sooner than the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Sardica?</hi> Was the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> without her <hi>Supremacy</hi> till that time? Will no <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> evidence it before them? When this <hi>Council</hi> was not held till eleven years after the death of <hi>Constantine.</hi> Had the <hi>Pope</hi> no right of Appeals till it was decreed here? <hi>Yes,</hi> Zosimus <hi>pleads the Nicene Canons for it</hi>; But upon what grounds, will appear suddenly. 3. Why is not the <hi>Pope's Supremacy</hi> mentioned as the ground of these Appeals then? Certainly those <hi>Western Bishops,</hi> who made those <hi>Canons,</hi> should have only recognized the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of the <hi>Pope's Supremacy</hi>; and not made a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> in such a manner as they do; that would make any one be confident they never knew the <hi>Popes Supremacy.</hi> For their decree runs thus; <hi>That in case any Bishop thought himself unjustly condemned; if it seem good to you,</hi>

I begin therefore with the <hi>Title of Vniversal Bishop</hi> attributed to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; and before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your particular allegations, we must more fully consider, in what sense that title of <hi>Vniversal Bishops</hi> was taken in <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and in what manner it was attributed to him. For when <hi>titles</hi> have different senses, and those senses evidently made use of by the ancient Writers, it is a most unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing meerly from the title to inferr one determinate sense, which is the most contrary to the current of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> The title then of <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Bishop,</hi> may be conceived to import one of these three things. 1. <hi>A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral care and solicitude over all the Churches of the Christian world.</hi> 2. <hi>A pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar dignity over the Churches within the Empire.</hi> 3. <hi>Vniversal Jurisdiction over all Churches,</hi> so that all exercise of it in the Church is derivative from him as <hi>Vniversal Pastor and Head of the Church.</hi> This last is that which
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:101069:222"/>
you attribute to the <hi>Pope</hi>; and though you find the name of <hi>Vniversal Bishop a hundred times over,</hi> in the records of the <hi>Church,</hi> yet if it be taken in either of the two former senses, it makes nothing at all to your purpose. Our business is therefore now, to shew, that this title was used in the Church in the two former senses; and that nothing from hence can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for that <hi>Oecumenical Pastorship,</hi> which you say, doth, of Divine Right, belong to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note>I begin with the <hi>first,</hi> as this Title may import <hi>a general care and solicitude over all the Christian Churches:</hi> and I deny not but in this sense this title might be attributed in <hi>Antiquity</hi> to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; but then I assert, that nothing peculiar to him can be inferred from hence, because expressions importing the same care, are attributed to other <hi>Bishops,</hi> especially such who were placed in the greater <hi>Sees,</hi> or were active in promoting the <hi>Churches</hi> interest. For which we must consider, that power and authority in the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is given with an immediate respect to the good of the <hi>whole Church</hi>; so that if it were possible that every particular <hi>Bishop</hi> could take care of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> they have authority enough by their <hi>Function</hi> to do it. But it not only being impossible that every <hi>Bishop</hi> should do it, but it being inconsistent with peace and order, that all should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it; therefore it was necessary that there should be some restraints and bounds set, for the more convenient management of that authority which they had. From hence came the <hi>Original</hi> of particular <hi>Dioceses,</hi> that within such a compass they might better exercise that power which they enjoyed. As if many lights be placed in a great Room, though the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every one of these is to give light to the <hi>whole Room</hi>; yet that this might the better be done, these lights are conveniently placed in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of it. And this is that which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> means in that famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his, <hi>That there is but one Bishoprick in the whole world, a part of which is held by every Bishop</hi>; For the <hi>Church</hi> in common is designed as the Diocese of all <hi>Bishops,</hi> which is set out into several <hi>appartiments</hi> for the more advantagious governing of it. As a flock of many thousand sheep, being committed to the care of many Shepherds, these all have an eye to the good of the <hi>whole Flock,</hi> but do not therefore sit altogether in one place to over-see it; but every one hath his share to look after, for the benefit of the <hi>Whole:</hi> But yet so, that upon occasion, one of them may extend his care beyond his own division, and may be very useful for the whole, by counsel and direction. Thus we shall find it was in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church</hi>; though every <hi>Bishop</hi> had his particular <hi>Charge,</hi> yet still they regarded the common good of the whole Church, and upon occasion did extend their counsel and advice far beyond their particular <hi>Churches</hi>; and exercised their Functions in other places besides those, which the <hi>Churches</hi> convenience had allotted to them. Hence it was, that, dissentions arising between the <hi>Asian</hi> and <hi>Roman Churches, Polycarp</hi> comes to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there,<note place="margin">Euseb. l. 5. cap. 24. Not. in l.</note> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, He exercised with <hi>Anicetus</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, his Episcopal Function. For, as <hi>Valesius</hi> observes, it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as <hi>Franciscus Florens</hi> would have it, of his <hi>receiving the Eucharist from Anicetus,</hi> but something of <hi>honour</hi> is implied in the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>call the</hi> Roman <hi>Bishops, Bishops of the Vniversal Church, they do it from the custome of their Churches, not that they look on them as Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Bishops of the whole Church, but in the same sense that the Patriarchs of</hi> Constantinople, Antioch, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Jerusalem, <hi>are call'd so; or as they are Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal over the Churches under their Patriarchate; or that in Oecumenical Councils they preside over the whole Church.</hi> And after acknowledgeth, that the title of <hi>Vniversal</hi> or <hi>Oecumenical Bishop</hi> makes nothing for the <hi>Popes Monarchy</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> And if it doth not so when given by the <hi>Western Fathers,</hi> much less certainly when given by the <hi>Eastern,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those who met in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>; For it is evident by their 16 <hi>Session,</hi> the 28 <hi>Canon,</hi> and their <hi>Synodical Epistle</hi> to <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> they designed the advancement of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>equal priviledges with that of</hi> Rome. And therefore if they gave the <hi>Pope</hi> the title of <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Patriarch,</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> it was that he might be willing that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Constantinople</hi> might be call'd so too. And if, as <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, the <hi>Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>would not accept the title of Vniversal Bishop,</hi> the truest account I know of it, is, lest the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> should share with him in it; but we see when the great <hi>Benefactor</hi> to your <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>Benigne Phocas,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> himself styles him, gave it to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome alone,</hi> then <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>heart</hi> and all were ready to receive it. And I much fear <hi>Leo</hi> 1. and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> himself would have been shrewdly tempted to receive it, if it had been offered them upon those terms, that no one else should have it besides them; but they scorned it till they could have it alone. And for all their declamations against the <hi>pride</hi> of <hi>Anatolius</hi> and <hi>John, Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they must look very favourably on the actions of those two <hi>Popes,</hi> that discern not their own <hi>Pride</hi> in condemning of them for it. For usually men shew it as much in suspecting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning others for it, as in any other way whatsoever. Thus it was in these persons; they thought the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> proud and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, because they sought to be equal with them. But, Was it not their own greater <hi>Pride,</hi> that they were able to bear no <hi>equals?</hi> and it is to be feared, it was their desire to advance their own <hi>Supremacy</hi> which made them quarrel so much with <hi>Anatolius,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Cyriacus.</hi> For would they but have been contented to truckle under the <hi>Roman Bishops</hi> they had been accounted very meek and humble men. And St. <hi>Gregory</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, would not sure have thought much to have call'd them so, who most abominably flatters that monster <hi>Phocas,</hi> after the murder of <hi>Mauricius</hi> and his <hi>Children:</hi> for he begins his <hi>Epistle</hi> to him with, <hi>Gloria in excelsis Deo: Glory to God on high,</hi>

                  <hi>who, according to what is written, changes times and transfers Kingdomes:</hi> and after, in such notorious flattering expressions congratulates his coming to the <hi>Throne,</hi> that any one who reads them would think <hi>Phocas</hi> the <hi>greater Saint</hi>; he rejoyces, <hi>that the benignity of his piety was advanced to the Imperial Throne, nay</hi> (laetentur coeli &amp; exultet terra) <hi>let the heavens rejoyce and the earth be glad, and all the people which

For before, the <hi>Emperours</hi> stood up for the honour of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> as being the <hi>seat</hi> of their <hi>Empire,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> began to sink, the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> decaying there; but now, there was a fit time to do something for the <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>Roman See; Cyriacus</hi> was in disgrace with the <hi>Tyrant Phocas</hi>; and no such time as now to fall in with him and caresse him: and we see <hi>Gregory</hi> did it prety well for a <hi>Saint,</hi> but he lived not to enjoy the benefit of it; but <hi>Boniface</hi> did however.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Patriarchate</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was erected,<note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> the <hi>Popes</hi> had a double game to play, to advance themselves, and depress that, which it was very hard for them to do, because all the <hi>Eastern Bishops,</hi> as well as the <hi>Emperour</hi> favoured it. But after <hi>equal priviledges</hi> were decreed to the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> they could no longer dissemble their choler; but had no such occasion ministred to them to express it as after the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> (wherein were present 630 <hi>Bishops</hi>) which confirmed the former. For then <hi>Leo</hi> fumes and frets and writes to <hi>Martianus,</hi> and <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> to <hi>Anatolius</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>East</hi>; but still pretends that he stood up for the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the other <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and the <hi>Nicene Canons,</hi> and what not? but one might easily discern what it was that pinched him, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>equalling</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Which it is apparent he suspected before, by the instructions he gave his <hi>Legats Paschasinus</hi> and <hi>Lucentius,</hi> to be sure to oppose whatever was proposed in the <hi>Council</hi> concerning the <hi>Primacy</hi> of that <hi>See.</hi> And accordingly they did; and complained that the <hi>Canon</hi> was <hi>surreptitiously</hi> made. Which they were hugely overseen in doing while the <hi>Council</hi> sat, for upon this the whole matter is reviewed, the <hi>Judges</hi> scan the business, the <hi>Bishops</hi> protest there were no practises used; that they all voluntarily consented to it; and all this in the presence of the <hi>Roman Legats?</hi> How comes it then to pass that this should not be a regular and Conciliar action? Were not the Bishops at age to understand their own <hi>priviledges?</hi> Did not the Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> know his own <hi>interest</hi> as well as <hi>Pope Leo?</hi> Must he be supposed more able to understand the <hi>Nicene Canons</hi> then these 630 Bishops? Why then was not this <hi>Canon</hi> as <hi>regular</hi> as any other. Why forsooth, <hi>The Pope did not consent to it.</hi> So true is that sharp censure of <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> that, <hi>those are accounted lawful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Councils which make for their interest,</hi>

                  <hi>that the Primacy of</hi> Rome <hi>came, by its being the seat of the Empire; and therefore not by Divine right: and since</hi> Constantinople <hi>was become the seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire too, therefore the Patriarch there should enjoy equal priviledges with the Bishop of</hi> Rome. If <hi>Rome</hi> had continued still the sole <hi>seat</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> this reason would not have been quarrelled at; but now <hi>Rome</hi> sinking
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:101069:225"/>
and <hi>Constantinople</hi> rising, this must not be endured, but all the arts and devices possible must be used to keep it under. And this is the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>pique</hi> which the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> had to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi> From whence we may easily, guess how probable it is that this <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> did acknowledge the <hi>Pope Oecumenical Bishop</hi> in any other sense then they contended the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was so too. And the same answer will serve for all your following Instances. For, as you pretend that the <hi>Council of Constantinople</hi> sub Menna <hi>did call Pope</hi> Agapetus <hi>Oecumenical Patriarch,</hi> so it is most certain that it call'd <hi>Mennas</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> so too. And which is more, <hi>Adrian</hi> 1. in his Epistle to <hi>Tharasius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the second <hi>Nicene Council</hi> calls him <hi>Vniversal Bishop.</hi> If therefore the <hi>Greek Emperours</hi> and <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> call the <hi>Pope</hi> so, they import nothing peculiar to him in it, because it is most evident they call'd their own <hi>Patriarch</hi> so likewise. So that you find little advantage to your cause from this first thing which you premise, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> was anciently call'd <hi>Vniversal Bishop.</hi> But you say fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">P. 196. n. 2.</note> 2. <hi>That the Bishops of</hi> Constantinople <hi>never intended to deny by this usurped title, the Popes Vniversal Authority even over themselves.</hi> This is ambiguous, unless it be further explained what you mean by <hi>Vniversal Authority</hi>; for, it may either note some kind of <hi>prae-eminence</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> which the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had as the <hi>chief Patriarch,</hi> and who on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count had great <hi>Authority</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and this your instances prove that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did acknowledge to belong to the <hi>Pope:</hi> but if by <hi>Vniversal Authority</hi> be meant <hi>Vniversal Jurisdiction over the Church as appointed the head of it by Christ,</hi> then not one of your instances comes near the shadow of a proof for it.</p>
               <p>Thus having considered what you premise, we come to your Answer it self.<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 197. n. 3.</note> For which you tell us, <hi>We are to take notice, that the term [Vniversal Bishop] is capable of two senses; the one Grammatical, the other Metaphorical. In the Grammatical sense it signifies Bishop of the Vniversal Church, and of all Churches in particular, even to the exclusion of all others from being properly Bishops; and consequently displaceable at his pleasure; as being only his, not Christs officers; and receiving authority from him, and not from Christ. In the Metaphorical sense, it signifies only so high and eminent a dignity above all other Bishops throughout the whole Church, that though he, who is stiled Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop, hath a true and real Superintendency, Jurisdiction, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all other Bishops, yet that they be as truly and properly Bishops in their respective Provinces and Dioceses as he himself. This being clear'd</hi> (say you) <hi>'tis evident that St.</hi> Gregory <hi>when he inveighs against the title of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">N. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>takes it in the literal and Grammatical sense</hi>; which you very faintly endeavour to prove out of him, as I shall make it presently appear. This being then the substance of that Answer which you say hath been given <hi>a hundred times over,</hi> must now <hi>once</hi> for all pass a strict and severe examination. Which it shall receive in these two Enquiries, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be possible to conceive that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> should take <hi>Vniversal Bishop</hi> in the literal and <hi>Grammatical</hi> sense? 2. Whether all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he useth against that title, do not hold against that <hi>Vniversal Jurisdiction</hi> which you attribute to the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Head of the Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether it be possible to conceive that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> should take <hi>Vniversal Bishop</hi> in the <hi>literal and Grammatical sense</hi> which you give of it? And he which can think so, must have some other way of understanding his meaning then by his words and arguments, which I confess I do not
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:101069:225"/>
pretend to. But if we examine them, we shall find how impossible it is that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> should ever think that <hi>John</hi> pretended to be the sole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of this world. 1. Because <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>That same title which</hi> John <hi>had usurped was offered to the</hi> Roman <hi>Bishops by the Council of</hi> Chalcedon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg. ep. l.</hi> 4. <hi>ep.</hi> 32.</note> 
                  <hi>but none of them would ever use it, because it seemed to diminish the honour of other Bishops.</hi> Now I pray think with your self, whether ever 630 Bishops would consent together to give away all their power and Authority in the <hi>Church?</hi> For you say, <hi>The literal sense of Vniversal Bishop doth suppose him to be Bishop of all particular Churches, to the exclusion of all others from being properly Bishops, and are displaceable at his pleasure.</hi> Can it now enter into your mind that <hi>Gregory</hi> should ever think that these Bishops should all make themselves the <hi>Popes Vassals</hi> of their own free choice? We see even under the great <hi>Vsurpations</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> since, though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (for all that I can see) to be <hi>Oecumenical Bishops</hi> in a higher sense then ever <hi>John</hi> pretended to, that yet the Bishops of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> are not willing to submit their office wholly to the <hi>Papal Jurisdiction</hi>; witness the stout and eager contests of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> about the <hi>Divine Institution of the Episcopal office,</hi> against the pretences of the <hi>Italian</hi> Party. And shall we then think when the <hi>Pope</hi> was far from that power which he hath since Usurped, that such multitude of grave and resolute Bishops should throw their <hi>Miters</hi> down at the <hi>Popes feet</hi> and offer him in your <hi>literal sense,</hi> to be <hi>sole Bishop of the World.</hi> That they would relinquish their power, which they made no question they had from <hi>Christ,</hi> and take it up again at the <hi>Popes hands?</hi> But whether you can imagine this of so many Bishops or no, Can you conceive that <hi>Gregory</hi> should think so of them? and he must do it, if he took the title of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop</hi> in your <hi>literal sense</hi>; and yet this <hi>Gregory</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Greg. l.</hi> 4. <hi>ep.</hi> 36</note> 
                  <hi>Hoc Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis nomen oblatum est, That very name of Vniversal Bishop was offered to the Pope by the Council of</hi> Chalcedon; Sed nullus unquam Decessorum meorum hoc tam prophano Vocabulo uti consensit. Nothing then can be more plain, then that <hi>John</hi> took that which the <hi>Pope</hi> refused. And he that can believe that this title should ever be offered in this literal sense, I despair without the help of <hi>Physick</hi> to make him believe any thing. 2. This very title was not usurped wholly by <hi>John</hi> himself, but was given him in a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> This <hi>Gregory</hi> confesseth in his Epistle to <hi>Eulogius</hi> and <hi>Anastasius,</hi> the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

               <p>These things being thus clear, I have prevented my self in the second <hi>Enquiry,</hi> in that I have proved already,<note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note> that the <hi>Reasons</hi> which St. <hi>Gregory</hi> produceth hold against that sense of <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> which you own and contend for, as of right belonging to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Although it were no difficult matter to prove, that, according to the most received Opinion in your <hi>Church, viz. that all Jurisdiction in Bishops is derived from the Pope</hi> (which opinion you cannot but know is most acceptable at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was so at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>) that that which you call the <hi>Literal sense,</hi> doth follow your <hi>Metaphorical, i. e.</hi> If the <hi>Pope</hi> hath <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Jurisdiction</hi> as <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> then other <hi>Bishops</hi> are not properly <hi>Bishops,</hi> nor <hi>Christ's Officers, but his.</hi> For what doth their <hi>power</hi> of <hi>order</hi> signifie as to the <hi>Church</hi> without the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Jurisdiction?</hi> And therefore, if they be taken only <hi>in partem solicitudinis,</hi> and not <hi>in plenitudinem pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis,</hi> according to the known distinction of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follows, that they are but the <hi>Pope's Officers,</hi> and are taken just into so much authority as he commits to them, and no more.<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Pontif. l. 4. cap. 24.

And, as when his Divine Majesty did govern it, it could not be said that any of the faithful had any the least power or Jurisdiction, but meer, pure, and total sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; so it must be said in all perpetuity of time, and so understood, that the Church is a Sheepfold and a Kingdom. And, that he is the Only Pastor, is plainly proved by the words of Christ, when he said, He hath other sheep which he will gather together, and so one Sheepfold should be made, and one Shepherd.</hi> What think you now of the <hi>Literal sense</hi> of <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> for the <hi>Only Bishop?</hi> Are not the <hi>Only Bishop,</hi> and the <hi>Only Pastor</hi> all one? Will not all those words of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> reach this, which any of you make use of to prove, that he takes it in the worst and Literal sense; nay, it goes higher.

And by this time I hope you see, that the Answer you say hath been given a <hi>hundred times over,</hi> is so pitifully weak, absurd and ridiculous, that you might have been ashamed to have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it <hi>once,</hi> and much more to repeat it without saying any more for it than you do.

                  <q>As yet, saith he, The right of <hi>Election,</hi> or ratification of the <hi>Pope,</hi> continued in the <hi>Emperour</hi>:<note place="margin">P. 179.</note> but then the <hi>Lombards</hi> grew so great in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Empire</hi> was so infested with <hi>Saracens,</hi> and such changes happened in all parts of the world, as that neither for the present, the homage of the <hi>Pope</hi> was useful for the <hi>Emperour</hi>; nor the protection of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> available for the <hi>Pope.</hi> By this means the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> was left to play his own game by himself. A thing which as it pleased him well enough, so both he and his Successors made great advantage by it. For, being grown to that <hi>Eminence</hi> by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the greatness of <hi>that City</hi> and place of his aboad; he found himself the more free, the greater the <hi>Tempest</hi> was, that beat upon the other. And then first he set himself to alienate the hearts of the <hi>Italians</hi> from the <hi>Emperour.</hi> Next he opposed himself against him. And about <hi>A. D.</hi> 710. <hi>Pope Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> 1. did also first of all openly confront <hi>Philippicus</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> in defence of <hi>Images</hi>; as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> tells us. After him <hi>Gregory</hi> 2. and the 3. did the same by <hi>Leo Isaurus.</hi> By this time the <hi>Lombards</hi> began to pinch very close, and to vex on all sides, not <hi>Italy</hi> only, but <hi>Rome</hi> also. This drives the <hi>Pope</hi> to seek a new <hi>Patron.</hi> And very fitly he meets with <hi>Charls Martell</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that famous warrior against the <hi>Sarazens.</hi> Him
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:101069:228"/>
he implores in defence of the <hi>Church</hi> against the <hi>Lombards.</hi> This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress seems very advisedly taken, at least it proves very fortunate to them both. For in short time it dissolved the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which had then stood two hundred and four years, which was the <hi>Popes</hi> security. And it brought the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>France</hi> into the house of <hi>Charls,</hi> and shortly after the <hi>Western Empire</hi>: And now began the <hi>Pope</hi> to be great indeed. For by the bounty of <hi>Pepin</hi> Son of <hi>Charls,</hi> that which was taken from the <hi>Lombards,</hi> was given to the <hi>Pope.</hi> So that now of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> he became a <hi>Temporal Prince.</hi> But when <hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> had set up the <hi>Western Empire,</hi> then he resumed the ancient and original power of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> to govern the <hi>Church,</hi> to call Councils, to order <hi>Papal Elections.</hi> And this power continued in his posterity. For this right of the <hi>Emperour</hi> was in force and use in <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh's time. Who was confirmed in the <hi>Popedom</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, whom he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward deposed. And it might have continued longer, if the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Emperours</hi> had had abilities enough to secure, or vindicate their own Right. But the <hi>Pope</hi> keeping a strong <hi>Council</hi> about him, and meeting with some weak <hi>Princes,</hi> and they oft-times distracted with great and dangerous warrs, grew stronger till he got the better. So this is enough to shew, How the <hi>Popes</hi> climed up by the <hi>Emperours,</hi> till they over-topt them, which is all I said before, and have now proved. And this was about the year 1073. Yet was it carried in succeeding times with great changes of fortune and different success. The <hi>Emperour</hi> sometimes pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> from the <hi>Emperour,</hi> winning and losing ground, as their spirits, abilities, aids, and opportunities were, till at the last the <hi>Pope</hi> settled himself upon the grounds laid by <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. in the great power which he now uses in and over these parts of the Christian world.</q>
To all this you return a short Answer, in these words; <hi>We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but that in Temporal power and Authority the Popes grew great by the Patronage of Christian Emperours. But what is this to the purpose?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 200.</note> 
                  <hi>If he would have said any thing material, he should have proved that the Popes rose by the Emperours means to their Spiritual Authority and Jurisdiction over all other Bishops throughout the whole Catholick Church; which is the only thing they claim</hi> jure divino, <hi>and which is so annexed to the dignity of their office by Christ's institution, that, were the Pope deprived of all his Temporalties, yet could not his Spiritual Authority suffer the least diminution by it.</hi> But 1. Doth his Lordships discourse only contain an account of the <hi>Popes temporal great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the Patronage of Christian Emperours?</hi> Doth he not plainly shew, How the <hi>Popes</hi> got their power by <hi>rebelling,</hi> and <hi>contesting</hi> with the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> themselves, How they assumed to themselves a power to depose <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi>: and, Do they claim these things <hi>jure Divino</hi> too? 2. What you say of the <hi>Popes Spiritual Authority,</hi> will then hold good when it is well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but bare asserting it, will never do it. We must therefore have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience till you have leisure to attempt it.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time we must consider, How you vindicate the <hi>famous place</hi> of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> concerning, as you say,<note place="margin">¬ß. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>the Pope's Supreme Pastoral Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> from his Lordships interpretation. Yet, before we come to the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> it self, there are <hi>some light skirmishes</hi> (as you call them) to be passed through; and those are, concerning <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himself. For his Lordship saith, <hi>That his Adversarie is much scanted of ancient proof, if</hi> Irenaeus <hi>stand alone; besides,</hi> Irenaeus <hi>was a Bishop of the Gallican Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 181. n. 13.</note>

                  </gap>) <hi>they countermanded him, that he might mind the things of peace and unity and brotherly love.</hi> And will you still render that word too, by <hi>exhorting him after a handsome manner,</hi> when even <hi>Christopherson</hi> renders it by <hi>magnoper√® adhortabantur, Valesius</hi> by <hi>ex ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verso hortati sunt:</hi> and although these seem not to come up to the full <hi>empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> of the word, yet surely they imply somewhat of <hi>vehemency</hi> and <hi>earnestness</hi> in their perswading him as well as their being hugely dissatisfied with what <hi>Victor</hi> did. I grant <hi>that these persons did reflect</hi> (as you say) <hi>on the Pope,</hi> but not as you would have it <hi>on his dignity,</hi> but <hi>on his rashness and indiscretion,</hi> that should go about to cast the <hi>Asian Churches</hi> out of Communion, for such a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle as that was in Controversie between them.

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:101069:229"/>
of the</hi> Gallican <hi>Bishops, writes to</hi> Victor, <hi>not to proceed so rashly in this action thence you infer, that the Pope had of right some Authority over the</hi> Asian <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and by consequence over the whole Church.</hi> Might you not every jot as well inferr, that when a man in passion is ready: to kill those that stand about him; whoever perswades him not to do it, doth suppose he might lawfully have done it, if he would. But if those Bishops had so venerable an esteem (as you would perswade us they had) then of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> How come they to dispute his actions in so high a manner as they did? If they had looked on him as <hi>Vniversal Pastor of the Church,</hi> it had more become them to sit still and be quiet, then severely to reprehend him who was alone able to judge what was fit to be done and what not in those cases. If the <hi>Pope</hi> had call'd them to <hi>Council</hi> to have known their advise, it might have been their duty to have given it him in the most humble and submissive manner that might be. But for them to intrude themselves into such an <hi>office</hi> as to advise the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> what to do in a matter peculiarly concerning him, as though he did not know what was fit to be done himself; methinks you should not imagine that these men did act <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>became them,</hi> in doing it. Could they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly in any thing more declare, how little they thought it necessary for all <hi>Churches</hi> to conform to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they plead for dissenters in such a matter which the <hi>Pope</hi> had absolutely declared himself about? And how durst any of them slight the <hi>thunderbolts</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with? Yet not only <hi>Polycrates</hi> and the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops who joyned with him profess themselves not at all affrighted at them; but the other <hi>Churches</hi> looked not on themselves as obliged to forsake their communion on that account. If this be such an evidence of the <hi>Popes power</hi> in one <hi>sense,</hi> I am sure it is a greater evidence of his <hi>weakness</hi> in another: It seems the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> began betimes to be troubled with the <hi>fumes</hi> of <hi>passion</hi>; and it is a little unhappy, that the first <hi>Instance</hi> of his <hi>Authority</hi> should meet with so little regard in the Christian world. If the <hi>Pope</hi> did begin to assume so early, you see it was not very well liked of by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of other <hi>Churches.</hi> But it seems he had a mind to try his <hi>power</hi> and the weight of his Arm; but for all his haste, he was fain to withdraw it very patiently again. <hi>Valesius</hi> thinks that he never went so far as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops at all,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vales. not. in Euseb. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 24,</note> but the noise of his threatning to do it being heard by them, (it seems the very preparing of his <hi>thunderbolts</hi> amazed the world) <hi>Irenaeus</hi> having call'd a <hi>Synod</hi> of the Bishops of <hi>Gaul</hi> together, doth in their name write that <hi>Letter,</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> to <hi>Victor</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him from it, and that it wrought so effectually with him, that he gave it over. And this he endeavours to prove. 1. Because <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, he only endeavour'd to do it. But <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> supposeth <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> had a worse meaning then so in it; <hi>i. e.</hi> that <hi>though the Pope did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare them excommunicate, yet it took no effect because other Bishops continued still in communion with them</hi>; and therefore he calls <hi>Eusebius</hi> an <hi>Arrian</hi> and an enemy to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> when yet all the records of this story are derived from him. 2. Because the Epistles of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tend to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him not to cut them off; whereas, if they had been excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, it would have been rather to have restored them to Communion; and that <hi>Photius,</hi> saith that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writ many letters to <hi>Victor</hi> to prevent their excommunication.

am to seek for such an Argument of the acknowledgement of the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority then, as you would draw from it. <hi>Yes,</hi> say you, <hi>because they do not tell him, He had no Authority to do what he did; which they would have done if they could without proclaiming themselves Schismaticks</hi> ipso facto <hi>and shaking the very Foundation of the Churches Discipline and Vnity.</hi> But all this proceeds from want of understanding the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> at that time; for excommunication did not imply any such <hi>authoritative act</hi> of throwing men out of the Communion of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> but only a declaring that they would not admit such persons to communion with themselves.

For it is apparent by the practise of the <hi>Church</hi> that excommunication argued no such <hi>superiority</hi> in the persons who did it; but all the force of it lay in the sense of the <hi>Church</hi>; for by whomsoever the sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, if all other <hi>Churches</hi> observed it, (as most commonly they did while the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> continued) then they were out of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; if not, then it was only the particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of those persons or <hi>Churches</hi> who did it.

                  <hi>by reason of her more powerful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality. This is S.</hi> Irenaeus <hi>his proposition. But there could be no necessity they all should have recourse to that Church, by reason of her more powerful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, if her said power extended not to them all. This is evident to reason.</hi>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:101069:231"/>
Ergo, <hi>this more powerful principality of the Roman Church, must needs extend to all the faithful every where, and not only to those of the Suburbicary Churches, or Patriarchal Diocese of</hi> Rome, <hi>as the Bishop pleads.</hi> Now I see, you are a man at arms, and know, not only how to <hi>grapple</hi> with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but with <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to boot. But we must first see, How <hi>Irenaeus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self argues, that we may the better understand the force of what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from him. The Question, as I have told you already, was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Apostles</hi> left any such Tradition in the <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians</hi> pretended: <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proves they did not, because, if there had been any such, the Apostolical Churches would certainly have preserved the memory of it; but because it would be too tedious to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on the succession of all <hi>Churches</hi>; he therefore makes choice of the most famous, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which the <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by a succession of <hi>Bishops</hi> down to his own time; <hi>and by this</hi> (saith he) <hi>we confound all those who through vain glory, or blindness, do gather any such thing. For</hi> (saith he) <hi>to this Church for the more powerful principality all Churches do make resort,</hi> i. e. <hi>the believers from all parts, in which by those who come from all parts the Apostolical Tradition is alwaies preserved.</hi> We must now see, How <hi>Irenaeus</hi> argues according to your sense of his words. If all the faithful every where, must of necessity have recourse to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>her more powerful principality</hi>; then there is no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Tradition left by the <hi>Apostles.</hi> But, Where lyes the connexion between these two? What had the <hi>Valentinians</hi> to do with the power of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> over other <hi>Churches?</hi> That was not the business they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; their Question was, Whether there were no such <hi>Tradition</hi> as they pretended? And <hi>Rome</hi> might have never so great power over all <hi>Churches,</hi> and yet have this secret <hi>Tradition</hi> too. For now we see, when she pretends to the greatest power, nay, to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> she pretends the highest to <hi>Traditions.</hi> Where then lyes the force of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Was it in this, that the <hi>Valentinians</hi> did acknowledge the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> then, in Traditions? This were indeed to the purpose, if it could be proved; Or, Doth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> go about to prove this first? But by what argument doth he prove it so, that the <hi>Valentinians</hi> might be convinced by it? <hi>Yes,</hi> say you, <hi>he saith, That all the faithful must of necessity have recourse to the Church of</hi> Rome? This is your way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving indeed, to take things for granted; but, How doth this <hi>necessity</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? because, say you, <hi>she hath the more powerful principality:</hi> But, What <hi>principality</hi> do you mean? over all <hi>Churches?</hi> But that was the thing in <hi>Question.</hi> So that if you will make <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speak sense, and argue perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, his meaning can be no other than this. If there be such a <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> left, it must be left somewhere among <hi>Christians</hi>: if it be left among them, it may be known by enquiry, Whether they own any such or no. But because it would be troublesome searching of all <hi>Churches,</hi> we may know their judgement more compendiously; there is the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> near us, a famous and ancient <hi>Church,</hi> seated in the chief <hi>City</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to which all persons have <hi>necessities</hi> to go; and among them, you cannot but suppose, but that out of every <hi>Church</hi> some faithful persons should come, and therefore it is very unreasonable to think, that the <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> hath not alwaies been preserved there, when persons come from all places thither. Is not every thing in this account of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his words very clear and pertinent to his present dispute? But in the sense you give of them, they are little to the purpose, and very precarious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consequent.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:101069:232"/>
And therefore since <hi>the more powerful principality</hi> is not that of the <hi>Church,</hi> but of the <hi>City</hi>; since the necessity of <hi>recourse</hi> thither, is not <hi>for doubts of Faith,</hi> but other occasions: therefore it by no means follows thence, <hi>That this Churches power did extend over the faithful every where</hi>; thus by explaining your Proposition, your Conclusion is ashamed of it self, and runs away. For your argument comes to this; If English men from all parts be forced to resort to <hi>London,</hi> then <hi>London</hi> hath the power over all <hi>England</hi>; or if one should say, If some from all <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>England</hi> must resort to <hi>London,</hi> then the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>London</hi> hath power over all the <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; and if this consequence be good, yours is; for it is of the same nature of it; the necessity of the <hi>resort,</hi> not lying in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but in the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the City, the words in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in the Greek, being <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>From whence we proceed to the Vindication of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> in his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the 6. <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 14.</note> The occasion of which is this. His Lordship saith, <hi>Supposing that the powerful principality be ascribed to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>yet it follows not that it should have power over all Churches; for this power was confined within its own Patriarchate and Jurisdiction;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 183.</note> 
                  <hi>and that</hi> (saith he) <hi>was very large, containing all the Provinces in the Diocese of</hi> Italy <hi>(in the old sense of the word Diocese) which Provinces the Lawyers and others term Suburbicaries. There were ten of them; the three Islands,</hi> Sicily, Corsica, <hi>and</hi> Sardinia, <hi>and the other seven upon the firm Land of</hi> Italy. <hi>And this, I take it, is plain in</hi> Ruffinus. <hi>For he living shortly after the Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as he did, and being of</hi> Italy, <hi>as he was, he might very well know the bounds of the Patriarchs Jurisdiction, as it was then practised.

                  <hi>and gives S.</hi> Irenaeus <hi>the lye</hi>; but if the former be no truer than the latter, it may be very much to his advantage, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what you have produced to the contrary. What the ground is, Why the <hi>Roman Patriarchate</hi> was confined within the <hi>Roman Diocese,</hi> I have already shewed in the precedent Chapter, in explication of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Canon.</hi> We must now therefore examine the Reasons you bring, Why the notion of <hi>Suburbicary Churches</hi> must be extended beyond the limits his Lordship assigns; that <hi>of the smalness of Jurisdiction compared with other Patriarchs,</hi> I have given an account of already, <hi>viz.</hi> from the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency of the Ecclesiastical and Civil Government; for the Civil <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses</hi> of the <hi>Eastern</hi> part of the <hi>Empire</hi> did extend much farther than the <hi>Western</hi> did; and that was the Reason, Why the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> had a larger <hi>Metropolitical</hi> Jurisdiction than the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had. But you tell us, <hi>That Suburbicary Churches must be taken as generally sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying all Churches and Cities any waies subordinate to the City of</hi> Rome; <hi>which was at that time known by the name of</hi> Urbs, <hi>or City, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:101069:232"/>
not as it related to the Praefect or Governour of</hi> Rome, <hi>in regard of whose ordinary Jurisdiction, we confess it commanded only those few places about it in</hi> Italy; <hi>but as it related to the Emperour himself; in which sense the word Suburbicary, rightly signifies all Cities or Churches whatsoever within the Roman Empire; as the word</hi> Romania <hi>also anciently signified the whole Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Territory, as Card.</hi> Perron <hi>clearly proves upon this subject.</hi> But, this is one instance of what mens wits will do, when they are resolved to break through any thing: For, whoever that had read of the <hi>Suburbicary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and Provinces</hi> in the <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> or other parts of the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> as distinguished from other <hi>Provinces</hi> under the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi>

Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos. l. 11. tit. 1. c 9. tit. 16. c. 12. tit. 28.12</note> and those in <hi>Italy</hi> too, could ever have imagined that the notion of <hi>Suburbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary Churches</hi> had been any other than what was correspondent to those <hi>Regions</hi> and <hi>Provinces.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Adventor. p. 2. de Eccles. sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbic. c. 1.</note> But let that be granted which <hi>Sirmondus</hi> so much contends for, That the notion of <hi>Suburbicary</hi> may have different respects, and so sometimes be taken for the <hi>Churches</hi> within the <hi>Roman Diocese,</hi> sometimes for those within the <hi>Roman Patriarchate,</hi> and sometimes for those, which are under the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Vniversal Pastor</hi>; yet, How doth it appear that ever <hi>Ruffinus</hi> took it in any other than the first sense? No other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> being called <hi>Suburbicary,</hi> but such as were under the Jurisdiction either of the <hi>Roman Prefect</hi> within <hi>a hundred miles</hi> of the City (within which compass, references and appeals were made to him) or at the most, to the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>Roman Diocese,</hi> whose Jurisdiction extended to those <hi>ten Provinces</hi> which his Lordship mentions. It is not therefore, In what sense words may be taken, but in what sense they were taken, and what Evidence there is that ever they were so understood. Never was any Controversie more ridiculous, than that concerning the extent of the <hi>Suburbicary Regions or Provinces,</hi> if <hi>Suburbicary</hi> were taken in your sense for all the <hi>Cities</hi> within <hi>the Roman Empire.</hi> But this extending of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbicary Churches,</hi> as far as the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> is like the art of those <hi>Jesuits,</hi> who in their setting forth <hi>Anastasius de vitis Pontificum,</hi> in <hi>Stephanus</hi> 5. turn'd <hi>Papa Vrbis</hi> into <hi>Papa Orbis:</hi> for that being so mean and contemptible a title, they thought much it should remain as it did; but <hi>Papa Orbis</hi> was magnificent and glorious. I wonder therefore, that instead of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the signification of <hi>Suburbicary Churches,</hi> you do not rather pretend that it ought to be read <hi>Suborbicary,</hi> and so to suit exactly with the <hi>Papa Orbis,</hi> as importing all those <hi>Churches</hi> which are under the power of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Pastor.</hi> For, Why should you stop at the confines of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi>; How comes his Jurisdiction to be confined within that? By what right did he govern the <hi>Churches</hi> within the <hi>Empire,</hi> and not those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? Surely not, as <hi>Primate, Metropolitan,</hi> or <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> for those are titles yet unheard of in <hi>Antiquity</hi>; if as <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> How comes the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of that to be at all limited? Were there no <hi>Churches</hi> without the <hi>Empire</hi> then? I hope you will not deny that: If there were, To whom did the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> over them belong? to the <hi>Pope,</hi> or not?

                  <hi>Suburbicary Churches</hi> within the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> without confining the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> of the <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> within those <hi>bounds</hi> too. For if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the notion of <hi>Surburbicary Churches</hi> depends upon the extent of his power, the fixing the <hi>limits</hi> of those <hi>Churches,</hi> determines the bounds of his power too. Which is utterly destructive to your pretences of the <hi>Pope's being Head of the Vniversal Church,</hi> and not barely of the <hi>Churches</hi> within the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> But if it had been <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his design to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press by <hi>Suburbicary Churches,</hi> all those within the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> surely he made choice of the most unhappy expression to do it by, which he could well have thought of. For, it being then so well known what the <hi>Subur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicary Provinces</hi> were, that in the <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> where they are so often mentioned, they are not distinctly enumerated, because they were then as well understood as the <hi>African, Gallican,</hi> or <hi>Britannick Provinces</hi>; How absurd were it for him, to take a word in common use, and so well known, and apply it to such a sense, as no example besides can be produced for it. For if any one at that time should have spoken of the <hi>African, Gallican,</hi> or <hi>Britannick Churches,</hi> no one would have imagined any other than those which were contained in the several <hi>Provinces</hi> under those names. What reason is there then, that any thing else should be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by <hi>the Suburbicary Churches?</hi> I know the last refuge of most of your side, instead of explaining these <hi>Suburbicary Churches,</hi> hath been to rail at <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and call him <hi>Dunce</hi> and <hi>Blockhead,</hi> and enemy to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> (instances were easie to be given, if it were at all necessary) but besides that, it were easie to make it appear, that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was no such fool, as some have taken him for: (And if they think so, because S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> gives him such hard words, they must think so of all whom S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> opposed) he is sufficiently vindicated in this translation by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Vatican Copy</hi> of the <hi>Nicene Canons,</hi> out of which this very <hi>Canon</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Sirmondus,</hi> and the very same word of <hi>Suburbicary</hi> therein used.

the Confession of S.</hi> Peter, <hi>and the solid Faith contained therein. And that</hi> Epiphanius <hi>could not mean that S.</hi> Peter <hi>was any Rock or Foundation of the Church, so as that he and his successors must be relyed on in all matters of Faith, and govern the Church like Princes and Monarchs,</hi> he proves <hi>not only by the Context, but because he makes S.</hi> James <hi>to succeed our Lord in the principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church. And</hi> Epiphanius, saith he, <hi>was too full of learning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, to speak contrary to himself in a point of this moment.</hi> This is the summ of his Lordships discourse: to which you answer, <hi>That it is clear even by the Texts of</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>that this promise by Christ to S.</hi> Peter, <hi>is derived to his successors</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 204. n. 9.</note> which you prove <hi>from hence, because he saith, That by the Gates of Hell, Heresies and Hereticks are understood; now this, say you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of S.</hi> Peter<hi>'s person alone; for then, Why not Heresies and Hereticks prevail against the Church after S.</hi> Peter<hi>'s death; yea so far as ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to extinguish the true Faith?</hi> But, Cannot <hi>God</hi> preserve the <hi>Church</hi> from being extinguished by <hi>Heresies,</hi> though S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath no <hi>Infallible Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor?</hi> Is not the promise, That the <hi>Gates of Hell shall not prevail against the Church?</hi> It doth not say, That the <hi>Gates of Hell</hi> shall not prevail against any that shall pretend to be his <hi>Successors at Rome:</hi> For if <hi>Heresies</hi> be those <hi>Gates,</hi> they have too often prevailed against him. And, Is this your way indeed to secure the <hi>Church,</hi> by providing S. <hi>Peter</hi> such successors, which may be <hi>Hereticks</hi> themselves? But much more wisely did S. <hi>Gregory</hi> say, If one pretends to be <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> then upon his falling, the <hi>Church</hi> must fall too; much more wisely the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> in their Synodal Epistle, object this as the necessary consequent of the Doctrine of the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> that, <hi>errante Pontifice, quod saepe contigit &amp; contingere potest, tota erraret Ecclesia</hi>; that, in case the <hi>Pope erre,</hi> which often hath happened, and often may, the whole <hi>Church</hi> must erre too. And yet this is your way to secure the <hi>Church</hi> from errours and heresies. If you designed to ruine it, you could not do it in a more compendious way, than to oblige the whole <hi>Church</hi> to believe the dictates of one, who is so far from that <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> which S. <hi>Peter</hi> had, that he follows him in nothing more than his <hi>Falls:</hi> I wish he would in his <hi>Repentance</hi> too, and that would be the best way to secure the <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Heresies.</hi> Which she can never be secured from, as long as one pretends to be her <hi>Head,</hi> who may not only erre himself, but propound that to be believed <hi>infallibly,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously false.

And, that a <hi>principality</hi> over the whole <hi>Church</hi> is intended by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> seems more clear by that other place which his Lordship cites, wherein he not only saith, <hi>That</hi> James <hi>was first made Bishop,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Haeres. 29. p. 119.</note> but gives this reason for it, <hi>because he was the Brother of our Lord</hi>; and if you observe, How <hi>Epiphanius</hi> brings it in, you will say, he intended more by it, than to make him the <hi>first Bishop.</hi> For he was disputing before, How the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> did both belong to Christ, and that Christ had transfused both into his <hi>Church, <gap reason="foreign">

For, if you suppose the <hi>Church</hi> cannot be governed, or <hi>Schism</hi> prevented without this, you may well save your self a labour of proving any further. But, so far are we from seeing such a <hi>Supremacy of power</hi> as you challenge to the <hi>Pope</hi> to be necessary for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting <hi>Schisms,</hi> that we are sufficiently convinced that the <hi>Vsurping</hi> of it
hath caused one of the <hi>greatest</hi> ever was in the <hi>Christian world.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VII. The Popes Authority, not proved from Scripture, or Reason.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The insufficiency of the proofs from Scripture acknowledged by Romanists themselves. The impertinency of <hi>Luk. 22.32.</hi> to that purpose. No proofs offered for it but the suspected testimonies of Popes in their own cause. That no Infallibility can thence come to the Pope as St. <hi>Peters</hi> successour, confessed and proved by <hi>Vigorius,</hi> and Mr. <hi>White.</hi> The weakness of the evasion of the Popes erring as a private Doctor, but not as Pope, acknowledged by them. <hi>John 21.15.</hi> proves nothing towards the Popes Supremacy. How far the Popes Authority is owned by the Romanists over Kings. <hi>T. C's.</hi> beggings of the Question, and tedious repetitions, past over. The Argument from the necessity of a living Judge, considered. The Government of the Church not Monarchical, but Aristocratical. The inconveniencies of Monarchical Government in the Church manifested from reason. No evidence that Christ intended to institute such Government in his Church, but much against it. The Communicatory letters in the primitive Church argued an Aristocracy. <hi>Gersons</hi> Testimony from his Book <hi>de Auferibilitate Papae,</hi> explained and vindicated. St. <hi>Hieromes</hi> Testimony full against a Monarchy in the Church. The inconsistency of the Popes Monarchy with that of Temporal Princes. The Supremacy of Princes in Ecclesiastical matters, asserted by the Scripture and Antiquity, as well as the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE are now come to the places of <hi>Scripture</hi> insisted on for the proof of the <hi>Popes</hi> Authority;<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> which you have been so often and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully beaten out of, by so many powerful assaults of our Writers, that it is matter of admiration that you should yet think to find any shelter there. For those which you yet account <hi>Fortresses</hi> and <hi>Bulwarks</hi> for your cause, have not only been triumphed over by your Adversaries, but have been <hi>slighted</hi> by the wisest of your party, and deserted as most untenable places. As I shall make it appear to you in the progress of this dispute: In which I shall not barely shew the palpable weakness of your pretended proofs, but bring unanswerable arguments against them from persons of your own Communion. For the force of that reason by which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> have prevailed over you in this dispute hath been so great, that it hath brought over some of the learnedst of your party, not only to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the insufficiency of these proofs, but to a zealous oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition against that very Doctrine which you attempt to prove by them. But such is the fate of a sinking cause, that it catcheth hold of any thing to save it self, though it be the <hi>Anchor</hi> of the ship which makes it sink the sooner. Thus it will appear to be in these <hi>baffled</hi> Proofs, which you only bring into the Field to shew what streights you are in for help; and no sooner appear there, but they fall off to the conquering side, and help only to promote your ruine. But since they are in the place where Arguments should be, we must in civility consider them, as if they were so. The first place then is, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>I have pray'd for thee that thy faith fail not.</hi> What would a <hi>Philosopher</hi> think, were he chosen as <hi>Vmpire</hi> between us, (as once one was between <hi>Origen</hi> and his Adversaries) to hear this place produced to prove the <hi>Popes Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility?</hi> And when a reason is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of so strange an Inference (from a promise of <hi>recovery</hi> to St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:101069:236"/>
to an <hi>impossibility</hi> of <hi>falling</hi> in the <hi>Pope</hi>) nothing else produced, but the forged <hi>Epistles</hi> of some <hi>Popes,</hi> and the partial Testimonies of others in their own cause? Could he think otherwise, but that these men loved their cause dearly, and would fain prove it, if they could tell how: but since there was neither evidence in reason or more indifferent writers in it, yet to let them see how confident they were of the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> they would produce their <hi>Infallible</hi> Testimonies, to prove they were <hi>Infallible.</hi> For we ask, What evidence is there that the priviledge obtained for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whatever it is, must descend to his <hi>Successours</hi>; if to his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, whether to <hi>all</hi> his Successours, or only to some; if only to <hi>some,</hi> why to those at <hi>Rome</hi> more then at <hi>Antioch</hi> or any other place; if to them at <hi>Rome,</hi> why it must be understood of a <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and not a <hi>saving Faith,</hi> as it was in St. <hi>Peter</hi>; if of <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> why not <hi>absolutely,</hi> but only <hi>conditionally,</hi> if they teach the Church? For all these and several other enquiries of this nature, we are told, It must be so understood; but if you ask Why, all the Answer we can get is, <hi>Because seven Popes at one time or other said so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at this you grow very angry; and tell us, 1. <hi>That</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these,</hi>

                  <hi>gives several pregnant reasons from the Text it self.</hi> What were it worth, to have a sight of them? If you had thought them so pregnant you are not so sparing of taking out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but you would have given them us over again. <hi>Bellarmins</hi> excellent proofs are two or three <hi>sine Dubio's.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bell de Pontif. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Sine dubio,</hi> saith he, <hi>hic Dominus speciale aliquid Petro impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travit.</hi> And who denies it? but we grant, it was so special to him that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to his Successours; and again, <hi>Sine dubio, ipsis praecipu√® debeat esse nota suae sedis auctoritas,</hi> speaking of the <hi>Popes Testimonies</hi> for themselves, Without all doubt they knew best their own Authority. They were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully to blame else; but all the difficulty is, to perswade others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them <hi>sine dubio,</hi> when they speak in their own Cause. And for that I can find no pregnant reason in him at all. Well, but we have a third <hi>sine dubio</hi> yet, which may be more to the purpose than either of the other two. For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> distinguishes of two priviledges which Christ obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the first is, <hi>That himself should never lose the true Faith though he were tempted of the Devil</hi>; and this his Lordship grants, that it was the special grace which Christs prayer obtained, that, notwithstanding Satans sifting him, and his threefold denyal of his Master, he should not fall into a final Apostacy: The second priviledge is, <hi>That he, as Bishop, should not be able to teach any thing against the Faith,</hi> sive, ut in sede ejus nunquam inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niretur qui doceret contra veram fidem, <hi>or, that there should be none found in his See who should do it.</hi> Is not here an excellent conjunction disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in this <hi>Sive,</hi> Or? that he should not do it <hi>himself, or,</hi> that his <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours</hi> should not do it? Doth not this want pregnant proofs? and we have them in the next words. <hi>The first of these, it may be</hi> (very modestly!) <hi>did not descend to his Successours; but</hi> secundum, sine Dubio, manavit ad posteros sive successores; <hi>the second, without all doubt, did descend to his Successours.</hi> Are not these pregnant reasons; <hi>three sine dubio's</hi> given us by <hi>Cardinal Bellarmin?</hi> For when he comes to confirm this last <hi>sine dubio,</hi> he produces nothing but those Testimonies, which his Lordship excepts against, as not fit to be Judges in their own Cause. If these then be <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> pregnant reasons out of the Text, no wonder that his Lordship was not pleased to Answer them. But yet you are displeased, that <hi>his Lordship should think that Popes were interessed persons in their own Cause.</hi> No, no; all
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:101069:236"/>
that ever sat in that <hi>See,</hi> were such holy, meek, humble, self-denying men, that they would not for a world, let a word fall to exalt their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the <hi>Church.</hi> And we are mightily to blame to think otherwise of them. Is it possible to think that <hi>Felix</hi> 1, and <hi>Lucius</hi> 1, should speak for their own interest; though the <hi>Epistles</hi> under their names be such notorious counterfeits, that all sober men among you are ashamed of them? Is it possible that <hi>Leo</hi> 1. should do it, who was so humble a man that he contended with 630. <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Council of Chalcedon</hi> about the <hi>Primacy</hi> of his <hi>See</hi>; and whose <hi>Epistles</hi> breathe so much of <hi>self-denyal</hi> in all the contests he had about it? And although <hi>Pope Agatho</hi> and the rest be of later standing, when the <hi>Popes</hi> did begin a little more openly to take upon them; yet, Can the <hi>Protestants</hi> think that these men were <hi>byassed</hi> with their proper <hi>Interest? Are not these weak pretences for them to reject their Authority upon? For your part</hi> (you say), <hi>you could never understand this proceeding of Protestants.</hi> The more a great deal is the pitty; and if we could help your understanding and not endanger our own, we would willingly do it. Well, but though <hi>Bellarmins</hi> pregnant reasons prove so abortive, and though the <hi>Popes</hi> Authorities should not be taken, yet his Lordship must needs wrong <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> in saying, <hi>That he doth upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confess, that there is not one Father in the Church disinteressed in the Cause, who understands this Text as</hi> Bellarmin <hi>doth, before</hi> Theophylact. And the reason is, <hi>because, though</hi> Bellarmin <hi>cite no more,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 209,</note> 
                  <hi>yet there might be more for all that: for, must he needs confcss, there are no more Authours citable in any subject, but what he cites himself?</hi> As though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> were wont to leave out any authorities which made for his purpose, especially in so weighty a subject as this? Do you think he was so weak a person to run to <hi>Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,</hi> if he could have found any other? and when he produces no more, is it not a plain confession he found no more to his purpose? But I am weary of such great Impertinencies: and would fain meet with some thing of matter that might hold up the Readers patience as well as mine. All that ever I can meet with, that hath any thing of tendency that way, is, <hi>That this priviledge of the Indeficiency of St.</hi> Peters <hi>Faith doth not belong to him as an Apostle, but rather as he was Prince of the Apostles, and appointed to be Christs Vicar on earth after him.</hi> Very handsomely begg'd again! but where is the proof for all this? Have you no <hi>Popes</hi> stand ready again to attest the truth of it? For none else that have any reason would ever say it? did St. <hi>Peter</hi> deny Christ as <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Apostles?</hi> Indeed it was then much for his honour that the <hi>Captain</hi> should fly from his colours first? and <hi>Christs Vicar upon earth</hi> should the most need to have his <hi>Faith</hi> pray'd for, that it should not fail? I had thought St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been head of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and not <hi>Simon:</hi> if Christ had spoke to him as his <hi>Vicar,</hi> he would sure have call'd him <hi>Peter, Peter,</hi> and not <hi>Simon, Simon.</hi> But it seems he did not attend, that <hi>Peter was the Rock, on which his Church must be built:</hi> or else he minded it so much, that he thought that name impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per when he mentions his falling; You have therefore stoutly and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably (not proved, but) demonstrated that these words were spoken of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> not as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> but as <hi>Christs Vicar upon earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But suppose it were so; what is this to those who pretend to be his Successours? <hi>Yes very much. For</hi> (say you),<note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatever our Saviour intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed should descend by vertue of that prayer of his, did effectively so descend.</hi> You might have put one of <hi>Bellarmins sine dubio's</hi> to this. For, Whoever was so sensless as to question that? But you confess, <hi>It is a very disputable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:101069:237"/>
Whether every thing which Christ by his prayer intended and obtained for St.</hi> Peter, <hi>was likewise intended by him to descend to St.</hi> Peters <hi>Successours. Yet that some special priviledge was to descend to them, is, you say, manifest by</hi> Bellarmins <hi>Authorities and Reasons.</hi> If from nothing else, I dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently say, no man in his wits will believe it manifest. And what that is, neither you, nor any one else can either prove or understand. <hi>Yes</hi> (say you) <hi>it is, that none of his Successours should ever so farr fall from the Faith, as to teach Heresie,</hi> in Pontificalibus, or, as you speak with <hi>Bellarmine, any thing contrary to Faith</hi> tanquam Pontifex; <hi>i. e. in vertue of that Authority which they were to have in the Church as St.</hi> Peters <hi>Successours.</hi> Here then we fix a while to see this proved; but our expectation is again frustrated: For instead of proofs we meet with the old <hi>Mumpsimus,</hi> of the <hi>Popes erring as private Doctor, but not as Pastour of the Church:</hi> A distinction so ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that many among your selves deride it, as will appear presently. And therefore put in your <hi>tanquam Pontifex</hi> as long as you please,<note place="margin">P. 210.</note> you will gain no great matter by it. When you can prove that Christ did intend in that one prayer, some part of the Gift <hi>personally</hi> and <hi>absolutely</hi> to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and another part <hi>conditionally to his Successours,</hi> I will grant it no absurdity to say, that <hi>perhaps some part of the Gift did not belong to either of them.</hi> But these are such strange fetches out of a plain <hi>Scripture,</hi> that those may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire your subtilty, who cannot be convinced by your reason. Yet to let you see that these things are not so clear as you would have them, I shall bring you some Arguments out of your own Writers against your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this place, and I pray Answer them at your leasure. <hi>Vigorius</hi> therefore proves that this place cannot be understood of St. <hi>Peter and his Successours,</hi>

If this were understood of St. <hi>Peters Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, they who succeeded him at</hi> Antioch <hi>would enjoy this priviledge as well as those at</hi> Rome; for they are, saith he, as well St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successours as the other. And, saith he, if they understand this of one and not of the other <hi>totis faucibus se deridendos propinarent,</hi> they expose themselves to contempt and laughter. 3.

be expected in St.</hi> Peters <hi>Successours, which fell out in St.</hi> Peter <hi>himself,</hi> viz. <hi>that either through fear, or some other motive they may be drawn into the shew of Heresie, or into Heresie it self; but so, as either in themselves or their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, they should be restored to the Catholick Faith.</hi> But what reason there is for this latter interpretation (though destructive to the Popes infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) neither doth that person acquaint us, nor can I possibly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. All the evasion that you have to avoid the force of what ever is brought against you out of this place, is by conjuring up that rare distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Popes not erring when he defines any thing as matter of Faith.</hi> But see what that same person saith of this distinction of yours, <hi>Excipiunt aliqui,</hi> saith he, <hi>Papam posse esse haereticum, sed non posse haeresim promulgare.</hi>

But such as have seen so much of the weakness and absurdity of your common doctrine, that they openly and confidently oppose it, and that upon the same grounds that <hi>Protestants</hi> had done it before them. And I hope, this is much more to our purpose to shew the insufficiency of these proofs, than it was for you to produce the Testimonies of several <hi>Popes</hi> in their own Cause.

               <p>But yet there is another place as pertinent as the former; the celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pasce oves &amp; agnos,</hi> John 21.15, 16, 17. <hi>But sheep and Lambs,</hi> say you,<note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note>

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note>Well, but his Lordship objects a shrewd Consequence from this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Pastourship; <hi>that this brings the necks of Princes under the Roman Pride.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 191.</note> 
                  <hi>And if Kings be meant,</hi> (his Lordship saith) <hi>yet the command is,</hi> pasce, <hi>feed them; but</hi> deponere, <hi>or</hi> occidere, <hi>to depose or kill them, is not</hi> pascere <hi>in any sense</hi>; Lanii id est, non Pastoris, <hi>that's the Butchers, not the Shepheards part. This,</hi> you call, <hi>his Lordships winding about, and falling upon that odious Question of killing and deposing Kings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> An odious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion indeed, whether we consider the grounds, or the effects and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it. But yet you would seem to clear your selves from the <hi>odium</hi> of it. <hi>First, By saying that it is a gross fallacy, to argue a</hi> negatione speciei ad negationem generis, <hi>which is a new kind of Logick.</hi> It is indeed, for it is of your own coyning; for his Lordship argues <hi>ab affirmatione generis ad affirmationem speciei,</hi> and I hope this is no new <hi>Logick,</hi> unless you think he that saith, He hath power over all <hi>living creatures,</hi> hath not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by power over <hi>men</hi> too. His Lordship therefore doth not argue against the <hi>Popes Vniversal Supremacy</hi> from the <hi>denyal</hi> of that, but deduces that as a <hi>consequence</hi> from your assertion, and explication of what you mean by <hi>Sheep and Lambs.</hi> But this is but a sleight Answer in comparison
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:101069:238"/>
of what follows; <hi>Secondly, we answer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 212.</note> 
                  <hi>That the point of Killing Kings, is a most false and scandalous Imputation</hi>; scandalous enough indeed, if false: and though your <hi>Popes</hi> have not given express warrant for the doing it, yet it is sufficiently known, How the <hi>Pope</hi> in Consistory could not contain his joy when it was done, in the case of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. of <hi>France.</hi> And it hath been sufficiently confessed and lamented by <hi>persons</hi> of your own communion, How much the Doctrine of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged those <hi>Assassinations</hi> of those two successive <hi>Henryes</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Will you, or dare you vindicate the Doctrines of <hi>Mariana,</hi> and others, which do not obscurely deliver their judgement, as to that very thing of <hi>Killing Haeretical Princes?</hi> But, if we should grant you this, That the <hi>Pope may not command to kill,</hi> What say you to that of <hi>deposing Princes</hi>; which seldome falls much short of the other? As to this, you dare not cry, It is a false and scandalous imputation, as you did to the other; but you answer, <hi>'Tis no point of your Faith, that the Pope hath power to do it; and therefore you say it is no part of your task to dispute it.</hi> Is this all the security <hi>Princes</hi> have from you, that it is no point of your Faith, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to do it? Is it not well enough known, that there are many things which are held undoubtedly by the greatest part of your <hi>Church,</hi> which yet you say, are no points of Faith? And yet in this you are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contradicted by one who knew what were points of <hi>Faith</hi> among you, as well as you, and that was <hi>Father Creswell</hi>;<note place="margin">Philopator. sect. 157. p. 149.</note> whose testimony I have cited already; and he saith expresly, <hi>Certum est, &amp; de fide,</hi> It is a thing certain, and of Faith: <hi>that the subjects of an Haeretical Prince, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed from Allegiance, but are bound,</hi> ex hominum Christianorum domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natu ejicere, <hi>to cast him out of his power,</hi> which certainly is more than the deposing of him. And <hi>Sanders</hi> plainly enough saith,<note place="margin">De visib. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. l. 2, c. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>That a King that will not submit to the Popes Authority, is by no means to be suffered, but his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ought to do their utmost endeavour that another may be placed in his room.</hi> Indeed, he saith not, as the other doth, That this is <hi>de fide,</hi> but that is the only reserve you have when a Doctrine is odious and infamous to the world, to cry out, It is not <hi>de side,</hi> when yet it may be as firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved among you, as any that you account <hi>de fide.</hi> And if you believe the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> in his <hi>Manifesto</hi> at the siege of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> when the <hi>Pope</hi> had deposed the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> to whom that City belonged, he saith,<note place="margin">Nebrissens. de bello Navarr. l. 1. c. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is not doubted but the Pope had power to depose Heretical Princes.</hi> And if you had been of another opinion, you ought to have declared your self more fully than you do. If you had said, that indeed some were of that opinion, but you abhorred and detested it, you had spoken to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; but when you use only that pitiful evasion, <hi>That it is not of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> you sufficiently shew, What your judgement is, but that you dare not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly own it. It seems, you remember what was said by your Masters in reference to <hi>Emanuel S√†, Non fuit opus ad ista descendere,</hi> There was no need to meddle with those things. It seems, if there had been, there was no hurt in the Doctrine, but only that it was unseasonable. I pray <hi>God</hi> keep us from that time, when you shall think it <hi>needful</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your selves in this point. But you conclude this with a most unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and scandalous reflection on <hi>Protestants,</hi> in these words; <hi>But what Protestants have both done and justified in the worst of these kinds, is but too fresh in memory.</hi> But, Were those the practices and principles of <hi>Protestants?</hi> Were they not abhorred and detested in the highest manner by all <hi>true Protestants,</hi> both at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroad?</hi> It will be well, if you can clear
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:101069:239"/>
some of your selves from having too much a hand in promoting both those principles and practices. I suppose you cannot but have heard, Who it was is said to have expressed so much joy at the time of that horrid execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; What counsels and machinations are said to have been among some devoted Sons of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> abroad about that time: Therefore clear your selves more than yet you have done, of those imputations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you charge that guilt on <hi>Protestants,</hi> which they express the highest abhorrence of. And let the names of such who either publickly or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately abett or justifie such horrid actions be under a continual <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> to all <hi>Generations.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note>After all this discourse about the <hi>Popes Authority, A. C.</hi> brings it at last home to the business of <hi>Schism.</hi> For, he saith, <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refuse to feed and govern the whole Flock in such sort, as that neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man nor Church shall have just cause, under pretence of Reformation in manners of Faith, to make a separation from the whole Church. This</hi> (his Lordship saith) <hi>by</hi> A. C<hi>'s favour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 191. n. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>is meer begging the Question. For this is the very thing which the Protestants charge upon him; namely, that he hath governed, if not the whole, yet so much of the Church as he hath been able to bring under his power, so as that he hath given too just cause of the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Separation. And, as the corruptions in the Doctrine of Faith, in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>were the cause of the first Separation; so are they at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent day the cause why the Separation continues. And the oppression of the Church of</hi> Rome, he further adds, <hi>is the great cause of all the errours in that part of the Church which is under the Roman Jurisdiction. And for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, they have made no separation from the General Church properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but their Separation is only from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and such other Churches as by adhering to her, have hazarded themselves, and do now mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call themselves the whole Catholick Church. Nay, even here the Protestants have not left the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in her essence, but in her errours; not in the things which constitute a Church, but only in such abuses and corruptions, as work towards the dissolution of a Church.</hi> Let now any indifferent Reader be judge, Whether his Lordship, or <hi>A. C.</hi> be the more guilty <hi>in begging the Question.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 212.</note> For all the Answer you can give, is, <hi>That his Lordship begs it, in saying that the Roman Church is not the whole Catholick Church, and that the Roman Catholick Church may be in an errour</hi>; but the former we have proved already, and I doubt not but the latter will be as evident as the other, before our task be ended. But, as though it were not possible for you to be guilty of <hi>begging the Question,</hi> after you have said that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church cannot erre,</hi> you give this as the reason for it, <hi>Because she is the unshaken Rock of Truth; and that she hath the sole continual succession of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully-sent Pastors and Teachers, who have taught the same unchanged Doctrine, and shall infallibly continue so teaching it to the worlds end.</hi> Now, Who dares call this, <hi>Begging the Question?</hi> No, it must not be called so in you, it shall be only <hi>Taking it for granted.</hi> Which we have seen, hath been your practice all along, especially when we charge your <hi>Church</hi> with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>; for then you cry out presently, What, <hi>your Church erre?</hi> No, you defie the language. What, <hi>the Spouse of Christ, the Catholick Church erre?</hi> that is impossible. What, the <hi>unshaken Rock of Truth</hi> to sink into errours? the <hi>Infallible Church</hi> be deceived? she that hath never taught any thing but Truth, be charged with falshood? she, that not only <hi>never did erre,</hi> but, it is <hi>impossible,</hi> nay, utterly <hi>impossible,</hi> nay, so <hi>impossible,</hi> that it <hi>cannot be imagined,</hi> that ever <hi>she should erre?</hi> This is the summ of all your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:101069:239"/>
which, no doubt, sound high to all such who know not what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident begging the Question means, or, out of modesty, are loath to charge you with it.</p>
               <p>Much to the same purpose do you go on, to prove, <hi>that Protestants have separated not from the errours, but the essence of your Church.</hi> And if that be true, which you say, <hi>That those things which we call Errours are essential to your Church,</hi> we are the more sorry for it; for we are sure, (and, when you please, will prove it) that they are not, cannot be, essential to a <hi>true Church</hi>; and if they be to yours, the case is so much the worse with you, when your distempers are in your vitals, and your errours essential to your <hi>Churches Constitution.</hi> What other things you have here, are the bare repetitions of what we have often had before in the <hi>Chapters</hi> you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to. And here we may thank you for some ease you give us in the far greatest remaining part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> which consists of tedious repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of such things which have been largely discussed in the <hi>First part,</hi> where they were purposely and designedly handled; as that concerning <hi>Traditions, chap.</hi> 6. that <hi>concerning necessaries to salvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>N.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>chap.</hi> 2, 3, 4. that concerning the <hi>Scriptures being an Infallible Rule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">N. 8.</note> throughout the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie of <hi>Resolution of Faith</hi>; and that which concerns <hi>the Infallibility of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils,</hi> we shall have occasion at large to handle afterwards;<note place="margin">N. 57.</note> and if there be any thing material here, which you omit there, it shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered. But I know no obligation lying upon me to answer things as often as you repeat them, especially since your gift is so good that way. It is sufficient that I know not of any material passage, which hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Answer in its proper place.</p>
               <p>That which is most pertinent to our present purpose, is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>the necessity of a Living Judge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>besides the Scriptures for ending Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Faith.</hi> As to which his Lordship saith, <hi>That, supposing there were such a one, and the Pope were he,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 198. n. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>yet that is not sufficient against the malice of the Devil, and impious men, to keep the Church at all times from renting even in the Doctrine of Faith, or to soder the Rents which are made. For,</hi> oportet esse Haereses, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19, <hi>Heresies there will be, and Heresies there properly cannot be but in the Doctrine of Faith.</hi> To this you answer, <hi>That Heresies are not within, but without the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 218.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Rents which stand in need of soder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are not found among the true members of the Church, who continue still united in the Faith, and due obedience to their Head; but in those who have deserted the true Church, and either made or adhered to Schismatical and Heretical Congregations.</hi> A most excellent Answer! His Lordship sayes, If Christ had appointed an <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> besides the <hi>Scripture,</hi> certainly it should have been for preventing <hi>Heresies,</hi> and sodering the Rents of the <hi>Church. So it is</hi> (say you) <hi>for if there be any Heresies, it is nothing to him, they are out of the Church; and if there be any Schisms, they are among those who are divided from him:</hi> That is, he is an <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> only thus far, in condemning all such for <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> who do not own him. And his only way of preventing <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms,</hi> is the making this the only tryal of them, that whatever questions his <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> is <hi>Heresie</hi>; and whatever separation be made from him, is <hi>Schism.</hi> Just as <hi>Absalom</hi> pretended that there was no <hi>Judge</hi> appointed <hi>to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine causes,</hi> and that the <hi>Laws</hi> were not sufficient without one,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.2.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would do it himself; so doth the <hi>Pope</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> he pretends that he hath not taken care sufficient for deciding Controversies in Faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a necessity in order to the Churches <hi>Vnity,</hi> he should take it
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:101069:240"/>
upon himself. But now, if we suppose in the former case of <hi>Absalom,</hi> that he had pretended he could infallibly end all the Controversies in <hi>Israel,</hi> and keep all in peace and unity; and yet abundance of Controversies to arise among them <hi>by what right and power he took that office upon him,</hi> and many of them cry out upon it, as an <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> and a disparagement to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of his <hi>Father David</hi>; and upon this, some of the wiser <hi>Israelites</hi> should have asked him, Whether this were the way to end all <hi>Controversies,</hi> and keep the Nation in peace? Would it not have been a satisfactory Answer for him to have said, Yes, no doubt it is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way; <hi>For, only they that acknowledge my power, are the Kings lawful sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and all the rest are Rebels and Traytors.</hi> And, Is not this just the same Answer which you give here? <hi>That the Pope is still appointed to keep peace and unity in the Church, because all that question his Authority, be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and Schismaticks.</hi> But, as in the former case, the surest way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent those Consequences, were to produce that power and authority which the <hi>King</hi> had given him, and that should be the first thing which should be made evident from authentick records, and the clear testimony of the gravest <hi>Senatours</hi>; so, if you could produce the <hi>Letters Pattents,</hi> whereby <hi>Christ</hi> made the <hi>Pope</hi> the great <hi>Lord Chancellour</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> to determine all <hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and shew this attested by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current voice of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> who best knew what order Christ took for the Government of his <hi>Church</hi>; this were a way to prevent such persons turning such <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> as you say they are, by not submitting themselves to the <hi>Popes Authority.</hi> But for you to pretend that the <hi>Popes Authority</hi> is necessary to the <hi>Churches Vnity,</hi> and when the <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> are objected, to say, That those are all out of the <hi>Church,</hi> is just as if a <hi>Shepherd</hi> should say, That he would keep the <hi>whole Flock</hi> of <hi>sheep</hi> within such a <hi>Fold,</hi> and when the better half are shewed him to be out of it, he should return this Answer, That those were without, and not within his Fold; and therefore they were none of the <hi>Flock</hi> that he meant. So that his meaning was, <hi>those that would abide in, he could keep in, but for those that would not, he had nothing to say to them.</hi> So it is with you, the <hi>Pope</hi> he ends Controversies, and keeps the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Vnity</hi>; How so? They who do agree, are of his <hi>Flock,</hi> and of the <hi>Church</hi>; and those that do not, are out of it. A <hi>Quaker</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist</hi> will keep the <hi>Church in Vnity</hi> after the same way, only the <hi>Pope</hi> hath the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his side; for, they will tell you, If they were hearkned to, the <hi>Church</hi> should never be in <hi>pieces</hi>; for all those who embrace their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> are of the <hi>Church,</hi> and those who do not, are <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</hi> So we see upon your principles, What an easie matter it is to be an <hi>Infallible Judge,</hi> and to end all <hi>Controversies</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi>; that only this must be taken for granted, that all who will not own such an <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judge,</hi> are out of the <hi>Church,</hi> and so the <hi>Church</hi> is at <hi>Vnity</hi> still, how many soever there are who doubt or deny the <hi>Popes Authority.</hi> Thus we easily understand what that excellent harmony is, which you cry so much up in your <hi>Church</hi>; that you most gravely say, <hi>That, had not the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from God the power he challenges, he could never have been able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that peace and unity in matters of Religion, that is found in the Roman Church:</hi> Of what nature that Unity is, we have seen already: And surely you have much cause to boast of the <hi>Popes</hi> faculty of deciding Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, ever since the late <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Pope Innocent,</hi> in the case of the <hi>five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</hi> For, How readily the <hi>Jansenists</hi> have submitted since, and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:101069:240"/>
what Unity there hath been among the dissenting parties in <hi>France,</hi> all the world can bear you witness. And, whatever you pretend, <hi>were it not for Policy and Interest,</hi> the Infallible Chair would soon fall to the ground; for it hath so little footing in <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that there had need be a watchful eye, and strong hand to keep it up.</p>
               <p>But now we are to examine the main proof which is brought for the necessity of this <hi>Living and Infallible Judge</hi>;<note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> which lyes in these words of <hi>A.C. Every earthly Kingdom, when matters cannot be composed by a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which cannot be called upon all occasions) hath, besides the Law-Books, some living Magistrates and Judges, and above all one visible King, the highest Judge, who hath Authority sufficient to end all Controversies, and settle Vnity in all Temporal Affairs. And, Shall we think that Christ, the wisest King, hath provided in his Kingdom the Church, only the Law-Books of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and no living visible Judges, and above all one chief, so assisted by his Spirit, as may suffice to end all Controversies for Vnity and Certainty of Faith? which can never be, if every man may interpret Holy Scripture, the Law-Books, as he list. This</hi> his Lordship saith,<note place="margin">P. 199. n. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>is a very plausible argument with the many; but the Foundation of it is but a similitude, and, if the similitude hold not in the main argument, is nothing.</hi> And so his Lordship at large proves that it is here. For whatever further concerns this Controversie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Popes Authority,</hi> is brought under the examination of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; which you mangle into <hi>several Chapters,</hi> thereby confounding the <hi>Reader,</hi> that he may not see the coherence or dependence of one thing upon another. But having cut off the superfluities of this <hi>Chapter</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I may with more conveniency reduce all that belongs to this matter within the compass of it. And that he may the better apprehend his Lordships scope and design. I shall first summ up his Lordships Answers together, and then more particularly go about the vindication of them. 1. Then, his Lordship at large proves that the <hi>Militant Church is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Monarchy,</hi> and therefore the foundation of the similitude is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. <hi>That supposing it a Kingdom, yet the Church Militant is spread in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny earthly Kingdoms, and cannot well be ordered like one particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> 3. <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>under one Supreme Governour, our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soveraign, hath, besides the Law-Book of the Scripture, visible Magistrates and Judges, Arch-Bishops and Bishops to govern the Church in Truth and Peace.</hi> 4. <hi>That as in particular Kingdoms there are some affairs of greatest Consequence as concerning the Statute Laws, which cannot be determined but in Parliament; so in the Church, the making such Canons which must bind all Christians, must belong to a free and lawful General Council.</hi> Thus I have laid together the substance of his Lordships Answer, that the dependence and connexion of things may be better perceived by the intelligent Reader.</p>
               <p>We come now therefore to the first Answer. As to which his Lordship saith, <hi>It is not certain that the whole Church Militant is a Kingdom;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 200.</note> 
                  <hi>for they are no mean ones which think, our Saviour Christ left the Church-Militant in the hands of the Apostles, and their Successours, in an Aristocratical, or rather a mixt Government; and that the Church is not Monarchical, otherwise than the Triumphant and Militant make one body under Christ the Head. And in this sense indeed, and in this only the Church is a most absolute Kingdom. And the very expressing of this sense, is a full Answer to all the places of Scripture, and other arguments brought by</hi> Bellarmine <hi>to prove that the Church is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. But the Church being as large as the world, Christ thought fittest to
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:101069:241"/>
govern it Aristocratically, by divers, rather than by one Vice-Roy. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> saith he, <hi>this is true. For so it was governed for the first three hundred years, and somewhat better; the Bishops of those times carrying the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of admitting any new consecrated Bishops or others to, or rejecting them from, their Communion.</hi> And this, his Lordship saith, <hi>He hath carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined for the first six hundred years even to, and within, the time of S.</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory <hi>the Great.</hi> Now to this you answer. 1. <hi>That though</hi> A. C. <hi>urgeth the argument in a similitude of a Kingdom only,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 219.</note> 
                  <hi>yet it is of force in any other kind of settled Government, as in a Common-wealth.</hi> But by this <hi>A. C.</hi> seems a great deal the wiser man, for he knew what he did when he instanced in in a <hi>Kingdom</hi>; for he foresaw that this only would tend to his purpose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi>; but though there be the same necessity of some <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> yet that would do him no good at all, for all that could be inferred thence, would be the necessity of a <hi>General Council.</hi> And by this you may see, How little your similitude will hold any other way than <hi>A.C.</hi> put it. Therefore, 2. You answer, <hi>That the Government of the Church is not a pure, but a mixt Monarchy,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Supream Government of the Church is clearly Monarchical, you confess: yet Bishops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their respective Dioceses and Jurisdictions are spiritual Princes also, that is, chief Pastors and Governours of such a part of the Church in their own right.</hi> How far this latter is consonant to your principles, I have already examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the former is that we dispute now, concerning the <hi>Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church,</hi> Whether that be <hi>Monarchical</hi> or no, and this is that which his Lordship denies; and, for all that I see, we may continue to do so too, for any argument you bring to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Although you produce your <hi>Achilles</hi> in the next paragraph, <hi>viz. that since the Government of one in chief,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 220.</note> 
                  <hi>is by all Philosophers acknowledged for the most perfect, What wonder is it that Christ our Saviour thought it fitter to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Church by one Vice-Roy, than Aristocratically, or by many, as he would have it?</hi> But, Are you sure Christ asked the <hi>Philosophers</hi> opinions, in establishing a Government in the <hi>Church?</hi> The <hi>Philosophers</hi> judged truly that of all <hi>Forms</hi> of Civil Government, <hi>Monarchy</hi> was the best, <hi>i. e.</hi> most conducing to the <hi>ends</hi> of Civil Government: for the <hi>excellency</hi> of such things must be measured by their respect to the <hi>ends.</hi> Now, if we apply this to the <hi>Church,</hi> we must not measure it by such <hi>ends,</hi> as we fancy to our selves, or such as are only the ends of meer Civil Societies; but all must be considered with a respect to the chief <hi>design</hi> of him who first instituted a <hi>Church.</hi> And from thence we must draw our Inferences, as to what may tend most to the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> of it. Now it appearing to be the great design of <hi>Christ,</hi> that mankind should be brought to eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we cannot argue from hence, as to the necessity of any manner of <hi>Government,</hi> unless one of them hath in it self a greater tendency to this than another hath. For in Civil Governments, the whole design of the <hi>Society,</hi> is the <hi>Civil Peace</hi> of it; but it is otherwise in the <hi>Church,</hi> the main end of it, is to order things with the greatest conveniency for a <hi>future life</hi>: Now this being the main end of this Society, and no manner of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> having in it self a greater tendency to this than other: It was in the power of the <hi>Legislator,</hi> to appoint what <hi>Government</hi> he pleased him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But when we consider that he intended this <hi>Church</hi> of his should be spread all over the world, and this to be his immediate errand he sent his <hi>Apostles</hi> upon, <hi>to preach to every creature,</hi> and to plant <hi>Churches</hi> in the most remote and distant places from each other; we can have the least ground
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:101069:241"/>
to fancy he should appoint an <hi>Vniversal Monarchy</hi> in his <hi>Church</hi> of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whatsoever. For if we will take that boldness you put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to enquire, What form is fittest for a <hi>Society</hi> dispersed into all <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and that are not bound, upon their being <hi>Christians,</hi> to live nearer <hi>Rome,</hi> than <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>Japan,</hi>; Could any one imagine it would be, to appoint one <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> to superintend his <hi>Church</hi> at such a place as <hi>Rome</hi> is? Suppose all the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies</hi> consisted of Christian <hi>Churches,</hi> What advantage, in order to the Government of those <hi>Churches,</hi> could the <hi>Popes Authority</hi> be? What <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms</hi> might be among them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Holiness</hi> could be acquainted with them? These are therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry slender and narrow Conceptions concerning <hi>Christs Institution</hi> of a <hi>Government</hi> over his <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as though he should only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to these few adjacent parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> without any respect to the good of the whole Church. But since we see, <hi>Christ</hi> designed such a <hi>Church</hi> which might be in most remote and distant places from each other, and yet at such a distance might equally promote the main ends, wherefore they became Churches, it is very unreasonable to think he should appoint one <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> to be <hi>Head</hi> over them all. For which, let us suppose, that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> might be (as the <hi>Eastern Churches</hi> have been) over-run with the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Power, and only some few suffering <hi>Christians</hi> left here, and the <hi>Pope</hi> much in the same condition with the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> But on the other side, that <hi>Christianity</hi> should largely spread it self in <hi>China,</hi> and the <hi>East Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Christian Church</hi> flourish in <hi>America,</hi> Could any <hi>Philosopher</hi> think that fixing a <hi>Monarchy</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or elsewhere, were the best way to <hi>Govern</hi> the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which consists of all these <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Societies?</hi> For that is certainly the best <hi>Government</hi> which is suited to all conditions of that <hi>Society,</hi> which it is intended for; now it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent the <hi>Christian Church</hi> was intended to be so <hi>Catholick,</hi> that no one <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> can be supposed able to look to the <hi>Government</hi> of it. If Christ had intended meerly such a <hi>Church</hi> which should have consisted of such persons which lay here near about <hi>Rome,</hi> and no others, the supposition of such a Monarchy in the <hi>Church</hi> would not have been altogether so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous (though liable to very many inconveniencies:) but when he intended his <hi>Religion</hi> for the universal good of the world, and that in all parts of it, without obliging them to live near each other, it is one of the most unreasonable suppositions in the world, that he should set up a <hi>Monarchical Government</hi> over his <hi>Catholich Church</hi> in such a place as <hi>Rome</hi> is. But now, if we suppose only an <hi>Aristocratical Government</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> under <hi>Christ</hi> as the alone <hi>Supreme Head</hi>; nothing can be more suitable to the nature of the <hi>Church,</hi> or the large extent of it, than that is. For where-ever a <hi>Church</hi> is, there may be <hi>Bishops</hi> to govern it, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the <hi>Church</hi> to over-see the lesser parts of it, and all joyn to promote the Peace and Unity of it, which they may with the more ease do, if no one challenge to be <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> to whom belongs the chief care of the Church. For by this means they cannot with that power and authority redress abuses, and preserve the <hi>Churches Purity</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they might have done. So that considering barely the nature of things, nothing seems more repugnant to the end for which Christ institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> than such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> as you imagine; and nothing more suitable than an <hi>Aristocracy</hi>; considering that <hi>Christian Churches</hi> may be much dispersed abroad, and that where they are, they are incorporated into that Civil Society in which they live (according to the known saying
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:101069:242"/>
of <hi>Optatus, Ecclesia est in republic√¢,</hi> &amp;c.) and therefore such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> would be unsuitable to the civil <hi>Governments</hi> in which those <hi>Churches</hi> may be. For it were easie to demonstrate, that such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> as you chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in the <hi>Church,</hi> is the most inconvenient <hi>Government</hi> for it, take the <hi>Church</hi> in what way, or sense you please; Whether, as to its own peace and order, or to its spreading into other <hi>Churches,</hi> or to the respect it must have to the civil Government it lives under. And, if we would more largely enquire into these things, we might easily find, that those which you look on as the great ends, wherefore Christ should institute such a Monarchical Government in his <hi>Church,</hi> are things unsuitable to the nature of a <hi>Christian Church</hi>; and which Christ, as far as we can judge, did never intend to take care, that they should never be: which are, freedom from all kind of <hi>Controversies,</hi> and absolute submission of <hi>Judgement</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of an <hi>Infallible Judge.</hi> We no where find such a state of a <hi>Christian Church</hi> described or promised, where men shall all be of one mind (only that peace and brotherly love be continued, is that, all Christians are bound to); much less certainly, that this <hi>Vnity</hi> should be by a submission of our understandings to an <hi>Infallible Judge,</hi> of whom we read nothing in that Book which perswades us to be <hi>Christians:</hi> and without which free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our understandings (which this pretended Infallibility would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of) we could never have been judicious and rational <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>

For he certainly knew best, what would suit with the conveniencies of his <hi>Church.</hi> And these are bold and insolent disputes, wherein those of your side argue, <hi>That Christ must have instituted a Monarchy in his Church, because all Philosophers have judged That the most perfect Government.</hi> I need not tell you what these speeches im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Christ</hi> to be, if he doth not follow the <hi>Philosophers</hi> judgement. Will you give him leave to judge what is fittest for his <hi>Church</hi> himself? or do you think he hath not wisdom enough to do it, unless the <hi>Philosophers</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him? Let us therefore appeal to his <hi>Laws</hi> to see what <hi>Government</hi> he hath there appointed. And now I shall deal more closely with you. You tell me, <hi>therein Christ hath appointed this Monarchical Government.</hi> But I may be nearer your mind, when you will Answer me these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Questions. When, and where did any wise <hi>Legislator</hi> appoint a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so vast concernment to the good of the <hi>Society,</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of it, and express no more of it in his <hi>Laws,</hi> than <hi>Christ</hi> hath done of this <hi>Monarchical Government</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> Is there not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care taken in all Laws about that, to express the <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> to hinder <hi>Vsurpations,</hi> to bind all to obedience, to determine the way of Succession by descent or election? And hath <hi>Christ</hi> instituted a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> in his <hi>Church</hi> and said nothing of all these things? When the utmost you can pretend to, are some ambiguous places, which you must have the power of Interpreting your <hi>selves,</hi> or they signifie nothing to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. So that none of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> or the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> for several <hi>Centuries,</hi> could find out such mysteries in <hi>super hanc Petram, dabo tibi Claves,</hi> and <hi>pasce oves,</hi> as you have done. If such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the <hi>Church,</hi> what should we have had more frequent mention
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:101069:242"/>
of in the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> than of this? Where do we meet with any <hi>Histories</hi> that write the affairs of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> for some hundred of years, and never mention any <hi>Royal Acts</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> of them? If St. <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> had setled the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> there, what more famous act could have been mentioned in all <hi>Antiquity</hi> then that? What notice would have been taken by other <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>him</hi> whom he had left his Successour? What addresses would have been made to him by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of other <hi>Churches?</hi> What testimonies of obedience and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; what appeals and resort thither? And it is wonderful strange that the <hi>Histories</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> should be silent in these grand Affairs, when they report many minute things even during the hottest times of persecution. Did the Christians conspire together in those times not to let their posterity know, Who had the <hi>Supream Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> then? Or were they afraid the <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi> should be jealous of the <hi>Popes,</hi> if they had understood their great Authority? But then methinks they should have carried it however among themselves with all reverence and submission to the Pope, and not openly oppose him assoon as ever he began to exercise any Authority, as in the case of <hi>Victor</hi> and the <hi>Asian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi> But of all things, it seems most strange and unaccountable to me, that <hi>Christ</hi> should have instituted such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> in his <hi>Church,</hi> and none of the <hi>Apostles</hi> mention any thing of it in any of the <hi>Epistles</hi> which they writ, in which are several things concerning the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> nay, when there were <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>divisions</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and that on the account of their Teachers, among whom <hi>Cephas</hi> was one (by that very name on which <hi>Christ</hi> said <hi>he would build his Church</hi>) and yet no mention of respect more to <hi>him,</hi> then to any other: no intimation of what power St. <hi>Peter</hi> had for the Government of the <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Monarch</hi> of it: no references at all made to him by any of the divided parties of the <hi>Church</hi> at that time: no mention at all of any such power given him in the <hi>Epistles</hi> written by him, but he writes just as any other <hi>Apostle</hi> did, with great expressions of humility; and, as if he foresaw what <hi>Vsurpations</hi> would be in the Church, he forbids any <hi>Lording it over Gods heritage,</hi> and calls <hi>Christ the chief Pastour of the Church.</hi> And this he doth in an Epistle not writ to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which had been most proper for him if <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> but only to the <hi>dispersed Jews</hi> in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Provinces. Can any one then imagine he should be <hi>Monarch</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and no act of his, as such, recorded at all of him; but carrying himself with all humility, not fixing himself as <hi>Head of the Church</hi> in any <hi>Chair,</hi> but going up and down from one place to another, as the rest of the <hi>Apostles</hi> for promoting the <hi>Gospel of Christ?</hi> To conclude all; Is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive there should be a <hi>Monarch</hi> appointed by <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> when he reckons up those offices which <hi>Christ</hi> had set in the <hi>Church,</hi> speak not one word of him: he mentions <hi>Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastours and Teachers</hi>; but the chief of all is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and he to whom the care of all the rest is committed;<note place="margin">Eph. 4 12.</note> and in whose Authority the welfare, peace, and unity of the <hi>Church</hi> is secured. These things to me seem so incredible, that till you have satisfied my mind in these <hi>Questions,</hi> I must needs judge this pretended <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> to be one of the greatest <hi>Figments</hi> ever were in the Christian world. And thus I have at large considered your Argument from <hi>Reason,</hi> Why there should be such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi>; which I have the rather done, because it is one of the great things in dispute between us, and because
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:101069:243"/>
the most plausible Argument brought for it, is, <hi>The necessity of it in order to the Churches peace,</hi> which <hi>Monarchy</hi> being the best of <hi>Governments</hi> would the most tend to promote. To return now to his Lordship.</p>

                  <note place="margin">P. 201.</note> 
                  <hi>Who were fit or unfit to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Communion, upon any occasion of repairing from one See to another. And these were sent mutually, and as freely in the same manner from</hi> Rome <hi>to the other Patriarchs, as from them to it. Out of which</hi> (saith his Lordship) <hi>I think this will follow most directly, that the Church-Government then was Aristocratical. For had the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>been then accounted sole Monarch of the Church, and been put into the definition of the Church (as he is now by</hi> Bellarmin) <hi>all these communicatory Letters should have been directed from him to the rest, as whose admittance ought to be a rule for all to communicate; but not from others to him, at least not in that even equal brotherly way, as now they appear to be written. For it is no way probable the Bishops of</hi> Rome, <hi>which even then sought their own greatness too much, would have submitted to the other Patriarchs voluntarily, had not the very course of the Church put it upon them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 220.</note> To this you Answer, <hi>That these</hi> literae communicatoriae <hi>do rather prove our assertion, being ordained by</hi> Sixtus 1, <hi>in favour of such Bishops as were called to</hi> Rome, <hi>or otherwise forced to repair thither; to the end they might without scruple, be received into their own Diocese at their return: having also decreed, that without such letters communicatory, none in such case should be admitted. But that these letters should be sent from other Bishops to</hi> Rome <hi>in such an even, equal, and brotherly way, you say, is one of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Chimaera's. But this difference, or inequality you pretend to be in them; that those to the Pope were meerly Testimonial; those from him were Mandato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, witness</hi> (say you) <hi>the case of St.</hi> Athanasius <hi>and other Bishops restored by the Popes communicatory letters. But supposing them equal, you say, it only shewed the Popes humility; and ought to be no prejudice to his just authority, and his right and power to do otherwise if he saw cause.</hi> But all this depends upon a meer fiction, <hi>viz. That these communicatory letters were ordained by</hi> Sixtus 1, <hi>in favour of such Bishops as were called to</hi> Rome, <hi>than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more improbable.</hi> But I do not say, that this is a <hi>Chimaera</hi> of your own Brains,<note place="margin">

Since therefore these were sent to all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> indifferently, and not barely to the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi>; there appears no difference at all in the letters sent to or from him and the other <hi>Patriarchs</hi> on this occasion. As for your instance of the <hi>Popes restoring</hi> Athanasius, I have sufficiently answered it already; and if the <hi>Popes</hi> letter were never so <hi>Mandatory</hi> (as it was not) yet we see it took no effect among the <hi>Eastern Bishops:</hi> and therefore they were of his Lordships mind, <hi>That the Government of the Church was not Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, but Aristocratical.</hi> I did expect here to have met with the pretended Epistle of <hi>Atticus</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> about the manner of making <hi>formed letters,</hi> wherein one Œ† is said to be for the honour of St. <hi>Peter</hi>; but since you pass it over, on this occasion, I hope you are convinced of the Forgery of it.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of your next <hi>Chapter</hi> (which because of the coherence of the matter I handle with this) you find great fault with his <hi>Lordship for a Marginal citation out of</hi> Gerson,<note place="margin">¬ß. 12.</note>

                  <hi>because he supposeth that</hi> Gersons <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was, that the Church might continue without a Monarchical head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he writ a Tract</hi> de Auferibilitate Papae; <hi>whereas,</hi> you say, <hi>Gersons drift is only to shew how many several waies the Pope may be taken away, that is, deprived of his office, and cease to be Pope as to his own person, so that the Church,</hi> pro tempore, <hi>till another be chosen shall be without her visible Head.</hi> But although the truth of what his Lordship proves, doth not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this Testimony of <hi>Gerson,</hi> which was only a <hi>Marginal citation</hi>; yet since you so boldly accuse him for a <hi>false allegation,</hi> we must further examine how pertinent this Testimony is to that which his Lordship brought it for.

alledging <hi>Gerson,</hi> as you are of falsly accusing him. To make this clear, we must consider what <hi>Gersons</hi> design was in writing that Book, and what his opinion therein is concerning the <hi>Churches Government.</hi> It is well known, that his Book was written upon the occasion of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> in the time of the great <hi>Schism</hi> between the three <hi>Popes</hi>; and that the design of it, is, to make it appear that it was in the power of the <hi>Council</hi> to depose the <hi>Popes,</hi>

For it is apparent, the <hi>Supream power</hi> lyes in the <hi>Senate</hi> and not the <hi>Prince,</hi> and that the <hi>Prince</hi> is only a <hi>Ministerial Head</hi> under them. And this is plainly <hi>Gersons</hi> opinion as to the <hi>Church</hi>; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore he may allow the supream <hi>Ministerial Authority</hi> to be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> (which is all your Citations prove) yet the <hi>radical</hi> and intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>power</hi> lyes in the <hi>Church,</hi> which being represented in a <hi>General Council,</hi> may <hi>depose</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> from his <hi>Authority</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> And the truth is, this opinion of <hi>Gerson</hi> makes the Fundamental power of the Church to be <hi>Democratical,</hi> and that the <hi>Supream exercise</hi> is by <hi>Representatives</hi> in a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council,</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> at the highest, is, but a <hi>Ministerial</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Head.</hi> And therefore <hi>Spalatensis</hi> truly observes, <hi>That this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Gerson (which is the same with that of the <hi>Paris Divines,</hi> of which he speaks) <hi>doth only in words attribute supream Ecclesiastical jurisdiction to the Pope,</hi>

                  <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi>; yet here you dare not charge his Lordship with a false allegation, but you are put to your shifts to get off this Testimony as well as you can. For, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> saying expresly in his Epistle to <hi>Evagrius, Vbicunque fuerit Episcopus, sive Romae, sive Eugubii, sive Constantinopoli, sive Rhegii, &amp;c. ejusdem meriti est, ejusdem est &amp; sacerdotii</hi>; his Lordship might well inferr, <hi>That doubtless he thought not of the Roman Bishops Monarchy. For what Bishop,</hi> saith he, <hi>is of the same merit or the same degree in the Priesthood with the Pope, as things are now carried at</hi> Rome? To this you Answer, <hi>That he speaks not of the Pope, as he is Pope, or in respect of that eminent Authority, which belongs to him as St.</hi> Peters <hi>Successour,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:101069:244"/>
but only compares him with another private Bishop, in respect of meer character or power of a Bishop, as Bishop only.</hi> But though this be all which any of your party ever since the <hi>Reformation</hi> have been able to Answer to this place; yet nothing looks more like a meer <hi>shift</hi> than this doth. For had St. <hi>Hierom</hi> only compared these <hi>Bishops</hi> together in regard of their <hi>order,</hi> was not <hi>Sacerdotium</hi> enough to express that by; if St. <hi>Hierom</hi> had said only, that all Bishops are <hi>ejusdem sacerdotii,</hi> there might have been some plausible pretence for this distinction; but when he adds <hi>ejusdem meriti</hi> too, he wholly precludes the possibility of your evading that way. For, What doth <hi>merit</hi> here stand for as distinct from Priesthood, if it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not something besides what belongs to <hi>Bishops as Bishops?</hi> What can <hi>merit</hi> here signifie, but some greater <hi>Power, Authority,</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> given by <hi>Christ</hi> to one <hi>Bishop</hi> above another. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> was not so sensless, as not to see that the <hi>Bishops of Rome, Constantinople, and Alexandria,</hi> had greater <hi>Authority,</hi> and larger <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> then the petty <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Eugubium, Rhegium,</hi> and <hi>Tanis</hi>; but all this he knew well enough came by the custom of the <hi>Church,</hi> that one <hi>Bishop</hi> should have larger po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the <hi>Church</hi> then another. But (saith he) if you come to urge us with what ought to be practised in the <hi>Church,</hi> then, saith he, <hi>Orbis major est urbe,</hi> it is no one City, as that of <hi>Rome</hi> (which he particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth in) which can prescribe to the whole world; For (saith he) <hi>all Bishops are of equal merit, and the same Priesthood wheresoever they are, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at</hi> Rome <hi>or elsewhere.</hi> So that it is plain to all, but such as wilfully blind themselves, that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> speaks not of that, which you call, <hi>the Character of Bishops,</hi> but of the <hi>Authority</hi> of them; for that very word he useth immediately before, <hi>Si authoritas quaeritur, orbis major est urbe.</hi> And where do you ever find <hi>merit</hi> applyed to the <hi>Bishops Character?</hi> They who say, It is understood of the <hi>merit of good life</hi> make St. <hi>Hierom</hi> speak non-sense. For are all <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>same merit of good life?</hi> But we need not go out of <hi>Rome</hi> for the proper importance of <hi>merit</hi> here. For in the <hi>third Roman Synod under</hi> Symmachus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>sub Symmacho. To.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 688.</note> that very word is used concerning Authority and Principality in the Church; <hi>ejus sedi primum Petri Apostoli meritum sive principatus, deinde Conciliorum venerandorum authoritas, &amp;c.</hi> where <hi>Binius</hi> confesseth an account is given of the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the first ground of which St. <hi>Peters merit or principality</hi>; apply now but this sense to S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and he may be very easily understood, All <hi>Bishops</hi> are <hi>ejusdem meriti sive principatus, of the same merit, Dignity or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church.</hi> But you say, <hi>he speaks not of the Pope, as he is Pope:</hi> good reason for it, for St. <hi>Hierom</hi> knew no such <hi>Supremacy</hi> in the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he now challengeth. And can you think, if St. <hi>Hierom</hi> had believed such an authority in the <hi>Pope</hi> as you do, he would ever have used such words as these are, to compare him with the poor <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Agobio</hi> in <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Priesthood.</hi> I cannot perswade my self you can think so, only something must be said for the cause you have undertaken to defend. And since, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and such great men, had gone before you, you could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there were any absurdity in saying as they did. Still you say, <hi>He doth not speak of that Authority which belongs to the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>as S.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<hi>'s Successor.</hi> But if you would but read a little further, you might see that S. <hi>Hierom</hi> speaks of all <hi>Bishops,</hi> whether at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Eugubium, &amp;c.</hi> as equally the <hi>Apostles Successors: For, it is neither</hi> (saith he) <hi>riches or poverty which makes Bishops higher or lower. Caeter√πm omnes Apostolorum successores sunt</hi>; but they are all the Apostles Successors; therefore he speaks of
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:101069:245"/>
them with relation to that <hi>Authority</hi> which they derived from the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And never had there been greater necessity for him to speak of the <hi>Popes succeeding S. Peter</hi> in the <hi>Supremacy</hi> over the <hi>Church</hi> than here, if he had known any such thing, but he must be excused, he was ignorant of it. <hi>No, that he could not be</hi> (say you again) <hi>for he speaks of it elsewhere, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must be so understood there, as that he neither contradict nor condemn himself.</hi> But if the Epistle to <hi>Damasus</hi> be all your evidence for it, a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient account hath been given of that already: <hi>therefore you add more,</hi> and bid us go find them out, to see, Whether they make for the purpose or no. I am sure your <hi>first</hi> doth not out of his <hi>Commentary</hi> on the 13. <hi>Psalm,</hi> because it only speaks of S. <hi>Peters being Head of the Church,</hi> and not of the the <hi>Popes,</hi> and that may import only <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>preheminence,</hi> without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and jurisdiction: besides, that <hi>Commentary</hi> on the <hi>Psalms</hi> is rejected as spurious by <hi>Erasmus, Sixtus Senensis,</hi> and many others among your selves. Your second, <hi>ad Demetriadem Virginem,</hi> is much less to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for that only speaks of <hi>Innocentius</hi> coming after <hi>Anastasius</hi> at <hi>Rome, qui Apostolicae Cathedrae &amp; supradicti viri successor &amp; filius est, Who succeeded him in the Apostolical Chair</hi>; But, Do you not know that there were many <hi>Apostolical Chairs</hi> besides that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had every one of them su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority over the Church of God? What, that should be on the 16. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> I cannot imagine, unless it be that S. <hi>Peter</hi> is called <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps Apostolorum,</hi> which honour we deny him not, or that he saith, <hi>Aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabo Ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lesiam meam super te:</hi> But how these things concern the <hi>Popes Authority,</hi> unless you had further enlightened us, I cannot understand.

So that we see S. <hi>Hierom</hi> remains a sufficient testimony against the <hi>Popes Monarchical Government</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordship further argues against this <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the <hi>Church from the great and undoubted Rule given by</hi> Optatus;<note place="margin">¬ß. 14.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 200.</note>

                  <hi>there the Church is in the Common-wealth, and not the Common-wealth in the Church. And so also the Church was in the Roman Empire. Now from this ground</hi> (saith his Lordship) <hi>I argue thus. If the Church be within the Empire, or other Kingdom, 'tis impossible the Government of the Church should be Monarchical. For no Emperour or King will endure another King within his Dominion, that shall be greater than himself, since the very enduring it makes him that endures it upon the matter no Monarch.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 223.</note> Your answer to this, is, <hi>That these two Kingdoms are of different natures, the one spiritual, the other temporal: the one exercised only in such things as concern the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and the Eternal Salvation of souls; the other in affairs that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this world only.</hi> Surely you would perswade us, we had never heard of much less read <hi>Bellarmin's first Book de Pontifice,</hi> about the <hi>Popes Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power,</hi> which was fain to get license for the other <hi>four</hi> to pass at <hi>Rome</hi>; and although he minces the matter as much as may be, and much more
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:101069:245"/>
than <hi>Baronius</hi> and others did, who pleaded downright for the <hi>Popes Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power</hi>; yet he must be a very weak <hi>Prince,</hi> who doth not see how far that <hi>indirect</hi> and <hi>reductive power,</hi> may extend, when the <hi>Pope</hi> himself is to be <hi>Judge,</hi> What comes under it, and what not. And, What may not come under it, when <hi>deposing of Princes</hi> shall be reduced under that you call <hi>The Worship of God?</hi> and <hi>absolving subjects from their obedience,</hi> tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their <hi>Eternal Salvation?</hi> But if the <hi>Pope</hi> may be <hi>Judge,</hi> What <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things</hi> are <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> and bring them under his power in that respect, Why may not the <hi>Prince</hi> be <hi>Judge</hi> what <hi>spiritual things</hi> are <hi>in ordine ad temporalia,</hi> and use his <hi>power</hi> over them in that respect too? But in the mean time, Is not a <hi>Kingdom</hi> like to be at peace then? If the <hi>Pope</hi> challenged no other authority but <hi>what Christ or the Apostles had,</hi> his Government might be admitted, as well as that authority which they had; but, What do you think of us the mean while, when you would perswade us, that the <hi>Popes Power</hi> is no other than what <hi>Christ</hi> or the <hi>Apostles</hi> had? you must certainly think us such persons <hi>as the Moon hath wrought particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon,</hi> as you after very civilly speak concerning his Lordship. Your instance <hi>from the Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, his Lordship had sufficiently answered, by telling you, <hi>That he that is not blind may see if he will, of what little value the Popes Power is in those Kingdoms, further than to serve their own turns of him, which they do to their great advantage.</hi> And when you would have this to be <hi>upon the account of Faith and Conscience,</hi> Let the <hi>Pope</hi> exercise his power apparently against their <hi>Interest,</hi> and then see, on what account they profess obedience to him. But, as long as they can manage such pretences for their advantage, and admit so much of it, and no more, they may very well endure it, and his Lordship be far enough from contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting himself. When you would urge the same inconvenience against the <hi>Aristocratical Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> you suppose that <hi>Aristocratical Government</hi> wholly <hi>Independent</hi> on, and not subordinate to,<note place="margin">P. 224.</note> the <hi>Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>; whereas his Lordship and the <hi>Church of England</hi> assert the <hi>Kings Supremacy in Government over all, both persons and causes Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal:</hi> And therefore this nothing concerns us. And if from what hath gone before, <hi>it must,</hi> as you say, <hi>remain therefore fully proved, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Government of the Church on earth is Monarchical.</hi> It may for all that I see, remain as fully proved, that you are now the man who enjoy this <hi>Monarchical Power</hi> over the <hi>Church.</hi> And whatever you stile the <hi>Pope,</hi> Whether <hi>the Deputy,</hi> or <hi>Vicar General of Christ,</hi> or <hi>Servus servorum,</hi> or what you will; it is all one to us as long as we know his meaning, whatever fair words you give him. As though men would take it one jot the better to have one usurp and <hi>Tyrannize</hi> over them, because he doth not call himself <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> but <hi>their humble servant.</hi> Is it not by so much the greater <hi>Tyranny?</hi> to have such kind of <hi>Ecclesiastical Saturnalia,</hi> when the <hi>servus servorum</hi> must, under that name, <hi>tyrannize</hi> over the whole world?</p>
               <p>We have already at large shewed, How destructive this pretended Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is to that Government of the Church by <hi>Bishops,</hi> which, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship proves <hi>from the ancient Canons and Fathers of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 202.</note> 
                  <hi>doth of right belong to them,</hi> viz. <hi>from several Canons of the Councils of</hi> Antioch <hi>and</hi> Nice, <hi>and the testimonies of S.</hi> Augustine <hi>and S.</hi> Cyprian. To all this you only say, <hi>That you allow the Bishops their portion in the Government of Christs Flock:</hi> But it is but a very small portion of what belongs to them,<note place="margin">P. 224.</note> if all their <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> must be derived from the <hi>Pope</hi>; which I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be the most current Opinion in your Church: And I dare say, you
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:101069:246"/>
will not dispute the contrary. His Lordship was well enough aware, to what purpose <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledged that the <hi>Government of the Church</hi> was ever in the <hi>Bishops</hi>; for he himself saith, <hi>It was to exclude temporal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but then he desires</hi> A. C. <hi>to take notice of that, when Secular Princes are to be excluded, then it shall be pretended, that Bishops have power to govern: but when it comes to sharing stakes between them and the Pope, then hands off</hi>; they have nothing to do any further than the <hi>Pope</hi> gives them leave. What follows concerning the impossibility of a right executing of this <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> hath been already discussed of, and you answer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to it that hath any face of pertinency; for when you say, it will hold as well against the <hi>Aristocratical Form,</hi> I have plainly enough shewed you the contrary.</p>

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 15.</note>That which follows about the design of an <hi>Vniversal Monarchy</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> as well as the <hi>Church</hi>; about <hi>Pope</hi> Innocent<hi>'s making the Pope to be the Sun, and the Emperour the Moon, the Spanish Friers two Scutchions,</hi> Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella<hi>'s Eclogue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 225, 227.</note> since you will not stand to defend them, I shall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pass them over. But what concerns the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the Civil Power, is more to our purpose, and must be considered. His Lordship therefore saith, <hi>That every soul was to be subject to the higher power,</hi> Rom. 13.1. <hi>And the higher Power there mentioned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 205.</note> 
                  <hi>is the Temporal. And the ancient Fathers come in with a full consent, that every soul comprehends all without exception: All spiritual men, even to the highest Bishop, even in spiritual causes too, so the Foundations of Faith and good Manners be not shaken: And where they are shaken, there ought to be prayer and patience, there ought not to be opposition by force. Nay, Emperours and Kings are</hi> custodes utriusque Tabulae; <hi>They to whom the custody and preservation of both Tables of the Law, for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to God, and duty to man, are committed. A Book of the Law was by Gods own command in</hi> Moses <hi>his time, to be given to the King,</hi> Deut. 17.18. <hi>And the Kings under the Law, but still according to it, did proceed to necessary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in Church-businesses; and therein commanded the very Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as appears in the Acts of</hi> Hezekiah <hi>and</hi> Josiah, <hi>who yet were never cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured to this day for usurping the High-Priests office. Nay, and the greatest Emperours for the Churches honour,</hi> Theodosius <hi>the elder, and</hi> Justinian, <hi>and</hi> Charls <hi>the Great, and divers others, did not only meddle now and then, but enact Laws to the great settlement and encrease of Religion in their several times.</hi> Now to this again, you answer, <hi>That the civil and spiritual are both absolute and independent powers, though each in their proper Orb, the one in spirituals, the other in temporals.</hi> But, What is this to that which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship proves, <hi>That there can be no such absolute independent spiritual power; both because all are bound to obey the Civil Power, and because the Civil Power hath a right to meddle in Ecclesiastical matters?</hi> And, though you express never so much honour to civil authority, yet still you limit it <hi>to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration meerly of civil affairs</hi>; and how far that is, is well enough known. You tell us plainly, <hi>That it doth not belong to the Emperour to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the affairs of the Church</hi>; But why do you not answer the Reasons and Instances which his Lordship brings to the contrary? Yet you yield, <hi>That in case of notorious and gross abuses, manifestly contrary to Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at by the Pastors of the Church, Christian Princes may lawfully and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously use their Authority, in procuring the said abuses to be effectually redressed by the said Pastors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 226.</note> 
                  <hi>as the examples of</hi> Ezekias <hi>and</hi> Josias <hi>prove.</hi> But in case the <hi>High-Priest</hi> would not have yielded to such a reformation, Might not those <hi>Princes,</hi> by the assistance of other <hi>Priests,</hi> have effected it? This is
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:101069:246"/>
the case you were to speak to: For whereas you fly out, and say, <hi>That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may not take the Priests office upon them.</hi> Whom do you dispute against in that? Not his Lordship certainly, nor any of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who never said they might, though they have been most injuriously ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated, as though they did. That which we assert, is, That <hi>Princes</hi> may enact <hi>Laws</hi> concerning Religion, and reform abuses in <hi>Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> but we do not say, they may take the <hi>Pastoral office</hi> upon them; and therefore you say no more in that than we do our selves. But when you say, <hi>They may not reform Religion in the substance of it,</hi> I cannot well tell How to understand you. If you mean, not so reform Religion, as to take away any of the <hi>substance,</hi> that is a Reformation to purpose; but if you bring it <hi>ad hypothesin,</hi> we utterly deny that any of the substance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was taken away upon our <hi>Churches</hi> Reformation: If you mean, not reform abuses which go under the name of the <hi>substance</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> that will be to make the most unsufferable abuses the most incurable. But, when you add, <hi>That nothing must be enacted pertaining to Religion by their own Authority without, or contrary to the Priests consent</hi> (the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> I suppose you mean) shew us, Where the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> were bound, not to reform in case the <hi>High-Priest</hi> did not consent: and if you could do this, you must prove such a <hi>High-Priest</hi> now, and that <hi>Princes</hi> are bound to wait his leisure for reforming abuses in <hi>Religion,</hi> when his pretended <hi>Authority</hi> is upheld by maintaining them. As for your commendations of <hi>Pope Hildebrand,</hi> and <hi>Innocent the Third, for very prudent men, and worthy Champions of your Church,</hi> we see, What <hi>prudence</hi> is with you, and what a worthy <hi>Church</hi> you have. But it is still an excellent evasion,<note place="margin">P. 227.</note> 
                  <hi>That they never endeavoured to subject the Emperour to themselves in temporal matters</hi>; no nor <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third neither, when he trod upon the <hi>Emperours</hi> neck? But the proceedings of these <hi>Popes</hi> with the <hi>Emperours,</hi> as likewise <hi>Adrian</hi> 4. <hi>Lucius</hi> 3. and others, are so gross, that it had been more for your Interest with Christian <hi>Princes,</hi> to disown them, than to go about to palliate them with such frivolous distinctions, that his <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> must be as <hi>blind</hi> as his <hi>Obedience,</hi> that doth not see thorough them. You are much concerned, that his Lordship should seem to give a lash to those mortified self-denying men, <hi>the Jesuits, in bidding them leave their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising to advance the greatness of the Pope and Emperour; for, Who could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they should deprive themselves of the riches and pleasures of the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such designs?</hi> Undoubtedly you are one of the number, for I never heard that any other <hi>Order</hi> among you, did ever give them half so good words, but condemned them as much for their practising, as we do our selves. And, What <hi>holy men</hi> they are, and what excellent Casuistical Divinity about both the riches and pleasures of the world, if we did not otherwise know, the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Jesuitism</hi> would sufficiently discover. To what his Lordship saith further,<note place="margin">P. 211.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is no necessity of one Supreme Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Judge, to keep the Church in peace and unity, but that the several Bishops under their Soveraign Princes, are sufficient in order to it</hi>; you only say, <hi>That he quotes</hi> Occham <hi>for it.</hi> But, Doth he nothing else but quote <hi>Occham?</hi> Why do you not answer to the thing, and not barely to <hi>Occham?</hi> You have very good reason for it; for you have little to say to the thing it self; but for <hi>Occham,</hi> you have enough to tell him in his ear. 1. <hi>That he is in the Index of forbidden Books</hi>; a good testimony for the man's honesty. 2. <hi>That he sided with the Emperour</hi>; a crime beyond an <hi>Index Expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. <hi>That if there were such a Government as</hi> Occham <hi>supposes,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:101069:247"/>
all those Governours must be Infallible, or else there would be meer Anarchy in the Church:</hi> And, Why not as well in the <hi>State,</hi> without <hi>Infallibility</hi> there? You say, <hi>For want of this Infallibility, those Countries where it is not acknowledged, are in Schisms:</hi> And we say, The pretence of this <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> hath caused the greatest of them. 4. You say, <hi>Occham speaks only</hi> de pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibili, <hi>of what might have been, if our Saviour had pleased</hi>; but <hi>Occham</hi>sayes, There is no necessity there should be one chief Governour under Christ, and we say, You can never prove that Christ hath appointed that there shall be one; and therefore this is more than disputing a bare possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>But now, as though all your beggings the Question had been argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all your sayings proofs, and all your proofs demonstrations, with as much authority as if you were <hi>in Cathedr√¢,</hi> you conculde; <hi>Remain it therefore a settled Catholick Principle, that the Pope hath power over the whole Church of God</hi>; But you leave out something which should be at the end of it, <hi>among all those who can believe things as strongly without reason, as with it.</hi> And for the greater solemnity of the Sentence you give it in the words of the <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> at <hi>Florence:</hi> And I must needs say, You have fitted them very well, for that was just as much an <hi>Oecumenical Council,</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Oecumenical Pastor</hi>: but, that neither the one nor the other is so, I have sufficiently proved already.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Illegality of it manifested, first from the insufficiency of the Rule it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, different from that of the first General Councils, and from the Popes Presidency in it. The matter of Right concerning it, discussed. In what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Superiours may be excepted against as Parties. The Pope justly excepted against as a Party, and therefore ought not to be Judge. The Necessity of a Reformation in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledged by Roman Catholicks. The matter of fact enquired into, as to the Popes Presidency in General Councils. <hi>Hosius</hi> did not preside in the Nicene Council as the Popes Legat. The Pope had nothing to do in the second General Council. Two Councils held at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> within two years; these strangely confounded. The mistake made evident. S. <hi>Cyril</hi> not President in the third General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil as the Popes Legat. No sufficient evidence of the Popes Presidency in following Councils. The justness of the Exception against the place, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested; and against the freedom of the Council from the Oath taken by the Bishops to the Pope. The form of that Oath in the time of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Protestants not condemned by General Councils. The Greeks and others unjustly excluded as Schismaticks. The exception from the small number of Bishops cleared and vindicated. A General Council in Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not so called from the Popes General Summons. In what sense a General Council represents the whole Church. The vast difference between the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that at <hi>Trent.</hi> The exception from the number of Italian Bishops, justified. How far the Greek Church and the Patriarch <hi>Hieremias</hi> may be said to condemn Protestants; with an account of the proceedings between them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus far considered the several grounds on which you lay the charge of <hi>Schism</hi> upon us,<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> and shewed at large the weakness<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and insufficiency of them, we should now have proceeded to the last part of our task, but that the great <hi>Palladium</hi> of the present <hi>Roman Church,</hi> viz. the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> must be examined, to see whether it be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, or no; whether it came from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or was only the contrivance of some cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Artificers.<note place="margin">Hist. Council of <hi>Trent. l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 132.</note> And the famous <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Bitonto</hi> in the Sermon made at the opening the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> hath given us some ground to conjecture its original by his comparing it so ominously to the <hi>Trojan-horse.</hi> Although therefore that the pretences may be high and great, that it was made <hi>Divina Palladis arte,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> being said to be present in it, and concurring with it, yet they who search further will find as much of <hi>Artifice</hi> in contriving, and deceit in the managing the one as the other. And although the <hi>Cardinal Palavicino</hi> uses all his art, to bring this Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude off, without reflecting on the honour of the <hi>Council</hi>; yet that <hi>Bishop,</hi> who in that <hi>Sermon</hi> pleaded so much, <hi>That the Spirit of God would open the mouths of the Council, as he did once those of</hi> Balaam <hi>and</hi> Caiaphas, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in this expression an illustrious Instance of the truth of what he said. For he spake as true in this, as if he had been <hi>High-Priest himself that year.</hi> But, as if you really believed your self the truth of that <hi>Bishops</hi> Doctrine, <hi>That whatever spirit was within them, yet being met in Council, the Spirit of God would infallibly inspire them,</hi> you set your self to a serious vindication
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:101069:248"/>
of the proceedings of that <hi>Council</hi>; and not only so, but triumph in it, as that which will bring <hi>the cause to a speedy Issue.</hi> And therefore we must particularly enquire into all the pretences you bring to justifie the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and freedom of that <hi>Council</hi>; but, to keep to the <hi>Bishops Metaphor,</hi>
                  <q>Accipe nunc Dana√ªm Insidias; &amp; crimine ab uno Disce omnes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And when we have thorowly searched this great <hi>Engine</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> we shall have little reason to believe, <hi>that ever it fell from Heaven.</hi> His Lordship then having spoken <hi>of the usefulness of free General Councils, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king some Laws which concern the whole Church</hi>; His Adversary thinks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to give him a <hi>Choak-pear,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 229.</note> by telling him, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>was a General Council; and that had already judged the Protestants to hold errours.</hi> This you call, <hi>Laying the Axe to the Root of the Tree</hi>; that <hi>Tree,</hi> you mean, out of which the <hi>Popes</hi> Infallible <hi>Chair</hi> was cut: for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this dispute about the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> will redound very little to the honour of your <hi>Church</hi> or Cause. But you do well to add, <hi>That his Lordship was not taken unprovided:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 213.</note> for he truly answered, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>was neither a Legal, nor a General Council.</hi> Both these we undertake to make good, in opposition to what you bring by way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his Lordships Exceptions to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note>That which we begin with, is, That it was not a <hi>Legal Council,</hi> which his Lordship proves: First, <hi>Because that Council maintained publickly, that it is lawful for them to conclude any Controversie, and make it to be</hi> de Fide, <hi>and so in your judgement fundamental, though it have not a written word for its warrant; nay, so much as a probable testimony from Scripture.</hi> The force of his Lordships argument I suppose lyes in this, that the Decrees of that <hi>Council</hi> cannot be such as should bind us to an assent to them; because according to their own principles, those Decrees may have no foundation in <hi>Scripture:</hi> And that the only legal proceeding in <hi>General Councils,</hi> is, to decree according to the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Now to this you answer, <hi>That the meaning of the Council, or Catholick Authours, is not, that the Council may make whatever they please matter of Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 230.</note> 
                  <hi>but only that which is expressed or involved in the Word of God written or unwritten</hi>; and this you confess, <hi>is defined by the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>in these terms, that in matters of Faith we are to rely not only upon Scripture, but also on Tradition: which Doctrine</hi> (you say) <hi>is true, and that you have already proved it:</hi> And I may as well say, It is false, for I have already answered all your pretended proofs. But it is one thing, Whether the Doctrine be <hi>true</hi> or no; and another, Whether the <hi>Council</hi> did proceed <hi>legally</hi> in defining things upon this principle. For upon your grounds you are bound to believe it true, because the <hi>Council</hi> hath defined it to be so: But if you will undertake to justifie the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Council</hi> as <hi>legal,</hi> you must make it appear that this was the Rule which <hi>General Councils</hi> have alwaies acted by, in defining any thing to be matter of Faith. But if this appear to be false; and that you cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in any true <hi>General Council,</hi> which did look on this as a sufficient ground to proceed upon, then though the thing may, since that Decree, be believed as <hi>true,</hi> yet that <hi>Council</hi> did not proceed <hi>legally</hi> in defining upon such grounds. Name us therefore, What <hi>Council</hi> did ever offer to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> meerly upon <hi>Tradition?</hi> In the four first <hi>General Councils</hi> it is well known, What authority was given to the <hi>Scripture</hi>
                  <pb n="477" facs="tcp:101069:248"/>
in their definitions; and I hope you will not say, That any thing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, had no other ground but <hi>Tradition.</hi> But suppose you could prove this, it is not enough for your purpose, unless you can make it appear, that those <hi>Fathers</hi> in making such Decrees, did acknowledge they had no ground in <hi>Scripture</hi> for them. For if you should prove that <hi>really</hi> there was no foundation but <hi>Tradition,</hi> yet all that you can inferr thence, is, That those <hi>Fathers</hi> were deceived in judging they had other grounds, when they had not. But still, if they made <hi>Scripture</hi> their <hi>Rule,</hi> and looked on nothing else as a <hi>Foundation</hi> for their definitions but the <hi>written word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> did not proceed <hi>legally,</hi> in offering to define matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> on such grounds which were not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> to be sufficient Foundation for such Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Cardinal Cusanus</hi> at large gives an account of the method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the <hi>Ancient General Councils,</hi> and therein tells us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Causanus de Concord. Cath. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> not only <hi>that the Word of God was placed in the middle among those who sate in Council,</hi> but gives this as the only Rule of their proceeding, <hi>qu√≤d secundum testimonia Scripturarum decrevit Synodus</hi>; that they decreed according to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture. Now if another <hi>Council</hi> shall go according to a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Rule</hi> from what the <hi>Church</hi> hath esteemed the only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Foundation</hi> for definition of <hi>Faith,</hi> that <hi>Council</hi> breaks the inviolable <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> and therefore its proceedings cannot be <hi>legal.</hi> As for Instance; Supposing a <hi>Parliament</hi> not to have power to make new <hi>Laws,</hi> but to declare only what is <hi>Law,</hi> and what not (for that is all you pretend to, as to <hi>General Councils</hi>) and that all other former <hi>Parliaments</hi> have all along professed this to be their Rule, <hi>viz. that they search into the body of the Laws</hi>; and if any thing be controverted, Whether it be a <hi>Law</hi> or no, they make a diligent search into it, and examine all circumstances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, for their own satisfaction, and according to the evidence they find of its being contained in this body of <hi>Laws,</hi> they declare themselves: but many things growing much in <hi>use</hi> among a <hi>prevailing party,</hi> which have no colour of being in the <hi>written Laws,</hi> but yet tend much to the <hi>Interest</hi> of that <hi>party</hi>; and these being opposed by such, who stand up for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and known <hi>Laws,</hi> the other are forced to make use of as good an Expedient as they can, to preserve their interest and credit together. To which end they pack together a company of such, who are most concerned to maintain the things in <hi>Question,</hi> and among these, the great <hi>Innovator</hi> sits as <hi>President</hi> among them, and suffers none to come there, but such as are obliged by <hi>Oath</hi> to speak nothing against his <hi>Interest</hi>; and these, when met together, seeing how unable they are to manage their business according to former <hi>Precedents</hi>; the first thing they do, is to declare, <hi>That customs and usages have as much the force of Laws among them, as any contained in the body of them</hi>; and having established this their <hi>Rule,</hi> according to it they decree all the matters in difference, to be true and real <hi>Laws.</hi> Would any man say, That these men proceeded <hi>legally,</hi> who first make the <hi>Foundation</hi> they are to go on, contrary to all former <hi>Precedents,</hi> and then define ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that? Yet this, in all particulars, is exactly the case of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi>; but the last part is that we are now about; that they should, contrary to the proceedings of all <hi>General Councils</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> first make their <hi>Rule,</hi> and then bind all men to all those <hi>Decrees</hi> which are made according to it. And therefore, though the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> may be thought to act <hi>wisely</hi> in advancing <hi>Traditions</hi> to an equality with <hi>Scripture</hi> in the first place, yet he must have a great deal of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:101069:249"/>
and little judgement, who say's, that in decreeing matters of Faith from Tradition, it acted <hi>legally; i. e.</hi> according to the rules of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>General Councils.</hi> I cannot therefore say, whether you have more of the one, or less of the other, when you tell us without offering to prove it, <hi>That the Council did not proceed in a different manner, from other lawful General Councils whil'st she grounded her definitions, partly on Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, partly on Tradition, even in matters not deducible by any particular or Logical Inference from Scripture.</hi> The absurdity of which Doctrine in it self, I have at large discovered already in our discourse of the <hi>Resolution of Faith,</hi> where it is shewed in what sense his Lordship say's, <hi>That Apostolical Tradition is the Word of God</hi>; But that this was a <hi>legal way</hi> of proceeding in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> to define matters of Faith by such <hi>Traditions</hi> as have no ground in <hi>Scripture,</hi> had need be better proved, than by your bare Affirmation. And if that be a <hi>Tradition</hi> too, I am sure it is one that is neither contained in, nor deducible from, the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His Lordship justly excepts against the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent, from the Popes sitting as President in it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>Is that Council legal, where the Pope the chief person to be reformed shall sit President in it, and be chief Judge in his own cause against all Law, Divine, Natural, and Humane.</hi> To this you return an Answer,<note place="margin">P. 230, 231.</note> both to the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> and the <hi>matter of Fact.</hi> To the <hi>matter of Right,</hi> you say, <hi>That the Pope not being justly accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any crime, but such as must involve, not only the Council, but the whole Church as well as himself, the Protestants had no just cause to quarrel with the Popes presiding in it. Nay, that it is conformable to all Law, Divine, Natural, and Humane, that the Head should preside over the members: and to give No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellists liberty to decline the Popes judgement, or the judgement of any other their lawful Superiours upon pretence of their being parties, is in effect to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt absolutely such people from all legal censure; and to grant there is no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means effectually to govern the Church, or condemn Heresie, Schism, and other offences against Religion.</hi> But is it not unanswerable on the other side, that this <hi>plea</hi> of yours makes it impossible, that the <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> should be reformed, in case the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> do abett and maintain them? If you say, <hi>That it is not possible the Governours of the Church should do so,</hi> we have nothing but your bare word for it, and reason and experience manifest the contrary. In case then there be a vehement presumption at least, in a considerable party of the <hi>Church,</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> is much degenerated and needs reformation, but those who call themselves the lawful <hi>Superiours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> utterly oppose it; What is to be done in this case? must the <hi>Church</hi> continue as it did, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because the <hi>Superiours</hi> make themselves <hi>parties?</hi> Nay, suppose that which you would call <hi>Idolatry</hi> be in the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> and a <hi>Council</hi> of his <hi>packing</hi> declare for it; must there be no endeavours of a <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but by them who pronounce all <hi>Hereticks</hi> who oppose them? But you say, <hi>The Head must preside over the members:</hi> an excellent Argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all usurpations both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi>; for doubtless, they who are in power will call themselves the <hi>Heads</hi> of all others, if that will secure them from any danger. <hi>But this will exempt them from all legal censure:</hi> so will your principles, all <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> though guilty of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, Blasphemy, Idolatry,</hi> or what crime soever. For still, I hope, <hi>the Head must be over the members</hi>; and you say, <hi>it will bring the Church to confusion, if any shall except against their Superiours as parties.</hi> You must therefore absolutely and roundly assert, that it is impossible that the <hi>Superiours</hi> in
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:101069:249"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> may be guilty of any errour or corruption; or that, if they be, they must never be called to an account for it; or else that it may be just in some <hi>cases</hi> to except against them as <hi>parties.</hi> And if in <hi>some cases,</hi> then the question comes to this, whether the present be <hi>some</hi> of those cases or no? and here if you make those <hi>Superiours Judges</hi> again, what you grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before comes to nothing. This will be more clear by a parallel case: Suppose the setting up the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> had been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such an open separation as that of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was, but that the people had sensibly declined from the worship of <hi>God</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and had agreed to assemble at those places, the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> and the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> having deserted <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and approving this alteration of <hi>Gods worship:</hi> But although this might continue for many years; yet some of the <hi>Inferiour Priests</hi> and others of the people reading the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> they find the worship of <hi>God</hi> much altered from what it ought to be, which they publish and declare to others, and bring many of the people to be of their <hi>mind</hi>; but the <hi>High-Priest</hi> and his <hi>Clergy</hi> (foreseeing how much it will be to their prejudice to bring things into their due order) they resolutely oppose it. I pray tell me now, what were to be done in this case? Must the people stand wholly to the judgement of those <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Priests,</hi> who have declared themselves to be utterly averse from any <hi>Reformation?</hi> And if a <hi>Council</hi> be called, is it reasonable or just, that he should sit as <hi>President</hi> in it, because he pretends to be the <hi>Head over the members? and that if Superiours be once accused as parties, all order and peace is gone?</hi> Is there any way left or no, whereby the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> might be reformed? <hi>Yes,</hi> say you, <hi>by a General Council</hi>; but, Must it be such a <hi>General Council,</hi> wherein the <hi>High-Priest</hi> sits as <hi>President,</hi> and all who sit with him sworn to do nothing against him? Is this a <hi>Free and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council</hi> likely to reform these things? And is it not all the <hi>Justice</hi> in the world, that such a <hi>Council</hi> should be truly <hi>Free and General,</hi> and those freely heard who complain of these as great corruptions? and that before the most equal and indifferent <hi>Judges</hi>; or, in case such cannot be assembled, that by the <hi>Assistance</hi> of the <hi>civil power,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> may be reformed by its <hi>parts:</hi> so that still these <hi>parts</hi> be willing to give an account of what they do before any <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>General Council,</hi> where the main party accused sits not as <hi>President</hi> in it? <hi>But what then,</hi> may you say? <hi>will you allow all Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to proceed to a Reformation, in case the Superiours do not presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?</hi> No: but men ought first to exhibit their complaints of abuses, and the <hi>reasons</hi> against them, to those who are actually the <hi>Superiours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; and that with all due reverence to Authority; but if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, they declare themselves willful and obstinate in defence of those things, by the concurrence of the <hi>Supream power</hi> they may lawfully and justly proceed to a <hi>Reformation.</hi>

                  <hi>but that other Bishops in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil may proceed against the Pope himself, if the case do necessarily require it, as if he be a Heretick.</hi> If you will then grant, that in some cases, as in that of <hi>Heresie,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> may be excepted against as a <hi>Party,</hi> you destroy all that ever you say besides. For when the <hi>Pope</hi> is accused for <hi>Heresie</hi> in a <hi>Council,</hi> Who must sit as <hi>President</hi> in that <hi>Council?</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, or not? If the <hi>Pope</hi> must sit as President, (for the <hi>Head,</hi> you say still, <hi>must be over the members</hi>) Do you think he will ever be condemned for <hi>Heresie,</hi> if he hath the supream management of the <hi>Council?</hi> If he may not sit as <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:101069:250"/>
then, by the same reason he ought not to do it, when he is accused of <hi>errour</hi> or <hi>Vsurpation</hi>; but the other <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> met together by the <hi>Assistance</hi> of <hi>Christian Princes</hi> in a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>General Council,</hi> ought to be <hi>Judges</hi> in that case, as well as the former. And this is no more then is agreeable to the Doctrine and practise of the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi>; for if they had suffered the <hi>Popes</hi> to have been <hi>Presidents</hi> in them, or have had that <hi>power</hi> over them, which the <hi>Popes</hi> had in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> Do you think they could have done so to the present <hi>Popes</hi> as they did? But the <hi>Popes</hi> were grown wiser afterwards; they had these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fresh in their memory, and therefore they were resolved never to be ridden by <hi>General Councils</hi> more. And thence came that continual oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to all proposals of the <hi>Emperour</hi> for a <hi>General Council,</hi> till necessity put the <hi>Pope</hi> upon yielding to it: thence came the resolution at <hi>Rome,</hi> not to venture any more <hi>Councils</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> for that place breathed too much freedome for the <hi>Popes</hi> interest, though this were most vehemently desired by, both the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>German Princes</hi> and <hi>Bishops:</hi> Thence, when a <hi>Council</hi> must be call'd, he summons it first at <hi>Mantua,</hi> then at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and when none would come thither, at last he yields it should be at <hi>Trent,</hi> a most inconvenient place for the <hi>Germans</hi> to come to: when they were there, though all art possible was used to prevent the mention of any thing of <hi>Reformation,</hi> yet sometimes some free words breaking out, troubled the <hi>Legats,</hi> who dispatch notice of it to <hi>Rome,</hi> and receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions what to do; yet all could not prevent their fears and jealousies, lest something concerning the <hi>Popes Interest</hi> should be discussed; upon which to make all sure they translate the <hi>Council</hi> to <hi>Bononia,</hi> and leave the Emperour's bishops to blow their fingers at <hi>Trent.</hi> And when upon the Emperour and King of <hi>France</hi>'s Protestations, the <hi>Pope</hi> saw a necessity of removing it back to <hi>Trent</hi> again, though any fair pretence would have been taken to have dissolved the <hi>Council</hi>; yet since that could not be, the greatest care must be used to spin out the time, in hopes of some occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence happening, which might give a plausible pretext for breaking it up. But to be sure nothing must pass, but what was privately dispatched to <hi>Rome</hi> and approved there first, (a good sure way to prevent any mischief) and thence the <hi>Holy Ghost came in a Portmantue</hi> once or twice a week, as the common <hi>by-word</hi> was then. But when, notwithstanding all this, the grand points of the <hi>Residence</hi> and power of <hi>Bishops</hi> were so hotly debated by the <hi>Spanish Bishops,</hi> What arts were used to divert them? when that would not do, How they bait them in <hi>Council</hi> by the flouting <hi>Italians?</hi> what private <hi>Cabals</hi> were kept by the <hi>Legats,</hi> what dispatching and post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rome,</hi> what numbers of jolly <hi>Italians</hi> are made <hi>Bishops,</hi> and sent away to over-vote them? And when the <hi>French-Bishops</hi> were come, what Spies did they keep upon them, what bones were thrown to divide the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish Bishops,</hi> what caressing the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to bring him off by the Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> And when any others durst speak freely what checks, and frowns, and disgraces did they meet with? And all this to keep the <hi>Pope</hi> safe, who was still in bodily fear till the <hi>Council</hi> was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his mind; and then what rejoycing, that they had cheated the world so, that that which was intended to clip the wings of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had confirmed and advanced the <hi>Interest</hi> of it. This was truly the <hi>Head's presiding over the members:</hi> for all the life and motion they had, proceeded from the <hi>Influence</hi> of their <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>: Call you this <hi>Presiding in a Council?</hi> It is rather <hi>riding of it,</hi> that by the <hi>spurring</hi> some and <hi>bridling</hi>

others, they may go just as the <hi>Pope</hi> would have them. And that this is a true account of it, appears, notwithstanding whatever your <hi>Cardinal Palavicino</hi> hath been able to object against the impartial history of it; whose two volumes pretended in Answer to it, consist of so many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies, and hath so very little material in it, that a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> himself hath declared to the world,<note place="margin">

But yet I know you have another Answer ready at hand, <hi>That all this concerned only some abuses in manners and management of affairs, but nothing confessed to be amiss in Doctrine of Faith.</hi> However, since it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Council</hi> to reform those abuses, the <hi>Pope</hi> as an interessed person ought not to have <hi>presided</hi> there, had it not been his intention to have prevented any real <hi>Reformation.</hi> For all the Decrees of the <hi>Council</hi> to that purpose were meerly delusory and nothing of <hi>Reformation</hi> followed upon them; and the most important things to that end could never pass the <hi>Council.</hi> And if we gain this, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ought not to be <hi>Judge,</hi> where himself is concerned, as to the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>abuses</hi>; your former assertion will make the other follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that in case of <hi>Heresie,</hi> other <hi>Bishops</hi> may in <hi>Council</hi> proceed against the <hi>Pope,</hi> and, by the same reason, when any <hi>errours</hi> in Faith are charged upon him, or those who joyn in Communion with him; that such ought to be debated in a full and free <hi>Council,</hi> where no one concerned may preside to <hi>over-aw</hi> the rest.

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:101069:251"/>
place of which no other account can be given; and because</hi> Cedrenus <hi>and</hi> Photius <hi>confess that the Pope gave authority to this Council by his Legats; and in the old preface to the Council of</hi> Sardica, <hi>it is said expresly, that</hi> Hosius <hi>was the Popes Legat, and the same acknowledged by</hi> Hincmarus, <hi>and</hi> Gelasius Cyzicenus, <hi>whom you prove that</hi> Photius <hi>had read.</hi> These being then all the Evidences you produce for the <hi>Popes</hi> Presidency at the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> we are obliged to afford them a particular consideration.</p>
               <p>Your first argument, which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> likewise insist on, is the order of subscription, <hi>because the name of</hi> Hosius <hi>is set first</hi>; but, if we mark it, this argument supposeth that which it should prove. For thus it proceeds, <hi>Hosius</hi> subscribed first, and therefore he was the <hi>Roman Legat; Hosius</hi> was the <hi>Roman Legat,</hi> and therefore he subscribed first: For it supposeth that the <hi>first Subscription</hi> did of <hi>right</hi> belong only to the <hi>Roman Legat</hi>; which we may as well deny, by an argument just like it, <hi>Vitus</hi> and <hi>Vincentius</hi> did not subscribe first, and therefore the <hi>Roman Legats</hi> did not subscribe first. But you ask, <hi>Why then did</hi> Hosius <hi>subscribe before the Patriarchs, and other Bishops, of greater dignity than himself.</hi> I answer, <hi>Because Hosius</hi> was <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> and not they. But if you ask, <hi>Why they chose him President before others,</hi> the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> must answer you, and not I. But you say, <hi>Cedrenus</hi> and <hi>Photius</hi> confess, <hi>That the Pope gave Authority to the Nicene Council by his Legats</hi>; but, How comes that to prove, that <hi>Hosius</hi> was one of those <hi>Legats?

But you will ask, <hi>How comes it then to be accounted an Oecumenical Council?</hi> For this indeed <hi>Baronius</hi> would fain find out some hand that <hi>Damasus</hi> had in it, or else he cannot conceive how it should become <hi>Oecumenical</hi>; but all the proof he produceth, is, <hi>Because in the Acts of the sixth Council it is said, that</hi> Theodosius <hi>and</hi> Damasus <hi>opposed</hi> Macedonius: and so I hope he might do by declaring his consent to the Doctrine decreed in this <hi>Council</hi>; not that thereby his approbation made it <hi>Oecumenical.</hi> And, as that Doctrine was received, and that Confession of <hi>Faith</hi> embraced all over the world, so that <hi>Council</hi> became <hi>Oecumenical.</hi> For I cannot see but that if <hi>Damasus</hi> had stood up for <hi>Macedonius,</hi> if the Decrees against him had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> it had been never the less <hi>Oecumenical</hi> in the sense of Antiquity: That testimony which <hi>Baronius</hi> brings out of his own <hi>Library,</hi> and a Copy of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> expressing that <hi>Damasus</hi> did summon the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> is not to be taken against the consent of the ancient <hi>Church-Historians</hi>; it being well known what <hi>Interess</hi> those <hi>Roman Copies</hi> have a long time driven on.

the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was assented to by <hi>Damasus,</hi> and the <hi>Western Bishops,</hi> in the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> there decided, but I utterly deny that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus</hi> had any thing to do in the <hi>Presidency</hi> over that <hi>Council.</hi> So that we find a <hi>Council</hi> alwaies acknowledged to be <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> in which the <hi>Pope</hi> had no <hi>Presidency</hi> at all; and this very Instance sufficiently refutes your <hi>Hypothesis, viz. that the Popes Presidency is necessary to a General Council.</hi>

But before <hi>Coelestine</hi> had read the Letters from <hi>Nestorius</hi> in vindication of himself, <hi>Possidonius</hi> a <hi>Deacon</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> comes with several dispatches from S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> wherein a large account is given of the heresie and actions of <hi>Nestorius</hi>; upon which the <hi>Pope</hi> calls a <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and therein examines the allegations on both sides, which being done, the <hi>Council</hi> condemns <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth this sentence on him, <hi>That ten daies should be allowed him (after notice given) for his repentance; and, in case of obstinacy, he should be declared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.</hi> And for executing this sentence, <hi>Coelestine</hi> commits his power to <hi>Cyril</hi>; not as though it belonged to the <hi>Pope</hi> only to do it, but that by this means there might appear the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Western</hi> with the <hi>Eastern Bishops,</hi> in putting <hi>Nestorius</hi> out of the communion of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> S. <hi>Cyril</hi> having received these Letters by the return of <hi>Possidonius,</hi>

Things being grown to this height, <hi>Theodosius</hi> calls a <hi>General Council</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to be held the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing year, writes to all the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> to appear there at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and bring such <hi>Bishops</hi> with them, as they thought convenient;
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:101069:254"/>
but what contentions happened there between the two parties, is not here our business to relate; but the <hi>Emperour</hi> foreseeing what disturbance was like to be there, sent the Count <hi>Candidianus</hi> for better management of the affairs of the <hi>Council.</hi> Now S. <hi>Cyril</hi> and his party having the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the other, both in number and forwardness of being there, <hi>Cyril</hi> sits as <hi>President</hi> among them. The Question now is, Whether he sate there by virtue of that <hi>Legantine</hi> Power he had for the excommunicating <hi>Nestorius</hi> the year before, or not? or only as <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and chief of that party? But by what authority he should challenge to be <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> because he had been deputed by <hi>Coelestine</hi> to act his part in the excommunicating <hi>Nestorius,</hi> I think is somewhat hard to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. Neither doth any thing appear in the <hi>Council</hi> which gives any ground for it; for <hi>Cyril</hi> subscribes to it meerly as <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Council on all occasions call him, and <hi>Memnon</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> their <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>assist together with them in Council:</hi> But, Why should <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi> send other <hi>Legats</hi> afterwards, <hi>viz. Arcadius, Philippus,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectus,</hi> if S. <hi>Cyril</hi> supplied the <hi>Popes</hi> place there already? Yet, although we should grant, that before the <hi>Legats</hi> came, <hi>Cyril</hi> did supply the place of <hi>Coelestine,</hi> yet it doth not follow, that he sate <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> on that account: but only to shew the concurrence of <hi>Coelestine</hi> with the <hi>Council</hi> in matter of Doctrine; and this there was good reason for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Coelestine</hi> had fully declared himself to <hi>Cyril</hi> concerning that already. And this was usual in the <hi>Councils,</hi> as appears in this very <hi>Council</hi> by <hi>Flavia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Bishop</hi> of <hi>Philippi</hi>; subscribing likewise in the place of <hi>Rufus</hi> of <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica.</hi> So that if we grant <hi>Cyril</hi> to sit in the <hi>Council</hi> as <hi>Legat</hi> of <hi>Coelestine,</hi> yet it doth not follow, that he was <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> in that capacity; for the other was only to <hi>testifie</hi> his <hi>consent,</hi> this required a particular <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> to that purpose. So that he might give a <hi>vote</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> for <hi>Coelestine,</hi> and yet sit (as he did) <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> as <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Thus it being manifested, that in the three first General <hi>Councils,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> sate not either by himself or his <hi>Legats</hi> as <hi>President,</hi> it is sufficiently proved thereby, that his <hi>Presidency</hi> is no necessary condition to a <hi>General Council</hi>; and if not, then we say, It is unjust and unreasonable he should challenge it, when he is the person mainly accused. But in the mean while it is not at all necessary, that we should deny that ever he sate as <hi>President</hi> in any other <hi>General Council</hi>; for being the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>chief See,</hi> Why should he in a case of general concernment to the <hi>Church,</hi> as that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> not be allowed by his <hi>Legats</hi> to have the <hi>prime place:</hi> But there wants sufficient evidence too, that these were properly the <hi>Presidents</hi> of that <hi>Council.</hi> In the next at <hi>Constantinople</hi> you grant, that <hi>Eutychius Bishop of Constantinople</hi> sate <hi>President</hi>; but you say, <hi>That he acknowledged this priviledge to be due to Pope Vigilius.</hi> But, How came it to pass then, that he would not sit there, though then at <hi>Constantinople?</hi> It appears by the many frivolous <hi>excuses</hi> he made, that he durst not trust himself in the <hi>Council,</hi> for fear that authority should not be given him which he expected. For that hath alwaies been the subtilty of the <hi>Popes</hi> in those elder times, when they began to encroach, not to venture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in presence in a <hi>General Council,</hi> for fear of opposition, but by their absence they reserved to themselves a liberty to declare their dissent, when any Acts passed which did not please them. As <hi>Leo</hi> did in the case of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> But however, this is evident from the fifth
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:101069:254"/>
                  <hi>General Council,</hi> that the <hi>Popes</hi> Presidency was not then thought at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. What was done in following <hi>Councils,</hi> is not material to our purpose, because it doth already sufficiently appear, that the <hi>Popes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency</hi> is not necessary to a <hi>General Council,</hi> and therefore you conclude with a notorious falsity, in saying with <hi>Bellarmin, That the Pope hath been possest full</hi> 1500 <hi>years of the right of presiding in General Councils.</hi>

               <p>His Lordships third exception against the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> is,<note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>That the place was not free, but either in, or too near the Popes dominions.</hi> To this you Answer, <hi>That certainly</hi> Trent <hi>is not within the Popes dominion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but it is well enough known, that <hi>Trent</hi> was under the sole jurisdiction of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi> to be sure was under the <hi>Popes</hi> dominion, having been particularly obliged too, by receiving a <hi>Cardinal's Hat.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not without just reason that the <hi>place</hi> was protested against, not only by the <hi>German Protestants,</hi> as being out of <hi>Germany</hi> where the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> had often promised the <hi>Council</hi> should be; at the Diet at <hi>Norimberg</hi> 1524, at <hi>Auspurg</hi> 1526. <hi>Spire</hi> 1529. <hi>Ratisbone</hi> 1532, 1541. again at <hi>Norimberg</hi> 1543. and last of all at <hi>Spire</hi> 1544. but as a most inconvenient <hi>place</hi> for them to come to; being <hi>a weeks journey</hi> (as they say) from the borders of <hi>Germany,</hi> seated in a barren and almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible place, having no freedom of passage almost amidst the <hi>Alps</hi>; This place, I say, was not only protested against by them, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the promises made to them; but the <hi>German Bishops</hi> made it their earnest request, that the <hi>Council</hi> might be held in <hi>Germany</hi>; for at <hi>Trent,</hi> they said they could neither be present themselves, nor send any <hi>Legats</hi> thither: and particularly instance in the unpassableness of the <hi>Alps</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and <hi>Trent</hi>; and that it was rather in the borders of <hi>Italy</hi> then <hi>Germany.</hi> And the <hi>Pope</hi> himself in his Answer to the <hi>German Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>Emperours Protestation</hi> upon the removal of the <hi>Council</hi> from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bononia,</hi> insists upon the inconvenience of <hi>Trent</hi> for the long residence of the <hi>Bishops</hi> there. And in behalf of the <hi>Protestants</hi> declaring against this <hi>place</hi> in regard of the unsafeness of it, the places about being all under the <hi>Popes</hi> authority: <hi>du Ranchin</hi> tells you, <hi>That it is an exception allowable by the Doctors of the Canon Law, who all agree,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Review of the Council of <hi>Trent. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>that an exception against the safety of the place is pertinent, and ought to be admitted; that it is good, both by the Civil Law and the Law of Nature, that a man summon'd to a place where any danger threatens him, is not bound to appear, nor to send his Proctour, and that a Judge is bound to assign the parties a place of safety for the hearing of their cause, otherwise there is just cause of appeal.</hi> That the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Pisa</hi> excepted against appearing at <hi>Rome</hi> on the same accounts, and if they durst not venture to <hi>Rome</hi> upon the offer of safe-conduct, much less rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had the Protestants to do it, to such a place as <hi>Trent,</hi> a City, by reason of the neighbouring woods very subject to treacheries and ambushments; that the very designing such a place yielded ground of fear and suspicion, especially to such as had not forgotten the late examples of <hi>John Husse,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance.</hi> That the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> in the <hi>diet</hi> at <hi>Francford A. D.</hi> 1338. pleaded the nullity of the <hi>Popes</hi> excommunication of <hi>Lewis</hi> 5, because he was cited to <hi>Avignon</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>place</hi>; and the place being not free for him to appear at, the summons were not <hi>Canonical,</hi> but void and invalid in Law. This and many other instances are there brought by the same learned <hi>Authour</hi> to justifie the <hi>Protestants</hi> in not appearing at <hi>Trent,</hi> because the place was not free nor safe; although the Authour seems not to have been one
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:101069:255"/>
himself. All these things being considered, he must have been an <hi>Infidel indeed,</hi> who would pronounce <hi>Trent</hi> to have been the most indifferent place for both parties to meet at. For what you say, <hi>That it might have been as unsafe for the Pope and his party, if it had been in</hi> Germany: there is no reason at all for it, because of the <hi>Emperours</hi> openly owning that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; but if you plead the warrs of <hi>Germany</hi> which then broke out, I hope that may serve as a further plea for the <hi>Protestants,</hi> who were in a good condition to go to a free <hi>Council</hi> about matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> when a war was already begun upon them upon the account of <hi>Religion,</hi> as most evidently appears, not only by the supplies sent by the <hi>Pope,</hi> but by the transactions afterwards between the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Emperour,</hi> in some of which it is expresly confessed.</p>
               <p>But supposing the place had been never so free, there is another great Exception remaining still,<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. That none had suffrage, but such as were sworn to the Pope and Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and professed enemies to all that call'd for Reformation or a free Council.</hi> To this you Answer, 1. <hi>That it is no new thing for Bishops to take an oath of Canonical obedience to the Pope;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 233.</note> 
                  <hi>for St.</hi> Gregory <hi>mentions it as an ancient custome in his time; and therefore this objection would serve as much against ancient General Councils as this of</hi> Trent. 2. <hi>That the Bishops oath doth not deprive them of the liberty of their suffrage; nay it doth not so much as oblige them not to proceed and vote even against the Pope himself, if they see just cause; but only that they will be obedient to him, so long as he commands things suitable to the will of God and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Canons of the Church.</hi> But what falshood and fraud lies in both these Answers, it will not take up much time to discover. Could you without blushing offer to say, <hi>That no other oath was taken by the Bishops at the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>then what was taken in ancient General Councils?</hi> for so much your words imply, when you say, <hi>That the same objection would have held as well against them as this of</hi> Trent. Why do you not produce some instance of any <hi>oath</hi> taken to the <hi>Pope</hi> in any of the first <hi>General Councils?</hi> I dare challenge you to bring any footsteps of any such thing in any anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Council</hi>; and you must needs have exceedingly hardened your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head that durst let fall any thing tending that way. It was in much later times before that oath of <hi>Canonical obedience</hi> from <hi>Bishops</hi> to their <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> came up; and when it did, no more took any such oath to the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> then such as were under his <hi>Metropolitical jurisdiction.</hi> In your citation of <hi>Gregory,</hi> you would let us see how far you can out-go <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> himself in these things.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Concil. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> For <hi>Bellarmin</hi> only proves, that it is not new for <hi>Bishops</hi> to take an <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>Canonical obedience</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi>; but you say, <hi>That</hi> Gregory <hi>mentions it as an ancient custom in his time,</hi> which is egregiously false.

D.</hi> 675. and
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:101069:255"/>
therein indeed they say it is <hi>expedibile,</hi> a matter they judge <hi>expedient, That those in orders should,</hi> Promissionis suae vota sub cautione spondere, <hi>bind themselves by promise to observe the Catholick Faith, and obey their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours:</hi> but here is nothing at all concerning any oath to be taken by all <hi>Bishops</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> produce it to that purpose. For that was much later then the time of this <hi>Council,</hi> it beginning at the time of the contests between the <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> about <hi>Investitures</hi>; then the <hi>Pope</hi> to secure as many as he could to himself, binds them in oath of <hi>Fealty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> rather then <hi>Canonical obedience</hi> to himself: by which, as <hi>Spalatensis</hi> truly saith, <hi>he makes the Bishops his slaves and vassals.</hi> And therefore in another place, he justly wonders,<note place="margin">

<pb n="492" facs="tcp:101069:256"/>
he was resolved to hold them fast enough to himself by it. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions or limitations can you now find out in this Oath, whereby these <hi>Bishops</hi> might freely debate the power and authority of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> They that swear, <hi>not to be in any Council or debate against the Pope,</hi> are not like to make any <hi>Free Council</hi> about the matters then in dispute.

And, Were there nothing else but this <hi>Oath,</hi> so unheard of a thing in all ancient <hi>Councils,</hi> so contrary to the ends of a <hi>Free Council</hi>; this were enough to keep them from ever submitting to the judgement of such a <hi>Council</hi> as that of <hi>Trent</hi> was.</p>
               <p>And yet this is not all neither: for his Lordship adds, <hi>That the Pope himself, to shew his charity, had declared and pronounced the appellants Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, before they were condemned by the Council. I hope,</hi> saith he, <hi>an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of enemies are no lawful Council; and I think that the Decrees of such a one are,</hi> omni jure nulla, <hi>and carry their nullity with them through all Law.</hi> All the Answer you give to this,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> is, <hi>That the Pope did nothing therein but in pursuance of the Canons of the Church which required him so to do, and of the Decrees of General Councils, which had already condemned their Opinions for Heresie.</hi> You mend the matter well: for it seems the <hi>Pope</hi> not only did so, but was bound to do so. For shame then never talk of a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>General Council,</hi> to debate those things which you say were already condemned for Heresies by <hi>General Councils.</hi> One may now see, What the <hi>Safe-conduct</hi> had been for the <hi>Protestants,</hi> if they had come to <hi>Trent</hi>; for it seems they were condemned for <hi>Hereticks</hi> before they came there, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then was wanting but execution. But if the <hi>Protestants</hi> Opinions were condemned for <hi>Heresies</hi> before by <hi>General Councils,</hi> Why was the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> at all summoned? Why was the world so deceived with the promises of a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>General Council?</hi> Why did they proceed to make new <hi>Decrees</hi> in these matters? In what ancient <hi>General Councils</hi> will you shew us the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> decreed, that those who held the contrary should be accounted <hi>Hereticks?</hi> Speak them out, that we may find our selves therein condemned. Give us a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the rest of your <hi>Tridentine Articles,</hi> and name us the <hi>General Councils</hi> in which they were decreed as they are there? But this is not a work for you to meddle in. However, What folly and madness would it be to account that a <hi>Free Council,</hi> in which the things to be debated are looked on as condemned Heresies already, and no liberty allowed to any persons to debate them?</p>
               <p>The last Exception you say of his Lordship, is, <hi>against the small number of Bishops present at the Tridentine Council;</hi>

                  <hi>and in the first place he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Greeks whom he takes</hi> (say you) <hi>to have been unjustly excluded.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> To this you say, 1. <hi>The Pope called all who had right to come: (you should say, all whom he would judge to have right to come.</hi>) 2. <hi>The Greeks, by reason of their notorious Schism, had excluded themselves:</hi> And, Might not the <hi>Greeks</hi> (if they were in condition) every whit as well hold a <hi>General Council</hi> among themselves. and say, The <hi>Latins</hi> had excluded themselves by their noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Schism.</hi> You say, <hi>It is confessed that no known Heretick or Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, hath right to sit in Council:</hi> but still you make your own selves Judges, Who are Orthodox, and who Hereticks and Schismaticks; and, Might not the <hi>Greeks</hi> again say the very same of you? and for all that I know, with much more truth and reason. It was then very like to be a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:101069:256"/>
Council,</hi> when the <hi>Pope</hi> and his party must sit as <hi>Judges,</hi> Who were to be admitted, and who not: Might not the <hi>Donatists</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> have call'd their <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>seventy Bishops</hi> an <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> upon the same grounds, because they accounted none to belong to the Church, but such as were of their own party? And if they did not belong to the <hi>Church,</hi> they could have no right to sit in <hi>Council.</hi> It seems, the more uncharitable you are, the freer your <hi>Councils</hi> are; For the <hi>Pope</hi> may, by pronouncing men <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> keep them from coming to <hi>Councils,</hi> and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against him there: and the <hi>Council</hi> be never the less <hi>General</hi> for all that. If the <hi>Greeks</hi> be not called to the <hi>Council,</hi> they may thank them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they are <hi>notorious Schismaticks,</hi> and, if we believe you, <hi>Hereticks</hi> too; If the <hi>Protestants</hi> be not admitted, it is their own fault they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Hereticks</hi>; if none appear from any other more remote <hi>Churches,</hi> still the same plea will serve to exclude them all. For my part I much approve the saying of <hi>Eugenius</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> when they spake of the paucity of <hi>Bishops</hi> for a <hi>General Council, That where he and the Emperour, and the Patriarch of</hi> Constantinople <hi>were present, there was a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, though there were no more.</hi> And <hi>Pope Pius the fourth</hi> might have saved a great deal of mony in his purse, with which he maintained his <hi>Bishops Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> at that <hi>Council,</hi> had he been of the same mind. But the scene of things was altered in <hi>Europe</hi>; there were such clamours made for a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council,</hi> that something must be done to satisfie the world: and, as long as the <hi>Pope</hi> knew how to manage the business, there would be nothing could breed so great danger in it. He therefore barely summons a <hi>Council,</hi> without acquainting any of the <hi>Eastern Patriarchs</hi> with it (as was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom in the ancient <hi>General Councils</hi>) among whom it was debated after the <hi>Emperours</hi> indicting of it; these summoned by the <hi>Emperours</hi> order their <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi>; the <hi>Bishops</hi> they agreed among themselves, who should go to the <hi>Council,</hi> who on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count might be said to represent those <hi>Churches</hi> from whence they came. What was there like this in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>? What messages were there sent to the <hi>Eastern Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Constantinople, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria?</hi> What <hi>Metropolitans</hi> came thence? What <hi>Bishops</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of those Churches? And, if there were nothing of all this, What bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is it to call this a <hi>General Council?</hi> Just by the same figure that your <hi>Church</hi> is called the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; which is<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> by an insufferable <hi>Catachre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</hi> And must six fugitive <hi>Greek-Bishops</hi> give vote here for all the <hi>Eastern Churches</hi>; and two fugitive <hi>English-Bishops</hi> for all the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> I do not then at all wonder, How easily this might be a <hi>General Council,</hi> though there were so very few persons in most of the <hi>Sessions</hi> of it. But you say, <hi>There was no need of any particular sending from the Greeks, as the case then stood, and still continues;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 234.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis sufficient they were called by the Pope.</hi> Sufficient indeed for your purpose; but not at all for a <hi>General Council</hi>; For if the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> had been in condition to have sent an equal number of <hi>Eastern</hi> to <hi>Western Bishops,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> would rather have lost all, than stood to the judgement of such a <hi>Council.</hi> And this you know well enough, for all your saying, <hi>That the Greek Church condemns the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants:</hi> You dread the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> meeting you in a <hi>Free General Council</hi>; and therefore to prevent that, they must be called <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and excluded as such, though you would never permit the debate of the <hi>Schism</hi> in a <hi>Free Council. As the case then stood, and still continues, there was no need of sending.</hi> And, Why so? Is it because those <hi>Churches</hi> were
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:101069:257"/>
then under persecutions, and are still, and therefore there is no hopes that the <hi>Bishops</hi> should come to a <hi>General Council?</hi> But all that thence follows, is, that as things stood then, and do still, there can be no truly <hi>General Council</hi>; and that is a just inference: but I suppose you rather mean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those <hi>Churches</hi> were then in <hi>Schism,</hi> and are still, which still disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers what a wonderful good opinion you have of your selves, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable you are to all others. And so great is the excellency of your <hi>Bishops,</hi> that one of them may represent a <hi>whole Nation</hi>; and so about <hi>fifty</hi> will be more than sufficient for the whole world. And therefore I rather wonder there were so many <hi>Bishops</hi> at <hi>Trent</hi>; for, if the <hi>Pope</hi> pleased, as he made <hi>Patriarchs, Primats,</hi> and <hi>Arch-Bishops</hi> of such places where they never durst go (which he knew well enough) it had been but appointing such to stand for such a <hi>Nation,</hi> and such for another, and a small number might have served turn, without putting any to the trouble of coming from any forein <hi>Countries</hi> at all. For otherwise, if we go about to examine the numbers of <hi>Bishops,</hi> by their proportions to the <hi>Churches</hi> they come from, as it ought to be in <hi>General Councils,</hi> we shall find a most pitiful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as his Lordship saith, <hi>Is it to be accounted a General Council, that in many Sessions had scarce ten Arch-Bishops,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>or forty or fifty Bishops present? In all the Sessions under</hi> Paul 3. <hi>but two Frenchmen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 215.</note> 
                  <hi>and sometimes none; as in the sixth, under</hi> Julius 3. <hi>when</hi> Henry 2. <hi>of</hi> France <hi>protested against that Council. And from</hi> England <hi>but one or two</hi> (by your own confession) <hi>and those not sent by Authority. And the French</hi> (he saith) <hi>held off till the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of</hi> Lorrain <hi>was got to</hi> Rome. <hi>As for the Spaniards, they laboured for many things upon good grounds, but were most unworthily over-born.</hi> Now to this you have a double Answer ready, 1. <hi>That mission or deputation, is not of absolute necessity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>but only of Canonical provision, when time or state of the Countries whence Bishops are sent, will permit; in other cases, it sufficeth they be called by the Pope.</hi> 2. <hi>For those who were absent, the impediment was not on the Councils part; and in the latter Sessions (wherein all that had been formerly desined by the Council, was</hi> de Novo <hi>confirmed and ratified by the unanimous consent of all the Prelates) 'tis manifest, the Council was so full, that in the number of Bishops it exceeded some of the first four General Councils.</hi> I begin with your first Answer, which necessarily implies, that a <hi>General Council</hi> is not so called by <hi>representation</hi> of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> but by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Popes Summons.</hi> So that if the <hi>Pope</hi> make a <hi>General Summons,</hi> that must be called a <hi>General Council,</hi> though none be present but such whom the <hi>Pope</hi> shall think fit to call thither. But, Where do you find any such account of a <hi>General Council</hi> in all <hi>Antiquity?</hi> I have given you instances already of <hi>General Councils,</hi> in which the <hi>Popes</hi> had nothing at all to do with the summoning of them; nay, all the four <hi>General Councils</hi> were called by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and not by the <hi>Pope,</hi> as any one may see, that doth not wilfully blind himself. The <hi>Pope</hi> sometimes did beseech and intreat the <hi>Emperour</hi> to call a <hi>Council,</hi> but never presumed to do it himself in those daies. And this is evident, not only from the <hi>Historians,</hi> but from the authentick <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Councils</hi> themselves; and <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi>'s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the <hi>temporal and spiritual call of Councils,</hi> is as ill grounded as the <hi>Popes temporal and spiritual power</hi>; there being no foundation at all in <hi>Anquity,</hi> nor any reason in the thing, for two such several <hi>Calls,</hi> the one by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the other by the <hi>Pope.</hi> But this is a meer evasion, the evidence being so clear, as to the <hi>Emperours</hi> calling those <hi>Councils,</hi> the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>

                     <hi>Recogniti. p.</hi> 46.</note> which I at large proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>That the Synodical Epistle was not sent by the General Council, but by another the year after.</hi> If then the calling of <hi>Councils</hi> belongs not of right to the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is not his summoning which can make a <hi>General Council,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mission and deputation from those <hi>Churches</hi> whom they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present. And any other sense of a <hi>General Council</hi> is contrary to the sense of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and is forced, and unreasonable in it self. For it must be either absolutely <hi>general,</hi> or by <hi>representation</hi>; none ever imagined yet an absolutely <hi>General Council,</hi> and therefore it must be so called as it doth <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present</hi>; if so, then there is a necessity of such a <hi>deputation.</hi> But here a <hi>Question</hi> might arise, Whether those <hi>Deputies</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> have power by their own votes to oblige the <hi>Churches</hi> they are sent from, by conveying in a <hi>General Council</hi>; or else only as they carry with them the sense of those <hi>Churches</hi> whom they represent: and this latter seems more agreeable to the nature of a truly <hi>General Council,</hi> whose acts must oblige the whole <hi>Church.</hi> For that can only be said to be the act of the whole <hi>Church,</hi> which is done by the <hi>Bishops</hi> delivering the <hi>sense</hi> of all <hi>particular Churches</hi>; and it is not easie to understand, How the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> can be obliged any other way; unless it be proved, that <hi>General Councils</hi> are instituted by some positive <hi>Law of Christ</hi>; so that what is done by the <hi>Bishops</hi> in them, must oblige the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>; and then we must find out not only the <hi>Institution</hi> it self, but the way and manner how <hi>General Councils</hi> should be called, of which the <hi>Scripture</hi> is wholly silent. And therefore there is no reason that there should be any other <hi>General Council</hi> imagined, but by such a <hi>representation</hi>; and in order to this, the consent of all those <hi>Churches</hi> must be known by the particular <hi>Bishops,</hi> before they can concurr with others, so as to make a <hi>General Council.</hi> The most suitable way then to a <hi>General Council,</hi> is, that the <hi>Summons</hi> of them being published by the consent of <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> every <hi>Prince</hi> may call together a <hi>National Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> in which the matters to be debated in the <hi>Council,</hi> are to be discussed, and the sense of that <hi>Synod</hi> fully declared, which those <hi>Bishops</hi> who are appointed by it to go to the <hi>General Council,</hi> are to carry with them, and there to declare the sense of their particular <hi>Church,</hi> and what all these <hi>Bishops</hi> so assembled do all agree in, as the sense of the whole <hi>Church,</hi> may be called the decree of a <hi>General Council.</hi> Or in case some great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment happen, that such <hi>Bishops</hi> cannot assemble from all <hi>Churches,</hi> but a very considerable number appearing and declaring themselves, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first notice of it, is universally received by all particular <hi>Churches,</hi> that may <hi>ex post-facto</hi> be called a <hi>General Council</hi>; as it was with the first four <hi>Oecumenical Councils.</hi> And yet that in them there was such a <hi>deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as this is, appears by that <hi>expression</hi> in the <hi>Synodical Epistle</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> before mentioned; for in that they give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, Why they could not do what the <hi>Western Bishops</hi> desired, <hi>because they brought not with them the consent of the Bishops, who remained at home to that purpose.</hi>

And concerning this only Council,</hi> viz. <hi>at</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, <hi>have we brought the consent of those Bishops which remain in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi> So that they looked on the consent of the other <hi>Bishops</hi> to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:101069:258"/>
as well as their own. But now, if we examine your <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> by this Rule, How far is it from any appearance of a <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil?</hi> What <hi>Bishops</hi> were there sent from the most of <hi>Christian Churches?</hi> Those that did appear, What equality and proportion was there among them? For Voices in <hi>General Councils</hi> ought not to go by the number of <hi>Bishops,</hi> but by the number of <hi>Churches</hi>; so that if <hi>six</hi> were sent from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> delivering the sense of that <hi>Church</hi> they come from, they have equal <hi>Votes</hi> with the greatest number of <hi>Italian Bishops.</hi> But here lay the great imposture of that <hi>Council</hi>; first, that the <hi>Councils</hi> being <hi>general,</hi> depended upon the <hi>Popes</hi> general <hi>Summons,</hi> though never so few <hi>Bishops</hi> appeared; next that the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> were to be carried by most <hi>Voices,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> to give their bare <hi>placet</hi>; these things being thus laid, when there was any fear that businesses would not go right, it was but the <hi>Legats</hi> using some art in delaying it, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence to <hi>Rome,</hi> and forty <hi>Bishops</hi> are made together, and posted to <hi>Trent,</hi> to help out the number of voices; and thus it was in the case of the <hi>Institution</hi> and <hi>Residence</hi> of <hi>Bishops:</hi> And this is that you call, a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council.</hi> 2. To your other, <hi>That what was wanting in number at first, was made up at last when all former Decrees were confirmed by a full number of Bishops</hi>; it is soon replied, That this is, as all the rest of the proceedings of that <hi>Council</hi> was,<note place="margin">Hist. Council of <hi>Trent. l.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 804.</note> but a meer <hi>Artifice.</hi> For it appears by the <hi>History</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> that in the last <hi>Session</hi> under <hi>Pius</hi> 4. a Proposition was made, that all the <hi>Decrees</hi> under <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> should be approved; which was opposed, because they said it would be a derogation to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of those times, if it should seem that the things then done had need of a new confirmation of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and would shew, that this and that was not all one, because none can confirm his own things. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>French Bishops</hi> earnest insisting upon it, it was determined <hi>simply to read them, and no more.</hi> And, Do you call this a <hi>confirming and ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them</hi> de novo? So that, for all appears by this last <hi>Session,</hi> the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of those <hi>Decrees,</hi> must, as far as concerns the <hi>Council,</hi> depend upon the number of the <hi>Bishops</hi> then present, which was but very small certainly for a <hi>General Council,</hi> there being not so many in most of the <hi>Sessions,</hi> as were in the <hi>Donatists Council</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi>; so far were they from the number of the ancient General Councils.</p>
               <p>But here comes your grand Objection in the way, <hi>That nothing is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by us against the Council of</hi> Trent,<note place="margin">¬ß. 13.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. n. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>which might not have been in effect as justly objected by the Arrians against the Council of</hi> Nice. But, Is not there easily discernable a vast disparity between these two, which way soever we conceive them? The one called by the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who in person sate in the <hi>Council,</hi> to prevent all disorders and clancular actions; the other by the <hi>Pope,</hi> who presided in it by his <hi>Legats,</hi> and ordered all things by his directions. In that of <hi>Nice,</hi> the <hi>Arrian Bishops</hi> were as freely admitted to debate, as any of the other; but it was far from being so at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> In the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> though <hi>Alexander</hi> was no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a party as to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> than the other <hi>Bishops</hi> (no more was <hi>Leo</hi> at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:101069:258"/>
never go about to parallel these two <hi>Councils</hi> with each other. Again, in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> all the <hi>Bishops</hi> came free, without any praeengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to maintain the party of <hi>Alexander</hi>; but the <hi>Bishops</hi> at <hi>Trent</hi> were all sworn to defend the <hi>Papal Interest.</hi> At <hi>Nice,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> themselves debated the matters in <hi>Controversie</hi>; at <hi>Trent,</hi> the <hi>Divines</hi> dispute, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> in their formalities give their <hi>Placet.</hi> At <hi>Nice,</hi> every one was freely heard, none died for grief of <hi>checks</hi> being given them for their too free speaking, as there did at <hi>Trent.</hi> And these, I hope, shew, there was much greater reason for the <hi>Protestants</hi> to except against the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> than for the <hi>Arrians</hi> against the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> And yet, besides all these grounds of disparity, those two remain good still, which his Lordship in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth in, <hi>viz.

                  <hi>that in condemning the Arrian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>grounded it self upon Tradition.</hi> But <hi>Theodoret</hi> sayes no such thing; only out of an <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> he sayes, <hi>When the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians objected that they used words not contained in Scripture, they gave them this Answer, that so did they too; but the words which they used, were such as their Fathers had used before them</hi>; and, Do you call this the grounding the condemnation of them upon <hi>Tradition?</hi> Yet, to do you right, I must suppose that either you took this upon trust, without searching <hi>Theodoret</hi>; or, if you did, you looked no further than <hi>Christophorsons Translation,</hi> which in things concerning the <hi>Papal Controversies,</hi> doth notoriously trip (to say no worse of it, as it were easie to manifest from several examples) but we need no more than this present.

But I find you so often tripping in your <hi>quotations,</hi> that where <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath been used by the <hi>Latin Interpreter,</hi> you very securely follow him in it; as in another place mentioned in this Chapter, where <hi>Christophorson</hi> renders <gap reason="foreign">

Thus you see, how vain your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is, of proving that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> grounded her definition on <hi>Tradition,</hi> as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> did, which is directly contrary to the advice of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the <hi>Proceedings</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> as his Lordship truly told you. To the second concerning the consent of the Church, you answer, <hi>That the like consent of the Church both is, and was, when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testans

first began.</hi> But, Will this reach to a <hi>Parity,</hi> if it were granted? for his Lordship speaks of the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in all ages, from the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> and <hi>Apostolical times.</hi> I pray, prove your <hi>Mass, Invocation of Saints, Worship of Images, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> by such a <hi>Consent</hi> as this, and then you may say, There is no such disparity between them: As to what you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> condemning the <hi>Quartodecimani</hi> for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> I know not where you will find it, I am sure <hi>Constantine</hi> is far from saying so in his <hi>Epistle</hi> perswading to union as to that matter. Cannot the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> appoint time to celebrate <hi>Easter?</hi> or determine, that those who come from <hi>Hereticks,</hi> shall not be <hi>rebaptized,</hi> but they must presently condemn all who do otherwise, for <hi>Hereticks?</hi> But you must be pardoned; you are proving a <hi>Parity</hi> between the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> and you know you could not do that sufficiently, unless they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all dissenters in any <hi>punctilio,</hi> for <hi>Hereticks.</hi>

                  <hi>the Pope having made himself a strong party in it; because there were more Italian Bishops there, than of all Christendom besides; yea more than double. For where the number of Prelates is expressed that had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage and vote in that Council, the Italians are set down to be a hundred eighty seven, and all the rest make but eighty three, so that there were more Italian Bishops by a hundred and four, than of all the rest of Christendom; sure</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Pope did not mean to be over-reached in this Council. And whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever became of his Infallibility otherwise, he might this way be sure to be Infallible in whatsoever he would have determined. And this without all doubt is all the Infallibility he hath.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 236.</note> To this you answer, <hi>That the Popes making a party, is disproved by the very argument he brings to assert it,</hi> viz. <hi>the multitude of Italian Prelates; for, Who knows not, that the Italians are more divided in point of Interest and Dependence, than in any other Nation of Christendom, by reason of the many Soveraign Principalities and States, into which</hi> Italy <hi>is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided?</hi> But, What is this to the purpose, unless you could prove that the <hi>Italian Prelates</hi> were so divided in point of <hi>Interest</hi> and dependence? Since therefore they have all their dependence on the <hi>Pope,</hi> and not on those <hi>Principalities</hi> in which they live; this evasion, though very sleight, is yet the best your cause would bear. And the greater you say, <hi>the number of Bishopricks</hi> is in <hi>Italy,</hi> the more friends, I hope, the <hi>Pope</hi> must make by disposing them; and, Could they do the <hi>Pope</hi> better service, than to help him in this grand business at <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein they sought to outvy each other by promoting the <hi>Popes Interest.</hi> But not only the <hi>Protestants</hi> complained of this, but the <hi>Emperour</hi> and other <hi>Princes,</hi> and all impartial men in <hi>Germany, France</hi>; nay, and in some part of <hi>Italy</hi> too. But here his Lordship encounters an Objection of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 220.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. that in the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>there were as few Bishops of the West present, as were of the East at</hi> Trent, and manifestly shews the great disparity between the the two <hi>Councils.</hi> 1. <hi>Because it is not a meer disparity in number which he insists on, but with it the Popes carriage, to be sure of a major part; but neither the Greek Church in general, nor any Patriarch of the East, had any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interest to look to, in the Council at</hi> Nice. 2. <hi>It was not so much a dispari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the Eastern and Western Bishops, but that there were so many more Italians and Bishops obnoxious to the Popes Power, than of all</hi> Germany, France, Spain, <hi>and of all other parts of the West besides.</hi> 3. <hi>Even in the comparison of those two Councils, as to Eastern and Western Bishops, there is this remarkable difference, that Pope</hi> Sylvester <hi>with</hi> 275. <hi>Bishops confirmed the Council at</hi> Nice,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:101069:259"/>
                  <hi>but the Council at</hi> Trent <hi>was never confirmed by any Council of Eastern Bishops.</hi> To the two first of these you Answer with your best property, <hi>silence.</hi> Only you would fain perswade some silly people (if there be any so weak in the world that enquire into such things) <hi>That the Pope had no private interest at</hi> Trent, <hi>but what was common to him with other Bishops.</hi> You should have done well to have commended the excellency of an <hi>implicite Faith,</hi> before you had uttered a thing so contrary to the sense of the whole Christian World. To the third you confess, <hi>It is some disparity, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, because if the Pope himself had ratified them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 237.</note> 
                  <hi>the Council would have had as much Authority as by that accessory Assembly.</hi> The more to blame was the <hi>Pope</hi> a great deal, for putting so many <hi>Bishops</hi> to so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a trouble. But you say further, <hi>This Council was not held just at the same time.</hi> But <hi>Binius</hi> tells you, it was held assoon as might be, after the notice of what was done at <hi>Nice</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>either in whole or in part, deserted the Faith defined at</hi> Nice, <hi>and embraced the</hi> Arrian <hi>Heresie.</hi> It seems then, the twelve good Articles of <hi>Trent</hi> have been more generally received by the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> then the <hi>eternal existence of the Son of God</hi>; and consequently, that you are more bound to believe the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> then that the <hi>Son is of the same substance with the Father:</hi> For your grounds of <hi>Faith</hi> being resolved into the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> you cannot believe that which hath been so much questioned in the <hi>Church,</hi> so firmly as that which hath been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally believed and constantly held. But the universal reception of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> by the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is so into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable a falshood, that you would scarce have vented it, unless it were your design to write for the <hi>Whetstone.</hi>

                  <hi>(or who might have agreed before the Council ended) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not admitted to a fair and free dispute.

                  <hi>That the Liberty of the Council was impeached chiefly by three causes: one, because every thing was first consulted of at</hi> Rome: <hi>another, because the Legats had assumed to themselves only the liberty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:101069:260"/>
which ought to be common to all: the third, because of the practises which some Prelats interested in the Greatness of the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>did make.</hi> The <hi>French Ambassadour, Monsieur de Lansac</hi> writ to the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Master, That the Pope was so much Master of this Council, that his Pensioners, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Emperours or we do remonstrate to them, will do but what they list.</hi> Several of the like nature might easily be produced, so that it is not his Lordship only is guilty of this <hi>want of charity</hi> (as you call it) but all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial persons, who were most acquainted with the <hi>Affairs</hi> of that <hi>Council.</hi> Whose judgement is certainly much more to be taken then such who have sworn to defend it. But you have an excellent Argument to prove the <hi>Council Free, because the Bishops of the Council continued in the Faith and Doctrine of it as long as they lived.</hi> And had they not good reason so to do, when they were sworn before hand to defend the <hi>Pope,</hi> and having se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him from danger of reformation by the <hi>Council,</hi> and subscribed the Decrees of it, they were as much bound to defend their own acts. And although it is well enough known what practises were used to bring off the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish Bishops</hi>; yet when they were brought off, what a shame would it have been for them to have revolted from their own <hi>Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi> But what is this to that General freedom which was desired by the <hi>Roman Catholick Princes</hi> for <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> and by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> both of the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Church?</hi> Was the <hi>Council</hi> any thing the more free, because that party which met there continued in what they had done? Just, as if a part of a <hi>Common-Council</hi> should suffer only such persons to come there whom they thought fit, and suffer nothing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, but what two or three of the leading men should propound, and yet this be call'd a free <hi>Common-Council,</hi> because they who were of it, did after they had done, persist in it?

Confession. After a long entercourse of letters, answers, and replies mutually continued for some years, and all Arguments used that might induce the Patriarch to receive them into his communion, he could not be courted to so much as the least shew of approving their Doctrine: but did in all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers clearly confirm the Tenets of the Roman Catholick Church, which those Lutherans endeavoured to overthrow. In so much, that the Patriarch tyred with their importunity, gave them a rebuke for their departure from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Catholick Church, and desired them not to trouble him any more with their writings.</hi> A very formal story! One would expect the next news should have been, that the <hi>Patriarch</hi> had come to kiss his <hi>Holiness's feet,</hi> or at least subscribed to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> But all your stories out of the <hi>East</hi> have not so much <hi>truth</hi> as <hi>formality</hi> in them: witness one for all, that solemn <hi>legation</hi> from <hi>Gabriel Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to <hi>Pope Clement</hi> 8, wherein an acknowledgement was made of the <hi>Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> as <hi>Head of the Church</hi>; upon which, such joy was conceived at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Baronius</hi> unmeasurably triumphs upon it, and sayes, it tends as much to the joy of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as to the confusion of <hi>Hereticks:</hi> and therefore hath very solemnly published the <hi>Legation</hi> it self; at the end of the sixth <hi>Tome</hi> of his <hi>Annals</hi>; but upon a further examination of it, it was all found to be a meer fiction and imposture of one <hi>Barton,</hi> as both <hi>Thuanus</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas √† Jesu</hi> confess.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Primum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triar. Resp. p.</hi> 1.9.</note> and other more general points, <hi>viz. That the Sacrament was to be received in both kinds, that the use of marriage was not to be absolutely forbidden the Clergy,</hi> though their custom is, that they must be married before they take Orders; besides the grand Articles of the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Churches Infallibility</hi>; Doth he that joyns with them in these things not in the least approve their Doctrine, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the <hi>Tenets</hi> of the <hi>Roman Catholick Church?</hi> But withall, it must be confessed, that besides that common Article of the <hi>Procession of the Spirit,</hi> wherein he disputes most earnestly; there are five others, in which they dissented from each other, <hi>about Free will, justification by Faith, the number of Sacraments, Invocation of Saints, and Monastick life,</hi> and about these the remaining disputes were. In some of which it is easie to discern how far the right state of the question was from being apprehended, which the <hi>Lutheran Divines</hi> perceiving sent him a larger and fuller explication of their mind in a <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi>; but the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> troubles coming on, <hi>Cantacuzenus</hi> deposing him too, and other businesses taking him off upon his <hi>restauration,</hi> he breaks off the Conference between them. But although he differed from them in these things, yet he was far enough from rebuking them for departing from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> although he was desirous they should have joyned with them in the approbation of such things as were in <hi>use</hi> among themselves. And in those things in which he seems to plead for some practises in <hi>use</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> yet there are many considerable circumstances about them, wherein they differ from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as hath been manifested by many others. As in the Article of <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> saith, <hi>They do not properly Invocate Saints but God, for neither</hi> Peter <hi>nor</hi> Paul <hi>do hear us,</hi> upon which ground it is impossible to maintain the <hi>Romish Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Invocation</hi> of
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:101069:261"/>
                  <hi>Saints.</hi> And in most of the other, the main difference lies in the want of a true <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Questions</hi> between them. But is this any such great matter of admiration, that the <hi>Patriarch</hi> upon the first sight of their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> should declare his dissent from them in these things? It is well enough known, how much <hi>Barbarism</hi> had crept into the Greek Church after their being subdued by the <hi>Turks,</hi> the means of <hi>Instruction</hi> being taken from them, and it being very rare at that time to have any <hi>Sermons</hi> at all, in so much, that one of your <hi>Calogeri</hi> being more learned then the rest, and preaching there in Lent, was thereby under great suspicion, and at last was by the <hi>Patriarch</hi> himself sent out of the way. It is therefore more to be wondered they should preserve so much of the Doctrine of Faith entire as they have done, then that any corrupt practises should prevail amongst them. The most then, which you can make of the judgement of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Hieremias,</hi> is, that in some things he was opposite to the <hi>Protestants,</hi> as in others to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But what would you have said, if any <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had declared his consent so fully with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Patriarch Cyril</hi> did afterwards with the <hi>Protestants?</hi> who on that account suffered so much by the practises of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> of whom he complains in his Epistle to <hi>Vtenbogard.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How far this tends to the ending Controversies. Two distinct Questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Infallibility, and Authority of General Councils. The first entered upon, with the state of the Question. That there can be no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faith that General Councils are infallible; nor that the particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of any of them are so: which are largely proved. <hi>Pighius</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the Divine Institution of General Councils. The places of Scripture considered, which are brought for the Churches infallibility, and that these cannot prove that General Councils are so; <hi>Matth. 18.20. Acts 15.28.</hi> particularly answered. The sense of the Fathers in their high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the decrees of Councils. No consent of the Church as to their infallibility. The place of St. <hi>Austin</hi> about the amendment of former General Councils by latter, at large vindicated. No other places in S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> prove them infallible, but many to the contrary. General Councils cannot be infallible in the conclusion, if not in the use of the means. No such infallibility, without as immediate a revelation as the Prophets and Apostles had: taking Infallibility not for an absolute unerring power, but such as comes by a promise of Divine Assistance preserving from errour. No obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to internal assent, but from immediate Divine Authority. Of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency of Faith and reason in things propounded to be believed. The suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of the contrary Doctrine to the Romanists principles.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F high pretences and large promises were the only things,<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> which we ought to value any <hi>Church</hi> for, there were none comparable to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For there can be nothing imagined amiss in the <hi>Christian world,</hi> but, if we believe the bills her <hi>Factours</hi> set up, she hath an <hi>Infallible cure</hi> for it. If any enquire into the grounds of <hi>Religion,</hi> they tell us, that her testimony only can give them <hi>Infallible Certainty</hi>; if any are afraid of mistaking in opinions, they have the only <hi>Infallible Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies</hi> to go to; if any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the rents and divisions of the Christian world, they have <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:101069:263"/>
Councils</hi> either to prevent or heal them. Who then would not run into the bosom of such a <hi>Church</hi> as this, with whom there is nothing but what is <hi>Infallible?</hi> Who but <hi>Scepticks, Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> would keep out of her communion? for what is there, men can desire more in a <hi>Church</hi> then she hath, where every thing is so <hi>Infallible? Faith</hi> is <hi>Infallible, Tradition Infallible,</hi> the <hi>Church Infallible,</hi> the <hi>Pope Infallible, General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Infallible,</hi> and what not? But who are there that more cheat and deceive the world, then those <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> who pretend to the most <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible cures?</hi> For, what is wanting in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> must be helped out with the greater <hi>confidence</hi>; and so we shall find it to be in these <hi>Infallible pretenders,</hi> who fall short in nothing more then where they lay the highest claim to <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Thus we have already manifested, that none have more weakened <hi>Faith,</hi> then such who have given out, that they only could make it <hi>Infallibly certain,</hi> none have brought more <hi>errours</hi> then that <hi>Church</hi> which arrogates to her self, that she is <hi>Infallible</hi>; it now remains, that we discover that nothing is further from promoting the <hi>Churches peace,</hi> then this present pretence of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils.</hi> For the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Controversies</hi> was the occasion of this dispute; but this dispute it self hath caused more. And will do so, as long as men desire to see reason for what they do. For it cannot be expected, that men should yield their judgements up to the decrees of every such combination of men as shall call it self a <hi>General Council,</hi> unless it be evidently proved, that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should erre in those <hi>decrees.</hi> Where there be no other wayes found out for the ending some great <hi>Controversies</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but by a free and <hi>General Council,</hi> all wise men will value the <hi>Churches peace</hi> so far as not to oppose the <hi>determinations</hi> of it; it being the highest <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> hath. But there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a submission for peace sake, in those things which are not contrary to the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the assent of the mind to all the <hi>Decrees</hi> of such a <hi>Council</hi> as in themselves are <hi>Infallible.</hi> For, supposing them sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errour, yet if that errour be not such as doth over-weigh the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>authority</hi> of it may be so great as to bind men to a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to them. But where they challenge an <hi>internal assent</hi> by vertue of such <hi>decrees,</hi> there must be first proved an <hi>impossibility</hi> of <hi>erring</hi> in them, before any can look on themselves as obliged to give it. And while men contend about this, that which was mainly aimed at, is lost by these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which is the <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> For it is a most fond and unreasonable thing, to suppose, there may not be as great divisions in the world, about the wayes to end <hi>Controversies</hi> as any other. Nay it is apparent, that the greatest <hi>Controversies</hi> this day in the Christian world are upon this Subject. It is not therefore any high challenge of <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> in any <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> which must put an end to <hi>Controversies</hi>; for nothing but <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> can ever do it, and the more men pretend to unreasonable wayes of deciding them, instead of ending <hi>one</hi> they beget <hi>many.</hi> For the higher the pretences are, the more all wise men are apt to suspect them, and to require the more clear and pregnant evidence for what they say; and if they fail in that, they have reason to question their <hi>Integrity</hi> much more then if they had contented themselves with more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate claims. For it is not saying <hi>Councils are infallible,</hi> will make men yield the sooner to their determinations, unless you first convince their reason by proving that they are so. But if you aim at nothing but the <hi>Churches peace,</hi> you might save your selves this labour; perswade men to be
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:101069:263"/>
                  <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>humble, sober</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> and I dare promise you the <hi>Church</hi> shall be more at quiet, than if you could prove all the <hi>Councils</hi> in the world to be <hi>Infallible.</hi> For, will that ever put a stop to the contentious <hi>Spirits</hi> of men? will that alter their tempers, or make them delight in those things which are contrary to them? No, you only offer to apply that <hi>Physick</hi> to the foreheads of men which should be <hi>taken inwards</hi>; if you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to promote true <hi>piety</hi> and a <hi>Christian Spirit</hi> in the world, that would tend more to the <hi>Churches peace</hi> then all your <hi>contests</hi> about the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils.</hi> But since you are resolved to <hi>contend,</hi> the nature of my task requires me to follow you, which I shall more chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, because, in pretence at least, it is for <hi>peace sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is then the first of those particular Controversies which this last part is designed for the handling of, and which in the consequence of it,<note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> brings in many of those particular <hi>errours,</hi> which we charge your <hi>Church</hi> with. In handling of which, I must (as I have hitherto done) confine my self to those <hi>lines</hi> you have drawn for me to direct my course by. Only in this first, to prevent that confusion and tediousness which your discourse is subject to, I find it necessary to alter the method somewhat. For there being two distinct <hi>Questions</hi> treated of, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether <hi>General Councils be Infallible?</hi> and supposing them not <hi>Infallible,</hi> How far they are to be submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to? You have intermixed these two so together, that it will easily puzzle the Reader to see which of them it is you discourse of. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I must confess his Lordship hath gone before you in it, as his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of entring into it required, yet now the points coming to be more fully examined, it will be the most natural and easie method to handle them apart, and to begin first with that of <hi>Infallibility</hi>; for the other sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the denial of it, it ought to follow the reasons which are given for that denial. But although I thus transpose your method, I assure you it is not with an intention to skip over any thing material, but I shall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily resume the debate of it in its proper place. In your entrance into this dispute, you give us very little hopes of any great advantage is like to come by it, because, upon your principles, it is impossible we should agree about the requisites to a <hi>General Council</hi>; for his Lordship wishing <hi>that a lawful General Council were called to end Controversies,</hi> you presently say,<note place="margin">P. 222.</note> 
                  <hi>A pure one to be sure, if according to his wish.</hi> Yes, too pure a great deal for you, to be willing to be tryed by. And when his Lordship professes,<note place="margin">P. 240.</note> 
                  <hi>That an easie General General Council shall satisfie him, that is lawfully called, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and ended according to the same course, and under the same conditions, which General Councils observed in the Primitive Church:</hi> You say, <hi>It is too general to be Ingenuous</hi>; you mean, such a <hi>Council</hi> would be too <hi>General</hi> for your purpose; for, you are resolved in your following words, <hi>not to yield to such a Council wherein all excommunicate Bishops, Hereticks and Schismaticks are not excluded</hi>; which is, in short, to tell us, You are resolved to account none <hi>General Councils,</hi> but such as are wholly of your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y, in which the <hi>Pope</hi> shall sit as <hi>Judge,</hi> Who are admitted, and Who not; though this be as contrary to sense and reason, as it is to the practice of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> in those <hi>Councils</hi> which were then called. In which I have already proved, that the <hi>Pope</hi> did not sit as <hi>President.</hi> And, as long as you hold to such unreasonable conditions, it evidently appears, That your discourses of <hi>General Councils,</hi> are meerly <hi>delusory</hi>; and, to use your own words, <hi>Such a General Council as you would have, is a meer nothing</hi> (as to a general and free Council), <hi>an empty name to amuse silly people with</hi>;
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:101069:264"/>
for, you require such conditions in order to it, as are destructive both to the freedom, and Being of a <hi>General Council.</hi> If therefore it be true, which you say, <hi>That morally speaking such a General Council, as Protestants would have, is impossible to be had</hi>; it is much more true, that such a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council</hi> as you would have, it is most unreasonable we should submit to. For, as long as you condemn all other <hi>Bishops,</hi> but those of your own,<note place="margin">P. 214.</note> 
                  <hi>Church for out-laws, and desertors of the Catholick Church</hi>; and give no other reason for it, but because you say so; we thereby see, How absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly averse you are from any <hi>Free Council,</hi> and that without any shew of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, you condemn all others but your selves, without suffering them to plead for themselves in an <hi>Indifferent Council,</hi> where both parties may be equally heard. But it was wisely said of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> 7. that <hi>General Councils are very dangerous, when the Popes Authority is called in Question</hi>; and this you know well enough; for, if a <hi>Free Council</hi> were held, the <hi>Pope</hi> himself might be found with his party to be the greatest <hi>out-laws and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of the truly Catholick Church.</hi> But in such pack'd <hi>Councils,</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi> sits as <hi>President,</hi> and orders all by his <hi>Legats,</hi> I shall desire you once more to ruminate over your own words; <hi>What Rebel would ever be found criminal, if he might be allowed to be his own Judge?</hi> But of such a kind of <hi>Council</hi> as you would have, I have spoken sufficiently in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent chapter. That which we are now upon, is not the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> but the <hi>Thesis,</hi> in which we are to enquire, <hi>Whether such a General Council as you suppose, be Infallible or no?</hi> His Lordship maintains the negative, and you the affirmative. Your Opinion then is, <hi>That the Decrees of a General Council confirmed by the Pope, are Infallible, and that the holding of this, is a piece of Catholick Faith; and that it secures all the members of the Church from erring in any matter of Faith.</hi> For you say, <hi>It is not</hi> de fide, <hi>that the Pope without a Council is Infallible; but, that Pope and Council together are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> you all along above assert to be so; and <hi>that the Decrees of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils fall nothing short in point of certainty of the Scripture it self; and that the contrary opinion does actually expose and abandon all the adherents to it, to an unevitable wavering and uncertainty in Faith.</hi> These are your own words, in several places which I have laid together, the better to discern the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Question.</hi> The main thing then whereon the use of <hi>General Councils</hi> depends being, <hi>that this must be believed to be</hi> de fide, <hi>in order to the certainty of mens Faith, and prevention of errours</hi>; that I may the better shew, how insignificant all this pretext of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> is, I shall first prove from your own principles, that this cannot be <hi>de fide,</hi> and then examine the <hi>grounds</hi> you insist on for the proof of their <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note>I begin with the <hi>First,</hi> which will sufficiently demonstrate, to how little purpose you talk of this <hi>Infallibility of Councils,</hi> for preventing <hi>uncertainty of Faith,</hi> when you cannot have any <hi>certainty of Faith</hi> at all as to that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which must prevent it. For, supposing that really <hi>General Councils are Infallible,</hi> if you cannot give me any reasons to believe that they are so, their Decrees can have no power over my understanding, to oblige me to assent to them. And since you say, this principle must be held <hi>de fide,</hi> if there be no foundation at all for such an <hi>assent of Faith</hi> to it, I must needs be <hi>uncertain,</hi> whatever the Decrees of those <hi>Councils</hi> be upon your own principles. If you require an assent to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> as <hi>Infallible,</hi> there must be an antecedent assent to this Proposition, <hi>That whatsoever Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils decree, is Infallible:</hi> As I cannot assent to any thing as <hi>Infallible,</hi> which
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:101069:264"/>
is contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> unless I first assent to this, That the <hi>Scripture it self is Infallible.</hi> If I therefore prove from your own principles, that none can have an assent of <hi>Faith</hi> to this Proposition, <hi>That whatever General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils decree, is Infallible,</hi> then all your discourse comes to nothing, and men can have no more certainty by their Decrees, than if they were not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. And this I shall prove by these things; 1. <hi>That you can have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Faith</hi> (I must use your own terms) <hi>That the Decrees of General Councils in the general are Infallible.</hi> 2. <hi>That you can have no such certainty as to the Decrees of any General Council in particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That you cannot in the general have any certainty of Faith as to the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of General Councils.</hi> For, 1. What <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> have you for this, without which, you say, No <hi>certainty of Faith</hi> is to be had? It is not enough for you to say, That the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> you produce, are an <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> for it: for that were to make the <hi>Scripture</hi> the sole <hi>Judge</hi> of this great <hi>Controversie,</hi> which you deny to be the <hi>sole Judge</hi> of any: And we must consider this as a <hi>present Controversie,</hi> which divides the <hi>Church, Whether General Councils be Infallible or no</hi>; In order to the ending which Controversie, we desire you to assign the way to it; for, you tell us, you have the only <hi>Infallible Way</hi> of putting an end to <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies.</hi> Shew us therefore, which way this must be ended in the first place? Not by <hi>Scripture,</hi> for that were to come wholly over to us; and if it may decide this Controversie, it may as well all others. Who must then? The <hi>Pope?</hi> That cannot be, for we are not bound to believe him <hi>Infallible,</hi> but only with a <hi>General Council,</hi> as you tell us often. Must every one judge it by his <hi>reason?</hi> No, this is the <hi>private Spirit,</hi> and would leave all to <hi>uncertainties.</hi> What then must do it? the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> together? But that is it we are enquiring for, Whether we are to believe <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> or no: And then the reason is, we must believe them, because they say so. And, Can any thing be more ridiculous, than for you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are to be believed for <hi>themselves,</hi> and to assert, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> are to be believed for themselves? If the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> then should declare their Decrees <hi>Infallible,</hi> On what account are we bound to believe them to be so? You have found it then an excellent way for ending all other <hi>Controversies</hi> that are so far to seek for ending this; which you cannot possibly do, without renouncing some of your principles, or an apparent contradiction. But besides this, 2. Your very manner of asserting the Infallibility of <hi>General Councils,</hi> destroyes all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of <hi>Faith</hi> concerning it. For, you say, That <hi>Councils</hi> are not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> unless they <hi>be confirmed by the Pope:</hi> which, to the apprehension of any reasonable man, is, <hi>that they are not in and of themselves Infallible,</hi> but by vertue of the <hi>Popes</hi> confirmation. And therefore to say that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> are <hi>Infallible,</hi> and then make that <hi>Infallibility</hi> depend upon the <hi>Popes Confirmation,</hi> is meerly delusory: for, you may as well say, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Provincial Councils</hi> are <hi>Infallible.</hi> For, Doth the Decree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any <hi>Infallibility</hi> from the <hi>Council,</hi> or not? If it doth, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is <hi>Infallible,</hi> whether the <hi>Pope</hi> confirm it or no: If it doth not, then the <hi>Infallibility</hi> is wholly in the <hi>Pope:</hi> And he may as well make a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Council</hi> Infallible, as a <hi>General.</hi> But, suppose it be some promise which helps the <hi>Pope</hi> in a <hi>General Council,</hi> which doth not in a lesser (though there be no reason for that, for he is <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in one as well as in the other) yet you cannot have any <hi>certainty of Faith,</hi> that the <hi>Council</hi> is <hi>Infallible.</hi> For, you say, The <hi>Popes</hi> Confirmation is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

to make it <hi>Infallible,</hi> but that the <hi>Pope</hi> may <hi>infallibly confirm</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> is no <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> can be none.

Besides, set aside this <hi>over-awing</hi> by some potent person, suppose some active and subtil men perceiving how things are like to go in a <hi>Council,</hi> use their wits to bring off some men, not of so deep reach as others, to their own <hi>party,</hi> and it may be by the <hi>accession</hi> of a small number, they <hi>over-vote</hi> the rest; Must we presently say, That the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> went off with those few men to the other <hi>party?</hi> for the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> going by <hi>Votes,</hi> and those <hi>Votes</hi> by the <hi>major part</hi>; Who doth not see, how easie it is (when it stands, it may be, upon a few Votes) to fetch off a number to the other side. And I do not know, where the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath promised, that where <hi>three or four men</hi> may so much alter the Decrees of a <hi>General Council,</hi> those <hi>Decrees,</hi> if they pass the <hi>major part,</hi> shall be <hi>infallible,</hi> and as <hi>certain</hi> as the <hi>Scripture.</hi> To be sure then, there ought to be great <hi>confidence</hi> of the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Councils</hi> proceedings where a man must <hi>assent</hi> to them as <hi>Infallible:</hi> and to that end men must be assured that they came thither without any <hi>prejudice</hi> upon their minds; that when they were there, they sought nothing but the <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; or else, to be sure, <hi>they are not gathered in his name,</hi> and if not so, they cannot expect <hi>he should be in the midst of them.</hi> Now let any one who understands the world, and humane nature, see if he can perswade himself, that a <hi>Council</hi> can have no <hi>prejudices</hi> or <hi>by-ends</hi> upon them, that nothing of <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>reputation,</hi> may sway upon them when they are met there, that there shall be no <hi>heats</hi> or <hi>contentions</hi> among them; for if there be, let him then see, Whether he can believe them to be <hi>Infallible?</hi> If you say, <hi>In a matter so highly concerning the Church, the Spirit of God will not suffer them to erre:</hi> You must first shew, where the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath promised this; and then, if you could, that those promises do not suppose the performance of some <hi>conditions,</hi> which if they neglect, they may want the effect of them. In which case, there can be no greater assurance of the <hi>Spirit's presence,</hi> than there is of performance of the <hi>conditions,</hi> which is the thing I now aim at.

If the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cannot put an end to Controversies on that account, how can <hi>General Councils</hi> do it? when their <hi>decrees</hi> are as lyable to a <hi>private sense</hi> and <hi>wrong interpretation</hi> as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are: Nay much more, for we have many other places to compare, the help of <hi>original tongues,</hi> and the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> to understand <hi>Scriptures</hi> by: when the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> are many times purposely framed in general terms, and with ambiguous expressions to give satisfaction to some dissenting parties then in the <hi>Council.</hi> Who knows not, what disputes have been raised about the sense of some of the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi> about which the several parties neither are, nor are like to be, agreed. Nay, Who is so unacquainted with the proceedings of that <hi>Council,</hi> as not to understand how much care was taken in many of the <hi>decrees</hi> to pass them in such general terms, that each party might find their sense in them. How fearful were they of declaring themselves, for fear of disobliging a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular party? and are these the effects of an <hi>Infallible Spirit?</hi> Since we know it hath been thus in some <hi>Councils,</hi> Who dares venture his <hi>faith,</hi> it hath not been so in others? Who dare be confident, this or that is the meaning of such a <hi>Decree,</hi> when it may be capable of several senses? Was it a sign, that <hi>Council</hi> was <hi>Infallible,</hi> that was afraid to speak out in a case of great consequence and necessity in the <hi>Church?</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> I mean, in determining, <hi>That due honour be given to Images,</hi> without assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what that <hi>due honour</hi> was, which was the most needful of all to be done. If the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> were not <hi>ambiguous,</hi> what mean so many <hi>disputes</hi> still about them as are in the world? And when at last, you say, <hi>That the Councils are Infallible when the Pope confirms them,</hi> you say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then if we should say, <hi>That Councils are Infallible when Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture confirms them.</hi> Nay, you say nothing near so much; for all are agreed, that <hi>Scriptures are Infallible,</hi> but many among your selves are far from believing, that the <hi>Pope is Infallible.</hi> And therefore we are much nearer ending Controversies, in saying, <hi>Councils confirmed by Scripture are Infallible,</hi> than you are in saying, <hi>Councils confirmed by the Pope are so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things being thus in the <hi>General</hi> premised, we come now to the particular handling this Controversie between his Lordship and you.<note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> And for the greater clearness of proceeding, he premises some things by way of consideration; whereof the first is, <hi>That all the power an Oecumenical Council hath to determine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 228 <hi>sect.</hi> 33.</note> 
                  <hi>and all the assistance it hath, not to err in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, is all from the Vniversal Body of the Church, whose representative it is. For the Government of the Church being not Monarchical, but as Christ is head, this principle is inviolable in nature; Every body collective, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents, receives power and priviledges, from the body which is represented, else a representation might have force without the thing it represents; which cannot be. So, there is no power in the Council, no assistance to it, but what is in and to the Church.</hi> But withall his Lordship adds, <hi>That the representative body cannot be so free from errour as the whole Church, because in all such assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies many able and sufficient men being left out, they which are present may
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:101069:266"/>
miss or misapply that reason and ground upon which the determination is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to rest. By which means the representative body may err, whereas the represented, by vertue of those members which saw and knew the ground, may hold the principle inviolated.</hi> All the Answer which you return to this, is, <hi>That his supposition of the Churches not being Monarchical, is confuted already,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 245.</note> (and I say, whatever you have produced is Answered already) <hi>and that the power and assistance of General Councils cannot possibly be communicated to them by the Church, but must proceed from the same fountain now, it did in the Apostles time,</hi> viz. <hi>the direction of the Holy Ghost; this spiritual power not being of humane, but divine Institution; and not proceeding so much from the abilities of the persons, as from the co-operation of the Holy Spirit with them.</hi> To which I reply, that all this had need be more then thus barely asserted: it being confessed by your selves (as his Lordship shews) that a <hi>General Council</hi> is a <hi>representative</hi> of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> you ought to have shewed us the <hi>Divine Institution</hi> of this <hi>Representative,</hi> and the promises made to it under that notion, or else we may still say with his Lordship, That all the power and assistance it hath, is by vertue of that body which it represents. But I need not in this urge the Arguments of <hi>Protestants</hi> against you; for in this, as in most other Controversies, we have enough from those of your own party to oppose against these affirmations of yours. For <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> not only asserts, but proves, that <hi>General Councils are not of divine, but humane institution, arising from a dictate of right reason;</hi>

                  <hi>that matters of doubt may be better debated by many prudent and experienced persons then by a few. So that as the supream authority for administration of affairs belongs to one, so it is most agreeable to right reason, that debates should be by many,</hi> This he proves at large, that nothing but <hi>humane reason</hi> is the foundation of <hi>Councils</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi>; for, saith he, <hi>In Scripturis Canonicis nullum de iis verbum est; nec ex Apostolorum institutione, speciale quicquam de illis accepit illa primitiva Christi Ecclesia. There is not a word of them in Scripture, neither did the primitive Church receive any particular order from the Apostles concerning them:</hi> which he from thence proves, because in all the time of the <hi>primitive Church</hi> till the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all of them. And at that time it did not receive any <hi>new revelation</hi> concerning the celebrating <hi>General Councils,</hi> but the <hi>Emperour Constantines</hi> zeal for the peace of the <hi>Church</hi> was the first cause and original of them. From whence he concludes that they have no supernatural or divine <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, sed prorsus humanam, but altogether humane:</hi> for they are, saith he, <hi>The invention of</hi> Constantine <hi>sometimes useful, but not at all necessary.</hi> This man speaks intelligibly, and not like those who jumble <hi>Pope and Council</hi> together to make something <hi>Infallible</hi> between them. For he sayes, <hi>It is the better way by far to go immediately to the Apostolical See and consult that, as the Infallible Oracle, in all doubts of Faith.</hi> And very honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us, <hi>That he believes</hi> Constantine <hi>was ignorant of that priviledge of the Holy See, when he first instituted General Councils.</hi> Than which nothing could be spoken truer. If you have then nothing more to say for the <hi>Divine Institution</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> then what you have acquainted us with, it would be much more wisedom in you to contend with <hi>Pighius</hi> for the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> and let that of <hi>General Councils</hi> shift for it self.</p>
               <p>His Lordships second Consideration you admit of, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>That though the Act which is hammered out by many together, must needs be perfecter, then that which is but the child of one mans sufficiency; yet this cannot be Infallible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be from some special assistance of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Therefore omitting
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:101069:267"/>
your very impertinent addition to this consideration, <hi>viz. So as to make its Decrees Infallible,</hi> (which is the thing in question): We proceed to the third; which is, <hi>That the Assistance of the Holy Ghost is without errour, which (saith he) is no question;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 230.</note> 
                  <hi>and as little that a Council hath it. But the doubt that troubles, is, whether all assistance of the Holy Ghost be afforded in such a high manner, as to cause all the definitions of a Council in matters fundamental in the Faith, and in remote deductions from it, to be alike Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi> From this last expression you would very subtilly infer contrary to his Lordships design, <hi>That he granted General Councils to be Infallible in deductions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>as well as fundamentals, but not to be alike Infallible:</hi> whereas it is plain, his Lordship means no more by <hi>alike Infallible,</hi> then, Whether the assistance be <hi>alike</hi> in both to make them <hi>Infallible.</hi> And this you might easily perceive, but it would have prevented your cavil about <hi>a graduated Infallibility</hi>; which I know none assert but your self. This Consideration brings on the main of the battel, in those <hi>texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which are most insisted on to prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> viz. <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>I will send you the Spirit of Truth and he shall lead you into all Truth.</hi> John 14.16. <hi>This Spirit shall abide with you for ever.</hi> Matth. 28.20. <hi>Behold I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> Matth. 16.18. <hi>The founding of the Church upon the Rock against which the gates of hell shall not prevail.</hi> Luke 22.32. <hi>Christs prayer for St.</hi> Peter, <hi>that his Faith should not fail.</hi> Matth. 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, I will be in the midst of them.</hi> Acts 15.28. <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us.</hi> All which places (except the two last) have been already examined as far as concerns any promise of <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the questions concerning the <hi>Churches</hi> and the <hi>Popes Infallibility</hi>: and there being no reason at all given, why any <hi>Infallibility</hi> at all is promised by them to the <hi>Church</hi> after the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, it may seem wholly needless to bestow a particular consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration again upon all of them. For it is evident in those places, all your drift and design, is only to prove a promise of <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and to the <hi>Councils</hi> only by vertue of that. But having at large before shewed, that no such thing can be inferred from these or any other places, that which is built upon it, is wholly taken away too. For the only pretence that you have, why <hi>Councils</hi> should be proved hence In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, is, because the <hi>Church</hi> hath <hi>Infallibility</hi> promised by these texts, which must be very well proved, and much better then you have done, either here, or elsewhere, before the other can be deduced from hence. And yet supposing I should grant, that <hi>Infallibility</hi> was promised to the <hi>Church,</hi> I see no such necessary consequence from thence, that <hi>General Councils</hi> must be <hi>Infallible:</hi> unless you can prove from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is meant of the <hi>Church representative</hi> and not <hi>diffusive</hi>; which is a new task which you have not yet undertaken. For it is not enough to say,<note place="margin">P. 254.</note> 
                  <hi>That the body of the Church is bound to believe and profess the doctrine taught by the representative, and therefore the representative must be Infallible,</hi> unless you could first prove, that there is a necessity of some continued Infallible teaching by the <hi>Church representative</hi>: which I despair of ever seeing done. I am so far therefore from thinking as you do, <hi>That these texts are sufficiently clear in themselves to prove the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of General Councils,</hi> that I believe a <hi>Philosopher</hi> might hear them repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a hundred times over without ever imagining any such thing as a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council,</hi> much less concluding thence, that they are Infallible. But because you again cavil with another expression of his Lordships, in that
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:101069:267"/>
he saith, <hi>That no one of them doth infer, much less inforce Infallibility</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 246.</note> from whence you not <hi>infer but inforce</hi> this consequence, <hi>that he was loath to say all of them together did not</hi>; I shall therefore give you his Lordships An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer from all of them together. Which is likewise sufficient for every one of them. <hi>And for all the places together, saith he, weigh them with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 239.</note> 
                  <hi>and either they speak of the Church (including the Apostles) as all of them do; and then all grant the voyce of the Church is Gods voyce Divine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Or else they are general unlimited, and appliable to private assemblies as well as General Councils, which none grant to be Infallible, but some mad Enthusiasts. Or else they are limited, not simply to all truth, but all necessary to salvation; in which I shall easily grant a General Council cannot err, suffering it self to be led by this Spirit of Truth in Scripture, and not taking upon it to lead both the Scripture and the Spirit. For, suppose these places or any other did promise assistance even to Infallibility, yet they granted it not to every General Council, but to the Catholick body of the Church it self, and if it be in the whole Church principally, then is it in a General Council but by consequent, as the Council represents the whole. And that which belongs to a thing by consequent, doth not otherwise, nor longer, belong unto it, then it consents and cleaves to that, upon which it is a consequent. And therefore a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil hath not this assistance, but as it keeps to the whole Church and Spouse of Christ, whose it is to hear his Word and determine by it. And therefore if a General Council will go out of the Churches way, it may easily go without the Churches truth.</hi> Which words of his, contain so full an Answer to all these places together, that till that be taken off there is no necessity at all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the particular places, especially those which are acknowledged by your selves to speak primarily of the <hi>Churches Infallibility.</hi>

               <p>Yet for your satisfaction (more than any <hi>intelligent Readers</hi>) I shall add somewhat further, to shew the impertinency of the former places,<note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> and then consider the force of the two last, which have not yet been handled.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There can be nothing drawn from promises made to the diffusive body, for the benefit of the representative, unless the maker of those promises did institute that representation.</hi> Therefore, supposing that Infallibility were by these promises bestowed upon the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> yet you cannot thence inferr that it belongs to a <hi>General Council,</hi> unless you prove that Christ did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a <hi>General Council</hi> to represent the <hi>Church,</hi> and in that <hi>representation to be Infallible.</hi> For this <hi>Infallibility</hi> coming meerly by <hi>promise,</hi> it belongs only to those to whom the <hi>promise</hi> is made, and in that capacity in which it is made to it. For, <hi>Spiritual gifts</hi> are not bequeathable to <hi>Heirs,</hi> nor can be made over to <hi>Assigns</hi>; if the <hi>Church</hi> be promised <hi>Infallibility,</hi> she cannot pass away the gift of it to her <hi>Assigns</hi> in a <hi>General Council,</hi> unless that power of devolution be contained in the <hi>Original Grant.</hi> For she can give no more then is in her power to bestow; but this <hi>Infallibility</hi> being out of her disposal, the utmost that can be given to a <hi>General Council</hi> is a power to <hi>oblige</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>acts</hi> of it, which falls much short of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi> Besides, this <hi>representation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by a <hi>General Council</hi> is a thing not so evident from whence it should come, that from a <hi>promise</hi> made to one it must necessarily be understood of the other. For, as <hi>Pighius</hi> sayes, <hi>It cannot be demonstrated from Theological grounds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>that a General Council which is so far from being the whole Church, that it is not a thousandth part of it, should represent the whole Church. For either,</hi> saith he, <hi>it hath this from Christ or from the Church: but they cannot produce one tittle from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, where Christ hath conveyed over the power and authority of the whole
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:101069:268"/>
Church to a hundred or two hundred Bishops. If they say, It is from the Church; there are two things to be shewed, first, that it is done; and secondly, that it is</hi> de jure <hi>or ought to be so done.</hi> First, it can never be shewed, that such a thing ever was done by the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi>; for if it were, it must either be by some <hi>formal act</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> or by a <hi>tacit consent.</hi> It could not be by any <hi>formal act</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; For then there must be some such act of the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> preceding the being of any <hi>General Council</hi>; for by that act they receive their Commission to appear in behalf of the <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church.</hi> And this could not be done in a <hi>General Council,</hi> because that is not pretended to be the <hi>whole Church</hi> but only to <hi>represent it:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must have this power to represent the <hi>Church</hi> by something antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to its being. Else it would only arrogate this power to it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any act of the <hi>Church</hi> in order to it. Now that the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> did ever agree in any such act, is utterly impossible to be demonstrated, either that it could be, or that it was. Yet such a <hi>delegation</hi> to a <hi>General Council</hi> must be supposed in order to its <hi>representation</hi> of the whole <hi>Church</hi>; and this <hi>delegation</hi> must not only be before the first <hi>General Council,</hi> but, for all that I can see, before every one. For how can the <hi>Church</hi> by its act in one age bind the <hi>Church</hi> in all ages succeeding to the <hi>acts</hi> of those sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Councils</hi> which shall be chosen afterwards? If it be said, <hi>That such a formal act is not necessary, but the tacit consent of the whole Church is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for it:</hi> then such a consent of the <hi>Church</hi> must be made evident, by which, they did devolve over the power of the whole <hi>Church</hi> to such a <hi>representative.</hi> And all those must consent in that act whose power the <hi>Council</hi> pretends to have, and so it cannot be sufficient to say, <hi>That those who choose Bishops for the Council do it</hi>; for then they could only <hi>represent</hi> those who chose them, and so their authority will fall much short of that of the whole <hi>Church.</hi> But suppose such a thing were done by the whole <hi>Church,</hi> of which no footsteps at all appear, we must further enquire by what <hi>right</hi> or <hi>authority</hi> this is done, for the authority of the <hi>Church</hi> being given it by <hi>Christ,</hi> it cannot be given from it self without his <hi>commission</hi> for doing it. Which if we stay till it can be produced in this case, we may stay long enough before we see any such <hi>Infallible Representative</hi> of the <hi>Vniversal Church.</hi> The utmost then, that can be supposed in this case, is, that the parts of the <hi>Church</hi> may voluntarily consent to accept of the <hi>decrees</hi> of such a <hi>Council</hi>; and by that voluntary <hi>act,</hi> or by the <hi>Supream authority</hi> injoyning it, such <hi>decrees</hi> may become obligatory. But what is this to an <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> because it represents the whole <hi>Church?</hi> For neither is there evidence enough for such a <hi>representation,</hi> neither, if there were, could any priviledge of that nature belong to the <hi>representative body,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of any promise made to the <hi>diffusive body</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note>2. <hi>What belongs to the representative body of the Church by vertue of a promise made to the diffusive, can in no other sense be understood of the representative, then as it belongs to the diffusive.</hi> Because no further right can be derived from any then they had themselves. Therefore supposing a promise of <hi>Infallibility</hi> made to the <hi>Church,</hi> it is necessary to know in what way and manner that <hi>promise</hi> belongs to it; for in no other way and manner can it belong to the <hi>Council</hi> which represents it. If therefore the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> lyes only in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> the <hi>Councils</hi> Infallibility can extend no further. If the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> doth not imply, that all the <hi>Church</hi> or the <hi>major part</hi> should be Infallible, but that though the <hi>major part</hi> err, yet all the <hi>Church</hi> shall not, then neither can it be true of a <hi>General

Council,</hi> that all, or the <hi>major part</hi> should be <hi>Infallible,</hi> but only that there should be no such <hi>General Council,</hi> wherein all the <hi>Bishops</hi> should erre. But then this is utterly destructive to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Decrees of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils,</hi> for those must pass by the <hi>major part</hi> of the <hi>Votes:</hi> Which <hi>Canus,</hi> one of the acutest of our adversaries, was sensible of, and grants, <hi>that the major part in a General Council may erre, and the lesser part hold the truth; but then,</hi> he saith, <hi>That the Pope is not bound to follow the major part.</hi>

What then do the <hi>promises</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> to the <hi>Council</hi> signifie, if the <hi>major part</hi> may definitively erre? And therefore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> likes not this Answer, as being too plain and open, but gives another as destructive to the <hi>Councils</hi> Infallibility, as this is. Which is, <hi>that in case the major part doth resist the better in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as in that of</hi> Ariminum, <hi>and the second at</hi> Ephesus,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>yet that it cannot conquer it.</hi> How so? Doth it not conquer it when the <hi>Decrees</hi> are passed by the <hi>major part? No,</hi> saith he, <hi>for these Decrees are afterwards made void.</hi> Very good: But then, I suppose in the <hi>Council,</hi> the <hi>major part</hi> did conquer, although not after. But by whom are they made void? <hi>By him to whom it belongs to confirm his Brethren,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> Well, but the skill is, to know who that is in this case, who can reverse the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative body</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> under the plea of <hi>confirming his Brethren?</hi> If it be the <hi>Pope,</hi> Who reversed the Decrees of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Sirmium,</hi> to which the <hi>Pope</hi> subscribed? And for that of <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Selencia, Hilary</hi> did more to reverse it, than ever the <hi>Pope</hi> did. Therefore others say, It is in the <hi>Churches</hi> power to make void the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>General Councils,</hi> as she did the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Arrian Councils.</hi> If so, then we plainly see, the <hi>Infallibility</hi> doth not lye in the <hi>representative,</hi> but in the <hi>diffusive body</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> still; if that hath the power to avoid and repeal the Decrees of <hi>General Councils.</hi> So that all the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> is meerly <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationary,</hi> and stands to the good liking and consent of the <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>If these places which mention a promise of Infallibility to the Church, must imply the Infallibility of General Councils, as the Churches representative, then it will thence follow, that the Decrees of General Councils are Infallible, whether the Pope confirm them or no.</hi> For the <hi>Infallibility</hi> is not promised at all <hi>mediante Pap√¢,</hi> but <hi>virtute Ecclesiae</hi>; for if they be <hi>infallible</hi> as represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Church,</hi> they are <hi>Infallible,</hi> whether there be any <hi>Pope</hi> or no: for the <hi>Pope</hi> doth not make them more represent the <hi>Church</hi> than they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And this is very well understood and proved by those, who from these <hi>promises</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and from that Infallibility consequent upon it (by their adversaries confession) to a <hi>General Council,</hi> do inferr the <hi>Councils</hi> Authority to be above the <hi>Popes.</hi> Which is a just and necessary consequence from this assertion, That the priviledges of the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> are by vertue of its <hi>representation</hi> in a <hi>General Council.</hi> Which Doctrine was asserted by the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Constance,</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> and by the <hi>Sorbonne Doctors,</hi> till their being <hi>Jesuited</hi> of late. Who have therefore
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:101069:269"/>
asserted, that it might be as lawful to call in question the Decrees of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> as of those <hi>two Councils.</hi> And whereas their adversaries object, That this is not <hi>de fide:</hi> they answer, It is impossible but that it should be <hi>de fide,</hi> since it is decreed by <hi>General Councils.</hi> For, say they, Were the <hi>Fathers</hi> at <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> acted by any other <hi>Spirit,</hi> than <hi>those</hi> at <hi>Nicaea,</hi> and <hi>Ephesus?</hi> Why may not then the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as well as them? For if there be any difference, they had much the advantage. In the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> (say they) two <hi>Popes</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, all the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> two <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the <hi>Emperour</hi> himself, and the <hi>Legats</hi> of all Christian Princes; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this, it was confirmed by <hi>Pope Martin,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> extant in the 45. <hi>Session.</hi> And so the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> was begun, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Decrees of the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Pisa,</hi> and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the <hi>Bulls</hi> of <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Eugenius</hi>; and the <hi>Popes Legats</hi> were presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in it. So that if <hi>General Councils</hi> be <hi>Infallible,</hi> it must be <hi>de fide Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic√¢,</hi> that their Authority is above the <hi>Pope's</hi>: And if so, their Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility cannot depend upon his Confirmation. Now, if we search into the grounds on which they build this power of <hi>General Councils</hi> independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the <hi>Pope,</hi> we shall find they derive it wholly from those places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which speak so much concerning the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> as is agreed on both sides. And therefore <hi>Aeneas Sylvius</hi> (afterwards <hi>Pius</hi> 2.) sayes,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That is not the less</hi> de fide, <hi>because it is contradicted by some, since it is founded on the promises of Christ concerning the Church.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> himself is but <hi>Filius Ecclesiae,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Sponsa Christi</hi>; they say, It is unreasonable that the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> should not be subject to the <hi>Spouse</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> If therefore these promises concerning the <hi>Church,</hi> inferr an <hi>Infallibility</hi> in it, and that <hi>Infallibility</hi> be in a <hi>General Council,</hi> as <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting</hi> the <hi>Church</hi>; it follows thence, that <hi>Councils</hi> must be in themselves <hi>Infallible,</hi> whether <hi>confirmed</hi> by the <hi>Pope</hi> or no.

                  <hi>the Council must of necessity erre; for that which properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Council, is, Passing judgement in matter of Faith, or making De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: now, if that were not the lawful Decree of the Council, which is made by the major part, there never could be a lawful Decree, for none passes without some dissenting: and therefore he denies that the Council doth fully represent the Church without the Pope.</hi> So that on both sides we see, how pregnant these proofs are for the <hi>Councils Infallibility,</hi> when one saith, That if they be understood of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Councils Infallibility</hi> doth not want the <hi>Popes</hi> Confirmation, the other to make the <hi>Popes Confirmation</hi> necessary, denies such an absolute <hi>representation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Council.</hi> If then the <hi>Council</hi> doth represent the <hi>Church,</hi> it is <hi>Infallible,</hi> although not <hi>confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope,</hi> if it doth not, then the <hi>promises</hi> made to the <hi>Church</hi> cannot belong to the <hi>General Council.</hi> Thus I have shewed you, how far these places concerning (as you say) the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> are, from proving the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils.</hi>

<pb n="519" facs="tcp:101069:269"/>
some particular places to this purpose. Which are,</hi> Mat. 18.20. <hi>and</hi> Act. 15.28. Which not having been handled already, I must follow you more closely in the examination of them. The first place is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> The substance of the argument from this place, his Lordship thus repeats from <hi>Bellarmin. The strength of the argument is not taken from these words alone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 234.</note> 
                  <hi>but as they are continued with the former, and that the argument is drawn</hi> √† minori ad majus, <hi>from the less to the greater, thus. If two or three gathered in my name, do alwaies obtain that which they ask at Gods hands,</hi> viz. <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge of those things which are necessary for them: How much more shall all the Bishops gathered together in Council, alwaies obtain wisdom and knowledge, to judge those things, which belong to the direction of the whole Church?</hi> To which his Lordship answers, <hi>That there is very little strength in these words, either considered alone, being generally interpreted by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of consent in prayer, or with the argument</hi> √† minori ad majus, 1. <hi>Because, though that argument hold in natural or necessary things, yet not in voluntary or promised things, or things which depend upon their institution.</hi> 2. <hi>Because it follows not, but where, and so far as, the thing upon which the argument is founded, agrees to the less: Now this Infallibility doth not belong to the lesser Congregation, and therefore cannot be inferred as to the greater.</hi> 3. <hi>Because it depends upon conditions here supposed of being gathered together in the name of Christ, and therefore supposing Infallibility promised these conditions here implied, must be known before such a Congregation can be known to be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi> 4. <hi>Because Christs promise of presence in the midst of them, is only to grant, what he shall find to be fit for them, not infallibly whatsoever they shall think fit to ask for themselves.</hi> 5. <hi>Because</hi> Gregory de Valenti√¢ <hi>and</hi> Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>confess, that this place doth not properly belong to prove an Infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of any sentence in which more agree in the name of Christ, but to the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of consent for obtaining that which more shall pray for in the name of Christ, if at least that be for their souls health. For else it would hence follow, that not only the definition of a General Council, but even of a Provincial; nay, of two or three Bishops gathered together, is valid, and that without the Popes consent.</hi> The utmost I can make of your reply to these Answers, lyes in this, <hi>That you grant that primarily and directly our Saviour doth not intend that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Infallibility, and this is that which</hi> Gregory <hi>and</hi> Stapleton <hi>assert;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 252, 252.</note> 
                  <hi>but only that he signified in general, that he would be present with his Church, and all faithful people gathered together in his name, so often, and so far, as their necessities required his presence, they duly imploring it. But yet the argument holds for the Infallibility of General Councils, and not National or Provincial, because the necessities of the Church require one, and not the other: and that it will follow</hi> √† minori ad majus, <hi>in things promised, as well as natural, where the motive is increased, and neither goodness nor power wanting in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.</hi> But all this depends on a false supposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Infallibility</hi> to continue in the <hi>Church,</hi> and that all persons are bound to believe the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Councils</hi> to be the <hi>Infallible Oracles</hi> of truth: but we say, neither of these are necessary in the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore you have no ground to extend this promise of <hi>Christs</hi> presence to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of Councils.</hi> For you are not to extend the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> of Christ as far as you shall judge fitting, but as far only as he hath <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi> to extend it. For otherwise it would be far more for the peace and unity of the <hi>Church,</hi> if every particular Congregation had this Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, than if only <hi>General Councils</hi> had it: Because by that means, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:101069:270"/>
disputes about the <hi>authority, calling,</hi> and <hi>proceedings</hi> of <hi>General Councils</hi> would be prevented: Nay, it might be extended much further, for by this argument from the <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> you might, for all that I can see, inferr with more force, that every true <hi>Christian</hi> should be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> and so there be no need of any <hi>Councils</hi> at all. For, whatever argument you can produce, why <hi>Christ's goodness</hi> should extend to make <hi>Councils Infallible,</hi> it will much more hold as to the other; for the peace, and unity of the <hi>Church</hi> would be far better secured this way. If you say that experience shews, <hi>Christ never intended this by the errours of particular men in all ages:</hi> To the same purpose we answer you as to <hi>Councils,</hi> that large experience shews, that when <hi>Bishops</hi> have solemnly met in <hi>Council,</hi> they have been grosly deceived; as you confess in all the <hi>Arrian Councils.</hi> If your argument would have ever held from the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; Would it not have held at that time, when so great a matter of <hi>Faith</hi> was under debate? If <hi>Christ</hi> therefore suffered so many <hi>Bishops</hi> so grosly to erre, in a matter of such importance, wherein the <hi>Church</hi> was so highly concerned, How can you inferr from his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> that he will never suffer <hi>General Councils</hi> to erre. If you answer, <hi>That these erred for not observing the conditions requisite in order to Christs hearing them,</hi> viz. <hi>that they were not met in the name of Christ, did not come without prejudice, nor rely on Divine Assistance.</hi> I pray take the same Answer as to all other <hi>Councils,</hi> that we cannot know that <hi>Christ</hi> hears them, or that they are Infallible, till we are assured of their performance of the <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> requisite in order to that <hi>Infallibility.</hi> And when you can assure us, that such a <hi>Council</hi> met together in the name of Christ, and came meerly with a desire to find out <hi>truth,</hi> and relyed wholly on his assistance for it, we do not so much distrust the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as to think he will suffer them to be deceived. For we know upon those <hi>conditions</hi> he will not suffer any good man to erre, much less an <hi>Assembly</hi> of them met in a <hi>General Council.</hi> But here you have the hardest task of all lying upon you, which is, to prove that a <hi>General Council</hi> hath observed all these <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> without which nothing can be inferred from this place, as to <hi>Christs</hi> being in any sense <hi>in the midst of them.</hi>

               <p>The last place mentioned for the Infallibility of <hi>General Councils,</hi> is that, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28.<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Where the Apostles say of themselves, and the Council held by them; It seems good to the Holy Ghost,</hi>

                  <hi>and to us. And,</hi> saith his Lordship, <hi>they might well say it. For they had infallibly the assistance of the Holy Ghost, and kept close to his direction. But there is a great deal of difference between them and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Councils, who never arrogated this to their definitions, though they presumed of the assistance of the Holy Ghost; and though that form might be used, yet they did not assume such an Infallibility to themselves, as the Apostles had. And therefore it is little less than blasphemy in</hi> Stapleton, <hi>to say, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Councils are the very Oracles of the Holy Ghost. And, that all Councils are not so Infallible, as was this of the Apostles, nor the causes handled in them, as there they were, is manifest by the ingenuous confession of</hi> Ferus <hi>to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> This is the substance of his Lordships Answer to this place. Which you think to take off by saying, <hi>That there's no essential difference between the certainty of the things determined by the Apostles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 253.</note> 
                  <hi>and those decided by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, confirmed by the Roman Bishop: and though after-Councils use not the same expression in terms, yet they do it in effect, by enjoyning the belief of their decisions under the pain of Anathema.</hi> If this be the meaning of the <hi>Anathema's</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> there had need indeed be no great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:101069:270"/>
the <hi>Apostles Decrees,</hi> and theirs. But this had need be very well proved; and so it is by you: for you produce <hi>several expressions of</hi> Cyril, Athanasius, Austin, Leo, Gregory, <hi>and some others</hi> (out of <hi>Bellarmin) in which they magnifie the Decrees of General Councils, calling them a Divine Oracle, a Sentence inspired by the Holy Ghost, not to be retracted,</hi> and some others to the same purpose, <hi>by which you vindicate</hi> Stapleton, <hi>and tell us, he said no more than the Fathers had done before him.</hi> Yet all this is far from any vindication of <hi>Stapleton,</hi> or proving your assertion as to the equal cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Decrees of <hi>Councils,</hi> and of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> For the ground of all those expressions, and several others of the same nature, was not the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of any <hi>inherent Infallibility</hi> in the Decrees of <hi>General Councils,</hi> but their great assurance of the truth of that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which was determined by those first <hi>General Councils.</hi> For although I am far enough from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> Infallible, yet if that had determined the same points of <hi>Faith,</hi> which were determined in the first <hi>four General Councils,</hi> and nothing else; I might have said, <hi>That the Decree of that Council was a Holy and Divine Oracle, a Sentence inspired by the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi> not that I thought the <hi>Council</hi> in the least <hi>Infallible,</hi> in determining these things; but that they were of themselves <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> which the <hi>Council</hi> determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And in this sense <hi>Athanasius</hi> might well term the definition of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene-Council</hi> against <hi>Arius, the word of our Lord which endureth for ever</hi>; and <hi>Constantine</hi> stile it a <hi>coelestial mandate</hi>; and <hi>Gregory might reverence the four first Councils, as the four Gospels</hi> (though <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells you, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression must be taken in a qualified sense) yet all these, and any other of a like nature, I say, import no more than that they were fully assured, the matters decreed by them, were revealed by <hi>God</hi> in his Word, and not that they believed that they became such holy and divine Oracles, meerly by the <hi>Councils definition.</hi> For the contrary might be abundantly manifested by many expressions in them quite to another purpose: and if, instead of all the rest, you will but read <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> concerning <hi>Councils,</hi> you will find your self strangely deceived, if you believed they ever thought them <hi>Infallible.</hi> What you add afterwards,<note place="margin">P. 254.</note> 
                  <hi>that it is sufficient that there be a real Infallibility, though not like to that of the Apostles,</hi> will not be sufficient for me, till you can shew me the degrees of <hi>Infallibility</hi>; for, I will promise you, if you can once prove that <hi>Councils are really Infallible,</hi> I shall not stick to say, That they are <hi>alike Infallible</hi> with the <hi>Apostles.</hi> As for <hi>your discarding</hi> Ferus <hi>as a prohibited Authour,</hi> it only shews the great integrity of the man, who spoke too much truth to be born by the tender <hi>ears</hi> of the <hi>Roman Inquisition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I had proceeded any further, I had thought (because of a former promise) to have looked back to the place,<note place="margin">P. 249.</note> where you <hi>speak</hi> in vindication of the <hi>decretal Epistles</hi>; but because you only referr to <hi>Turrianus</hi> his defence of them, I shall only return you an equal courtesie, and referr you to the abundantly sufficient Answer to him by <hi>David Blondel.</hi> One would have thought you should have been ashamed of so notorious an imposture as those <hi>decretal Epistles</hi> are; but we see, what shifts a bad cause puts you upon, that such men as <hi>Ferus, Cassander, Erasmus,</hi> are under an <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius,</hi> but the <hi>decretal Epistles</hi> must be still justified; but he that doth not see the reasons of these proceedings, wants a greater <hi>Index Expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> for his <hi>brains,</hi> than ever they did for their <hi>Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We return therefore to our present subject, and having manifested,<note place="margin">¬ß. 11.</note> how far the Infallibility of <hi>General Councils</hi> is from being grounded <hi>on the

veracity of Divine promises,</hi> as you pretend without ground; we now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the consent of the <hi>Church,</hi> as to this subject: which his Lordship speaks to in the next Consideration. Which is, <hi>That all agree that the Church in general can never err from the Faith necessary to salvation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 240.</note> 
                  <hi>but there is not the like consent that General Councils cannot err.</hi> Whether <hi>Waldensis</hi> asserting, <hi>that General Councils may err,</hi> speak of such <hi>Councils</hi> as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>unlawful</hi> or no, is not much material; since, as his Lordship sayes, <hi>The Fathers having to do with so many Hereticks, and so many of them opposing Church authority, did never in the condemnation of those Hereticks utter this proposition, That a General Council cannot err. And supposing that no General Council had erred in any matter of moment to this day, which will not be found true, yet this would not have followed, that it is therefore Infallible and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err.</hi> And to shew that St. <hi>Augustin</hi> puts a manifest difference between the rules of <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>definitions</hi> of men, he produceth that noted place in him, wherein he so fully asserts the prerogative of <hi>Scripture</hi> above all the writings of men or definitions of <hi>Councils:</hi> Which, because it will be often refer'd to, I have cited at large in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,<note place="margin">

And even Plenary Councils themselves may be amended, the former by the latter.</hi> From whence he inferrs, <hi>That it seems it was no news with St.</hi> Austin, <hi>that a General Council might err, and therefore be inferiour to the Scripture, which may neither be doubted nor disputed, where it affirms.

Donatist.</hi> where you say, he expresly teacheth, <hi>that no doubt ought to be made of what is by full decree established in a General Council.</hi> But here a great doubt may justly be made, Whether ever you searched this place or no; for if you had, you would have had little heart to produce it to this purpose. For St. <hi>Augustin</hi> is there giving an account, why he would not insist upon any <hi>humane authorities,</hi> but bring certain evidence out of <hi>Scripture</hi> for what he said; and the reason he gives for it, is, because in the former times of the <hi>Church</hi> before the <hi>Schism</hi> of <hi>Donatus</hi> brake forth, the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>particular Councils</hi> did differ from each other about the Question in hand, <hi>viz. rebaptizing Hereticks,</hi> untill that by a <hi>General

Council</hi> of the <hi>whole world,</hi> that which was most soundly held <hi>etiam remotis dubitationibus firmaretur, was confirmed the disputes being taken away.</hi> The utmost that can be drawn hence, is, that when this Controversie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by a <hi>General Council,</hi> the disputes were ended among the <hi>Catholick Bishops.</hi> But by what arts can you hence draw, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> thought the <hi>Council Infallible</hi> in its <hi>definitions?</hi> When the business came to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued in a <hi>free Council</hi> by the dissenting parties, and they more fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood each other, and agreed upon one sentence, St. <hi>Austin</hi> sayes the former doubts were taken off: that is, the reasons and <hi>Scriptures</hi> produced on the other side satisfied them: but he doth not say, that no doubt is to be made of what is by full Decree established in a <hi>General Council</hi>; but, that no <hi>doubts were made after it.</hi> But if you say, <hi>There could be no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unless the Councils definition were supposed Infallible,</hi> you speak that which is contrary to the sense and experience of the world; and even of that general <hi>Council</hi> where this <hi>decree</hi> is supposed by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to be made, <hi>viz. the Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> For, Will you say the <hi>Council</hi> was Infallible in deciding the time of <hi>keeping Easter,</hi> because after that <hi>Council</hi> the <hi>Asian Bishops</hi> submitted to the custom of other <hi>Churches?</hi> Is there no way ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to convince men, but by <hi>Infallibility?</hi> If there be, their <hi>doubts</hi> may be taken away by a <hi>General Council,</hi> and yet that <hi>Council</hi> not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Infallible.</hi> For if St. <hi>Augustin</hi> had meant so, nothing had been more pertinent then to have insisted on the decree of that <hi>Council</hi>; and yet he there leaves it, and calls all arguments of that nature <hi>humane arguments,</hi> and therefore saith, <hi>ex Evangelio profero certa documenta; I bring certain evidences out of the Gospel.</hi> Which words doubtless he would never have so immediately subjoyned to his former concerning a <hi>General Council,</hi> if he had judged it <hi>Infallible,</hi> or its decrees as certain as the <hi>Scripture.</hi> In your second place <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 5. there is nothing hath any shadow of pertinency to your purpose; that which I suppose you may mean, is, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 17. where what he said before <hi>was decreed by a General Council,</hi> he after saith, <hi>was the judgement of the Holy Catholick Church:</hi> from whence you may indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> did approve that <hi>decree</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> but how it proves it <hi>Infallible</hi> I cannot understand.

                  <hi>that General Councils cannot err in precepts of manners: No,</hi> (say you) <hi>this is no contradiction, because these depend much upon circumstances of time, place, person,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which varying, it often so falls out, that what at first was prudently judged fit to be done, becomes afterwards unfitting, and in this case one General Council may be amended by another, and yet neither charged with errour.</hi> But do you suppose the mean while that St. <hi>Austin</hi> spake pertinently to this business, or no?

                  </gap> as running through the whole Discourse, which are, 1. The difference of all these from the <hi>Scripture</hi> in regard of our <hi>yielding assent</hi> to them; for that is it, which he begins with, that we are not in the least to doubt, whether any thing contained therein be true or no: and then comes the other in, by way of immediate <hi>Antithesis</hi>; but, the <hi>writings of Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. and although there be a <hi>gradation</hi> in all these, yet all of them are therein different from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>whatsoever is found there may neither be doubted nor disputed; but the writings of Bishops may be doubted or disputed of, because they may be corrected by other Bishops or Councils. And those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Councils may be, because they may be corrected by General; and even these General Councils cannot require such an undoubted assent as the Scripture doth, because the former may be amended by the latter.</hi> So that if you take
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:101069:272"/>
the scope of S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s discourse in this place, whether he speaks generally; or particularly, nothing can be more evident, than that he puts this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and all other writings or <hi>Councils,</hi> that the one may not at all be doubted or disputed of, but the other may: and the common reason of all is, because none are so <hi>Infallible,</hi> but they may be corrected by something besides themselves, which cannot be in any sense said of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> 2. Although Saint <hi>Austin</hi> adds that clause, <hi>Si quid in eis fort√® √† veritate deviatum est, If they have erred from the truth,</hi> only where he speaks of the writings of <hi>Bishops</hi>; yet the series of his discourse implies, that it should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in what follows too: that, as the writings of <hi>Bishops</hi> may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by <hi>Councils, if they have erred,</hi> so <hi>National Councils</hi> may be corrected by <hi>General, if they have erred</hi>; and so former <hi>General Councils by latter</hi> on the same <hi>supposition</hi> still, <hi>that they have erred.</hi> For, as the <hi>errours</hi> was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be the ground of <hi>correction</hi> in the former, it must be likewise of <hi>amendment</hi> here. And whatever is not so <hi>perfect,</hi> but that it may be <hi>amended,</hi> cannot be supposed <hi>Infallible</hi>; for, if the persons had been <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> who had made those Decrees in <hi>General Councils,</hi> they would have prevented any necessity of further <hi>amendments</hi> by <hi>succeeding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</hi> So that, take <hi>amendment</hi> in what sense you will, either for <hi>supplying defects,</hi> or <hi>correcting errours,</hi> it is destructive to your pretence, that the Decrees of <hi>General Councils</hi> are <hi>Infallible,</hi> and as certain as the <hi>Scripture.</hi> Which is so repugnant to the scope of this speech of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> as nothing can be more. Your <hi>Criticism</hi> then, <hi>from the signification of</hi> emendare <hi>from</hi> menda, <hi>and</hi> menda <hi>from</hi> minus, <hi>and so importing only the taking away any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> yields you no relief at all:<note place="margin">P. 252.</note> for that <hi>defect</hi> which is supposed in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Councils,</hi> which needs that <hi>emendation,</hi> doth sufficiently argue, there was no <hi>Infallible Assistance</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the Decrees of those <hi>Councils.</hi> For where <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> assists <hi>infallibly,</hi> it leaves no such <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> as are necessary to be <hi>amended</hi> afterwards, by some other <hi>Council</hi> which can pretend to no higher assistance than the other had before. But your critical judgement is not extraordinary, if you will have the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of words taken from the conjectural <hi>Etymologies</hi> of them, such as this of <hi>Scaliger</hi> is in the place where he corrects <hi>Varro's Etymologies</hi> (at the end of his <hi>Conjectanea</hi>) but, besides that, all attempts of that nature are but <hi>Conjectural Essayes,</hi> it is but an ill way to judge of the use of a word by the <hi>Etymology</hi> of it; for, What multitudes of words are carried further in their sense, than their <hi>Originals</hi> would bear? His Lordship therefore takes a far surer way to know S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s meaning, than running to <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for the signification of the word <hi>menda</hi>; which is, by producing a parallel place in S. <hi>Austin,</hi> where it is taken for to <hi>correct,</hi> and supposes an evident fault; <hi>aliud quod praecipere jubemur,</hi>

                  <hi>aliud quod emendare praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi>; where <hi>emendare</hi> is, plainly to <hi>amend</hi> something <hi>amiss,</hi> not to <hi>supply</hi> something <hi>defective.</hi> So that <hi>Stapleton</hi>'s sense of <hi>amending</hi> by <hi>explication</hi> of something <hi>not fully known,</hi> and not by <hi>correction</hi> of something <hi>errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> cannot here have place. For, as his Lordship well observes the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Council,</hi> which S. <hi>Austin</hi> did in this dispute speak most of, was not guilty meerly of not fully explaining it self, but of a <hi>positive errour, viz.</hi> that under S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> determining that <hi>Baptism of Hereticks was no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi> And therefore when S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks of <hi>amendment,</hi> it is such an <hi>amendment</hi> as doth suppose <hi>errour,</hi> and not barely <hi>defect.</hi> And so the words used before of <hi>reprehension</hi> and <hi>yielding,</hi> do both imply more than a
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:101069:273"/>
bare explanation; and those which follow after, evince it fully, where S. <hi>Austin</hi> layes down the cautions, whereby such <hi>amendments</hi> should be made, <hi>without sacrilegious pride, or swelling arrogancy, without contention of envy, and in holy humility, in Catholick peace, in Christian Charity.</hi> All which words were very needless, if he meant only an <hi>explanation</hi> of something not <hi>fully declared</hi> before; but are very necessary, supposing it to be the <hi>amendment</hi> of some former <hi>errour.</hi> All the Answer you have, is, <hi>That these last words relate not in particular to General Councils</hi> (by no means,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> although they follow them at the heels) <hi>but to the other several subjects,</hi> viz. <hi>private Bishops, Provincial and National Councils; which are subject to pride, arrogancy, and contention in their emendations.</hi> But, Was not S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> an unhappy man then at expressing himself, that he must needs set those Caveats after he had spoken of <hi>General Councils,</hi> which referr to the particulars that went before, without any reference to the immediate <hi>antecedents?</hi> For if they do at all respect the proceedings of <hi>General Councils,</hi> (as doubtless they do, and that most immediately, as appears to any one who reads them) then they imply still, that this <hi>amendment</hi> of <hi>General Councils</hi> must be done without <hi>pride, arrogance,</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> and with the <hi>greatest humility,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>charity</hi>; which it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive why S. <hi>Austin</hi> should add, unless he supposed some <hi>errours</hi> to be <hi>amended</hi> in them.

                  <hi>The poorest shift of all in</hi> Bellarmin, <hi>viz.</hi> that he speaks of <hi>unlawful Councils:</hi> and it is a sign it is so indeed, when you have nothing more to say for it, <hi>but only, that it was given</hi> ex superabundanti, <hi>and with a Peradventure.</hi> When his Lordship concludes, <hi>that the Popes Confirmation to make Councils Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, is a meer trick, and unknown to the ancient Church</hi>; you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to prove it to be grounded on the <hi>practice of Councils</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of <hi>Reason,</hi> but to referr the Reader back to what you have said about the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi>; and therefore I must do so too, for an Answer to what you have said on that subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 13.</note>The next thing which belongs to this Question, is contained in his Lordships sixth <hi>Consideration</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 248.</note> which is, <hi>If the definition of a General Council be Infallible, then the Infallibility of it, is either in the conclusion, and in the means that prove it; or in the conclusion, not the means; or in the means, not the conclusion. But it is Infallible in none of these. Not in the first; for there are divers deliberations in General Councils, where the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is Catholick, but the means by which they prove it, not Infallible. Not in the second; for the conclusion must alwaies follow the nature of the premises, or principles out of which it is deduced; therefore if those which the Council uses, be sometimes uncertain, the conclusion cannot be Infallible. Not in the third; for the conclusion cannot but be true and necessary, if the means be so.</hi> Your Answer is, <hi>That it is Infallible in the conclusion, that is, in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine defined, though it be not Infallible in the means, or arguments upon which it proceeded to the definition.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 263.</note> 
                  <hi>And your reason is, because one is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Government of the Church, but the other is not; for,</hi> Deus non deficit in necessariis, nec redundat in superfluis. You mean, it is necessary for you to assert it, whether it hath any foundation in reason or no: for you have not yet proved, that the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils</hi> is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the <hi>Churches Government,</hi> and therefore cannot thence inferr so great an absurdity as this; that, where all the <hi>premises</hi> are fallible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, yet the <hi>conclusion</hi> may be prophetical and Infallible. But so
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:101069:273"/>
involved and obscure are your discourses on this subject, that while you pretend a <hi>General Council</hi> is <hi>seeing Visions,</hi> one might easily believe <hi>you were dreaming dreams.</hi> For, I pray, speak out, and tell us, what you mean by <hi>Councils being fallible in the use of means, and yet Infallible in the conclusion</hi> drawn from those <hi>premises,</hi> which she was fallible in the deducing the conclusion from? For the deducing the conclusion, is in the <hi>use of the means</hi>; therefore how is it possible that the <hi>Council</hi> should be <hi>Infallible</hi> in the <hi>conclusion,</hi> when it was fallible in making that <hi>Conclusion?</hi> But it may be I do not yet fully apprehend what you would have, neither I doubt do you. For you would fain be Infallible in the <hi>conclusion</hi> too, without so much as <hi>truth</hi> in the <hi>premises.</hi> But I shall attempt to make you speak intelligibly; it must be one of these two things you mean, when you say, <hi>Councils</hi> are <hi>Infallible</hi> in the <hi>conclusion,</hi> either that they are <hi>Infallible in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Conclusion,</hi> or <hi>in assenting to the Conclusion.</hi> If <hi>Infallible</hi> in the deducing the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> then it must be Infallible in the <hi>use of the means</hi>; for, unless it doth infallibly discern the <hi>connexion</hi> of the <hi>premises,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it should be <hi>Infallible</hi> in drawing the <hi>Conclusion</hi> from them. So that it is <hi>non-sense,</hi> and a <hi>contradiction</hi> to say, That a <hi>Council</hi> is Infallible in the drawing a <hi>Conclusion,</hi> and not Infallible in the <hi>use of the means:</hi> for, it is to say, It is <hi>Infallible,</hi> and not <hi>Infallible</hi> at the same time, and about the same thing, and in the same manner. For, What is drawing a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi> but a discerning that <hi>truth</hi> which results from the <hi>connexion</hi> of the premises together? for that which is concluded, hath all its <hi>truth</hi> depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the evidence of the <hi>premises,</hi> otherwise it is a <hi>simple Proposition,</hi> and not a <hi>Conclusion.</hi> If you had then said, That the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> did <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reveal</hi> to the <hi>Council</hi> the truth of what was to be decreed; you had spoken that which might have been understood, though not believed; but this you durst not say, for fear of the charge of <hi>Enthusiasms,</hi> and <hi>new Revelations:</hi> but when you say, The <hi>Council</hi> must <hi>use means,</hi> and make <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> as other fallible creatures do, but then it is <hi>Infallible</hi> in the drawing the <hi>Conclusion</hi> from the <hi>premises</hi> (though it be fallible in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of those <hi>premises</hi>) is an unparalleld piece of profound non-sense. For, suppose the matter the <hi>Council</hi> was to determine, was the <hi>Popes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>; in order to the proving this, you say, The <hi>Council</hi> must use all arguments tending to prove it; there comes in <hi>Christ's Prayer for S.</hi> Peter, <hi>that his Faith should not fail,</hi> and that this must be extended to his <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,</hi> thence the argument is formed. <hi>Whomsoever Christ prayed for, that his Faith should not fail, is Infallible; but Christ prayed for the Pope, that his Faith should not fail; therefore he is Infallible.</hi> Now you say, The <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> is <hi>fallible</hi> in the <hi>use of the means</hi> for this <hi>Conclusion, i. e.</hi> it may not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly believe the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>major</hi> or <hi>minor Proposition,</hi> but yet it may <hi>infallibly</hi> deduce thence the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> though all the strength of the <hi>Conclusion</hi> depends upon the truth of the <hi>premises.</hi> You must therefore either assert that the Decrees of <hi>Councils</hi> are immediately revealed as <hi>Divine Oracl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s,</hi> or else that they are <hi>fallible Conclusions</hi> drawn from <hi>fallible premises.</hi> And, were it not for a little shame, because of your charging others with <hi>immediate Revelations,</hi> I doubt not but you would assert the former; which you must of necessity do, if you will maintain the <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> of <hi>General Councils:</hi> for if there be any infirmity in the use of the premises, it must of necessity be in the Conclusion too. But, suppose you mean <hi>an Infallible Assent to the matter of the Conclusion,</hi> though it be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly deduced, you are as far to seek as ever; for, Whereon must that
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:101069:274"/>
                  <hi>Assent</hi> be grounded? It must be either upon the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>premises,</hi> or something <hi>immediately revealed:</hi> If on the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>premises,</hi> the <hi>Assent</hi> can be no stronger than the grounds are on which it is built; if on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing revealed, it must needs be still an <hi>immediate Revelation.</hi> But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my self all this while, to urge you thus with absurdities consequent from reason; for, in answer to his Lordship, you grant, <hi>That it is a thing altogether unknown in nature, and art too, that fallible principles can either as Father or Mother, beget or bring forth an Infallible Conclusion</hi>; for, when his Lordship had objected this, you return him this Answer, <hi>That this is a false supposition of the Bishop,</hi>

                  <hi>for the Conclusion is not so much the child of those premises (i. e.</hi> it is not the Conclusion) <hi>as the fruit of the Holy Ghost, directing and guiding the Council, to produce an Infallible Conclusion, whatever the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises be</hi> (true, or false, certain, or uncertain, all is a case.) <hi>This is necessary for the peace and unity of the Church</hi> (to believe Contradictions) <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be denied, unless an impossibility be shewed therein.</hi> (I doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving contradictions is accounted no impossibility with you.) <hi>But, I hope, no man will attaque Gods Omnipotency, and deprive him of the power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this.</hi> Is it come to that at last? Whatever you assert that is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the common reason of mankind, and involves <hi>contradictions</hi> in it, that you call for <hi>Gods Omnipotency</hi> to help you in. Thus <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> must be believed, because <hi>God is Omnipotent</hi>; and that men may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing, though not grounded on <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>repugnant</hi> to <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> because <hi>God is Omnipotent.</hi> We acknowledge <hi>God's Omnipotency,</hi> as much as you, but we dare not put it to such servile uses, to make good any absurd imaginations of our brains. If you had said, It was possible, for <hi>God</hi> to enlighten the minds of the <hi>Bishops</hi> in a <hi>General Council,</hi> either to discern infallibly the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>premises,</hi> or <hi>immediately to reveal</hi> the truth of the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> you had spoken intelligible falshoods. But to say, that <hi>God</hi> permits them to be fallible in the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>means,</hi> and in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Conclusion</hi> from them; but to be <hi>Infallible</hi> in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> it self, without any <hi>immediate Revelation,</hi> and then to challenge <hi>Gods Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> for it: I know not whether it be a greater <hi>dishonour</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> to <hi>humane understanding.</hi> And if such <hi>incongruities</hi> as these are, do not discover that you are <hi>miserably hampered,</hi> as his Lordship saith, in this argument, I know not what will.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 14.</note>But we must proceed to discover more of them; two things his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship very rationally objects against <hi>Stapletons</hi> assertion,<note place="margin">P. 249.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Council is discursive in the use of the means, but prophetical in delivering the Conclusion.</hi> 1. <hi>That since this is not according to principles of nature and reason, there must be some supernatural Authority, which must deliver this truth (which,</hi> saith he, <hi>must be the Scripture.) For if you fly to immediate Revelations; the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm must be yours. But the Scriptures which are brought, in the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of all the Primitive Church, neither say it, nor enforce it. Therefore Scripture warrants not your prophecy in the Conclusion. Neither can the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Produce one Father, who sayes, This is an Vniversal Tradition of the Church, that her definitions in a General Council are prophetical, and by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation: Produce any one Father that sayes it of his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that he thinks so.</hi> To all this you very gravely say nothing; and we can shrewdly guess at the reason of it. 2. His Lordship proves, <hi>That it is a repugnancy to say, That the Council is prophetical in the Conclusion, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursive in the use of the means; for no Prophet, in that which he delivered from God as Infallible truth, was ever discursive at all in the use of the means; Nay</hi>
                  <pb n="529" facs="tcp:101069:274"/>
(saith he) <hi>make it but probable in the ordinary course of prophecy, and I hope you go no higher, nor will I offer at Gods absolute power</hi> (but his Lordship was deceived in you, for you run to <hi>Gods</hi> Omnipotency) <hi>that that which is discursive in the means, can be prophetical in the Conclusion, and you shall be my great</hi> Apollo <hi>for ever.</hi> And this, he shews, <hi>is contrary to what your own Authours deliver concerning the nature and kinds of prophecy, and that none of them were by discourse.</hi> To this you answer,<note place="margin">P. 264.</note> 
                  <hi>That both</hi> Stapleton <hi>and you deny that the Church is simply prophetical, either in the premises or Conclusion, but rather the quite contrary; and that by the definition of the Councils being prophetical in an Analogical sense, no more is meant but that by vertue of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine assistance and direction, such a Conclusion or definition, in regard of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise verity, is as infallibly true and certain, as if it were a prophecy.</hi> But if you had a mind that we should understand, or believe what you say, Why do not you come more out of the clouds, and shew us the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that which is <hi>simply prophetical,</hi> and that which is only <hi>Analogically</hi> so, but as infallibly true and certain as the other? But, that you may no longer blind the world with such insignificant discourses, I shall put you upon speaking more distinctly, by enquiring into those waies, whereby <hi>God</hi> may be supposed supernaturally to work upon the minds of men, in order to the discovery of truth. These two waies we may conceive that <hi>God</hi> may make known <hi>truth</hi> to the minds of men. 1. <hi>By the immediate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of something, which could not otherwise be known but by immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation:</hi> And of this nature were all those <hi>future events</hi> which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and this I suppose you call <hi>simply prophetical</hi>; so likewise all those <hi>Doctrines</hi> which are of pure <hi>Revelation, i. e.</hi> such as could never have been known, unless God had revealed them: of which kind there are several in the Gospel. 2. <hi>God may discover such things to the minds of men, which, though they might otherwise be known, yet not with that degree of certainty, as by this immediate assistance of Gods Spirit:</hi> Now this I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is that you call <hi>Analogically prophetical,</hi> which you assert <hi>to differ no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all from prophecy, in regard of Infallible truth and certainty, being by vertue of divine assistance and direction.</hi> And this you say a <hi>General Council</hi> hath, but not the former.</p>
               <p>Now to convince you of the absurdity of your assertions,<note place="margin">¬ß. 15.</note> I shall shew you these two things. 1. <hi>That this cannot be without an imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>diate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. <hi>That being so, it cannot be discursive, as you say it is</hi> in the use of the means. 1. <hi>That this cannot be without an immediate Revelation:</hi> for which I need nothing but your own assertions, <hi>viz.</hi> that this is a higher discovery of truth, than <hi>nature</hi> can ever attain to, or ordinary <hi>Grace</hi>; and that it is such as obliges all men <hi>to an internal assent to it,</hi> when it is declared. Now I shall desire you, or any of your party, to tell me, What difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this, and the <hi>Inspiration</hi> which the <hi>Apostles</hi> had in writing the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> I mean not such as contain <hi>prophesies</hi> in them, but those which deliver to us the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>: as for <hi>instance,</hi> in S. <hi>John's Gospel,</hi> he doth not pretend to deliver any thing which was not revealed before, but to give an account of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and life of <hi>Christ.</hi> And so that <hi>Inspiration</hi> was not <hi>simply prophetical,</hi> as in writing the <hi>Prophecies</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> but <hi>Analogically</hi> so, in that such an assistance of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> as made what he writ, to be as infallibly true and certain, as if it were a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which are your own words concerning the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Councils.</hi> Shew us therefore any rational difference between this kind of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and that <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by which the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> are written. If you say, the one was

                  <hi>immediate</hi> and the other not, you beg the Question: for I am proving that what you assert, doth necessarily imply, that it is as <hi>immediate</hi> as that which the <hi>Apostles</hi> had. Nay I will go yet further, and say it is as immediate as that which the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves had in <hi>Council.</hi> For when they said, <hi>It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us,</hi> Can any thing more possibly be understood, then that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> did so far assist their minds, that they should not err in their Definitions? And therefore when of late you are grown (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) somewhat jealous of the word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and you give us a grave advertisement at the end of your <hi>Preface, that you do not mean by it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal unerring power in all things, in those whom you account Infallible, but only that they never have erred, nor shall err in definitions of Faith</hi>; you do not at all advantage your selves by it. For none of your considerate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries do charge you so much with usurping <hi>Gods incommunicable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of Infallibility,</hi> (which is thereby avoided because you pretend to derive it from him) but that you challenge the same <hi>Infallibility</hi> which the <hi>Apostles</hi> had. And so must of necessity assert as much of <hi>Divine Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm</hi> and <hi>immediate revelation</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> as any of the <hi>Apostles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had. For what ever they had, came <hi>by vertue of Christs promise,</hi> and that is all you say for the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>: but that doth no more take it off from being an <hi>immediate revelation</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> then it did in the Apostles. If you say, <hi>The Church is only secured that it neither hath erred, nor can err in definitions of Faith,</hi> What more had the <hi>Apostles</hi> then this? And if this in them did require an <hi>immediate inspiration,</hi> certainly it must do so in the <hi>Church</hi> too. But you say, <hi>Neither Church nor Council do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish immediate revelations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>nor create any new Articles of Faith, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and unfold by their definitions, that doctrine, which Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in some manner first delivered.</hi> But all this, supposing it true, doth not hinder, but the <hi>Councils Infallibility</hi> must imply an <hi>immediate revelation</hi> on the <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> though not of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> decreed by them. For granting the <hi>decrees</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> are no <hi>new Articles of Faith</hi> (which is yet contrary to your own principles; for if by the definitions of <hi>Councils</hi> that may be <hi>de fide</hi> which was not before, then the <hi>Councils</hi> do make <hi>new Articles of Faith,</hi> though not <hi>new Doctrines) i. e.</hi> that the <hi>matter of them in some manner was before revealed,</hi> yet since you say <hi>the Council in declaring them, hath an Infallibility, equal to Prophecy,</hi> it must be by <hi>immediate inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> For, Hath the <hi>Council</hi> greater certainty, and higher assistance then any ordinary believer hath or not? if not, it can be no more <hi>Infallible</hi> then an ordinary believer; if it hath, it must be <hi>immediate,</hi> because it hath a higher degree of certainty, then can be attained by the <hi>use of means.</hi> And to say this, as you do expresly, when you assert the <hi>Council</hi> fallible in the <hi>use of means,</hi> but infallible in the <hi>conclusion,</hi> is a most palpable Contradiction. For, it is to assert a <hi>certainty</hi> beyond and above the <hi>use of means,</hi> and yet not <hi>immediate.</hi> But here lyes your perpetual mistake, as though nothing could be an <hi>immediate revelation,</hi> but what is a <hi>revelation</hi> of some <hi>Doctrine never revealed before:</hi> whereas if there be a further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of that Doctrine in as <hi>Infallible</hi> a manner as the <hi>Apostles</hi> at first revealed it, that <hi>explanation</hi> is by as immediate a <hi>revelation,</hi> as the first discovery of it. As is clear in the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> for I hope you will not deny, but the non-obligation of the ceremonial <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>in some manner revealed to them before</hi>; and yet I hope you will not say, but the <hi>Apostles</hi> had an <hi>immediate revelation</hi> as to what they decreed in that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:101069:275"/>
It is very plain therefore, that when you say, <hi>General Councils neither have erred nor can err in their definitions,</hi> they usurp as great a priviledge thereby as ever the <hi>Apostles</hi> had, and in order to it must have as <hi>immediate</hi> an <hi>inspiration.</hi> For, never was there any such <hi>Infallibility,</hi> either in the <hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>Apostles,</hi> as did suppose an <hi>absolute impossibility of errour</hi>; but it was wholly <hi>hypothetical</hi> in case of <hi>Divine assistance,</hi> which hindred them from any capacity of erring so long as that continued with them and no longer. For, <hi>inspiration</hi> was no <hi>permanent habit,</hi> but a <hi>transient act</hi> in them; and that being removed, they were lyable to errours as well as others; from whence it follows, that where <hi>revelations</hi> were most <hi>immediate,</hi> they did no more then what you assume to your <hi>Church,</hi> viz. <hi>preserve them from actual errour in declaring Gods will.</hi> So that nothing can be more evident then that you challenge as great an <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and as <hi>immediate assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> in <hi>Councils</hi> as ever the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> had. And therefore that <hi>Divine</hi> was in the right, of whom <hi>Canus</hi> speaks,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Canus l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> who assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That since General Councils were Infallible, their definitions ought to be equalled with the Scriptures themselves.</hi> And although <hi>Canus</hi> and others dislike this, it is rather because of the <hi>odium</hi> which would follow it, than for any just <hi>reason</hi> they give, why it should not follow. For they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suppose as great a <hi>Certainty</hi> or <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Decrees</hi> of both, but an equal <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>internal assent</hi> in those to whom they are declared. Which doth further prove, that the <hi>revelation</hi> must be <hi>immediate:</hi> for if by vertue of those <hi>definitions,</hi> we are obliged to <hi>assent</hi> to the Doctrines contained in them as Infallibly true, there must be an <hi>immediate Divine Authority</hi> which must command our <hi>Assent.</hi> For nothing short of that can oblige us to believe any thing as of <hi>Divine revelation</hi>; now <hi>Councils</hi> require, that we must believe their <hi>definitions</hi> to be <hi>Divine truths,</hi> though men were not <hi>obliged</hi> to believe them to be so, before those <hi>definitions.</hi> For that is your express Doctrine, <hi>That though the matters decreed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were in some manner revealed before, yet not so as to oblige all men with an explicite assent to believe them</hi>; but after the definitions of <hi>Councils</hi> they are bound to do it. So that though there be not an <hi>object</hi> newly <hi>revealed,</hi> yet there ariseth a <hi>new obligation</hi> to <hi>internal assent</hi>; which <hi>obligation</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come but from <hi>immediate Divine Authority.</hi> If you say, <hi>The obligation comes not simply by vertue of the Councils definitions, but by a command ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in Scripture, whereby all are bound to give this assent to the decrees of Councils</hi>; I then say, we must be excused from it, till you have discharged this <hi>new obligation</hi> upon your self, by producing some express testimony of <hi>Scripture</hi> to that purpose: which is, I think, sufficient to keep our minds at liberty from this <hi>internal assent</hi> to the definitions of <hi>General Councils</hi> by vertue of any <hi>Infallibility</hi> in them. And thus having more at large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the nature of this <hi>Infallibility</hi> which you challenge to <hi>General Councils,</hi> and having shewed that it implyes as <hi>immediate a revelation</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> had; the second thing is sufficiently demonstrated, <hi>That this Infallibility cannot suppose discursiveness with fallibility in the use of the means,</hi> because these two are repugnant to each other.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be considered, is, <hi>Stapletons argument, why Councils must be Prophetical in the conclusion;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>because that which is determined by the Church is matter of Faith, and not of knowledge, and the assent required else would not be an assent of Faith, but an habit of knowledge.</hi> To which his Lordship Answers, <hi>That he sees no inconvenience in it, if it be granted; for one and the same conclusion may be Faith to the believer, that cannot prove;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 251.</note>

                  <hi>and knowledge to the learned, that can.</hi> Which he further explains thus: <hi>Some supernatural principles which reason cannot demonstrate simply, must be supposed in order to Faith; but, these principles being owned, reason being thereby inlightned, that may serve to convert or convince Philosophers, and the great men of reason in the very point of Faith where it is at the highest.</hi> This he brings down <hi>to the business of Councils; as to which,</hi> he saith, <hi>that the first immediate, fundamental points of Faith, as they cannot be proved simply by reason, so neither need they be determined by any Council, nor ever were they attempted, they are so plain set down in Scripture. If about the sense and true meaning of these, or necessary deduction out of the prime Articles of Faith, General Councils determine any thing, as they have done at</hi> Nice <hi>and the rest; there is no inconvenience, that one and the same Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil should be believed as it reflects upon the Articles and grounds indemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable; and yet known to the learned, by the means and proof, by which that deduction is vouched and made good. And again the conclusion of a Council, suppose that in</hi> Nice <hi>about the consubstantiality of Christ with the Father, in it self considered, is indemonstrable by reason; there</hi> (saith he) <hi>I believe, and assent in Faith: but the same conclusion if you give me the ground of Scripture and the Creed (for somewhat must be supposed in all whether Faith or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) is demonstrable by natural reason against any Arrian in the world.</hi> So that he concludes, <hi>The weaker sort of Christians may assent by Faith, where the more learned may build it on reason, the principles of Faith being supposed.</hi> This is the substance of his Lordships Discourse. In Answer to which, you tell us, <hi>That the Bishop seems to broach a new Doctrine, that the assent of Faith may be an habit of knowledge.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 265.</note> 
                  <hi>But surely</hi> (say you) <hi>Divine Faith is according to the Apostle,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>an Argument of things which do not appear,</hi> viz. <hi>by the same means, by which we give this assent of Faith: otherwise our Faith would not be free and meritorious.</hi> An Answer I must needs say, hugely suitable to your principles, who are most concerned of all men to set <hi>reason</hi> at a distance from Faith; and so you do sufficiently in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of it. For it is no easie matter to understand what you mean, but that is not to be wondered at, since you make <hi>obscurity</hi> so necessary to <hi>Faith. Divine Faith is</hi> (you say) <hi>an Argument of things which do not appear,</hi> viz. <hi>by the same means, by which we give this assent of Faith.</hi> Do you mean that the <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>Faith do not appear?</hi> or that the <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>believing</hi> doth not? If only the former, which is all the <hi>Apostle</hi> means; that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to your purpose, for we are not enquiring, whether men may not believe <hi>the things which are not seen,</hi> but, whether the <hi>assent</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> may not be <hi>consistent</hi> with <hi>reason:</hi> which I am so far from thinking any strange doctrine, that I cannot see how there can be an <hi>assent</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>reason.</hi> And they must be such great <hi>meriters at Gods hands,</hi> as you are, who must think to oblige him with believing what you cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, or see any ground in reason for. For, <hi>assent</hi> being an <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> cannot be elicited without sufficient reason, perswading the mind to it; or else, it is <hi>so far from being free,</hi> and as you (who are so loath to be beholding to <hi>God</hi>) call it, <hi>meritorious,</hi> that it is brutish and irrational. Not that there are <hi>demonstrations</hi> to be expected for every thing we <hi>believe,</hi> but there must be sufficient <hi>reason</hi> for the <hi>mind</hi> to build its <hi>assent</hi> upon, and that <hi>reason</hi> is <hi>evidence,</hi> and that <hi>evidence</hi> destroyes that <hi>obscurity</hi> which you make necessary to Faith. <hi>Evidence,</hi> I say, not of the <hi>object,</hi> but of the <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>assent.</hi> When you say, <hi>That Faith, as Faith, cannot be Knowledge,</hi> his Lordship grants it; but yet it doth not thence follow, that
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:101069:276"/>
what may be believed by one may not be known by another: and <hi>though Christ</hi> (as you add) <hi>did not set up a School of knowledge but of Faith,</hi> yet he did not set up a <hi>School of blind implicite Faith,</hi> but such a one as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of a rational and discursive act of the mind. You must not therefore expect that we should believe the definitions of <hi>Councils</hi> because they pretend to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> but you must first convince our <hi>reasons</hi> that they are so, and then we shall assent to them. But you have very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived your business, to have an <hi>obscure, implicite Faith,</hi> for such <hi>Doctrines</hi> which are so far from any <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>Reason.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of the use and Authority of General Councils.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The denying the Infallibility of General Councils takes not away their use and Authority. Of the submission due to them by all particular persons. How far external obedience is required in case they err. No violent opposition to be made against them. Rare Inconveniences hinder not the effect of a just power. It cannot rationally be supposed, that such General Councils as are here meant should often or dangerously err. The true notion of a General Council explained. The Freedom requisite in the proceedings of it. The Rule it must judge by. Great difference between external obedience, and internal assent to the Decrees of Councils. This latter unites men in errour, not the former. As great uncertainties supposing General Councils Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as not. Not so great certainty requisite for submission as Faith. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Romanists Doctrine of the Infallibility of Councils, or ours, tend more to the Churches peace? St. <hi>Austin</hi> explained. The Keyes according to him given to the Church. No unremediable inconvenience, supposing a General Councilerr. But errours in Faith are so, supposing them Infallible when they are not. The Church hath power to reverse the Decrees of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils. The power of Councils not by Divine Institution. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of making the Infallibility of Councils depend on the Popes confirmation. No consent among the Romanists about the subject of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, whether in Pope or Council. No evidence from Scripture, Reason, or
Antiquity, for the Popes personal Infallibility.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>first question</hi> being thus dispatched, I now come to the <hi>second,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> which is, <hi>Of what Vse and Authority General Councils are in the Church, supposing them not Infallible?</hi> And here again two things are to be examined; first, <hi>How far General Councils are to be submitted to.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Whether our opinion or yours tend more to the peace of the Church</hi>; for both these his Lordship handles distinctly, and so shall we. For the first, nothing is more necessary then throughly to understand his Lordships meaning, which he most fully delivers in these words.<note place="margin">P. 245.</note> 
                  <hi>General Councils lawfully called and ordered and lawfully proceeding, are a great and awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, and cannot err in matters of Faith, keeping themselves to Gods rule, and not attempting to make a new one of their own; and are with all submission to be observed by every Christian, where Scripture, or evident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, comes not against them.</hi> Two things you mainly object against this opinion. 1. <hi>That in case such a Council err, it tends only to unite men in errour.</hi> 2. <hi>Who shall be Judge of all those conditions implyed in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:101069:277"/>
proceedings?</hi> to these two, all that I can find material scattered up and down in your Discourse on this Subject, may be reduced. For the <hi>first,</hi> we must consider the occasion of his Lordships entrance into this <hi>subject</hi> concerning <hi>General Councils, how far they may err, or not,</hi> which he saith, <hi>is a question of great consequence in the Church of God. For to say they cannot err,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 223.</note> 
                  <hi>leaves the Church not only without remedy against an errour once determin'd; but also without sense that it may need a remedy, and so without care to seek it, which is the misery of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>at this day. To say they can err, seems to expose the members of the Church to an uncertainty and wavering in the Faith, to make unquiet Spirits not only to disrespect former Councils of the Church, but also to slight and contemn whatsoever they may now determine.</hi> So that, great inconveniencies appearing on both sides, his Lordship endeavours to steer his course so as not to dash on the <hi>rocks</hi> of either side, by betraying the <hi>Churches Faith</hi> in asserting their <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or the <hi>Churches peace</hi> by acknowledging them <hi>fallible.</hi> But as he could not see any <hi>reason</hi> to believe them <hi>Infallible,</hi> so neither could he see any <hi>necessity</hi> that the <hi>Churches peace</hi> should be broken, supposing them not to be so. And the most obvious objection being, <hi>If a General Council be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, what is to be done in case it should err?</hi> For that, he propounds this <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, That the determination of a General Council erring was to stand in force,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 224.</note> 
                  <hi>and to have external obedience at the least yielded to it, till evidence of Scripture, or a demonstration to the contrary made the errour appear; and untill thereupon another Council of equal authority did reverse it.</hi> And he after explains what he means by this <hi>external obedience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 226.</note> viz. <hi>That which consists in silence, patience, and forbearance yielded to it:</hi> which he builds on this reason, <hi>That Controversies arising in the Church must have some end or they'l tear all in sunder: therefore supposing a General Council should err, and an erring Decree be by the Law it self invalid, I would have it,</hi> (saith he) <hi>wisely considered again (supposing the Council not to err in Fundamental Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) whether it be not fit to allow a General Council that honour and priviledge, which all other great Courts have; Namely that there be a declaration of the invalidity of its decrees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 227.</note> 
                  <hi>as well as of the Laws of other Courts, before private men can take liberty to refuse obedience.</hi> Therefore he concludes, <hi>That this seems most fit and necessary for the peace of Christendom, unless in case the errour be manifest and intolerable, or that the whole Church upon peaceable and just complaint of this errour neglect or refuse to call a Council to examine it: and there come in National and Provincial Councils to reform for themselves.</hi> These words contain the full account of his Lordships opinion, which you charge with so <hi>many interclashings and inconveniences.</hi> The first of which is, <hi>That it tends only to oblige all the members of the Church to an Vnity in errour against Scripture and demonstration,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 242.</note> 
                  <hi>during their whole lives, or rather to the worlds end; since such an</hi> Utopian <hi>rectifying Council as the Bishop here fancies, is morally impossible ever to be had; and therefore you call it a strange (not not say an impious) doctrine, advanced without authority of Gods Word, or Antiquity, nay contrary to all solid reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being a charge of the highest nature and manag'd with such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable confidence,<note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> we must somewhat further enquire into the grounds of his Lordships opinion, to see whether it be guilty of these crimes or no. There are three things therefore must be cleared in order to his Lordships Vindication. 1. The design of his <hi>Discourse.</hi> 2. The suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions he makes as to the proceedings of the <hi>Council.</hi> 3. The <hi>obligation</hi> of its decrees supposing that it should err.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="535" facs="tcp:101069:277"/>1. <hi>The design of his discourse</hi> is to be considered; which is to remedy a supposable inconvenience, and to provide for the <hi>Churches peace.</hi> For the first question in debate was, <hi>Whether a General Council might err, or no.</hi> In which his Lordship gives sufficient evidence from <hi>Scripture, Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> that it might. But then here comes an inconvenience to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; for his <hi>Adversary</hi> objects, <hi>What are we then nearer to Vnity after a Council hath determin'd, supposing it may err?</hi> To this his Lordship suits his Answer: wherein we ought to consider, that the inconvenience objected is, on his Lordships <hi>suppositions,</hi> one of the <hi>rara contingentia</hi>; and such a one ought not to destroy a principle of <hi>Government</hi> in all other cases useful and necessary. For there cannot possibly be any way thought of for peace and <hi>Government,</hi> but there may be a supposition made of some notable inconvenience; but that not being necessary, nor immediately consequent upon it, but something which may happen and far more probably may not, it ought not to hinder the obtaining of that, which is generally both use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and necessary. To give you a parallel case to this: It is granted on all hands that the <hi>civil authority</hi> of a Nation is Fallible, and therefore we may suppose it actually to err, and that so far as to bind men by Law to something in it self unlawful. Will you say now, that the intent of <hi>civil authority</hi> is to bind men necessarily to sin? I hope, you will not: but by this you may easily see the <hi>fallacy</hi> of your arguing against his Lordship; for it is an Inconvenience indeed supposable, but not at all <hi>necessary</hi>; if he had said indeed, that <hi>General Councils</hi> must necessarily err, your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been strong against him; but as it is, it hath no more force against his assertion, then the supposition before made hath against civil authority. For that case may be easily put, that such a <hi>Law</hi> may pass; but, doth this hinder men from their <hi>obligation</hi> to duty and submission to a just authority? or, Will you have men presently to renounce obedience, and to repeal such a <hi>Law</hi> themselves, and not rather in all wayes of duty and reverence to authority make known their just complaints and desire a redress by the hands of Supream authority? And this is all which his Lordship aims at, that in case a <hi>General Council</hi> should err (which is not easily imaginable upon his suppositions) it tends more to the <hi>Churches peace</hi> for private men not to oppose the Decrees of it, but to endeavour that another <hi>General Council</hi> be called to repeal it, and till then to preserve the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, supposing the errour not manifest or intolerable. In this case then there are two inconveniences put: the one of them is, That when a <hi>Council</hi> is supposed to err, every particular man may be at liberty to oppose the Decrees of it, and so put the <hi>Church</hi> into confusion; the other is, That though private men may know it to be an errour, yet they should be patient till the <hi>Church</hi> by another <hi>Council</hi> may repeal it: now these two inconveniences being laid together, the question is, Which is the greater? His Lordship with a great deal of <hi>reason</hi> judges the former to be: because in the latter case it is only a <hi>silencing</hi> of some less necessary <hi>truth</hi> for some time; but in the other it is an exposing the <hi>Church</hi> to the fury of mens turbulent <hi>Spirits.</hi> But that which shews the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your objection, <hi>That this is the way to bind the Church to an union in errour,</hi> is, that this doth not necessarily follow from his Lordships opinion, but is only a case supposable: and no rare Inconvenience ought to prejudice a general good: And the peace of the <hi>Church</hi> in such a case ought to be preferred before private mens satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note>But this will further appear, if we consider, <hi>secondly,</hi> the <hi>Suppositions</hi> his Lordship makes; for by that we shall see, how rarely incident this case is: for, I hope, the supposing that a <hi>General Council</hi> may erre, doth not suppose that it must necessarily erre; and granting those things which are supposed by him, it is a rare case that it should erre. For these things are by him supposed. 1. <hi>That it must be a Council lawfully called and ordered</hi>; and so, not such Councils as that of <hi>Trent</hi> was, or any like it; wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> gives only a <hi>General Summons,</hi> and that it must be called a <hi>General Council</hi> on that account, how few <hi>Bishops</hi> soever appear in it, nay, though the far greatest part of the <hi>Christian</hi> world be excluded from it: but it must be such a <hi>Council</hi> as may be acknowledged to be <hi>General,</hi> by the <hi>general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> of the <hi>Christian world.</hi> For that we would make our <hi>Judge</hi> in the case; as it was in the four first <hi>General Councils.</hi> Not that we would stand upon <hi>Bishops</hi> being actually present from every particular <hi>Church,</hi> but that such a number be present from the greatest <hi>Churches,</hi> as may make it not be suspected to be meerly a <hi>Faction,</hi> packed together for the <hi>Interess</hi> of some potent <hi>Prelate</hi>; but that they do so indifferently meet from all parts, that there may be no just ground of suspicion, that they design any thing but the common good of the Christian world. And therefore we acknowledge the first <hi>four General Councils</hi> to be truly such, in our present sense; neither do we quarrel at them, because so few <hi>Bishops</hi> were present, who lived out of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi>; for, supposing the <hi>Church</hi> at the same freedom from particular <hi>Interesses</hi> that it was then, and so great a number of <hi>Bishops</hi> assembled together, we look on it to be <hi>so great and awful a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation,</hi> that its determinations ought not to be opposed by any <hi>factious</hi> or turbulent <hi>Spirits.</hi> And in case some <hi>Bishops</hi> be not present from some <hi>Churches,</hi> whether <hi>Eastern</hi> or <hi>Western,</hi> yet if upon the publishing those <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> they be <hi>universally accepted,</hi> that doth, <hi>ex post-facto,</hi> make the <hi>Council</hi> truly <hi>Occumenical.</hi> By this you see, what we mean by a <hi>General Council.</hi> And, for <hi>the calling of it</hi>; though we say, it should be by the consent of the chief <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> yet the right and custom of the ancient <hi>Church,</hi> clearly carries it, that it ought to be summoned by the authority of <hi>Christian Princes:</hi> for, nothing can be more evident to such, who will not shut their eyes against the clearest evidence, than that the first <hi>General Councils</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Pope</hi> had got the better of the <hi>Emperours</hi>) were summoned by the <hi>Emperours</hi> command and authority; and since the division of the <hi>Empire</hi> into so many <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Principalities,</hi> the consent of <hi>Christian Princes</hi> is necessary on the same grounds. Neither ought it only to be a <hi>General Council,</hi> and <hi>lawfully called,</hi> but <hi>lawfully ordered too, viz.</hi> that no <hi>Prelate</hi> challenge himself such a <hi>Presidency</hi> not in, but over the <hi>Council,</hi> that his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions</hi> must be looked on as the only <hi>Chart</hi> they must <hi>steer</hi> their <hi>course</hi> by; and that nothing be debated, but <hi>proponentibus Legatis,</hi> as it was at <hi>Trent:</hi> for these things take away utterly that <hi>Freedom</hi> which is necessary for a <hi>General Council.</hi> And therefore his Lordship justly requires, 2. <hi>That the Council do proceed lawfully</hi>; which it cannot do, if it be <hi>over-awed,</hi> as the <hi>second Ephesine</hi> was by <hi>Dioscorus</hi> and his party; or if practices be used, as at <hi>Ariminum:</hi> but there must be the greatest freedom in debates, no canvasing for votes, but every one suffered to deliver his judgement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice or partiality, that those who give their judegements, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their reasons before, and not only appear <hi>in Pontificalibus,</hi> to give their <hi>Placet.</hi> That the <hi>Bishops</hi> present, be men of unquestionable abilities, and generally presumed to be well acquainted with the matters to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:101069:278"/>
there: For otherwise nothing would be more easie, than for the more subtil men, under ambiguous expressions, and fair pretences to bring over a great number of the rest to them, who want either judgement or learning enough to discern their designs. And this is supposed to be the case of the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> where the <hi>Occidental Bishops,</hi> for want of <hi>learning</hi> were over-reached by the subtilty of the <hi>Arrian party.</hi> 3. His Lordship supposes, <hi>That this Council keeps it self to Gods Rule, and not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make a new one of their own</hi>: For in so doing they commit an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the <hi>first Concoction,</hi> which will be <hi>incorrigible</hi> afterwards. And this is not only reasonable, but just and necessary, because nothing can be a Rule of Faith, but what is of immediate <hi>divine Revelation</hi>; and this hath been the practice of the first <hi>General Councils,</hi> which never owned or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by any other Rule of <hi>Faith</hi> but this. These things being supposed, May we not justly say, That an erring determination of such a <hi>Council</hi> so proceeding, is a <hi>rare case?</hi> Since we believe, that <hi>God</hi> will not deny to any particular person (who doth sincerely seek it) the <hi>knowledge of his truth,</hi> much less may we think he will do it to such an <hi>awful Representation of the Church,</hi> when assembled together purposely for finding out that truth, which may be of so great consequence to the <hi>Christian world.</hi> For both the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Gods promises,</hi> the <hi>goodness of God</hi> to his <hi>people,</hi> and his <hi>peculiar care</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> seem highly concerned, that such a <hi>Council</hi> should not be guilty of any notorious errour.</p>
               <p>But, because we deny not, but such a <hi>Council</hi> is fallible, therefore we grant the case may be put, that such a <hi>Council</hi> may erre;<note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> and the Question is, What is to be done then? <hi>Whether every particular person may oppose such a determination, or submit till another Council reverse the Decrees of it.</hi> His Lordship asserts the latter; and so we come to the effect of such an erring Decree, which was the third thing to be spoken to. As to which, these things must be considered, 1. That he doth not assert, that men are bound to <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of that <hi>Decree,</hi> but not <hi>openly to oppose it.</hi> For so he speaks expresly of <hi>external obedience,</hi> and <hi>at least so far as it consists in silence, patience, and forbearance yielded to it.</hi> And therefore you are greatly deceived, when with such confidence you assert, <hi>That this obliges all the members of the Church to unity in errour</hi>; for that is only consequent upon your principle, that the Decrees of <hi>General Councils</hi> are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by an <hi>internal Assent:</hi> for this indeed would necessarily oblige them to <hi>unity in errour</hi>; but the most that is consequent on his Lordships Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is, that in such cases wherein a <hi>General Council</hi> hath erred, men ought rather to be <hi>silent</hi> for a time as to some <hi>truth,</hi> than to break the <hi>Churches peace.</hi> In the mean time he doth not deny, but that men may be bound to follow their own <hi>judgements</hi> in the discovery of truth; nay, and they may use all means consistent with the <hi>Churches peace,</hi> to promote that <hi>truth</hi>; for he allows that <hi>just complaints may be made to the Church for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing the decrees of the former Council,</hi> and this cannot be without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the errour of that <hi>Council.</hi> And I hope this liberty of dissent and just complaint, is sufficient to keep all the members of the Church from being united in <hi>Errour.</hi> And, I pray Sir, What cause is there now for such <hi>hideous out-cryes, that this is such a strange and impious Doctrine, against Scripture, Antiquity, and solid Reason,</hi> which appears, for all that I can see, very just and reasonable, taking it in the way which he explains himself in. But, whereas you object, <hi>That this will keep men in errour to the worlds end, because such a Council is morally impossible</hi>; it is easie to shew
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:101069:279"/>
you, that if the <hi>rectifying Council</hi> be impossible; the <hi>General erring Council</hi> is equally impossible; therefore there is no danger coming that way nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And that such <hi>General Councils</hi> are grown such morally impossible things, we may in a great measure thank your <hi>Church</hi> for it, which hates as much such a <hi>true rectifying Council</hi> (as you call it) as the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> does a <hi>thorow Reformation.</hi> For, all your design is, to perswade men, that those only are <hi>General Councils,</hi> which have the <hi>Popes Summons,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he rules, and, in effect, does all; and to perswade men to believe the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> of such <hi>Councils,</hi> is the most effectual way in the world to <hi>unite men in the belief of errours to the worlds end.</hi> For, as long as the <hi>Popes</hi> Interest can carry it, to be sure, all <hi>rectifying Councils,</hi> shall be (as you say) <hi>Vtopian</hi> too; for he will prevent, if possible, their ever appearing in <hi>Europe.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all this discourse of his Lordship doth suppose such a state of the <hi>Church,</hi> as that was in the time of the <hi>Nicene Councils,</hi> and after; when there might be a liberty of calling such <hi>Councils,</hi> that in case one errs, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might be summoned to reverse it. But this is not to be expected <hi>in faece Romuli,</hi> in this state of the <hi>Christian world,</hi> that there should be such a <hi>General Council</hi> so called, and so proceeding as he supposes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no such danger of <hi>being united in errour,</hi> by vertue of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees; but if the state of things would bear such a <hi>Council</hi> so decreeing, we might as well think it would bear another to reverse it, if need were, and then his Lordships supposition would come to act, that in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of those <hi>Councils,</hi> private men ought not to oppose the Decrees of the former, but patiently wait till the latter <hi>reverse</hi> them. But, as things are now in the Christian world, his Lordship doth not suppose that any <hi>Council</hi> hath such a power to oblige, because it calls it self a <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>; but a truly <hi>General Council</hi> being, as you say, morally impossible, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is left but that the <hi>Church</hi> reform it self by parts, and wait to give an account of its proceedings therein, till such a <hi>General Council</hi> as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described, be assembled in the Christian world. Thus we see, how vain and empty your first Objection is, <hi>That from his Lordships opinion, it would follow, that the Church must be united in errour,</hi> which is only the direct consequent of your own assertion, that men are bound to believe the <hi>Decrees</hi> of those you call <hi>General Councils to be Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your next great Objection is, <hi>That this Doctrine exposes all to uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>for, Who shall be judge, whether it be a lawful Council, and proceeds law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully? Whether the errours be fundamental and intolerable or no? Whether there be Scripture and demonstration against them or no? For, if every man be judge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 242, &amp;c. P. 260, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>there can be no such submission to any General Council.</hi> This is the force of the many words, which, in several places, you spend upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and therefore I shall consider them together. I answer therefore, 1. In general, if this be so intolerable an inconvenience, it is unavoidable upon your own principles: and therefore it is unreasonable to object that to another, which you cannot quit your self of. For you say, That the <hi>Infallibility of General Councils confirmed by the Pope,</hi> is the best way to end Controversies; but there is not one term in the main Proposition, but is liable to the same uncertainty which you here object to his Lordship; for, 1. You do not say, that all <hi>Councils</hi> are Infallible, but only <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> Who then shall be judge, whether the <hi>Council</hi> you would have me believe, be <hi>General</hi> or no? You do not say, that all must be there to make a <hi>General Council,</hi> but the <hi>Popes General Summons</hi> is sufficient: But, <hi>Who must be judge,</hi> whether that be sufficient or no? You say so; but, I see no
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:101069:279"/>
reason for it, Must you be my <hi>judge,</hi> or I my own? If I may be my own judge, so must every one else, and so every man is left to believe what <hi>Councils to be General</hi> he please himself. 2. You say, <hi>General Councils are Infallible:</hi> Who must be <hi>judge</hi> of that too? Must the <hi>Council</hi> be infallibly believed in it? But that is the thing in <hi>Question.</hi> Must the <hi>Pope</hi> be judge? <hi>But no man</hi> (you say) <hi>is bound to believe him Infallible without the Council.</hi> Must the <hi>Scripture</hi> be judge? But, Who must judge what the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> is? 3. Who must be <hi>judge</hi> in what sense, and how far the <hi>Council</hi> is <hi>Infallible?</hi> Who must <hi>judge,</hi> how the <hi>Council</hi> comes to be <hi>Infallible</hi> in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> that was fallible in the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>means?</hi> And when any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie arises concerning the <hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> Who must be <hi>judge,</hi> which is the Infallible <hi>sense</hi> of them? for there is but one <hi>sense Infallible,</hi> though the words may bear many, and unless I know which is the <hi>Infallible sense,</hi> I am not bound to yield my <hi>assent</hi> to it. But, Who must decide this? The <hi>Council</hi> cannot; for that leaves no exposition with the decrees. The <hi>Pope</hi> cannot; for he is not <hi>Infallible</hi> without the <hi>Council.</hi> So that still it falls to every mans private reason, to judge of it. 4. Who must be judge, that the <hi>Popes Confirmation</hi> is necessary to make the Decrees <hi>Infallible?</hi> Not the <hi>Council</hi> without the <hi>Pope,</hi> not the <hi>Pope</hi> without the <hi>Council</hi>; for, you say, <hi>We are not bound to believe them Infallible, but as they are together.</hi> And together they cannot, for that is the Question, <hi>Why not a Council without the Popes Confirmation, as well as with it?</hi> and, When did <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> determine, that no <hi>Council</hi> without the <hi>Pope,</hi> is Infallible? but the contrary hath been determined by a <hi>Council, viz. that a Council is above the Pope,</hi> and consequently needs not his Confirmation. So that for all your pretending to end Controversies, you leave men at as great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties as any whatsoever. Being not able to resolve some of the most necessary Questions, in order to the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, according to your own principles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I answer more particularly, that his Lordships opinion doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose near to so great <hi>uncertainties</hi> as yours doth; upon this reason,<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> because you requiring an <hi>internal assent</hi> to the Decrees of <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>Infallible Certainty</hi> in all that men believe, must of necessity leave men in the greatest <hi>perplexities,</hi> where you cannot give them that kind of <hi>Certainty</hi> on which they may build their Faith; but, his Lordship only requiring <hi>external obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to the Decrees of <hi>Councils,</hi> a far less degree of <hi>Certainty</hi> will be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. That is, such a kind of <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> as things of that nature are capable of. You ask then, <hi>Who shall be judge, whether a Council were lawfully called, and did lawfully proceed or no?</hi> I answer, let every man be judge according to the general sense and reason of mankind. If there were sufficient authority for calling them together, according to the known pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Church</hi>; if there was no plain ground of <hi>suspicion</hi> of any <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises</hi> by the power of any particular <hi>Prelate</hi>; no complaints made of it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in, or after the <hi>Council</hi>; if there be no plain evidence that it takes any other Rules for its Decrees, but the <hi>Scripture,</hi> then we say, They are bound to yield <hi>external obedience</hi> to them, supposing the <hi>Council</hi> general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received in the Christian world for a <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>General Council.</hi> If you ask again, <hi>How should it be known when errours are manifest and intolerable, and when not?</hi> We here appeal to <hi>Scripture</hi> interpreted by the concurrent sense of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> the <hi>common reason</hi> of mankind (supposing the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>) the consent of wise and learned men; which certainly will prevent the exorbitances and capricious humours of
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:101069:280"/>
any phantastical <hi>Spirits,</hi> which may cry out, That the most received <hi>truths,</hi> ever since Christianity was in the world, are <hi>intolerable errours.</hi> If you are resolved yet further to ask, <hi>Who shall be judge what a necessary reason or demonstration is?</hi> His Lordship tells you, I think plain enough, from <hi>Hooker,</hi> what is understood by it, <hi>viz. such as being proposed to any man, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, the mind cannot chuse but inwardly assent to it.</hi> And, Do you require any other judge but a mans own reason in this case? But, you say, <hi>Others call their arguments demonstrations</hi>; but let them submit to this way of tryal, and they may soon be convinced that they are not. Still you say, <hi>They will not be convinced, but will break the peace of the Church, supposing they have sufficient evidence for what they say.</hi> But if men will be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, who can help it? Can you, with telling them <hi>Councils</hi> are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible? I doubt you would hear of more arguments than you could well satisfie against that presently. We appeal then to the common <hi>reason</hi> of mankind, Whether it be not a far probable way to end <hi>Controversies,</hi> to perswade men in disputable matters, to yield <hi>external obedience</hi> to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of a <hi>lawful General Council,</hi> than to tell them, they are bound to believe whatever they decree to be <hi>infallibly true?</hi> And therefore you are very much mistaken,<note place="margin">P. 262.</note> 
                  <hi>when you say, His Lordship declines the main Question,</hi> which is, <hi>of the necessity of submitting to a living Judge, or a definitive sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in case two parties, equal for learning and integrity, both pretend to equal evidence for what they say</hi>; for his Lordship doth not deny, but that in such a case the submitting to a definitive sentence, may be a reasonable way to end the <hi>Controversie</hi>; but then the difference between you lyes in two things. 1. That you would bind men to <hi>internal assent</hi> to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of a <hi>Council,</hi> as being <hi>Infallible</hi>; but his Lordship saith, They bind to <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obedience,</hi> as being the <hi>Supremest Judicatory can be expected in the Church.</hi> 2. You pretend, <hi>that Councils called and confirmed by the Pope, are thus In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and our Supreme Judge in matters of Faith</hi>; his Lordship justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that, and sayes, That a <hi>Free General Council observing the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the first did, is the only equal and indifferent Judge.</hi> So that the Question is not so much, Whether shall be a <hi>living Judge</hi>? as, Who shall be he? and, How far the definitive <hi>Sentence</hi> binds? and, What is to be done, in case there cannot be a free and indifferent Judge? for in this case we say, Every <hi>Church</hi> is bound to regard her own purity and peace, and, in case of <hi>corruptions,</hi> to proceed to a <hi>Reformation</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note>We now come to the remaining <hi>Enquiry,</hi> which is, <hi>Whether your Doctrine, or ours, tends more to the Churches peace?</hi> For clearing of this, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship premises these things by way of <hi>Considerations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 253.</note> 1. <hi>That there is n necessity of any such Infallibility in the Church, as was in the Apostles.</hi> 2. <hi>That what Infallibility or Authority belongs to the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 254.</note> 
                  <hi>doth primarily reside in the whole body of the Church, and not in a General Council.</hi> 3. <hi>That in case a General Council erre, the whole Church hath full Authority to represent her self in another Council,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 256.</note> 
                  <hi>and so to redress what was amiss either practised, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</hi> And so upon these principles his Lordship saith, <hi>Here is a sufficient remedy for what is amiss, and yet no infringing any lawful Authority in the Church; and yet he grants, as the Church of</hi> England <hi>doth, that a General Council may erre.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 257.</note> But he saith, <hi>It doth not follow, because the Church may erre, therefore she may not govern. For the Church hath not only a Pastoral Power to teach and direct, but a Praetorian also, to controll and censure too where errours or crimes are against points fundamental, or of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> Thus he represents the advantages which follow upon his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:101069:280"/>
after which he comes to the disadvantages of yours. But we must first consider, what you have to object against what his Lordship hath here delivered. To the first you say nothing, but that <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> attribute more <hi>Infallibility</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> than his Lordship doth,<note place="margin">P. 266.</note> which is an excellent way to prove the necessity of it, if you had first proved those two Authours Infallible. To the second, your Answer is more large; for his Lordship to confirm what he said, That the power and authority given by Christ, lyes in the whole <hi>Church,</hi> produces that saying of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> That S. <hi>Peter did not receive the Keyes of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>but as sustaining the person of the Church</hi>; from whence he proves against <hi>Stapleton, That it is not to be understood finally only for the good of the Church, but that the primary and formal right is in the Church. For he that receives a thing in the person of another, receives it indeed to his good and use, but in his right too.</hi> To this you answer from <hi>Bellarmin, That there is a twofold representing or bearing the person of another, The one Parabolical,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>and by way of meer figure and supposition only; as</hi> Agar <hi>represented the people of the Jews under bondage of the Law, &amp;c. The other historical and real,</hi> viz. <hi>when the person representing, has right or relation</hi> √† parte rei, <hi>in and towards the thing represented, by vertue whereof, it bears the person of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented: Now S. Peter,</hi> say you, <hi>sustained the person of the Church in this latter sense, really and historically, and not parabolically, and in figure,</hi> i. e. <hi>he received the Keyes as Head of the Church; though that Reception were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the good of the whole Church.</hi> But Sir, our enquiry is not, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies one may imagine a <hi>Representation</hi> to be made, but, What kind of Representation that is, which is suitable to S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s meaning? That there may be an <hi>Allegorical Representation,</hi> no body denies: but I cannot imagine, How it can belong to this place; or, Who ever meant that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> stood here for an <hi>Allegory</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore the members of your distinction are not apposite. For those who assert, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> did sustain the person of the <hi>Church,</hi> in his Lordships sense, do yet acknowledge that he did it <hi>historic√®,</hi> and not <hi>parabolic√®,</hi> as you speak, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>donation</hi> was <hi>really</hi> made to him; but then the Question is, In what <hi>right</hi> or <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> it was made to him, Whether in his <hi>personal</hi> or <hi>representative</hi> capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? For, these are the two only proper members of a distinction here. St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, not only in that place, but in very many others, that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did sustain the <hi>person of the Church, when Christ said to him,</hi>

                  <hi>I will give thee the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; Now the Question is, In what sense he sustained the <hi>person</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> You say, In his <hi>own right as Head of the Church</hi>; We say, As a <hi>publick person</hi> representing the <hi>Church,</hi> not <hi>parabolically</hi> (for that is no sustaining the <hi>person</hi> at all) but <hi>really</hi> and <hi>histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically.</hi> And that S. <hi>Austin</hi> means, As a <hi>publick person,</hi> appears by the other expressions in the places cited, that he did <hi>universam significare Ecclesiam,</hi> signifie the whole Church; and that those things which are spoken of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Non habent illustrem intellectum nisi cum referuntur ad Ecclesiam cujus ille agnoscitur in figur√¢ gest√¢sse personam, Have no clear sense, but when they are referred to the Church, whose person he did bear.</hi> Can you say this <hi>of a King, who receives the Keyes of a Town, whereof he takes possession for himself, though it be for the good of the Kingdom; that he signifies the whole Kingdom in it, and that it cannot have any clear sense, but when it is applied to the Kingdom which he represents?</hi> No, this cannot be; for the <hi>King</hi> takes possession in his own <hi>full right,</hi> and it is not the <hi>possession,</hi> but the <hi>administration,</hi> which is referred properly to the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> But this might be properly
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:101069:281"/>
said of a <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> that he takes possession of a <hi>Town</hi> in the person of the <hi>State,</hi> and that the proper sense is, that the <hi>State</hi> took <hi>possession,</hi> and he only representing it. So that the full right lyes in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> but he as <hi>chief member</hi> represents the whole. And this is that which S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> means, when he saith, That S. <hi>Peter</hi> represented the <hi>Church, propter primatum, for the Primacy</hi> which he had amongst the <hi>Apostles, i e.</hi> such a <hi>Primacy of order,</hi> whereby he was fittest to represent the whole <hi>Church.</hi> For it is impossible to conceive that he should mean that S. <hi>Peter</hi> should receive this as <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> when you acknowledge that he was not <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> till after the <hi>Keyes were given him.</hi> For, you say, The <hi>performance</hi> of <hi>Christ's Promise,</hi> in making him <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> was not till after his <hi>resurrection.</hi> But, Will you say, the <hi>Church</hi> had no power of the <hi>Keyes</hi> till then; and then only <hi>finally</hi> too, and not <hi>formally?</hi> What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came then of the power of the <hi>Keyes</hi> at S. <hi>Peters</hi> death, if only <hi>formally</hi> in him, and not in the <hi>Church?</hi> What becomes of them at the <hi>death</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Pope?</hi> Will you say, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth, that <hi>Christ</hi> takes them, and gives them to his Successour? But he must be sure to wait till the <hi>Cardinals</hi> agree, To whom he must give them. Nothing then could be further from S. <hi>Austin's</hi> meaning, than that S. <hi>Peter</hi> received the <hi>Keyes,</hi> as <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> and so, that he represented the <hi>Church</hi> only <hi>finally</hi>; whereas his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions carry it, that he means the <hi>formal right</hi> of them was conveyed to the <hi>Church,</hi> and that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was only a <hi>publick person,</hi> to receive them in the name of the <hi>Church.</hi> But, whatever S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s meaning was, the strength of his Lordships assertion doth not stand or fall with that; for there are arguments sufficient besides to prove, that the <hi>Authority</hi> for <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> was not committed <hi>formally</hi> to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> much less to any pretended successour, but that it primarily and formally resides in the whole <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And, were that the thing to be here dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you must not think to take it for granted, that if the <hi>Keyes</hi> were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven personally to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> by them was meant the <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the <hi>Church,</hi> exclusively of the other <hi>Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the third <hi>Consideration,</hi> you answer, <hi>That in case a General Council erre,<note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">P. 267.</note> there can be no redress for errour in Faith; for if one Council may erre, so may another, and a third, and a fourth, &amp;c.</hi> This indeed is very suitable to your Doctrine from the beginning, that a man can be <hi>certain</hi> of nothing but what it is impossible should be otherwise. I hope you are certain your self, you do not erre; but I suppose you do not think it <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> you should: So, although we do not think it impossible, a <hi>Council</hi> should erre, yet we may be certain it doth not: and, supposing it should, we do not say, It is impossible that a <hi>Council</hi> should not <hi>erre,</hi> so that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Council</hi> may correct the errour of the former. And doubtless men may be certain of it too; if, as his Lordship saith, <hi>plain Scripture, and evident demonstration</hi> be brought against the former errour. But these are strange Doctrines, that because a <hi>Council</hi> may erre, therefore a <hi>Council</hi> can never afford remedy against inconveniences. For, one great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is, the <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>Churches peace:</hi> that, is remedied by the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Authority</hi>; another is, <hi>errour in Faith,</hi> that may be remedied by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Council: No,</hi> say you, <hi>for that may erre too</hi>; but, Doth it follow that it <hi>must erre?</hi> or, Is it probable that it should erre? if the former <hi>errour</hi> be so discovered, and the <hi>Council</hi> so proceed as his Lordship supposes. For your other difficulty <hi>about the calling another General Council,</hi> I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered it already,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 268.</note> when I shewed, what we meant by a <hi>General Council,</hi>
                  <pb n="543" facs="tcp:101069:281"/>
and when it was <hi>lawfully call'd.</hi> When you after add, <hi>That the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver represented her self in another Council but where the former Council was unlawful; and instance in the Councils of</hi> Ariminum <hi>and</hi> Ephesus: you say the same which his Lordship doth, for these <hi>Councils</hi> were therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unlawful because <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>factious,</hi> and he never asserts the necessity of calling a <hi>new Council,</hi> but in those two cases. But if you would have us account none such, but whom you do, you must excuse us till we see greater reason for it then we do yet: and so likewise for what follows, that the <hi>Councils which rectified the errours of those were called by the Popes authority, as that of</hi> Trent <hi>and others were,</hi> which to speak mildly is a gross untruth.</p>
               <p>You urge from his Lordships granting, <hi>That the Church hath a Praetorian power to controul and censure too, where errours or crimes are against points Fundamental or of great consequence</hi>; that <hi>therefore he and all Protestants are justly censured by the Roman Church for opposing those Doctrines which are with her Fundamental and of great consequence.</hi> But still there is no difference with you between the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and the <hi>Catholick</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Papal Councils,</hi> and <hi>Free and General</hi>; between what she judges Fundamental, and what all are bound to judge so. If you prove then, that we are bound to rely only on the judgement of your <hi>Church,</hi> your conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is good; but otherwise it is tyed with a rope of sand, and therefore we do not fear the <hi>lashes</hi> of it. And the same fault runs through your subsequent discourse,<note place="margin">P. 269.</note> in which you suppose the <hi>Church Infallible in all she propounds,</hi> which you know is constantly denyed, and hath been at large disproved in our first Part. For, the ground of your <hi>resolution of Faith being removed,</hi> I see the Fabrick of your <hi>Church</hi> falls down with it. For take but away your pretence of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and your confounding the <hi>Catholick and Roman Church</hi>; all the rest moulders, as not being able to stand without them. But that is still your way, if any thing be said of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> we must presently understand it of yours; so that it cannot be said in any sense <hi>that the Church is without spot or wrinkle,</hi> but by you it must be understood presently of the <hi>Doctrine of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church universally received as a matter of Faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but till you prove not only your two former assertions, but that St. <hi>Austin</hi> understood those words ever in that sense, your vindication of that <hi>place</hi> in him concerning it, will appear utterly impertinent to your purpose. And his Lordships assertion may still stand good, <hi>That the Church on earth is not any freer from wrinkles in Doctrine and Discipline, then she is from spots in life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus vindicated his Lordships way from the objections you raised against it,<note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> we must now consider how well you vindicate your own from the <hi>unreasonableness</hi> he charges it with, in several particulars. 1. <hi>That if we suppose a General Council Infallible, and it prove not so,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 258.</note> 
                  <hi>but that an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in Faith be concluded; the same erring opinion, which makes it think it self Infallible, makes the errour of it irrevocable, and so leaves the Church without remedy.</hi> To this you Answer,<note place="margin">P. 269.</note> 
                  <hi>Grant false antecedents and false premises enow, and what absurdities will not be consequent, and fill up the conclusion?</hi> But you clearly mistake the present business; which is not, Whether <hi>Councils</hi> be Infallible or no? but, Whether opinion be lyable to greater Inconveniencies, that which asserts that they may, or that they cannot, err? Will you have your supposition of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> taken for a <hi>first principle,</hi> or a thing as true as the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> So you
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:101069:282"/>
would seem indeed, <hi>by the supposing the Scriptures not to be Gods Word,</hi> which you subjoyn as the <hi>parallel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 270.</note> 
                  <hi>to the supposing General Councils fallible.</hi> But will you say the one is as evident and built on as good reason, and as much agreed on among <hi>Christians,</hi> as the other is? I suppose, you will not: and therefore it was very absurd &amp; unreasonable to say, <hi>Supposing the Word of God were not so, errours would be irrevocable, as if General Councils were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Infallible and proved not so.</hi> But this is a Question you grant to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable among Christians, and will you not give us leave to make a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that it may prove not so? You must consider, we are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the <hi>conveniencies</hi> of these two <hi>opinions,</hi> and in that case it is necessary to make such suppositions: And let any reasonable man judge what opinion can be more pernicious to the <hi>Church</hi> then yours is, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it not to be true: for then it will be necessary for men to assent to the <hi>grossest errours,</hi> as the most <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible truths:</hi> and there can be no remedy imagin'd for the redress of them. If then the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of admitting it be so great, men had need look well to the grounds on which it is built. And I cannot see any reason men can have to admit any <hi>Infallible proponent in matters of Faith</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> but on as great and as clear evidence, as the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> had, that they were sent from <hi>God.</hi> For the danger may be as great to believe that to be <hi>Infallible</hi> which is not, as not to believe that to be <hi>Infallible</hi> which is: for the believing an errour to be a <hi>Divine truth,</hi> may be as dangerous to the <hi>souls</hi> of men, as the not believing something which is really revealed by <hi>God.</hi> But to be sure, those who see no reason to believe a <hi>General Council</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> cannot be obliged to <hi>assent</hi> to <hi>errours</hi> propounded by it; but such who believe it <hi>Infallible</hi> must what ever the errours be, swallow them down, without questioning the truth of them. And it argues how conscious you are of the falseness of your <hi>principles,</hi> that you are so loath to have them examined, or so much as a supposition made that they should not prove true: Whereas <hi>truth</hi> alwayes invites men to the most accurate search into it. We see the <hi>Apostles</hi> bid men <hi>search,</hi> whether the things they spake were <hi>true</hi> or no; and those are most commended who did it most, and I hope men were as much bound to believe them <hi>Infallible</hi> as <hi>General Councils.</hi> But we see how unreasonable you are, you would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude such things upon mens Faith, which must lead them into unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>errours</hi> if false, and yet not allow men the liberty of examination, whether they be <hi>true</hi> or no. But such proceedings are so far from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing your cause, that nothing can more prejudice it among rational and inquisitive men.</p>
               <p>His Lordship for the clearing this, proceeds to an Instance of an <hi>errour</hi> defined by one of your <hi>General Councils,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 259.</note> viz. <hi>Communion in one kind</hi>; but that we shall reserve the discussion of, to the ensuing Chapter; which is purposely allotted for the discovery of those <hi>errours</hi> which have been defined by such as you call <hi>General Councils.</hi> Therefore I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Lordship saith, <hi>Your opinion is yet more unreasonable, because no Body-collective,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>whensoever it assembled it self, did ever give more power to the representing body of it, then a binding power upon it self and all particulars; nor ever did it give this power otherwise,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 260.</note> 
                  <hi>then with this reservation in nature, that it would call again, and reform, and, if need were, abrogate any Law, or ordinance upon just cause made evident that the representing Body had failed in trust, or truth. And this power no Body-collective, ecclesiastical or civil, can
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:101069:282"/>
put out of it self, or give away to a Parliament, or Council, or call it what you will that represents it.</hi> To this again you Answer,<note place="margin">P. 272.</note> 
                  <hi>This is only to suppose and take for granted, that a General Council hath no Authority, but what is meerly delegate from the Church Vniversal which it represents.</hi> I grant, this is supposed in it, and this is all which the nature of a representative body doth imply; if you say, there is more then that, you are bound to prove it. Yes, say you, <hi>We maintain its Authority to be of Divine Institution, and when lawfully assembled to act by Divine right, and not meerly by deputation and consent of the Church.</hi> But if all the proof you have for it, be only that which you refer us to in the precedent <hi>Chapter,</hi> the palpable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it for any such purpose hath been there fully laid open. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship saith, <hi>That the power which a Council hath to order,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 261.</note> 
                  <hi>settle and define differences arising concerning Faith, it hath not by any Immediate Institution from Christ, but it was prudently taken up by the Church from the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. So that to hold Councils to this end, is apparent Apostolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on written: but the power which Councils have, is from the whole Catholick Church, whose members they are, and the Churches power from God.</hi> You say, <hi>True it is, the calling such assemblies was taken up, and hath for its pattern the example of the Apostles,</hi> Act. 15. <hi>yet surely there is little doubt to be made, but the Apostles had both direction and precept too, for doing it so often as just occasion required, from Christ himself.</hi> The whole force of which Answer lyes in those well placed words, <hi>Surely there is little doubt to be made</hi>; for as to any thing of reason, you never offer at it. Just such another of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmins Sine dubio's</hi> comes after; <hi>Though a General Council be the Church representative, and do not meet, or assemble together</hi> hic &amp; nunc, <hi>but by order and deputation from man; yet it follows not, but the power and authority by which they act when they are met may be from God, as doubtless it is.</hi> Can any man have the face to question, Whether the Authority of <hi>General Councils</hi> be of <hi>Divine Institution</hi> or no, when you say, <hi>Yes surely, there is no doubt to be made of it, doubtless it is?</hi> We do not question, as you would seem to imply afterwards, <hi>Whether the people or the Pastours have right to send to General Councils,</hi> but what ground you have to assert, that <hi>General Councils are an immediate Divine Institution.</hi> But I must needs say, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saw any thing affirmed oftener, and offered to be proved less, then that is here: and yet as though you had done it invincibly you trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly proceed; <hi>General Councils then, are a principal and necessary part of that Ecclesiastical Hierarchy which Christ instituted for the Government of his Church, and not an humane Expedient only,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 273.</note> 
                  <hi>taken up by the Church her self meerly upon prudential considerations, as the Bishop will needs conceive.</hi> It strangely puzzles me to find out any thing that Particle <hi>then</hi> relates to; and after all my search can find nothing, but <hi>surely, without doubt, and doubtless.</hi> I pray Sir, think not so meanly of us, that we should take these for Arguments or Demonstrations: Deal fairly with us, and if we fall by the <hi>force</hi> of reason, we yield our selves up to you. But you are very much deceived, if you think these things are taken for proofs with us: we can easily discern the weakness of your cause through the most confident affirmations. If you had brought any <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> appointing that <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils</hi> should be in the <hi>Church,</hi> any <hi>Apostolical precept,</hi> prescribing or giving directions concerning them, you had done something; but, not so much as to offer at a proof, and yet conclude it as confidently as if it were impossible to resist the force of your Demonstrations, is an evidence, that either you know your cause to be weak, or suppose us to be so. Much
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:101069:283"/>
such another discourse is that which follows, wherein you pretend to give a reason, <hi>Why what is defined by one Council in point of Doctrine cannot be reversed by another.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 273.</note> Which is, <hi>because the true Christian Faith is</hi> ex natura rei <hi>unchangeable, that it admits not of yea and nay, but only yea; that it is alwayes the same, that it must stand without alteration for ever, nay that it is to be invariable and admit no change.</hi> All these expressions we have in one <hi>Paragraph,</hi> and, for all that I see, are the greatest strength of it. But what is it you mean by all this? Do you think we could not understand what you meant by the <hi>unchangeableness of Christian Faith,</hi> without so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diversified expressions of it? And what follows now from all this? <hi>That one Council cannot repeal the Decrees of another?</hi> How so? was not the <hi>Faith of Christ</hi> as <hi>unchangeable</hi> in the time of the <hi>Arrian Councils,</hi> as it is now? and yet then one <hi>Council</hi> repealed the Decrees of others, in point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and yet by that nothing was derogated from the <hi>Institution</hi> or <hi>honour of Christ,</hi> by such a reversing those Decrees. Though the <hi>Faith, i. e. The Doctrine of Christ,</hi> be alwayes the same, Doth it thence follow; then men shall alwayes believe all this unalterable Doctrine? If so, how came <hi>Arrianism</hi> to overspread the <hi>Church?</hi> How came six hundred <hi>Bishops</hi> at the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Ariminum</hi> to be deceived in a <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> by your own confession? It is therefore a profound mistake, to infer from the fallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>General Councils</hi> the <hi>alteration</hi> of the <hi>Faith of Christ.</hi> The <hi>Faith of Christ</hi> is founded on a surer bottom then the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils, though all men are lyars God is true, and Christ the same yesterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> But of this more afterwards.</p>
               <p>You would seem to argue more pertinently in the following pages against his Lordships opinion:<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> for you say, <hi>He sayes and unsayes the same; and what he seems to attribute to General Councils in one proposition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 274, 275.</note> 
                  <hi>he takes away in another.</hi> That which his Lordship sayes, is, <hi>That the definitions of a General Council are binding to all particulars,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 261.</note> 
                  <hi>and it self; but yet so, that they cannot bind the whole Church from calling again, and in the after-calls upon just cause to order, and, if need be, to abrogate former acts. And after adds, And because the whole Church can meet no other way, the Council shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the Supream, external, living, temporary, Ecclesiastical Judge of all Controversies. Only the whole Church, and she alone, hath power when Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or Demonstration is found, and peaceably tendered to her, to represent her self again in a new Council, and in it to order what was amiss.</hi> Now we must consider what we find contradictious and repugnant to themselves in these words: Three things, if I mistake not, the main of this charge may be reduced to, 1. <hi>That men should be bound to that which Scripture and Demonstration be against</hi>; But this is very easily answered, for his Lordship doth not say, Men are bound to <hi>believe</hi> it, but not so to oppose it as to break the peace of the <hi>Church</hi> by it. 2. <hi>That another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil cannot be call'd without opposition to the other:</hi> this his Lordship pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by supposing that the <hi>just reasons</hi> against the decrees of the former <hi>Council</hi> ought to be <hi>peaceably tendred</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi>; but no boisterous opposition to be made against it. 3. <hi>To what purpose should another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil be call'd, if the whole Church be satisfied that there is Scripture and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration against the decrees of the former?</hi> But, 1. His Lordship sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses there may <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Demonstration</hi> be, where the whole <hi>Church</hi> is not satisfied; and therefore there may be necessity of calling another <hi>Council.</hi> 2. That the <hi>Council</hi> may free all those who may suppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves still bound not to <hi>oppose</hi> the former errour. 3. That no <hi>errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Decree</hi> of a <hi>Council,</hi> may remain unrepealed in the <hi>Church</hi>: that so no erroneous person may challenge such a Decree of a <hi>Council,</hi> as a ground for his opposition to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church.</hi> And where now lyes any such appearance of contradiction in his Lordships words?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The last thing his Lordship chargeth your way with <hi>unreasonableness</hi> in, is, <hi>That you do not only make the definition of a General Council,</hi>

So belike this Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rests not in the representative body, the Council, nor in the whole body the Church, but in your Head of the Church, the Pope of</hi> Rome. <hi>And if this be so, To what end such a trouble for a General Council? or, Where in are we neerer to unity, if the Pope confirm it not?</hi> To this you answer, 1. <hi>That a General Council is not held by you to be Infallible at all, unless it involve the Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 276.</note> 
                  <hi>or his Confirmation; and so there is but one Infallibility,</hi> viz. <hi>of the Pope presiding in, and confirming of the votes of a General Council.</hi> 2. <hi>You confess there are two different Opinions among you; the first and more common is, that the Pope, even without a General Council, is Infallible in his definitions of Faith, when he teaches the whole Church; the second is, that he is not Infallible in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, save only where he defines in, and with, a General Council. Now the Bishop</hi> (you say) <hi>takes no notice of the second Opinion, but only of the first, as though that were the Opinion of all Catholick Doctors. But, for your part, you will not meddle much with any matters of private Opinion or dispute, and therefore you will briefly pass over what his Lordship saith further, and only correct some mistakes of his.</hi> But whereas you pretend it only necessary to believe, that <hi>Pope and Council together are Infallible, for this all Catholicks are agreed in; but, whether the Pope be Infallible without a Council or no, you leave it as matter of dispute.</hi> I shall manifest, how great a cheat you put upon the world by this Assertion, in these two things, 1. <hi>That there is no such agreement among your selves in this common principle, as you pretend.</hi> 2. <hi>That from the making the Popes Confirmation necessary to the Infallibility of the Council, you must make the Pope Infallible without a Council.</hi> 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you pretend such a consent among all <hi>Catholicks</hi> in this common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>That Pope and Council are Infallible together,</hi> it is evident that there is no such thing. For, 1. Some among you have asserted, that the <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative body of the Church</hi> is not at all the <hi>subject</hi> of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> but the <hi>diffusive.</hi> For <hi>Occham</hi> contends at large, <hi>That the priviledge of Infallibility,</hi>

of this Opinion, and those who make the <hi>Popes</hi> Confirmation neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of a <hi>General Council,</hi> I shall prove out of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself, from the state of the Question, and the Arguments he urges against it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarmin. de Concil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us, <hi>The first occasion of this Controversie, was about the deposition of Popes,</hi> viz. <hi>whether the Pope might against his consent be judged, condemned, and deposed by the Council:</hi> and therefore, saith he, <hi>They are mistaken, who think the Question is, Whether the Council with the Pope be greater than the Pope without a Council? for, it cannot be conceived he should give consent to his own deposition.</hi> And this he proves <hi>from the Council at</hi> Basil, <hi>who defined their Council to be above the Pope, at that time, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope, nor his Legats were present.</hi> And this <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Basil</hi> in their <hi>Synodal Epistle,</hi> declare a <hi>General Council, as representing the Vniversal Church, to be Infallible,</hi> when at the same time they assert, <hi>That Popes have fallen into Heresie.</hi> Now, Can any one possibly imagine, these men should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Popes Confirmation</hi> to be necessary to the <hi>Councils Infallibility,</hi> who suppose the <hi>Pope</hi> may be an <hi>Heretick</hi> at the same time, in which a <hi>Council</hi> may be Infallible? And when they assert it to belong to the <hi>Council</hi> only to pronounce, Whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be guilty of <hi>Heresie</hi> or no? Those therefore who contend for the <hi>Councils Authority</hi> above the <hi>Pope,</hi> do not at all look at the <hi>Popes</hi> Confirmation, as necessary to make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees <hi>Infallible</hi>; though some of them may, to make them <hi>Canonical.</hi> For there lyes one of your fallacies; because they look on the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> therefore to make <hi>Canons</hi> to be valid, they may judge it in most cases necessary that the <hi>Pope</hi> confirm the Decrees; but yet, they do not suppose this <hi>Confirmation</hi> doth at all make them <hi>Infallible</hi>; but, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> had confirmed them or no, they had been <hi>Infallible</hi> however. So that you cannot say, <hi>That it is a principle of Faith among you, that Pope and Council together are Infallible</hi>; for those of this opinion make it a <hi>principle of Faith,</hi> that the <hi>Council</hi> in it self is <hi>Infallible,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Concil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> whether it be confirmed by the <hi>Pope</hi> or no. And therefore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith, Their opinion is, <hi>That in case the Pope be dead, deposed, or refuseth to come to the Council, the Council is not at all the less perfect, but that it hath full power to make definitions in matters of Faith.</hi> And when he comes to urge against this Opinion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 16.</note> one of his <hi>arguments</hi> is, that from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>That the Council would not at all need the Popes Confirmation</hi>; and another, <hi>That Councils without the Pope may erre in Decrees of Faith</hi>; for which he instanceth in <hi>the Councils of Sirmium, Milan, Ariminum, Ephesus, &amp;c. Neither,</hi> saith he, <hi>can it be answered, that these Councils erred, because they were unlawful Councils; for the most of them wanted nothing but the Popes consent, and the second Ephesine Council was just such another as that of</hi> Basil. From which disputation of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> it is both clear, that those who make <hi>Councils</hi> above the <hi>Pope,</hi> do not judge the <hi>Popes</hi> Confirmation neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; and those who judge it necessary, do not suppose the <hi>Council</hi> Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible without it. So that you are either deceived your self, or would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, when you would make them believe that there is but one <hi>Infallibility</hi> asserted by you, whereas nothing can be more evident, than that two distinct <hi>subjects</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> are asserted in your <hi>Church,</hi> some placing it in the <hi>Council</hi> without the <hi>Pope,</hi> and others in the <hi>Pope,</hi> and not in the <hi>Council,</hi> and neither of them absolutely and formally in the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I shall therefore more fully shew, <hi>That those who make the Popes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation necessary,</hi>

Council</hi>; and that from these things, 1. Because they in terms assert, <hi>That though nothing be wanting to a Council,</hi> but the <hi>Popes Confirmation, it may erre, if the Pope confirm it not.</hi> And this we produced <hi>Bellarmins</hi> assertion for already, giving that as the only reason, why those <hi>Councils</hi> did erre, which wanted nothing but that. Nay, he elsewhere asserts, <hi>Not only that General Councils may erre, though the Pope confirm them not,</hi>

                  <hi>but although the Popes Legats be present, and consent with the Council, yet if they do not follow the certain instruction of the Pope, the Council may erre.</hi> And, Can any one then possibly conceive, that the Infallibility lyes any where but in the <hi>Pope?</hi> 2. You assert, <hi>That all the Power and Infallibility which is in the Church, is formally in the Pope, and only finally in the Church, because it is for the good of the Church</hi>; this I suppose you have not forgot, since you told us, that S. <hi>Peter sustained the person of the Church</hi> historic√®,<note place="margin">P. 266.</note> 
                  <hi>and not</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolic√®, <hi>and that the fulness of all Ecclesiastical Power was in him as Head of the Church:</hi> If this be true, as there you assert it confidently, whatever you pretend here, you are bound to defend, that all the <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> comes wholly from the <hi>Pope</hi>; for I know you will not place <hi>Infallibility</hi> in one, and the <hi>fulness of Ecclesiastical Power</hi> in another. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the main ground</hi> of the <hi>reprobating Councils lyes in the Popes dissent.</hi> So that <hi>Councils</hi> which in all other particulars are accounted lawful and general, yet if any thing passed displeasing in them to the <hi>Pope,</hi> so far they are <hi>reprobated</hi>; as the proceedings of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon, Constance,</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> in reference to the <hi>Popes,</hi> do sufficiently testifie. For, although they were the same persons, acting with equal <hi>freedom</hi> in those, as in other things, yet when they came to touch any thing of the <hi>Popes Interess,</hi> then, because the <hi>Pope</hi> doth not consent, so far they were not <hi>Infallible.</hi> By which it is plain, that, though the <hi>Council</hi> stands for a <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> to the world, all the <hi>Infallibility</hi> lyes wholly in the <hi>Pope.</hi> And by this means, to be sure, the <hi>Pope</hi> shall never receive any hurt by <hi>General Councils</hi>; for if he pleases, the <hi>Council</hi> shall either be approved or rejected, or partly approved, and partly rejected; or neither approved, nor rejected; for of all these sorts <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us <hi>Councils</hi> are: which in short is, The <hi>Councils</hi> which make for the <hi>Popes</hi> turn, are <hi>Infallible,</hi> but none other. And therefore <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> very consonantly to his principles, sayes expresly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Pontif. Rom l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Totam firmitatem Conciliorum legitimorum esse √† Pontifice, non partim √† Pontifice, partim √† Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio; The whole strength of lawful Councils depends wholly on the Pope, and not partly on the Pope, and partly on the Council.</hi> And if their <hi>firmness</hi> doth, their <hi>Infallibility</hi> must do so too. This is not a meer private opinion of his, but that which doth necessarily follow, from the making the <hi>Popes</hi> Confirmation necessary to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>General Councils.</hi> Although therefore you would fain put off this as a matter of dispute among your selves; yet it can be no matter of dispute any more, than, Whether the Decrees of <hi>Councils,</hi> as confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> be Infallible or no? And therefore all that his Lordship objects, falls upon all such who assert this: Whereof the first which you mention is,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>That then the Council is called but only in effect, to hear the Pope give his Sentence in more state.</hi> To which you answer, <hi>That the Objection hath the same force against the Council called in the Apostles time,</hi> viz. <hi>that it was done; only to hear S.</hi> Peter <hi>pronounce his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in more state.</hi> Neither had it been any more, if the Infallibility of the <hi>Council</hi> had only depended on S. <hi>Peter's</hi> Sentence: but I hope you will not deny the rest of the <hi>Apostles</hi> to have been as <hi>Infallible</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> was. But you answer, 2. <hi>That the Pope being to use all means morally requisite to find
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:101069:285"/>
out the truth; the Council is called really to help and assist the Pope; and the advice of the Council is a necessary</hi> Medium <hi>to his Holiness, whereby to make a full inspection into the matters he is to define.</hi> But all this only confirms what his Lordship saith, <hi>That it is for his giving Sentence in more state</hi>; for the <hi>Council</hi> is only a subservient <hi>means,</hi> and contributes nothing at all to the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Sentence.</hi> But, you say, <hi>They are a necessary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi> 1. Then the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot define any matter of Faith without a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council.</hi> Which, all who assert that Opinion, utterly deny; for, they say, The <hi>Pope</hi> may define matters of <hi>Faith</hi> without a <hi>General Council</hi>; and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That the state of the Church, without General Councils (which was for three hundred years) might have continued so to the worlds end; and therefore it was necessary there should be a living Judge, whose Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility should not depend upon any Council:</hi> And elsewhere he sayes, <hi>That if seven Heresies have been condemned by seven General Councils; more than a hundred have been condemned without,</hi>

Though the <hi>Pope</hi> must use all moral means, yet, Why must a <hi>General Council</hi> be that <hi>necessary Medium?</hi> Why may not a <hi>Provincial,</hi> or lesser <hi>Council</hi> serve turn? And so <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells you, it would; he saith, indeed <hi>some kind of Council is necessary,</hi>

No more, then the <hi>Crucifix Pope Innocent</hi> shewed to <hi>Monsieur de Saint-Amour; Before which,</hi> he told him, <hi>he kneeled down to take at the feet thereof his resolution,</hi>

                  <hi>according to the inspiration given to him by the Holy Spirt, whose assistance was promised to him, and could not fail him.</hi> We see, the <hi>Pope</hi> understood his <hi>Infallibility</hi> better, than to make use of such moral means as <hi>Councils</hi> are; he knew his <hi>Infallibility</hi> came not that way, and therefore he took the more likely course to receive his <hi>Inspiration</hi> from Heaven, by taking his resolution at the feet of a <hi>Crucifix.</hi> And this he called, <hi>his Council in matters of Faith:</hi> And yet, if we believe him, he did as much want all <hi>moral means</hi> for finding out the <hi>truth,</hi> as another; since he so ingenuously confessed at another audience, <hi>That he was old, and had never studied Divinity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Journal. part 3. ch. 12 p 120</note> But, What need he to do it, that could so easily be <hi>inspired,</hi> by <hi>kneeling at the feet of a Crucifix?</hi> Your Doctrine then would not be very well taken at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>General Councils</hi> are a <hi>necessary Medium</hi> to his <hi>Holiness,</hi> in order to the definition of matters of Faith.

                  <note place="margin">P. 277.</note> 
                  <hi>That though the Pope acquires no new power, or certainty of judgement by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of a General Council, and there is something thereby, which conduceth to the due exercise of that power:</hi> So that it must be an usurpation or <hi>undue exercise of power,</hi> for the <hi>Pope</hi> to offer to define without a <hi>General Council.</hi> I know not what liberty you have to write these things among us; but if you were at <hi>Rome,</hi> you durst not venture to do it. Your saying, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> only sayes, <hi>That the firmness of a Council in regard of us, depends wholly on the Popes Confirmation,</hi> argues, you had very little to say: For, What <hi>firmness</hi> hath a <hi>Council</hi> at all in this dispute, but in regard of us; since you look on men as obliged to believe the Decrees of it <hi>Infallible?</hi> And, if the Decrees had any <hi>Infallibility</hi> from the <hi>Council,</hi> that might make them
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:101069:285"/>
firm in regard of us, as well as the <hi>Pope.</hi> But you object to your self, <hi>That if the Pope be Infallible without the Council, and the Council subject to errour without the Pope, it must needs follow, that all the Infallibility of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils proceeds from the Pope only; not partly from the Pope, and partly from the Council.</hi> To which you answer,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>That the assertors of that Opinion</hi> (of whom you must be one, if you know what you say) <hi>may say, that Christ hath made two promises to his Church, the one to assist her Soveraign Head and Pastor to make him Infallible, another to assist General Councils to make them so.</hi> But, What need this latter, if the former be well proved? For if the Head be <hi>Infallible</hi> by vertue of a <hi>promise</hi> from <hi>Christ,</hi> he must be Infallible, whether in <hi>Council,</hi> or out of it. And therefore it is a ridiculous shift to say, The <hi>Pope</hi> hath one promise to make him Infallible in a General Council; ano-to make him so out of it. But I commend you, that since you thought one would not hold, you would have two strings for the Popes Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And it is but adding a third promise to the Church in general, and then your threefold cord may be surely Infallible.</p>
               <p>You give many Reasons (but none so convincing as Experience) <hi>Why the Popes should not be Impeccable</hi>; and, if you search Scripture, Antiquity,<note place="margin">¬ß. 13.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 278.</note> and Reason, you may find as much, why he should not be <hi>Infallible.</hi> For that of the necessity of one, and not the other for the Church, is of your own devising, it having been sufficiently proved, that the certainty of Faith doth not at all depend upon the <hi>Popes,</hi> or your <hi>Churches,</hi> or <hi>Councils Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> And it seems still very strange to all who know the doctrine and promises of Christianity, and that the promotion of <hi>Holiness</hi> is the great design of it, and that <hi>Faith</hi> signifies nothing without <hi>Obedience,</hi> and that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> as well as Truth, that you dare challenge such an assistance of the <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> as may make your <hi>Popes</hi> Infallible, who have led lives quite contrary to the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ.

That principle destructive to all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Faith upon our Authours grounds. The absurdity of asserting that Councils define themselves to be Infallible.

Evidences against Invocation of Saints from the Christians Answers to the Heathens. The worship of Spirits and Heroes among the Heathens justifiable on the same grounds that Invocation of Saints is in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Commemoration of the Saints without Invocation, in S. <hi>Augustins</hi> time.

               </argument>
               <p>ALthough nothing can be more unreasonable then to pretend that <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Person,</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> which we can prove to have actually erred; yet we have yielded so much to you, as to disprove what you have in general brought for the <hi>one,</hi> before we come to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the <hi>other.</hi> But that being dispatched, we come to a more short and compendious way of overthrowing your <hi>Infallibility,</hi> by shewing the palpable falsity of such principles which must be owned by you as <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> truths, because defined by <hi>General Councils</hi> confirmed by the <hi>Pope.</hi> Whereof, <hi>The first in the Endictment,</hi> as you say, <hi>is that of the Priests In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention defined by the Councils of</hi> Florence <hi>and</hi> Trent <hi>(both of them confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope) to be essentially necessary to the validity of a Sacrament.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 281.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, there are two things to be enquired into, 1. <hi>Whether this doth not render all pretence of Infallibility with you a vain and useless thing?</hi> 2. <hi>Whether it be not in it self an errour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must begin with the <hi>first</hi> of these, for that was the occasion of his Lordships entering upon it; for he was shewing, <hi>That your claim of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is of no use at all,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 271.</note> 
                  <hi>for the settling of Truth and Peace in the Church; because no man can either know or believe this Infallibility. It cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved with Divine Faith; having no foundation either in the written Word
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:101069:287"/>
of God, or Tradition of the Catholick Church; and no humane Faith can be sufficient in order to it. But neither can it be believed or known, upon that decree of the Councils of</hi> Florence <hi>and</hi> Trent, <hi>that the intention of the Priest is necessary to the validity of a Sacrament.</hi> And, lest you should think I represent his Lordships words too much with advantage, I will take his Argument in the words you have summed it up in, which are these: <hi>Before the Church or any particular man can make use of the Popes Infallibility (that is, be settled, and confirmed in the Truth by means thereof),</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 282.</note> 
                  <hi>he must either know, or upon sure grounds believe, that he is Infallible. But</hi> (sayes the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) <hi>this can only be believed of him, as he is S.</hi> Peters <hi>Successour and Bishop of</hi> Rome; <hi>of which it is impossible, in the relatours opinion, for the Church or any particular man, to have such certainty as is sufficient to ground an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble belief. Why? because the knowledge and belief of this, depends upon his being truly in Orders, truly a Bishop, truly a Priest, truly Baptized; none of all which, according to our principles, can be certainly known and believed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (forsooth) the intention of him that administred these Sacraments to the Pope, or made him Bishop, Priest,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>can never be certainly known; and yet by the Doctrine of the Councils of</hi> Florence <hi>and</hi> Trent, <hi>it is of absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to the validity of every one of these Sacraments, so as without it, the Pope were neither Bishop nor Priest.</hi> Thus I grant you have faithfully sum'd up his Lordships Argument; we must now see with what courage and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess you encounter it. Your first Answer is, <hi>That though it be level'd against the Popes Infallibility, yet it hath the same force against the Infallibility of the whole Church in points fundamental; for we cannot be Infallibly sure, there is such a number of Baptized persons to make a Church.</hi> By this, we see how likely you are to assoil this difficulty, who bring it more strongly upon your self, without the least inconvenience to your adversary. For I grant, it necessarily follows against the pretence of any <hi>Infallibility,</hi> whether in <hi>Church, Councils,</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> as being a <hi>certain ground</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi>; for all these must suppose such a <hi>certainty</hi> of the due <hi>administration</hi> of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which your Doctrine of <hi>Intention</hi> doth utterly destroy. For these two things are your <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that there can be no certainty of <hi>Faith,</hi> without present <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; and that, in order to the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>testimony Infallible,</hi> there must be such a <hi>certainty</hi> as is ground suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for an <hi>Infallible belief.</hi> Now, How is it possible there can be such, when there can be no <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Church, Council,</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi> from your own principles? For when the only way of knowing this, is a thing not possible to be evidenced to any one in any way of <hi>Infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> viz. <hi>the intention of the Priest,</hi> you must unavoidably destroy all your pretence of <hi>Infallibility.</hi> For, To what purpose do you tell me, that <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Councils</hi> are <hi>Infallible,</hi> unless I may be <hi>Infallibly sure</hi> that such <hi>decrees</hi> were passed by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council?</hi> I cannot be assured of that, unless I be first assured that they were <hi>Baptized persons,</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; and for this you dare not offer at <hi>Infallible certainty,</hi> and therefore all the rest is useless and vain. So that while by this Doctrine of <hi>the intention of the Priest for the validity of the Sacraments,</hi> you thought to advance higher the reputation of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and to take away the <hi>assurance</hi> of <hi>Protestants,</hi> as to the benefits which come by the use of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> you could not have asserted any thing more really pernicious to your selves, than this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is. So strange an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy</hi> was it in those <hi>Councils</hi> to define it, and as great in those who defend it, and yet at the same time, maintain the necessity of a present
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:101069:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>General Councils.</hi> For can any thing be more <hi>rational,</hi> then to desire the highest <hi>assurance</hi> as to that, whose <hi>decrees</hi> I am to believe <hi>Infallible?</hi> And yet at the last, you confess we can have but a <hi>moral certainty</hi> of it, and that of the lowest degree; the utmost ground of it, being either the testimony of the <hi>Priest</hi> himself, or, that <hi>we have no ground to suspect the contrary.</hi> Now what unreasonable men are you, who so much to the dishonour of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> cry out upon the <hi>rational evidence</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of it, as an <hi>uncertain principle,</hi> and that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> though they assert the highest degree of actual <hi>certainty,</hi> cannot have any <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> because they want the <hi>Churches Infallible testimony?</hi> and yet when we enquire into this <hi>Infallible Testimony,</hi> you are fain to resolve it, into one of the most <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>conjectural</hi> things imaginable. For what can I have less ground to build my Faith upon, than that the <hi>Priest</hi> had at least a <hi>virtual intention</hi> to do as the <hi>Church</hi> doth? Whom must I believe in this case? and whereon must that <hi>Faith</hi> be grounded? On the <hi>Priests Testimony?</hi> But how can I be assured, but that he, who may wander in his <hi>intention,</hi> may do so in his <hi>expression</hi> too? Or must I do it because I have no <hi>reason</hi> to <hi>suspect</hi> the contrary? how can you assure me of that, that I have no reason to suspect the contrary? no otherwise then by telling me, that the <hi>Priest</hi> is a man of that <hi>honesty</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi> that he cannot be supposed to do such a thing without <hi>intention?</hi> So that, though I were in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> where, some have told us, it is no hard matter to meet with <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Priests habits,</hi> and professing themselves such, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accordingly; yet I am bound to believe (though they heartily believe nothing of <hi>Christianity</hi>) yet in all <hi>Sacraments</hi> they must have an <hi>intention</hi> to do as the <hi>Church</hi> doth. Without which, we are told by you, <hi>No Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament can be valid, because the matter and form cannot be determin'd or united without the Priests intention.</hi> And therefore I do not only object, that this takes away the <hi>comfort</hi> of all <hi>Sacraments</hi> as to the <hi>receivers,</hi> but that it destroyes all certain <hi>Foundations of Faith.</hi> Because the promises of <hi>Infallibility</hi> supposing that, which I can have no <hi>assurance</hi> of; that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> can be no foundation of <hi>Faith</hi> at all to me. As for instance, suppose the <hi>title</hi> to an <hi>estate</hi> depends upon the <hi>Kings free donation,</hi> and this <hi>donation</hi> to be confirmed by his <hi>Great Seal</hi>; but yet so, that if the <hi>Lord Chancellour</hi> in the <hi>sealing</hi> it, doth not <hi>intend</hi> it should pass on that account, the whole <hi>gift</hi> becomes null in <hi>Law.</hi> I pray tell me now, What other <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi> you can have of your <hi>title</hi> to this estate, then you have of the <hi>Lord Chancellours intention</hi> in passing the <hi>Seal?</hi> and what <hi>Infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> you can have of such <hi>intention</hi> of his? Just such, is your case, you tell us, The only ground of <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> in <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> this <hi>Infallibility</hi> comes by a <hi>free promise</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> this <hi>promise</hi> must suppose a <hi>Church</hi> in being; that there is a <hi>Church,</hi> we can have no more <hi>assurance</hi> then that there are <hi>Baptized-persons,</hi> but the validity of their <hi>Baptism</hi> requires the <hi>Priests intention</hi> in administring it; and therefore we can have no more <hi>assurance</hi> of the <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> then we have of the <hi>Priests intention.</hi> And, Is this it at last, which your loud clamours of <hi>Infallibility</hi> come to? Is this the effect of all your <hi>exclamations</hi> against <hi>Protestants,</hi> for making Faith <hi>uncertain</hi> by taking away the <hi>Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility?</hi> Must our <hi>Faith</hi> at last be resolved into that, which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible we should have any undoubted <hi>assurance</hi> at all of? And will not the highest reason, the clearest evidence, the most pregnant demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which things are capable of, be accounted with you <hi>sufficient ground</hi>

to build our <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> upon? and yet, must a thing so <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> to be <hi>certainly</hi> known, so generally uncertain and conjectural, be accounted by you sufficient ground to believe your <hi>Churches Infallibility?</hi> Are not the <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> joyned with the <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> a ground firm enough, for us to believe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> divine? and yet must the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> with you be a much surer ground then these are? By all which it appears, that if I had not already largely discovered your grand <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi> in your pretence to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> this very Doctrine would invincibly prove it; since, notwithstanding that pretence, you must resolve all into something which falls short of those grounds of <hi>certainty</hi> which we have to build our <hi>Faith</hi> upon. But we must now consider, how you offer to retort this upon his Lordship; for you say, <hi>The same Argument will hold against the Infallibility of the whole Church in Fundamentals; since men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Infallibly sure, there is such a company of men who are truly Baptized.</hi> But how manifestly ridiculous this is, will appear, 1. That it will hold indeed against all such who assert this Doctrine of the <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> but not others. Therefore if his Lordship had said, This Doctrine had been true, the retortion had been good; but you saw well enough he disproves it as an <hi>errour,</hi> and urges this as an absurdity conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon it. Your Argument then as it is, runs in this form: If they who hold the <hi>Priests</hi> intention necessary cannot be <hi>sure</hi> who are Baptized, then they who do not hold it necessary, cannot. Where is your conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? for he was shewing, the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of it depended upon that principle, and therefore I suppose the denying of the principle doth not stand guilty of the same absurdity, which the holding it doth. But it may be, the force lyes in being <hi>Infallibly sure,</hi> and so that none can know the Infallibility of the Church in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> but such as are <hi>Infallibly sure</hi> that men are Baptised. I Answer therefore, 2. That there is no such necessity of being <hi>Infallibly sure,</hi> upon our principles as there is upon yours. For you build your <hi>Faith</hi> upon the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> in <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> but we do not pretend to build our Faith upon the <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi> in <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> All that we assert, is, that the <hi>Church</hi> is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> but we do not say, the ground of our <hi>Faith</hi> is, because she is so, for that were to make the <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>formal object</hi> of our <hi>Faith:</hi> since therefore we do not rely on the <hi>Church</hi> as our <hi>Infallible Guide</hi> in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> there is no such necessity of that <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> as to this principle as there is with you, who must wholly establish your Faith upon the <hi>Churches</hi> Infallibility, The most then that we assert, is, that there is and shall alwayes be a <hi>Church,</hi> for that (as I have told you) is all that is meant by a <hi>Church</hi> being <hi>Infallible</hi> in <hi>Fundamentals</hi>; now for this we have the greatest assurance possible, that there <hi>shall be</hi> from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Christ, and that <hi>there is,</hi> from the certainty we have of the Faith and Baptism of <hi>Christians,</hi> since no more is required by us to assure men of it, then all men in the world are competent <hi>Judges</hi> of; which surely they cannot be of the <hi>Priests</hi> intention. So much for your weak attempt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting this Argument upon his Lordship.</p>
               <p>But the main thing to be considered, is, your solid Answer you give to it; which indeed is of that weight,<note place="margin">¬ß. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> that it must not be slightly passed over. You Answer therefore, <hi>That both a General Council and the Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid;</note> 
                  <hi>when they define any matters of Faith, do also implicitely define that themselves are Infallible; and by consequence that both the Pope in such case, and also the
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:101069:289"/>
Bishops that sit in Council are persons Baptised, in holy Orders, and have all things essentially necessary for that Function, which they then execute. Neither is there any more difficulty in the case of the Pope now, then there was in the time of the Prophets and Apostles of old; whom all must grant that with the same breath they defin'd, or Infallibly declared the several Articles and points of Doctrine proposed by them to the Faithful, and their own Infallibility in proposing them.</hi> So indeed <hi>Vega</hi> answered in the case of <hi>General Councils</hi>; for when it was demanded, How it should be known that the <hi>Council</hi> was a lawful <hi>Council,</hi> he sayes, <hi>Because the Council defined it self to be so</hi>; but for this he is sufficiently chastised by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Concil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> who gives this unanswerable Argument against it. Either it doth appear from some other Argument, that while the <hi>Council</hi> defines it self to be a lawful <hi>Council,</hi> it was a lawful <hi>Council</hi>; or it doth not: if it doth, To what purpose doth it define it self to be a lawful <hi>Council?</hi> if it doth not, then we shall doubt of that Decree whereby it defines it self to be so: for if I doubt, whether the <hi>Council</hi> were lawful before that Decree; I doubt likewise, whether it might not err in passing that Decree. And therefore he grants, that no more than <hi>moral certainty</hi> or historical Faith is requisite in order to it. Now this Argument of <hi>Bellarmins</hi> holds with equal strength (if not more) against you; for you derive the lawfulness of the <hi>Council</hi> from its <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and that <hi>Infallibility</hi> from the <hi>Councils</hi> definition. Thus therefore I argue: Either it doth appear, that the <hi>Council</hi> was <hi>Infallible</hi> before that definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or it doth not. If it appears to be <hi>Infallible</hi> before, then its <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> is not known by that <hi>definition:</hi> If it doth not, How can I know it to be <hi>Infallible</hi> by it? For as I doubt, whether it was <hi>Infallible</hi> before it, so I must doubt, whether it was <hi>Infallible</hi> in it: and consequently it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible I should believe it <hi>Infallible</hi> because it defines it self to be so. Neither do you at all salve this, by calling it only an <hi>implicite definition,</hi> for whether it be <hi>implicite</hi> or <hi>explicite,</hi> it is all one, since that <hi>definition</hi> is made the ground, why we must believe the <hi>Council</hi> to be Infallible. And of all men in the world you seem the strangest in this, that you declaim with so much vehemency against those who believe the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>Infallible for themselves</hi>; and yet assert that <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>General Councils</hi> are to be believed <hi>Infallible, because they define themselves to be so.</hi> Than which no greater absurdity can be well imagin'd. For they who assert that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are to be believed for <hi>themselves,</hi> do not thereby mean that they are to be believed <hi>Infallible</hi> meerly because they say they are <hi>Infallible,</hi> but that out of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> such <hi>Arguments</hi> may be brought, as may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prove that they come from <hi>God.</hi> But when you say, that <hi>Pope and General Councils</hi> are to be believed <hi>Infallible,</hi> because of their <hi>implicite definition</hi> that they are so, you can mean nothing else, but that they are <hi>Infallible,</hi> because they take upon them to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> for that is all I can understand by your <hi>implicite definition</hi>; for if they should decree they were Infallible, that were an <hi>explicite definition.</hi> But yet how should this <hi>implicite definition</hi> be known? for it must be some way certainly known, or else we can never believe that they are <hi>Infallible</hi> upon that account. Which way then must we understand that they <hi>implicitely</hi> define it? Is it by their meeting, debating, decreeing matters of <hi>Faith?</hi> that cannot be, for <hi>Councils</hi> have done all these which are acknowledged to have <hi>erred.</hi> Is it by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> joyning together? but how can that be, unless I know before, that, when <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> joyn, they are <hi>Infallible?</hi> If this then be all the way to prove that <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> are <hi>true Bishops</hi>
                  <pb n="559" facs="tcp:101069:289"/>
because <hi>Infallible,</hi> and they are <hi>Infallible</hi> because they <hi>define</hi> themselves to be so; I see, there is an absolute necessity of a mans putting out the <hi>eye</hi> of his reason, if ever he hopes to <hi>see Pope</hi> and <hi>Councils Infallible.</hi> But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, there is more absurdity still (if more can be imagin'd) in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Answer; for here is a new <hi>Labyrinth</hi> for our Authour to sport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in. For, we are to believe a <hi>Council</hi> to consist of lawful <hi>Bishops</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>Infallible,</hi> and yet his only way to prove them <hi>Infallible,</hi> is by supposing that they consist of lawful <hi>Bishops.</hi> For I ask, Whether all persons meeting together in <hi>Council</hi> are Infallible? <hi>No.</hi> Are all <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Protestant,</hi> and the <hi>Greek,</hi> and other <hi>Churches</hi> besides the <hi>Roman,</hi> assembled in <hi>Council</hi> Infallible? <hi>No.</hi> Must it not then be supposed, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> are lawful <hi>Bishops,</hi> before they can <hi>implicitely</hi> define themselves Infallible? And if their lawfulness must be supposed before their <hi>Infallibility,</hi> they cannot first be proved to be Infallible, before we can know, Whether they were lawful <hi>Bishops</hi> or no. And we cannot know them to be lawful <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> unless we knew the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi>; and therefore it remains proved with evidence equal to a <hi>demonstration,</hi> that your <hi>certainty</hi> of your <hi>Churches</hi> Infallibility, can be no greater than that you have of the <hi>Priests</hi> intention in the administration of <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this it appears, how absurdly you go about <hi>to compare the case of Pope and Council, with that of the Prophets and Apostles of old.</hi> For you challenge not an <hi>Infallibility</hi> by <hi>immediate inspiration,</hi> but such as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly resident in the <hi>Church</hi> by vertue of some particular <hi>promises,</hi> which must suppose the <hi>persons</hi> in whom it lodges to be actually <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore all the proof of their <hi>Infallibility</hi> depends upon the <hi>certainty</hi> of that, which you can never satisfie any rational men in; but, I hope, you will not say, it was so in the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, <hi>God</hi> never sent any persons with a message from himself to the world, but he gave the world sufficient evidence in point of reason that He sent them; either by <hi>Miracles,</hi> the <hi>Testimony</hi> of other <hi>Prophets</hi> who wrought them, or some other satisfactory way to humane reason, as I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where proved at large. But there is no such thing in your case, no rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal evidence at all is offered, but we must believe the <hi>Council</hi> lawful because <hi>Infallible,</hi> and we must believe it <hi>Infallible</hi> because it defines itself to be so. Neither is it possible to conceive that any man should believe whatever the <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Apostle</hi> said, to be <hi>Infallibly true</hi>; unless he were before convinced, that they were <hi>Infallible</hi> who spake it. But for this you have a further Answer, <hi>That it is not necessary to believe the Infallibility of the proposer,</hi> viz. prioritate temporis, <hi>in respect of time, and afterwards the Infallibility of the Doctrine he proposeth: but it sufficeth to believe it first</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritate naturae, <hi>so as the Infallibility of the teacher be presupposed to the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his Doctrine.</hi> But what this makes to your purpose, I understand not. For it is not the <hi>time,</hi> but the <hi>evidence</hi> we enquire for, or the <hi>ground</hi> on which we are to believe the proposer <hi>Infallible.</hi> Whether it must not be something else besides the <hi>implicite defining</hi> himself to be <hi>Infallible?</hi> You assert that to be a sufficient ground in the case of <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councils?</hi> and I pray, Will it not be as sufficient in the case of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> or <hi>Enthusiast?</hi> May not they as well pretend this, that they are <hi>Infallible?</hi> and if you ask them what evidence they have for it, they may tell you, just the same that <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> have to be so: for, as they <hi>implicitely define themselves to be Infallible, so do they.</hi> So that, talk what you will of <hi>private Spirits</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasms,</hi> I know none lay so great a foundation for them as you do upon
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:101069:290"/>
this pretence; <hi>That we are to believe the Pope and Council Infallible, because implicitly they define themselves to be so.</hi> Than which, one could hardly meet with a more absurd Answer from the highest <hi>Enthusiast</hi>: for, he can tell you as boldly, that he hath the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> because he hath it; and just so much you say, and no more, <hi>Pope and Council are Infallible, because they are Infallible.</hi> But I must pity you: I know you would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have run into these <hi>absurdities,</hi> but it was your hard fortune to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a bad cause, and you could not possibly help it; for the <hi>straights</hi> you were in, were so great, that you must venture thorow some great <hi>absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to get out of them. But all the pity I have for you is gone, when I read your next words. <hi>Thus we conceive the Relator's</hi> Achilles <hi>is fallen.</hi> How fallen? If he be, it is only with <hi>Antaeus,</hi> to rise the stronger. But I assure you, so far was he from falling by any force of your Answer, that he stands more impregnably than ever, having not so much as a <hi>heel</hi> left, that you can wound him in. And if you have nothing more to say, than what you here give us in answer to this argument, which you tell us, <hi>is the common Answer of Divines</hi>; I am so far from wondring that his Lordship took no notice of it, that I shall only wonder at the weakness of your judgement, or largeness of your Faith, that can so contentedly swallow such grand <hi>absurdities.</hi>

                  <hi>The main business,</hi> you tell us, <hi>is about the Priests intention, concerning which he positively layes down, that it is not of absolute necessity to the essence of a Sacrament, so as to make it void, though the Priests thoughts should wander from his work, at the instant of using the essentials of a Sacrament; yea, or have in him an actual intention to scorn the Church.</hi> What now have you to shew to the contrary? <hi>If the Priests intention be not absolutely necessary to the essence or validity of a Sacrament, you desire a reason of your adversaries, Why we should not think a Priest consecrates the body of Christ, as much at a Table where there is Wheaten Bread before him, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>either by way of disputation, or reading the</hi> 26. <hi>Chapter of St.</hi> Matthew, <hi>he pronounces the words,</hi> Hoc est corpus meum, <hi>as he doth at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; since here is the true form,</hi> Hoc est corpus meum, <hi>the true matter Wheaten Bread, and he that pronounces the form, is a true Priest, and yet in all mens judgement here's no true Sacrament made. Something else there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is requisite to the essence of a Sacrament, and, What can that possibly be, if it be not the intention which the Church requires?</hi> Since your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest is reasonable, I shall endeavour your satisfaction, and the rather because it tends to the full clearing the business in hand. To your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry then, I answer, That the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> requiring such a <hi>solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> for the administration of it, and such a <hi>disposition</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> for the receiving it, and the performance of such <hi>acts,</hi> in order to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, by the <hi>dispenser</hi> of it; these do sufficiently distinguish the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> from all other actions, what matter, form, or person soever be there. Were not in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times the assembling of the people together for this end, and the solemn performance of the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>administration,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to discriminate the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> from reading the 26. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> by an <hi>Apostle</hi> at the Table, when there was <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> upon it? And I must confess, I cannot but wonder that you should be so much to seek, as not to know the one from the other, unless you knew the <hi>Priests inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> But I consider, your Question was not made for <hi>Apostolical times,</hi> but for <hi>private Masses,</hi> wherein the <hi>Priest</hi> may mumble over the words of
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:101069:290" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Consecration</hi> to himself, and none else be the wiser or better for what he saith, or doth. Here it was indeed very requisite you should make the <hi>Priests intention</hi> necessary to <hi>discriminate</hi> this action, from that you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but, where-ever the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> is duly administred according to the <hi>Primitive Institution,</hi> the solemnity of the action and circumstances do so far individuate it, as sufficiently to difference it from any other <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> whatsoever. And so it is in <hi>conferring Orders</hi>; Is there not enough, do you think, in the <hi>solemnity</hi> of the action, with the preceding <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> laying on of his <hi>hands,</hi> with the using the words proper to that occasion, to difference it from the <hi>Bishops</hi> casual laying his hands on the head of a man, and in the mean time reading perchance the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>ordination?</hi> We assert then, that no further <hi>intention</hi> is at all <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> to the essence of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but what is discoverable by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action. Which being of that nature, which may difference it self by reason of peculiar <hi>circumstances</hi> from others, there is no imaginable necessity to have recourse to the private <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. But see how unreasonable you are herein; for you would make that to be necessary to distinguish a <hi>Sacramental action</hi> from any other, which it is impossible any man should be acquainted with. For, if I had no other way to distinguish in the case you mention, but the <hi>Priests inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I must be as much to seek as ever, unless I cerrainly knew what the <hi>Priests intention</hi> was; which if you have an art of being acquainted with, I pretend not to it. Is it then necessary to distinguish the one from the other, or not? If not, To what end is your Question? If it be, To what purpose is the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> when I cannot know it? But you would seem to object against the <hi>circumstances</hi> discriminating a <hi>Sacramental action.</hi> 1. <hi>If the circumstances do shew to the standers by, that the Priest really intends to make a Sacrament, and this signification be necessary; then the Priests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is necessary, or else, Why is it necessary it should be signified?</hi> I answer, The circumstances are not intended to signifie the <hi>Priests intention</hi> any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than that <hi>intention</hi> is discoverable by the <hi>actions</hi> themselves, so that it is not any <hi>inward intention</hi> which is thereby signified, but only such an <hi>intention</hi> as the <hi>outward action</hi> imports, which is the celebration of the <hi>blessed Sacrament.</hi> So it is not the <hi>Priests</hi> intending <hi>to make a Sacrament,</hi> as you phrasify it, but his intending <hi>to celebrate it, i. e.</hi> not such an <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as is <hi>unitive</hi> of <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>form,</hi> as your <hi>Schools</hi> speak in this case, but such as relates to the <hi>external action.</hi> But against this you urge, 2. <hi>That such external signification is not at all necessary; for,</hi> say you, <hi>Might not a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Priest, to save the soul of some dying Infant, baptize it, if he could, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such signification by circumstances?</hi> Yes, and a very charitable man he would be in it too, if without any <hi>signification</hi> by <hi>circumstances, he could save the soul of a dying Infant.</hi> But I should think his meer intention were sufficient and well, as the <hi>chief Priest</hi> would supply the rest, as the <hi>Schools</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in a like case. For they put a very hard Question to themselves, <hi>If the intention of a Priest be necessary to the validity of a Sacrament, then, What becomes of the soul of an Infant, which dyes, being baptized without the Priest's intention?</hi> To which they answer, <hi>It may very piously be believed,</hi>

                  <hi>that in that case,</hi> summus Sacerdos supplebit, <hi>the High Priest will supply that defect</hi>; and what they say of <hi>intention,</hi> is much more true of <hi>Baptism</hi> it self; for in case it be not done out of <hi>contempt,</hi> I say that <hi>summus Sacerdos supplebit:</hi> it is not the meer want of <hi>Baptism</hi> will damn the soul of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> (as you suppose) when you make it so necessary, to use such <hi>shifts</hi>
                  <pb n="562" facs="tcp:101069:291"/>
as you speak of, <hi>to save the soul of a dying Infant.</hi> But, Do you think se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, that is the way to do it; for <hi>a Priest, under a Physical pretence to sprinkle water on the Childs face often, and once among the rest, to say softly, or by way of discourse,</hi> Ego te baptizo, &amp;c. <hi>with intention to conferr the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> But you ask however, <hi>Whether the Child be not really baptized by this, although none took notice of what the Priest did?</hi> I answer, though we should grant it, yet it proves not that the <hi>Priests inward intention</hi> was it which made it a <hi>Sacrament</hi>; but the observation of the <hi>institution</hi> of Christ in the external actions; and so far, as that is observed in this <hi>odd kind</hi> of <hi>baptizing,</hi> so far it is <hi>Baptism,</hi> and no more. There are two things therefore to be observed in <hi>Sacramental actions.</hi> 1. The <hi>differencing</hi> of them from other <hi>common</hi> or <hi>ordinary actions,</hi> and this we say is done by the <hi>circumstances</hi> attending them. 2. The <hi>validity</hi> of them as <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and this depends wholly and only on the observation of <hi>Christs Institution.</hi> For, as it is <hi>Institution</hi> which makes a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> so it is the observation of it, which makes this a <hi>Sacramental action,</hi> and not another. But in neither case is the <hi>Priests intention</hi> necessary to the essence of a <hi>Sacrament</hi>; for it may have its full force in all respects it was appointed for, whatever the <hi>Priests</hi> inward intention be. So that neither of your Instances, as to the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> or the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> do at all imply the necessity of the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> in order to the essence of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in either of them.</p>

                  <hi>no not of Baptism it self.</hi> You answer, 1. <hi>That as to the far greater part of Christians, the inconvenience follows as much out of the Bishops principles as yours, that they cannot be absolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they are baptized; because the Priest may vitiate something pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the essentials of Baptism.</hi> 2. You answer, <hi>That moral Assurance is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in such cases,</hi> i. e. <hi>such as is liable to no just cause of doubting and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting the contrary.</hi> We accept of this latter Answer in reference to your retortion of the <hi>inconvenience</hi> upon us, as to which we say, That where is no sufficient cause of doubting, a man ought to rest satisfied. But I shall now shew you, that this <hi>moral Assurance</hi> cannot be sufficient in your case, and that for these Reasons, 1. Because you build a main principle of <hi>Faith</hi> upon it, and you say, <hi>That moral Assurance cannot be a sufficient foundation for Faith</hi>; for then all your discourse of the <hi>resolution of Faith,</hi> comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which runs upon this principle, <hi>That nothing short of Infallibility can be a sufficient foundation for Faith.</hi> Now that you build a principle of <hi>Faith</hi> upon it, is evident, as I have proved already, even all that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> you pretend to in <hi>Church, Pope,</hi> and <hi>Council</hi>; for all depends upon this, that you certainly know, that such persons in your <hi>Church</hi> have had the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> truly administred, which cannot be without knowing the <hi>Priests intention.</hi> 2. Because you acknowledged before, that there must be such a <hi>certainty</hi> as is sufficient to ground an <hi>Infallible belief</hi>; for this you placed in his Lordships Objection, and this you pretended to satisfie, by saying, <hi>That the Pope and Council implicitly define themselves to be Infallible</hi>; and therefore you fall much beneath your self now, when you say, <hi>Moral Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> is sufficient. 3. Because we have far greater ground for <hi>moral Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> than you: for we make no more requisite to the <hi>essence</hi> of a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> than what all men are competent judges of; and our <hi>Church</hi> allows no such <hi>Baptisms,</hi> wherein none but the <hi>Priest</hi> is present; therefore if he
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:101069:291"/>
                  <hi>vitiates</hi> any thing <hi>essential</hi> to <hi>Baptism,</hi> it may easily be discovered; but in your case you have no positive <hi>Assurance</hi> at all of the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> the utmost you can pretend to, is, your having no <hi>ground</hi> to suspect it, which in many cases there may be. So that you cannot have properly a <hi>moral Certainty,</hi> which hath some evidence to build it self upon; but in your case there can be no <hi>evidence</hi> at all of the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> and therefore the knowledge of it is uncertain and conjectural. So that there is a vast difference between that <hi>moral Assurance,</hi> which we may have from the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal action,</hi> and that which you can possibly have from the <hi>Priests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi> 4. The danger is far greater, in not having this <hi>Assurance</hi> upon your principles, than upon ours, and yet we have far greater <hi>Assurance</hi> than you can possibly pretend to. Your danger is manifestly greater, as appears by this evident demonstration of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that in case the <hi>Priests intention</hi> be wanting, you must, by your own confession, be guilty of <hi>gross Idolatry</hi>; and yet you cannot certainly know, what the <hi>Priests intention</hi> was. This is plain in the case of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> whose <hi>adoration</hi> you profess to be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> because you suppose <hi>Christ</hi> to be present there. Now this depends upon a thing impossible for you certainly to know, and that is the <hi>Priests intention</hi> in the <hi>Consecration.</hi> For if the <hi>Priest</hi> wanted that <hi>inward inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which you make necessary to the essence of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> then, for all his pronouncing the words of <hi>Consecration, Hoc est corpus meum, Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> may not be there; and in case it be not there, you are by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for you do not then worship <hi>Christ,</hi> but meerly the <hi>Bread.</hi> Therefore, supposing <hi>adoration</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> upon your principle of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> were not <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet since that depends upon a thing <hi>impossible</hi> to be <hi>known,</hi> Who can with a good conscience do that, which he cannot be certain, but in the doing it, he may commit the <hi>greatest Idolatry?</hi> Wherefore, all the ill consequences of this Doctrine of the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> considered, besides the palpable errours of it, never was any Doctrine more imprudently contrived, or more weakly managed, than when this was decreed at the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You spend many words to explain that <hi>virtual intention</hi> which the <hi>Schools</hi> have taken up from <hi>Scotus</hi> upon this subject; but, all that you say,<note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 284, &amp;c.</note> adds nothing of satisfaction: upon these grounds, 1. Because this <hi>virtual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> must suppose some <hi>actual intention,</hi> so it is in all those cases you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>of a servant on his journey, a labourer at his work</hi>; though these may not have alwaies an <hi>express intention</hi> of the design of their journey or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet there is sufficient evidence from both of them, to know they had an <hi>actual intention,</hi> and there is no necessity of knowing any more of it, than what their <hi>actions</hi> discover: but in your case it is necessary to know that there was once an <hi>actual intention,</hi> because upon that depends the <hi>essence</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> and that is it which we object against you, that you cannot have any assurance that the Priest ever had an <hi>express intention.</hi> We do not therefore say, that any wandring thoughts after, do destroy the <hi>essence</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament</hi>; but the want of an <hi>actual intention</hi> at all upon your principles doth it, and this you cannot be certain of upon your grounds. And therefore your <hi>virtual intention</hi> doth you no service at all; for you say, <hi>This virtual intention is, when the Priest doth really operate, or ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Sacrament in virtue of an express intention which he had to do it</hi>; therefore it necessarily follows, that the <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>validity</hi> of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> must depend upon the first <hi>express intention,</hi> and not the after vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:101069:292"/>
one. So that if you cannot be certain of the <hi>first actual intention,</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> may want its essence, for all that you know. 2. Though a <hi>virtual intention</hi> may be consistent with some <hi>wandring thoughts</hi> from the <hi>first intention,</hi> yet not with an <hi>express intention</hi> to the <hi>contrary.</hi> As in your own instance, A servant sent upon business, hath at first an <hi>express in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> to do what his Master commands him; after, falling into company upon his way, he loseth for the time his <hi>actual intention</hi>; but, as long as he goes on upon his first business, he retains, I grant, a <hi>virtual intention</hi> of it: but, supposing that company disswade him from it, or his own mind turn, so that he hath an <hi>actual intention</hi> to the contrary, Will you say, this man retains his <hi>virtual intention</hi> still? Now our argument doth not lye meerly in this, that the <hi>Priest,</hi> at the instant of <hi>Consecration,</hi> may have his mind distracted from the matter, in which case you say, <hi>The virtual intention</hi> remains still, and is sufficient; but, that you cannot have any <hi>certainty,</hi> but he may have an <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>express intention</hi> to the <hi>contrary,</hi> at the instant of <hi>Consecration,</hi> and this destroyes his <hi>virtual intention,</hi> and consequently the essence of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> For, as long as you require an <hi>inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> besides the <hi>external action,</hi> you must be assured, that he had no actual contrary <hi>intention</hi> at that time, or else your <hi>virtual intention</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing to your purpose or satisfaction. That which remains, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Catharinus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 273.</note> of whom his Lordship sayes, <hi>That being present at</hi> Trent, <hi>he disputed this case very learnedly, and made it most evident, that this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot be defended, but that it must open a way for any unworthy Priest, to make infinite nullities in the administration of Sacraments; and that his arguments were of such strength, as amazed the other Divines which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And concluded, that no internal intention was required in the Minister of a Sacrament, but that intention which did appear,</hi> opere externo, <hi>in the work it self performed by him; and that if he had unworthily any wandring thoughts; nay more, any contrary intention within him, yet it neither did, nor could hinder the blessed effect of any Sacrament.</hi> To this you answer, <hi>That the Cardinal</hi> Palavicino <hi>is clear of opinion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 285.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Council decreed nothing against him; because he denied not an intention to be necessary in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only explicated the thing differently from the common way of the Schoolmen.</hi> But whosoever will read the arguments which <hi>Catharinus</hi> used in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> against the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> will easily find that he disputes against all manner of <hi>inward intention,</hi> but such as may be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the external action. But we must consider that <hi>Palavicino</hi> had a particular kindness for <hi>Catharinus,</hi> as being of <hi>Siena</hi> (the present <hi>Popes</hi> Country) insomuch that <hi>Caesar Aquilinius</hi> saith, <hi>If</hi> Luther <hi>had been of</hi> Siena, <hi>the Cardinal</hi> Palavicino <hi>would have defended him:</hi> and thence he endeavours to vindicate him in the point of certitude of <hi>Grace,</hi> as well as in this of the <hi>Priests intention,</hi> though in both, he goes contrary to the general sense of your <hi>Divines,</hi> both then at <hi>Trent,</hi> and ever since; who looked on both Opinions of <hi>Catharinus,</hi> as condemned there, as is manifest by <hi>Bellarmin, Suares, Vasquez, Valentia,</hi> and others. But however, we may observe this from hence, What an excellent Rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> and Judge of Controversies the Decrees of your <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> are, when there have been, and are still, such different Opinions, and eager contests about the sense of them; that in one point <hi>Dominicus √† Soto</hi> saith, the <hi>Council</hi> decreed of his side, <hi>Catharinus</hi> saith just the contrary, and yet both great <hi>Divines</hi> and present in the <hi>Council.</hi> And in this Doctrine of the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Priest,</hi> the general apprehension then was, and hath been since, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharinus</hi>
                  <pb n="565" facs="tcp:101069:292"/>
his Opinion was condemned there, but <hi>Cardinal Palavicino</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove the contrary. So that in the mean time here is like to be a fair <hi>end</hi> of Controversies, by your pretended Infallible Decrees of <hi>Councils,</hi> when you are so far from being agreed, what the sense of them is: and yet <hi>You, You</hi> are the men who say, <hi>Controversies</hi> cannot be ended by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> because there are such differences in the sense and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Thus (we hope) we have sufficiently vindicated his Lordships first charge of errour against your pretended <hi>General Councils</hi> confirmed by the <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we come to the second, you say,<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>His Lordship presents such a quaint subtilty against the Popes right to confirm them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 258.</note> 
                  <hi>and the necessity of his Confirmation, that you cannot well avoid the taking notice of it.</hi> Thus then, you say, he argues, <hi>No Council is confirmed till it be finished: and when it is finished, even before the Popes Confirmation be put to it, either it hath erred, or it hath not erred: If it hath erred, the Pope ought not to confirm it; and if he do, it is a void act: for no power can make falshood truth: If it hath not erred, then it was true before the Pope confirmed it; so his Confirmation adds nothing but his own assent.</hi> As quaint a <hi>subtilty</hi> as you call this, I am sure you are hard put to it, to return any satisfactory Answer to it. For you distinguish <hi>of the Popes joynt-consent, and of his actual Confirmation; in case,</hi> say you, <hi>the Pope either in person, or by his Legats concurr with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, then the definition is unquestionably Infallible; but in case he doth not, then the actual Confirmation is necessary; but in case the Council erre, the Pope ought not, and it is impossible he should confirm it; but if he doth not erre, you grant it is true, before the Pope confirms it, but his Confirmation makes us infallibly certain that it is true.</hi> This is the full force of your Answer, which by no means takes off the difficulty, as will appear, 1. That by reason of the <hi>Pope's</hi> rare appearance in <hi>General Councils</hi> (never in any that are unquestioned by the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Churches</hi>) that of his <hi>joynt-consent</hi> cannot serve you: neither doth the presence of his <hi>Legats</hi> suffice; for it is determined by <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and proved by many reasons, that though the <hi>Pope's Legats</hi> consent,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Concil. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> yet if they have not the <hi>express sentence</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> may erre notwithstanding. So that still the <hi>Popes</hi> actual Confirmation is supposed necessary, and that after the definitions of the <hi>Council</hi> are passed. And this is the case which his Lordship speaks to: and for your answer to that, I say, 2. That in plain terms you assert the <hi>Popes personal Infallibility,</hi> which you disowned the defence of before: for you say, In case the <hi>Council erre,</hi> not only the <hi>Pope</hi> ought not to confirm it, but that it is impossible he should. Which, What is it other than to assert, that the <hi>Pope</hi> shall never erre, though the <hi>Council</hi> may? Neither is it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to say, <hi>That he shall never erre in confirming the Decrees of a Council:</hi> for in this case the <hi>Council</hi> is supposed actually to <hi>erre</hi> already, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Infallibility</hi> can be at all supposed in the <hi>Council</hi>; and if the <hi>Pope</hi> be not considered in his personal capacity, he might erre as well as the <hi>Council.</hi> From whence it follows, since you suppose that a <hi>Council</hi> may erre, but not the <hi>Pope,</hi> that you really judge the <hi>Council</hi> not to be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, but the <hi>Pope</hi> only. 3. When you say, That if the <hi>Council</hi> erred not, the <hi>Popes</hi> Confirmation doth not make the definition true, but makes us infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly certain that it is true. I enquire further, Whereon this <hi>Infallible Certainty</hi> depends? on a <hi>promise</hi> made to the <hi>Council,</hi> or to the <hi>Pope?</hi> not to the <hi>Council,</hi> for that you grant may erre; but it is impossible the <hi>Pope</hi> should confirm it, therefore still it is some promise of the <hi>Popes Infallibility</hi>
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:101069:293"/>
which makes men <hi>Infallibly certain</hi> of the truth of what the <hi>Council</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. 4. To what purpose then are all those <hi>promises</hi> and <hi>proofs</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> which you produced concerning the <hi>Councils Infallibility,</hi> if, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding them, a <hi>General Council may err?</hi> Only the <hi>Pope</hi> shall never confirm it, and although it do not err, yet we cannot be <hi>Infallibly certain</hi> of it, but by the <hi>Popes</hi> confirmation. And let any reasonable man judge, whether a promise of the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> though there be none at all concerning <hi>Councils,</hi> be not sufficient for all this? So that upon these prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples you take away the least degree of <hi>necessity</hi> of any <hi>Infallibility</hi> in <hi>Councils,</hi> and resolve all into the <hi>Popes</hi> Infallibility. For to what purpose are they <hi>Infallible,</hi> if we cannot be certain that any thing which they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> is true, but by the <hi>Popes</hi> confirmation?</p>
               <p>But that the <hi>Popes confirmation</hi> cannot make the Decrees of those you account <hi>General Councils</hi> Infallible,<note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> nor us <hi>Infallibly Certain</hi> of the truth of them, his Lordship proves by another evidence in matter of fact, <hi>viz. That the Pope hath erred by teaching in and by the Council of</hi> Lateran (<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by</hi> Innocent 3.) <hi>that Christ is present in the Sacrament by way of Transubstantiation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 257.</note> 
                  <hi>Which</hi> (his Lordship saith) <hi>was never heard of in the Primitive Church, nor till the Council of</hi> Lateran; <hi>nor can it be proved out of Scripture; and taken properly cannot stand with the grounds of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 287.</note> This you call <hi>a strange kind of proceeding to assert a point of so great importance, without solving or so much as taking notice of the pregnant proofs your Authours bring both out of Scripture and Fathers to the contrary of what he mainly affirms.</hi> How pregnant those proofs are, we must examine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; but his Lordship might justly leave it to those who assert so strange a Doctrine to produce their evidence for it. Especially, since it is confessed by so many among your selves, <hi>That it could not be sufficiently proved, either from Scripture or Fathers to bind men to the belief of it,</hi>

For it is a vain thing for you to attempt to prove so unreasonable a Doctrine as this is, by some few lame citations of <hi>Fathers,</hi> unless you can first prove that the <hi>Authority</hi> of them is so great, as to make me believe any thing they say, though never so contrary to sense and reason. If you could bring some places of the <hi>Fathers</hi> to prove that we must renounce absolutely the judgement of sense, believe things most contradictions to reason, yet you must first shew that the <hi>evidence</hi> they bring is greater then that of <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>reason.</hi> Or that I am more bound to believe them, then I am to believe the greatest evidence of <hi>sense</hi> or <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> When you say, <hi>In these cases we must submit reason to Faith</hi>; we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, when it is no manifest contradiction, in things so obvious to sense or reason, that the asserting it, will destroy the use of our <hi>faculties</hi> and make us turn absolute <hi>Scepticks</hi>; for then <hi>Faith,</hi> must be destroyed too. For may not a man question, as well, whether his hearing may not deceive him as his sight, and by that means he may question all the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and what becometh of his <hi>Faith</hi> then? and if his <hi>sight</hi> might deceive him in a proper object of it, Why might not the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> sight deceive them in the <hi>body</hi> of Christ being risen from the grave? And if a man may be bound to believe that to be false which his sense judges to be true, what assurance can be had of any <hi>miracles</hi> which were wrought to confirm the <hi>Christian Doctrine?</hi> and therefore his Lordship might well say,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That Transubstantiation is not consistent with the grounds of Christian Religion.</hi> But of this I have spoken already.

And since, you do not grant their <hi>Authority</hi> immediately <hi>Divine</hi>; since you pretend not to places as clear out of them as the judgement of <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> is in this case; since you dare not say, that all the <hi>Fathers</hi> are as much

agreed about it, as the <hi>senses</hi> of all mankind are about the matter in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute; I think with men who have not already renounced all that looks like reason, this will be no matter of Controversie at all. From whence it follows, that supposing the <hi>Fathers</hi> were as clear for you (as they are against you) in this subject, yet that would not be enough to perswade us to believe so many <hi>contradictions</hi> as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> involves in it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because the <hi>Fathers</hi> delivered it to us. I speak not this, as though I did at all fear the clearness of any <hi>Testimony</hi> you can produce out of them, but to shew you that you take not a competent way to prove such a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is.

enough from that <hi>substantial change</hi> into the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert) so by that effect of the <hi>sign</hi> it self upon our <hi>bodies,</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> is helped the better to understand the <hi>efficacy</hi> of the thing signified upon our <hi>souls,</hi> in order to eternal life; there being as <hi>real,</hi> though <hi>spiritual, union</hi> between <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Believers,</hi> as there is between the <hi>bread</hi> and our <hi>bodies.</hi> And that this is the plain and unsophisticated meaning of this <hi>Authour</hi> in these words, I dare appeal to the impartial judgement of any intelligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                  <hi>viz. this bread, is bread before the words of the Sacrament, but when consecration comes, of bread, it is made the flesh of Christ.</hi> This we deny not, but the dispute is about the sense in which it is made so, whether by a <hi>substantial change</hi> of the <hi>bread</hi> into the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> and that this cannot be this Authour's meaning, appears by those known words which are used by him, speaking of the efficacy of Christs power in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whereby he can make, <hi>ut sint quae erant &amp; in aliud commutentur, that they might be what they were, and yet be changed into something else.</hi> And, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a great Controversie hath been raised about the reading of these words, yet this <hi>reading</hi> is not only justified by many Authours of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Antiquity, but by two <hi>MSS.</hi> in the <hi>K. of France's Library,</hi> besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others elsewhere, and all editions, but that at <hi>Rome,</hi> and others which follow it.

               <p>Thus I have, to satisfie you, examined your testimonies in behalf of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>; but whereas you referr me for more to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and other <hi>Catholick Authours,</hi> I shall referr you for Answer to those no less <hi>Catholick Authours,</hi> though no believers of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> who have taken large and excellent pains in answering what they have brought; either from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity.</hi> But you, having done your best in the latter, come at last to the former; but so pitifully manage your business as to <hi>Scripture,</hi> that it had been more for the interest of your cause, you had never medled with it. For you only say, <hi>That the words of Scripture, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their proper and litteral sense, do evidently shew, that the only substance which is delivered in this Sacrament, is the body of Christ, and that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread is no more there.</hi> And all this comes only from hence, because Christ saith, <hi>This is my body,</hi> which you parallel with one, <hi>pointing to a hogshead of wine, saying, This is wine; and with one holding up a purse full of mony, saying, This is gold: who if they intend to speak truth, must signifie, that the only liquor contained</hi> sub propri√¢ form√¢, <hi>in the hogshead is wine; and all the mony in the purse, gold.</hi> But how weak this is, will easily appear, 1. That you take it for granted, that the expression of Christ is not at all <hi>figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> but of the same <hi>nature</hi> with those Propositions you mention, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is largely proved, from the nature of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> from many parallel <hi>expressions</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> from evidence of <hi>Antiquity, Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> that these words of <hi>Christ</hi> cannot be otherwise than <hi>figuratively</hi> understood. 2. You suppose that <hi>Christ</hi> must speak of the <hi>individual bread,</hi> when he said, <hi>This is my body,</hi> as our parallel instances are of such <hi>individuals</hi> as are pointed to. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> will tell you, <hi>That if Christ had spoken of the bread, when he said, This is my body,</hi> absurdissima esset locutio, <hi>it had been a most absurd speech.</hi> And <hi>Vasquez</hi> saith, <hi>If the Pronoune</hi> Hoc, <hi>This, should relate to the bread,</hi>

                  <hi>he confesses, that by virtue of those words, there could be no substantial change made in it; for the bread must remain still.</hi> So that by the confession of your own Authours, your parallel is absurd, and destructive to the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>

Yea, and the after words of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil couple both together, in this reference; for it follows,</hi> &amp; similiter, <hi>And so likewise, though in the Primitive Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And a man by the definition of this Council may be an Heretick for standing to Christs Institution, in the very matter of the Sacrament: And the Churches Law for one kind may not be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but Christs Institution under both kinds may. And yet this Council did not err; no, take heed of it.</hi> But all this cannot perswade you, <hi>That the</hi> non obstante <hi>relates to any thing but to the receiving after supper:</hi> which I much wonder at,<note place="margin">P. 250.</note> since the design of the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> was not to determine so much concerning the <hi>time</hi> of receiving, as the <hi>kinds</hi> in which it was to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                  <hi>nor the practise of the Church in administring under one kind is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Institution and ordination of Christ. For,</hi> say you, <hi>to shew this, the Bishop should have made it appear that Christ did so institute this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his last supper, that he would not have one part to be administred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, or that he would not have one part to be taken without the other. And it cannot be proved that Laymen are bound to receive in both kinds, from those words, Drink ye all of this; For if this were a command and not a Counsel, it was given to the Apostles who all drunk of the Chalice.</hi> So that the state of the Question is this, Whether the Primitive <hi>Institution</hi> be universally obligatory to all <hi>Christians</hi> or no? For you suppose, that either it was only a <hi>Counsel,</hi> or else it had particular reference to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> For the clearing therefore of this <hi>Question,</hi> there are but two wayes whereby we can judge of the obligatory nature of such <hi>Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; either by an express declaration of the will of the first <hi>Institutor,</hi> or by the <hi>Vniversal</hi> sense of the <hi>Church</hi> concerning the nature of that <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi> And if these two appear evident in this present case, you will have no cause to question, but the <hi>communion in one kind is a violation of the Institution of Christ.</hi> There are two wayes whereby we may judge what the will of the <hi>Legislator</hi> is: First, by an <hi>express positive command.</hi> Secondly, by an <hi>unalterable reason</hi> on which the <hi>Institution</hi> is founded. Now that both these are clear in the case of Communion in both kinds I now come to manifest. First, by a <hi>positive command.</hi> For although we grant a difference between an <hi>Institution</hi> and a <hi>command,</hi> in this respect, that the <hi>Institution</hi> properly respects the <hi>thing,</hi> and a <hi>command</hi> the <hi>person</hi>; and that an <hi>Institution,</hi> barely considered as such, doth not bind all persons to the <hi>observance</hi> of it; as we say, <hi>Matrimony</hi> is <hi>Instituted</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> but do not thence assert that all persons are <hi>bound</hi> to it, but yet take an <hi>Institution</hi> as it referrs to persons, and so it is aequipollent with a <hi>command.</hi> And so <hi>Christs Instituting</hi> that all who believe should be <hi>baptized,</hi> is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>command</hi> to that purpose. But here is a great difference to be made between such things as were <hi>done</hi> at the <hi>Institution,</hi> and such things as were <hi>Instituted</hi> to be <hi>done</hi> afterwards. Thus <hi>Christ</hi> washed his <hi>Disciples feet,</hi> administred <hi>after Supper,</hi> and only to <hi>twelve</hi>; but it doth not follow that these <hi>circumstances</hi> must be still observed, because though they were done then at that <hi>celebration,</hi> yet <hi>Christ</hi> doth not <hi>Institute</hi> or appoint the doing of them, when ever that <hi>Sacrament</hi> should be administred after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. For we are to consider, that though there were some things peculiar to the first <hi>Institution,</hi> yet the main of it was intended for the
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:101069:299"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> in all following times. Or else we must make the celebration of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> it self to be a meer arbitrary thing. Which if it be not, there must lye an <hi>obligation</hi> on men for the <hi>participation</hi> of it; now this obligation must suppose a <hi>Law,</hi> and therefore we have gained this, that the <hi>Institution</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> doth imply a command for its observation in the <hi>Church.</hi> So that this action of <hi>Christ</hi> was not meerly a matter of <hi>Counsel,</hi> but there is something in it perpetually <hi>obligatory:</hi> Because it was not a peculiar <hi>rite</hi> appropriated to the present time, but intended for the future ages of the <hi>Church.</hi> This being proved in the <hi>General,</hi> that there is a perpetually obligatory command, implyed in the <hi>Institution</hi>; we are now to enquire, How far this command extends? Whether it extended only to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or else to all believers? That it was administred then to the <hi>Apostles</hi> only is granted, but the Question is, In what capacity it was administred to them, Whether only as <hi>Apostles,</hi> or as <hi>Believers?</hi> and that must be judged by the intention of the <hi>Institution,</hi> Whether it were of that nature as to respect their <hi>Apostolical office,</hi> or else some thing which would be common with them to all other Believers to the worlds end? If it were only and wholly proper to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> there can be no reason given, why the <hi>Institution</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> should continue after their times: neither could any other but the <hi>Apostles</hi> have any right, either to administer or to receive it. It follows then, that this <hi>Sacrament</hi> was not instituted meerly for the <hi>Apostles</hi>; if not for them meerly, then what was contained in the <hi>Institution</hi> doth concern others as well as them. Now there are four things commanded in the <hi>Institution, Take, eat, drink ye all of this, and, This do in remembrance of me.</hi> If the <hi>Institution</hi> doth not meerly respect the <hi>Apostles</hi> as such but others also, then some of these things at least must extend to others too considered as <hi>Believers.</hi> And if <hi>some,</hi> why not <hi>all</hi> of them? Were the <hi>Apostles</hi> considered as <hi>Believers,</hi> when they were bid <hi>to take and eat?</hi> and as <hi>Apostles,</hi> when <hi>Christ</hi> said, <hi>drink ye all of this?</hi> What reasonable pretext can be imagin'd for such a groundless fancy? If they were not considered as <hi>Believers,</hi> when <hi>Christ</hi> said <hi>take, eat</hi>; by what right can any <hi>Believers take</hi> and <hi>eat?</hi> if they were then, so were they likewise afterwards, when <hi>Christ said to them, Drink ye all of this.</hi> As far therefore as I can possibly see, you must either admit the people to <hi>drinking all of this,</hi> or else deprive them of their right of <hi>taking and eating.</hi> And if you did speak consistently, you must say, that the peoples being admitted at all to the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is an act of favour and indulgence in the <hi>Church,</hi> but not necessary by any command of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Eucharist</hi> being administred to the <hi>Apostles</hi> and not the <hi>people</hi>; and therefore it being <hi>indulgence</hi> to admit them at all, it is in the <hi>Churches</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to admit as far and to what she pleases. This is the only rational way I can imagine, whereby you may defend the excluding the people from the <hi>Cup:</hi> But this you dare not say; and therefore are put to the weakest shifts imaginable to reconcile it with the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some therefore say,<note place="margin">¬ß. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>That all these are words only of invitation and not of command, and that they only give a right, and not oblige men to do it.</hi> But if these be only words of <hi>invitation,</hi> what <hi>precept</hi> is there any where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for the celebration of the <hi>Eucharist?</hi> That they are an <hi>invitation</hi> we deny not; but we say they are such an <hi>invitation</hi> as imply a <hi>duty</hi> to come, too. When a <hi>Father</hi> bids his <hi>Children</hi> come and sit down at <hi>Table, take and eat</hi> their meat: this is an invitation, but such as by reason of the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the person carry a <hi>command</hi> with them. So it is here, <hi>Christ
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:101069:300"/>
invites to come, to take, eat, and drink</hi>; but so that it implyes a <hi>command</hi> that men should come; or else it must be wholly left at mens <hi>liberty,</hi> so that it is no <hi>sin</hi> for men to neglect or refuse to come. And if the <hi>Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> only gives men a <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>take, eat, and drink,</hi> without any obligation to these things as a <hi>duty,</hi> How comes the administration of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> at all to become a <hi>duty,</hi> since there are no other words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand then what are contained in the <hi>Institution?</hi> Which others being sensible of, they most unreasonably distinguish between <hi>Taking and eating,</hi> which they <hi>make an absolute command, and, Drinking all of this, which they say is only a conditional precept:</hi> and the reason they give, is, <hi>because St.</hi> Paul <hi>saith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.25.</note> 
                  <hi>This do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me</hi>; and so, say they, <hi>Do this, doth not imply a command for the doing it, but only the relation which that action hath to the death of Christ when they do it; for those words, as oft as you do it, do suppose it not to be simply necessary, but only shew, when they do it, to what purpose it should be done.</hi> But if there be any weight in this, it will as well hold still concerning the participation of the <hi>bread,</hi> as well as the <hi>cup</hi>; for, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith <hi>This do ye as oft as ye drink it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> so he adds in the words immediately following, <hi>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>ye do shew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> If therefore it notes only the relation of the <hi>action</hi> to its end without a <hi>command</hi> for performance in the <hi>one,</hi> it must do so in the <hi>other</hi> also. And so all the <hi>Sacrament</hi> will be a meer matter of <hi>liberty</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> whether men will observe it or no. But <hi>Bellarmin</hi> with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful subtilty hath found a <hi>command</hi> for the <hi>one</hi> and not the <hi>other</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22.19.</note> 
                  <hi>by which,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are to understand, that Christ commanded that the Sacrament should be administred to all under the species of bread, but not under that of wine.</hi> And this he is so transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, <hi>That in a rapture he admires the wonderful providence of God in the Scripture, who by this means hath taken away all possibility of evasion from the Hereticks.</hi> So it should seem indeed, when even his Brethren the <hi>Jesuits</hi> can scarce hold laughing at this subtilty. Since, St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>This do in remembrance of me,</hi> not after the <hi>bread,</hi> but after the <hi>cup.</hi> And therefore may we not more justly admire at the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in thus suffering men who will not see the truth under a pretence of <hi>subtilty,</hi> to <hi>infatuate</hi> themselves.

                  <hi>Who doth not see this?</hi> And <hi>Suarez</hi> saith, <hi>those words, Do this, or with that addition, In remembrance of me, or with that condition, As oft as ye do it,</hi> ad eundem sensum referuntur, <hi>come all to the same purpose.</hi> So that still it follows, if there be a <hi>command</hi> for one, there is for the other also. But yet there is a <hi>subtilty</hi> beyond any of these; which is, <hi>That Christ in those words in</hi> Luke <hi>after the distribution of the bread,</hi> Hoc facite, <hi>Do this, did make the Apostles Priests; and therefore, although they did receive the bread as believers, yet they received the cup as Priests, and so that belongs only to the Priests and not to the people.</hi> What will not these men prove which they have a mind to! But it is their unhappiness, that their own <hi>subtilties</hi>
                  <pb n="581" facs="tcp:101069:300"/>
do them the most mischief, as appears by these things conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent from hence; which are repugnant to their own principles. 1. That <hi>Priests</hi> not consecrating, ought to receive the Cup, as well as those that do. For it is plain, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate now, but only receive; and therefore this belongs to them as receiving, and not as consecrating. And by the same reasons that <hi>Priests</hi> not-consecrating may receive, others may receive too. 2. That if they were made <hi>Priests</hi> by those words, after the distribution of the bread, then they have no power to <hi>consecrate,</hi> but only the <hi>bread.</hi> For the words are, <hi>Hoc facite, Do this,</hi> i. e. <hi>that which Christ had then done.</hi> Otherwise, if those words be taken with reference to the <hi>Cup,</hi> then if the <hi>Apostles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the bread as <hi>believers,</hi> they received the <hi>Cup</hi> so too: for these words, <hi>Do this,</hi> must not relate to their <hi>receiving,</hi> but to their <hi>power</hi> of <hi>consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 3. If this be taken generally, <hi>Do this,</hi> and so giving them a <hi>power</hi> to do all that <hi>Christ</hi> did, then it will amount to a <hi>precept</hi> for all who admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to follow <hi>Christs example</hi> in the <hi>Institution.</hi> And therefore, as he did administer, the <hi>Cup,</hi> as well as the <hi>Bread,</hi> to all that were present, then all others will be bound to do so, if their power of <hi>administration</hi> be derived from these words, <hi>Do this,</hi> and they referr to the whole action of <hi>Christ.</hi> But I know what Answer will be here given, <hi>That these words relate to the Sacrifice, and not to the Sacrament,</hi> Hoc facite, <hi>implying their power of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, as to which they say, both elements are necessary, but not to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> But 1. Not to enter on the Dispute about the <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; if both <hi>elements</hi> be necessary to it, then it was great reason that the words make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>Priests,</hi> should come after both <hi>elements,</hi> and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reason be deduced from those words which are spoken only after the bread. 2. If these words relate to the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and not to the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> By what authority do they administer the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> What other words are there to give them a power to do the one distinct from them, whereby they pretend a <hi>right</hi> for the other. 3. There is no evidence at all from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that <hi>Hoc facite</hi> hath any respect to the <hi>Eucharist</hi> as a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> or to the making the <hi>Apostles Priests.</hi> And so much is confessed by <hi>Estius, viz. that neither is this exposition found in any ancient Writer, nor is it suitable to our Saviours purpose. For, he saith, it is not absolutely said,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Estius in l.</hi> 4. <hi>sentent dist.</hi> 12. <hi>sect.</hi> 11.</note> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, <hi>but,</hi> Hoc facite, i. e. <hi>that which ye see me do, do ye likewise.</hi> So that still, by virtue of these words, those who do receive authority to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, are bound to follow <hi>Christs example,</hi> and that as he did administer in <hi>both kinds</hi> to all who were present, so ought they to do likewise. But there is one Exception yet more left, which is the last Reserve, <hi>viz. that although it be granted to be a command, that the Cup should be administred to all, yet it is only a positive command, binding in the general; but yet it is of the nature of all affirmative precepts, that though it alwaies binds, yet not at all times, but only in case of necessity, of which necessity the Church is the most competent Judge; and therefore if the Church do not think it necessary, then the obligation ceases.</hi> To which I answer, 1. That upon this ground it will be in the <hi>Churches</hi> power to repeal or suspend all divine <hi>positive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> as well as this. For the reason of this will hold for all others, which is, that they do not oblige, as they speak, <hi>ad semper,</hi> but only <hi>semper, i. e. not at all times,</hi> though they never <hi>cease to oblige.</hi> And therefore on this ground, for all that I can see, the <hi>Church</hi> may as well repeal the use of <hi>Baptism,</hi> or the <hi>Eucharist</hi> it self, as the <hi>communion in both kinds</hi>; all being of of an equal nature, as <hi>affirmative precepts.</hi> But, Is it possible to imagine
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:101069:301" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>Christ</hi> appointing <hi>positive Institutions</hi> in his <hi>Church,</hi> and giving <hi>precepts</hi> and plain directions about them, should yet leave it in the power of any men to reverse, alter, suspend the <hi>obligation</hi> to the performance of those commands? Did not he foresee all cases of <hi>necessity,</hi> when he first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed these things, and, if notwithstanding that, he makes a plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for the observance of them; What can such a pretended power in the <hi>Church</hi> signifie, but an authority to alter or repeal what she pleases in the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> 2. There is a great deal of difference between the nature of the <hi>obligation</hi> of <hi>affirmative precepts,</hi> and the prohibiting the <hi>use</hi> of something positively commanded. For, although <hi>positive precepts</hi> do not bind at all times, yet that reaches only to the thing it self, and not to the <hi>mode</hi> of performance. Thus we say, That the <hi>Eucharist</hi> being a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Institution,</hi> doth not oblige men at all times to be partakers of it; but if on that account any <hi>Church</hi> should undertake to forbid the celebration of it, this were a direct violation of the <hi>Law</hi> it self, and not an <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it in regard of circumstances. And what ever obligation of this nature there is, it respects the whole <hi>duty</hi>; But it doth by no means fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that therefore in the <hi>celebration</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> may declare what may be used, and what not. For the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>performance</hi> in case it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at all, is absolutely <hi>commanded</hi>; it is only the <hi>performance</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which is of the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>positive precept.</hi> Thus we say, Men are not <hi>bound to pray at all times,</hi> though they be <hi>alwaies bound to pray</hi>; but in case men do pray, they are indispensably bound to pray as <hi>God</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to do it. So we say here, That men are not <hi>bound</hi> at all times to administer, or receive the <hi>Eucharist</hi>; but, in case they do, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably bound to receive it according to <hi>Christ's Institution.</hi> So that this of <hi>communion</hi> in <hi>both kinds,</hi> relates to the <hi>manner</hi> of a <hi>positive precept,</hi> and is not a distinct <hi>positive precept</hi> by it self; and therefore is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably by any authority of the <hi>Church.</hi> Besides, your <hi>Church</hi> doth not meerly <hi>suspend</hi> the exercise of this in case of necessity, but forbids men the doing it, which is a direct and wilful <hi>violation</hi> of the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And therefore the Question is not as it is strangely perverted by some of you, <hi>Whether it be necessary at all times to receive the Cup</hi> (although even that be true in case of receiving at all) <hi>but, whether it be in the Churches power at all to prohibit the receiving it</hi>; and this we say, and are ready to make good to be a presumptuous violation of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and an usurping an <hi>Authority</hi> which may as well extend to all positive <hi>Institutions.</hi> And thus I hope I have made that appear, which you say his Lordship should have done, <hi>viz. that Christ did so institute the Sacrament of his last Supper, that he would, not have one part to be administred without the other, nor one part to be taken without the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same I might also at large shew, from the <hi>Reasons</hi> of this <hi>Institution,</hi> that they do equally belong to the people,<note place="margin">¬ß 16.</note> as well as the <hi>Priests,</hi> and that those reasons are of a nature as unalterable as the <hi>Institution</hi> it self; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I should have shewed the vanity of your distinction of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the absurdity of your Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy</hi>; but that would be too large for our present design; and that which you give me not sufficient ground to enter upon, since the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is sufficiently cleared from the <hi>Institution</hi> it self. I therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to shew, that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did alwaies understand the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> in both kinds to be an indispensible part of the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Which one would think were evident enough from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his bringing

For if, because of some ill customs which had obtained amongst them, he tells them, <hi>This is not to eat the Lords Supper</hi>; How much more would he have said so,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.20.</note> if there had been an <hi>mutilation</hi> of the <hi>parts</hi> of it? And all along in his discourse he supposes <hi>Christs Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be the indispensable Rule which they ought to observe; <hi>That which I have received of the Lord, I delivered unto you:</hi> not, certainly, to leave it in their power, Whether they would observe it or no, but to shew them, what their duty was, and what they ought unalterably to observe. Else he would never have told them so much of the danger of <hi>unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, in eating the Bread, and drinking the Cup of the Lord unworthily</hi>; For, Can we possibly think, that the rudeness of their access to the <hi>Lords Table</hi> was so great a sin, and the violation of his <hi>Institution</hi> to be none at all? The <hi>Apostles</hi> were such strangers to the Doctrine of <hi>Concomitancy,</hi> that still both <hi>eating and drinking</hi> were supposed then, even by the most unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receivers. There were then no such <hi>fears</hi> of the <hi>effusion</hi> of the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> or the irreverence in receiving it, and much less of the <hi>long beards</hi> of the <hi>Laity</hi>; which are the worshipful reasons given by <hi>Gerson</hi> and others, why the people should not be admitted to the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Chalice.</hi> I do verily think the <hi>Apostles</hi> had as much care to preserve the due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as ever the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> or <hi>Trent</hi> had; but they thought it no way to preserve the reverence of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> by shewing so little to <hi>Christ,</hi> as not to observe his <hi>Institution.</hi> But you very kindly grant that which you knew was impossible to be denied, <hi>viz.

                  <hi>it was the ordinary custom for all that would (the Laity as well as others) to receive the Eucharist in both kinds; but,</hi> say you, <hi>we averr, this custom proceeded meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of free devotion, and not out of any belief, that it was absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary so to do, by virtue of Christs precept.</hi> It is no great matter what you <hi>averr,</hi> since you <hi>averr</hi> so monstrous a Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as confidently as you do this, and with much alike reason. For I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already, that the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in reference to this, is perpetually obligatory, and that the <hi>Apostles</hi> look upon that as an <hi>unalterable Rule,</hi> and therefore your <hi>averring</hi> signifies nothing, when you never offer to prove what you averr. But, I pray tell me, By what <hi>means</hi> would you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what <hi>precepts</hi> are perpetually obligatory, which are not clear to our present purpose? If <hi>positive command, immutable reason, universal practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> may prove any thing so, we have all these plain and clear for Communion in both kinds. And not the least suspition or intimation given, that they looked on it as a matter of <hi>free devotion,</hi> but of <hi>indispensable necessity.</hi> But, What mean you in saying, <hi>When the number of Christians was small, they received it in both kinds?</hi> Do <hi>Christs Institutions</hi> vary according to the numbers of <hi>Communicants?</hi> Hath not <hi>Christ</hi> the same power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige <hi>many</hi> as a <hi>few?</hi> or, Do you think the numbers of breakers of his <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> make the fault the less? But, When was it the number of <hi>Christians</hi> was so small? Only in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times, or as long as the custom lasted of <hi>communicating</hi> in both kinds? Do you think the number of <hi>Christians</hi> was so small in the <hi>Primitive times?</hi> If you do, you lamentably discover your ignorance in the <hi>History</hi> of those times: Read the <hi>Christians Apologies</hi> over, and you will believe the contrary. But, Did this small number continue in the time of the <hi>Christian Emperours,</hi> even till after a <hi>thousand years</hi> after Christ? For so long the Communion in both kinds continued
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:101069:302"/>
so inviolably, that neither you, nor any before you, are able to produce one <hi>Instance</hi> of a publick and solemn celebration of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> wherein the <hi>People</hi> did not communicate in both kinds. And, Could a matter so indifferent as you suppose this to be, meet with no persons all this time, who out of reverence to the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> should deny giving it to the <hi>People</hi>? Nothing then but an unmeasurable confidence, and a resolution to say any thing, though never so false or absurd (if it tend to the interest of your <hi>Church</hi>) could make you say, <hi>That communion in one kind was alwaies, even in the first five or six hundred years, allowed publickly as well in the Church, as out of it.</hi> Than which, if you had studied it, you could scarce have uttered a <hi>greater untruth</hi>; and in which there are such <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> of your own party bearing witness against you. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is so far from helping you out in it, that he is extremely at a loss to offer at any thing which hath any tendency that way. But before we come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Instances and Exceptions you make, we must somewhat further see, what the practice and sense of the <hi>Church</hi> was, that we may the better judge, Whether communion in both <hi>kinds</hi> were looked on as a matter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>free devotion,</hi> or as something necessary by virtue of <hi>Christs Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And for this I shall not insist on those multitudes of Testimonies, which manifest the practice it self, but briefly touch at some few, which more directly prove, that what they did, was, Because in doing otherwise, they should have violated the <hi>Institution</hi> of Christ. To pass by therefore the Testimonies of <hi>Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> all clear for the practice; the first I insist on, is that of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> against those who gave water in the <hi>Chalice,</hi> instead of wine; for, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth but read the very entrance of that Epistle, will soon find that he looked on <hi>Christs Institution</hi> in all the parts of it as <hi>unalterable.

                  <hi>and by that means they may be expelled out of the society of Catholicks.</hi> You were therefore very ill advised, to make choice of this for your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which makes it plain, that all <hi>Catholicks</hi> did receive in <hi>both kinds,</hi> and that the <hi>Manichees</hi> might be thereby known that they did not. And if it were the custom for the <hi>Catholicks</hi> sometimes to receive in both kinds, and sometimes not, (which is all the shift <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath) and the <hi>Manichees</hi> not at all, this could be no note of <hi>distinction</hi> between them; for, although the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> might not receive at one time, they could not tell but they might at another. Now <hi>Leo</hi>'s intention being, to give such a note of distinction, that they might not receive at all among them, it evidently follows, that all the <hi>Catholicks</hi> did constantly receive in both kinds, and that they were only <hi>Manichees</hi> who did abstain from the <hi>Cup.</hi> For that Story which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> insists on, and you referr to, <hi>of the woman, who being a Macedonian Heretick, yet pretending to communicate with the Catholicks, had the bread which her Maid brought with her, and which she took instead of the Eucharist, turned into a stone in her mouth, upon which she runs presently to the Bishop, and with tears confessed her fault,</hi> as we take it wholly upon the Faith of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen,</hi> from whom <hi>Nicephorus</hi> transcribes it,<note place="margin">

For the first, When you are proving that the <hi>Fathers</hi> expressions were not <hi>Rhetorical flourishes,</hi> you would fain have your own accounted so. <hi>For,</hi> say you, <hi>How can it seem to any that duly considers it,</hi>

This is a thing must be tryed by particulars, because it is on both sides acknowledged, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> did many times use their <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and that such things are uttered by them, in their <hi>Panegyrical Orations</hi> especially, which will not abide a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere tryal.<note place="margin">

But who are better Judges of these things then the <hi>Fathers</hi> themselves? Are they not the men, who have bid us distinguish what comes from them in a heat, from that which they deliver as the Doctrine of the <hi>Church?</hi> Have not they told us, that the popular <hi>Orations</hi> uttered in <hi>Churches</hi> are no rules of opinion?

What <hi>put-off</hi> then is it for us to say, that St. <hi>Basil</hi> in

his <hi>Oration</hi> on <hi>Mammas,</hi> and the forty eight <hi>Martyrs</hi>; that S. <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> in his <hi>Panegyrical Orations</hi> on St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> his sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> in his commendation of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> do make use of their <hi>Rhetorick</hi> in <hi>Apostrophe's</hi> to the persons whom they praise, without any solemn Invocation of them? What is there herein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable to their present purpose? Is it any more then <hi>Oratours</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done? What strange thing is it then, that those great <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> should make use of their art to raise the people, not only to a high esteem of their persons, but of those vertues which rendred them so illustrious. Might not such expressions by way of <hi>Apostrophe</hi> be still used by such who are furthest from the <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints?</hi> although by their example we are taught how dangerous it is to indulge <hi>Rhetorick</hi> too much in such cases. But as though they foresaw the ill use would be made of them, they add such expressions as sufficiently tell us, they made no solemn Invocation of them; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, and the like. Had these persons a mind to deliver a Doctrine of <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> who speak with such <hi>hesitation</hi> and doubt as to their sense of what was spoken? (For it is a groundless shift, to say, that those expressions imply an affirmation and not doubt.) That which we say then, is this, That the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> is not to be judged by such <hi>Encomiastick Orations,</hi> wherein such <hi>Rhetorical flourishes</hi> are usual; and when you bring us their plain and positive assertions, we will by no means give you that Answer, That those are <hi>flourishes</hi> of <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick.</hi> But his Lordship very well knew, how far you were from any such dogmatical assertions of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in this point, and that the most plausible testimonies which you had were taken out of those three great <hi>Oratours</hi> in their <hi>Panegyricks</hi> in praise of their Friends, or of the <hi>Martyrs</hi>; and therefore it was he said, <hi>Though some of the ancient Fathers have some Rhetorical flourishes about it, for the stirring up devotion (as they thought) yet the Church then admitted not of the Invocation of Saints.</hi> That is it we stand on, that no such thing was admitted by the <hi>Church,</hi> if we should yield that any particular (though great) persons were too lavish in their expressions this way; must these be the standard which we must judge of the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> by? We must consider the <hi>Church</hi> was now out of persecution, and ease and honour attended that profession of Christianity, for which such multitudes had endured the flames; and the people began to grow more loose and vain then when they still expected <hi>Martyrdoms:</hi> This made these great men so highly commend the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in their popular Orations, not to propound them as <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>Invocation,</hi> but as <hi>examples</hi> for their <hi>imitation.</hi> Thence they encouraged them to frequent the <hi>Memoriae martyrum,</hi> that by their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in those places they might revive something of that pristine heat of devotion, which was now so much abated among them. But the event was so far from answering their expectation, that by this means they grew by degrees to place much of their Religion, rather in honouring the former <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> then in striving to imitate them in their vertues and graces. And from the frequenting the places where the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were enshrined through the pretence of some extatical dreams and visions, or some rare occurrences which they say happened at those places, they began to turn their real honour into superstitious devotion, which at last ended in solemn <hi>Invocation.</hi> To which no small encouragement was given when such persons as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> and others, were so far from putting a stop to the growing evil, that though they confessed many miscarriages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:101069:305"/>
yet they rather sought to palliate them and make the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of them, still hoping that this zeal in the people to the honour of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> would promote devotion among them; whereas it sunk gradually into greater superstitions. This I take to be the truest and most faithful account of those first beginnings and tendencies to <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> which appeared in the latter end of the fourth <hi>Century.</hi>

prayers, and in the mean time to take them off from their serious and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn addresses to <hi>God.</hi> Not to insist, I say, on these things, because I design no set discourse on this subject, which hath been so amply handled by so many already; I shall only discover the sense of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> in this particular by two things, the one of which takes in the first three Centuries, and the other extends a great deal farther: From which I doubt not, but to make it evident how farr the <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> was from being received then. The first is, from the Answers given to the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> when it was objected against the <hi>Christians</hi> that they did worship dead men and Angels.

From whence <hi>Origen</hi> afterwards supposing the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Starrs</hi> to be <hi>Intellectual Beings,</hi> gives this account, <hi>Why, notwithstanding that, they made no prayers to them.

For they have a sympathy with them, that are thought worthy to find favour with God. Neither are they only favourable
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:101069:307"/>
unto such as be worthy; but they co-operate with them also that are willing to serve God over all, and are friendly to them, and pray with them, and intreat with them.

Now of these three he saith, the <hi>second</hi> is most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>essential,</hi> because the first may be without <hi>Adoration,</hi> and the last with <hi>Irrision</hi> of that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to worship. Further he observes that there are so many sorts of <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> or <hi>Worship,</hi> as there are degrees of <hi>excellency,</hi> of which he reckons three kinds, <hi>Divine, Humane,</hi> and <hi>between both,</hi> as the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Saints:</hi> and that these several sorts of Worship, according to these several excellencies, are not <hi>univocal,</hi> but <hi>analogical:</hi> and that they may be very well distinguished by the <hi>Internal Acts,</hi> for the inclination of the will is greater or less, according to the degree of <hi>excellency</hi> apprehended in the object. But as to the <hi>External Acts,</hi> it is not easie to distinguish them; for, almost all <hi>External Acts, (sacrifice</hi> only, and the things referring to it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:101069:307" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are common to all kinds of <hi>Adoration.</hi> This is the substance of what he hath, for explaining the nature of <hi>Divine Worship</hi>: And by which I cannot possibly see, but that kind of <hi>Worship</hi> which was given by the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> to their <hi>Daemons,</hi> was defensible upon the same grounds that the <hi>Invocations</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> is now. For as these apprehend a greater excellency in <hi>God,</hi> than in the <hi>Saints</hi>; so did they in the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> than in those <hi>Inferiour Deities</hi>; which they did not acknowledge to have an <hi>Infinite Nature</hi> in themselves, but only that they had the <hi>honour</hi> of being solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>worshipped</hi> bestowed upon them. But this will be much clearer in the case of the <hi>Heroes,</hi> or the <hi>Apotheosis</hi> of the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> as <hi>Augustus</hi> for instance. The <hi>Roman Senate</hi> decrees, that <hi>Divine Honours</hi> shall be given to <hi>Augustus:</hi> we cannot think, that by virtue of this decree he assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or became absolutely <hi>God,</hi> so that the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> was of the same nature, which it would have been, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing some <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> should believe <hi>Augustus</hi> to have been a <hi>Saint:</hi> on which supposition, we will suppose a <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>him</hi> to be at their <hi>prayers</hi> together to him. I pray now tell me, Wherein lyes the difference, that one is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the other is not: for neither of them suppose him to be the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> both look on him as having a <hi>middle kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency between God and man,</hi> the <hi>external actions</hi> are the same in both, and their apprehensions of excellency being equal, the <hi>inclinations</hi> of their <hi>Wills</hi> to testifie their devotion must be equal too. If you answer me, that one looks on him as a <hi>Saint,</hi> and the other doth not; I may soon tell you, that is nothing to the purpose; for, the Question is not, Whether he was a <hi>Saint</hi> or no, but, Whether the <hi>apprehension</hi> of a <hi>middle excellency</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> with a correspondent inclination of the <hi>Will,</hi> testified by external <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Adoration</hi> be <hi>Idolatry</hi> or no? If it be <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> in the one, it must be in the other; for the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> is the same in both, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>apprehension</hi> of an <hi>excellency</hi> between <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi>: for we are not enquiring, Whether the apprehension be true or false, but, What the nature of that <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is, which is cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if this be granted; for my part, I cannot tell how you can excuse the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> that would rather suffer <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> than worship the <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi>; for, although they all thought it <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet upon these principles it could not be so; but the worst that could be made of it, was this, That the <hi>Senate</hi> took that upon it, which it had nothing to do with, because it belonged to the <hi>Pope</hi> to <hi>Canonize</hi> men, and not to the <hi>Roman Senate.</hi> For, let me put it seriously to you, Whether you do not attribute the very same kind of <hi>authority</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi> now, which the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> challenged in the <gap reason="foreign">

these <hi>Honours</hi> were wholly terminated upon them, but they thought the giving of this relative <hi>Honour</hi> to them, did redound to the greater <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Deity?</hi> So that we see, a new object of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> is solemnly appointed, upon the <hi>Popes Canonizing a Saint</hi>; and no pretence can be made to excuse this from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which would not have excused all those <hi>Heathens</hi> from it, who believed there was one <hi>Supreme Deity,</hi> and yet allowed <hi>Divine Honours</hi> to be given to such <hi>Spirits</hi> which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him, or attended on him. So that if the notion of <hi>Idolatry</hi> must only lye in such an act of the <hi>Will,</hi> which results from an apprehension of <hi>infinite excellency,</hi> which is only in the <hi>Supreme Being</hi>; very few, if any, of the more <hi>intelligent Heathens</hi> were ever guilty of it. But if the formal reason of their <hi>Idolatry</hi> lay in offering up those <hi>devotions to that which was not God,</hi> which only belong to an <hi>Infinite Being</hi>; I see not, but the same charge will hold on the same grounds, against those who <hi>Invocate Saints</hi> with those <hi>external acts of devotion,</hi> which are confessed to be the same with those wherewith we call on <hi>God.</hi> But nothing can be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, than that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> should except <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and things belonging thereto, from being common to the first and second sort of <hi>Adoration,</hi> and not except <hi>Invocation.</hi> For, Is it possible to conceive any act which doth more express our sense of an <hi>Infinite Excellency,</hi> and the profession of our <hi>subjection</hi> to it, than <hi>Invocation</hi> doth? which doth it far more than <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> doth; for that being a meer external act, is consistent with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test mockery of <hi>God</hi>; but <hi>solemn Invocation</hi> implies in its own nature our dependence upon <hi>God,</hi> and an acknowledgement of his <hi>Infinite Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> For <hi>Invocation</hi> lyes chiefly in the internal <hi>acts,</hi> and denotes primarily the inward desire of obtaining something from a <hi>Being</hi> above our own: So that, though I should grant the meer <hi>external acts</hi> of <hi>bowing</hi> and <hi>kneeling</hi> to be common to <hi>Adoration</hi> given to <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>finite perfections</hi>; yet I utterly deny that these <hi>acts</hi> are common to both, when the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances do determine the <hi>end</hi> and design of them. As no man by the meer bowing of <hi>Abraham</hi> to the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Heth</hi> could tell, whether it were ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or divine <hi>Adoration</hi> which he meant; but none who understood all the circumstances of it, would have any reason to question it. But, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it had been declared before, that these men expected a more than <hi>civil Adoration,</hi> and that all the rites of solemn <hi>Invocation</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> at any time used to <hi>God,</hi> must be used to them too; then the same exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>acts</hi> must have received a new denomination. So that though the meer <hi>external acts</hi> be common to <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious Worship,</hi> yet as those <hi>acts</hi> are considered with their several <hi>circumstances,</hi> they are appropriated to one or the other of them. Thus, though a man may use the same form of <hi>words</hi> to an <hi>Emperour</hi> on his Throne, and the same external <hi>posture,</hi> which he doth use after his death in a <hi>Temple</hi> consecrated to him; yet in the one they are meerly signs of <hi>Civil Worship,</hi> but in the other they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Testimonies of <hi>Religious Adoration.</hi> So, although in the <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> no other words were used, but such as denote them to be <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> still, yet if they be used with all the rites of solemn <hi>Invocation</hi>; in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appropriate to <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> and in <hi>Sacred Offices,</hi> they thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>Adoration</hi> intended to be greater than any meer creature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. For we must consider, that as <hi>God</hi> is owned to be <hi>Infinite</hi> in himself, and to have incommunicable perfections, so by reason of them there ought to be some appropriated acts or signs of Worship, to declare our subjection to him; which being determined for this end, either by the
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:101069:308" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>consent</hi> of people, the attributing of them to any else but him, is a publick <hi>violation</hi> of his <hi>honour.</hi> Although in so doing, men profess that they intend them only as expressions of a lower kind of <hi>Worship</hi> than is due to the <hi>Supreme Being.</hi> But in such cases the <hi>protestation</hi> avails not, where the fact is evident to the contrary. For when men in the most solemn manner, in publick places of <hi>devotion,</hi> and in <hi>sacred offices,</hi> do invocate <hi>Saints,</hi> and yet think they dishonour not God by it, because they say, they do not worship them as <hi>God</hi>; it is just as if a man should upon all occasions, in the Presence-Chamber, address himself to one of the <hi>King</hi>'s subjects as to the <hi>King</hi> himself; and being questioned for it, should only say, he did not dishonour the <hi>King</hi> by it, because he meant it not to him as a <hi>King,</hi> but as a <hi>Subject.</hi> But by so much is the <hi>dishonour</hi> greater because the <hi>Soveraignity</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> doth require that the rights of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> should not be given to any <hi>Subject</hi> whatsoever. So that it is but a vain pretence, when men use all the expressions whereby we declare our sense of the <hi>Infinite Perfections</hi> which are in <hi>God,</hi> to any <hi>Creatures,</hi> to say, <hi>They give them not that Worship which belongs to God,</hi> meerly because they do believe they are <hi>Creatures</hi> still. But, Is it possible for men to give the honour which is due to <hi>God,</hi> to the <hi>Creatures,</hi> or no, acknowledging them to be <hi>Creatures</hi> still? or, Is it not? If not, then none of the <hi>Heathens</hi> could be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in worshipping <hi>Daemons, Heroes,</hi> and <hi>Deified Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>; if it be possible, then the acknowledging the <hi>Saints</hi> not to be <hi>God,</hi> cannot excuse men from the same kind of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in the <hi>Invocation</hi> of them. And it is as frivolous a plea which is made for those forms of <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> which are made to the <hi>Saints</hi> in plain terms, not to intercede with God for them, but to bestow upon them both temporal and spiritual <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> (of which multitudes have been produced by our Writers) <hi>viz. That though the form of words be the same that is used to God, yet the sense is wholly that they would pray to God to bestow them.</hi> For, How should any other sense be understood, when these forms are allowed in <hi>Invocation?</hi> For, although the <hi>Scripture</hi> may sometimes attribute the effect to the subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Instrument,</hi> as when S. <hi>Paul</hi> is said <hi>to save some,</hi> yet certainly the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> is far from allowing such a liberty in solemn <hi>Invocation:</hi> For upon this ground it might have been lawful for men to have fallen down upon their knees to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and have intreated him to save them. Do you think, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have approved such phrases in <hi>Invocation</hi>? So that it is not the meer <hi>phrase,</hi> but as it is joyned with all <hi>rites</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> which makes it look so like the most gross <hi>Idolatry.</hi> When you pray to the <hi>Virgin Mary, to protect you from your enemies, and receive you in the hour of death</hi>; and to the <hi>Apostles, to heal your spiritual maladies,</hi> which forms are acknowledged by <hi>Bellarmin</hi>; Can any reasonable man think,<note place="margin">

meaning no other,</hi> (say you) <hi>but the Sacrifice of the Mass, which you hope the Reader will mark for</hi> S.

A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> indeed they had, and a <hi>Commemoration</hi> of <hi>Christs Sacrifice</hi> in the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> but no such thing as a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice for the living and the dead</hi>; and I pray mark this for your own sake. But for our better understanding S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s meaning, we must consider that he is there comparing the <hi>honours</hi> which the <hi>Heathens</hi> gave to their <hi>Heroes,</hi> with those which the <hi>Christians</hi> give to the <hi>Martyrs. They,</hi> saith he, <hi>to those Gods of theirs, build Temples, erect Altars, appoint Priests, and offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; but we do not build any Temples to the Martyrs as to gods, but raise Sepulchres as to dead men, whose spirits live with God; neither do we build Altars, at which we may sacrifice to the Martyrs, but we offer up a Sacrifice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the God of the Martyrs, and of us; at which Sacrifice,</hi> saith he, <hi>as holy men of God, who through their confession of him have overcome the world, they are named in their place and order, but are not invocated by the Priest, who offers up the Sacrifice.</hi> Two things may here be understood by the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> either the <hi>anniversary Sacrifice of praise to God,</hi> on the day of their <hi>Natalitia</hi> or <hi>Martyrdoms</hi>; or else the <hi>celebration</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> which was wont to be done at the <hi>memoriae Martyrum</hi> chiefly upon that <hi>anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary day.</hi> Now there are many reasons to incline me to think that S. <hi>Austin</hi> doth not speak of any ordinary celebration of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> but of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary <hi>solemnity,</hi> which was wont to be kept at the <hi>tombs</hi> of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> on the day of their <hi>sufferings.</hi> Chiefly because S. <hi>Austin</hi> is here paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leling the <hi>honours</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> with those of the <hi>Heathen Heroes</hi>; and therefore it was reason he should speak of the greatest <hi>solemnities</hi> which were used for them.

these solemn Eucharistical <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Martyrs sufferings,</hi> which were called their <hi>Natalitia.</hi> Now to apply this to S. <hi>Austin</hi>: among the <hi>honours</hi> belonging to the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> he mentions the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which was offered to <hi>God</hi> in Commemoration of them, and, What can this be other than on that <hi>anniversary solemnity</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> mention, that was duly kept on that account. Now at this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> saith he, <hi>they are named in their order, but not invocated.</hi> Which being understood of the anniversary day, and of the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>praises,</hi> nothing can be more express against <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> than this place is. For, if ever they were solemnly <hi>invocated,</hi> it certainly would be on the day of the great solemnity for them; and if then all <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>praises</hi> were looked on as due only to <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Sacrifices</hi> belonging to him, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a robbing <hi>God</hi> of his <hi>honour,</hi> to offer up either <hi>prayers</hi> or <hi>prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> to any but himself. But, because it was the custom at those solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to have the <hi>Eucharist</hi> administred, and that S. <hi>Austin</hi> afterwards mentions this, I shall not exclude the <hi>Eucharist</hi> here, yet that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> may still comprehend all the <hi>supplications</hi> which were then used; and if the <hi>Saints</hi> were not <hi>invocated</hi> then, we have reason to conclude they were not at all. For the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> was made after the <hi>Ite, missa est,</hi> and the <hi>Catechumens</hi> were departed; so that there was no such occasion for their <hi>Invocation</hi> at any other time, as then. So that if there were no <hi>Invocation</hi> of them at the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> much less was there out of it; since all the <hi>solemnities</hi> concerning the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were used in the time of <hi>Celebration.</hi> Thus we see, this place of S. <hi>Austin</hi> is full and clear against <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and we must now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into what he saith elsewhere. Only we take notice here, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> not only appropriates <hi>Sacrifices</hi> as a thing peculiar to <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Altars</hi> too. And that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which was then appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>God,</hi> was not a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> but <hi>Eucharistical</hi> and <hi>supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>; and by consequence, if Sacrifice only belongs to God, then all <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> and <hi>Invocation</hi> doth too.

                  <hi>that God alone must be served by the soul, because he alone is the Creatour of it: and that every glorified rational creature, is only to be loved and imitated; that we ought not to apply our Religion to yield service to the dead; that they must be honoured for imitation, not worshipped for Religion. That Religion is nothing else but the Worship of God, and therefore we ought not to consecrate our selves to any thing else, by any Religious rites. That those who have gone to Angels, instead of God, have fallen into many illusions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful fancies.</hi> Now is it conceivable, that a person constant to himself, should so often, and on such good grounds assert, that all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> belong only to <hi>God,</hi> and yet withall ascribe religious <hi>Invocation</hi> as due either to <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi>?

assert different degrees of <hi>religious worship,</hi> but to make different kinds of <hi>worship</hi> of those two; the one being properly <hi>religious</hi> worship, the other only <hi>cultus dilectionis &amp; societatis,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>a worship only of love and respect.</hi> So that we quarrel not with the distinction it self, but with your misapplying it. <hi>For St.</hi> Austin <hi>plainly makes the honour given to Saints departed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Colimus ergo Martyres eo cultu dilectionis &amp; societatis, quo &amp; in h√¢c vit√¢ coluntur San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti homines Dei.</hi> Cont. Faustum. l. 20 c. 21.</note>

And this we have gained already, that they cannot be understood of any <hi>religious worship,</hi> without an apparent contradiction. Your first Citation is, <hi>That the commemoration of Martyrs at the Holy Table,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tract.</hi> 84. <hi>in Johan. De verbis Ap. serm.</hi> 17. (<hi>not</hi>) 34.</note> 
                  <hi>is not that we should pray for them, but rather that they should pray for us.</hi> To the same purpose the second is, <hi>That it is an injury to pray for a Martyr, to whose prayers we our selves ought to be recommended.</hi> The only things which can be drawn from hence are, that the <hi>Martyrs</hi> do pray for the <hi>Church</hi> on earth, and that we ought to recommend our selves to their prayers: But what is this to an Invocation of them, when it doth not so much as imply a direct desire of them to pray for us? When this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending our selves to the prayers of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> is probably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of nothing else, but a desire that <hi>God</hi> would hear the <hi>prayers</hi> which the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> do make on our behalf, without any address to the <hi>Martyrs</hi> themselves, that they would pray for us. Which seems very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, without good assurance that they did hear or understand those requests of that nature which are made to them. It is not therefore the saying that <hi>the Saints do pray for us,</hi> which makes it either <hi>lawful or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi> for us to pray to them. For since they ascribe that <hi>honour</hi> as alone due to <hi>God,</hi> so ought we to do too; and I can hardly see how the very praying to <hi>Saints</hi> to pray for us, being performed with all the rites of <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>Religious Invocation,</hi> can be excused from attributing that <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to the <hi>creature</hi> which is due only to the <hi>Creatour.</hi> And therefore I cannot but wonder at those who would make this only of the same nature, with our desiring <hi>Fellow-Christians</hi> to pray for us. For is there no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a mans intreating a <hi>Courtier</hi> to present his Petition to the <hi>King,</hi> and his falling down on his <hi>Knees</hi> to him with all the ceremony due to the <hi>King</hi> himself; and then put it off, with saying, that in all that, he only desired him to sue to his <hi>Majesty</hi> in his behalf? Although therefore we condemn not the solemn praying to <hi>God,</hi> not only to hear the prayers of the <hi>Church Militant,</hi> but of that part of it which is <hi>triumphant</hi> in behalf of the other in <hi>General</hi>; yet this falls far short of solemn <hi>addresses</hi> in places of <hi>Divine worship,</hi> and in <hi>Sacred offices</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> that they would pray for us. This is it, which as to that you call <hi>virtual Invocation,</hi> you should have proved out of St. <hi>Austin</hi>; and yet even that falls much short of that <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>formal Invocation</hi> which is both used and allowed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But you offer at a further proof of a direct <hi>Ora pro nobis</hi> in St. <hi>Austin. For</hi> (say you) <hi>St.</hi> Austin <hi>doth profess it to be the General custom of Christians in their recommending themselves to the Saints, to say,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> Memor esto nostr√Æ; <hi>which surely no man will contend to signifie less than</hi> ora pro nobis. I grant, it signifies as much where St. <hi>Austin</hi> uses it; but if you had consulted the place you might easily have seen how wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:101069:311"/>
it is to your purpose. For St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks not at all there of <hi>Saints</hi> departed, but of them <hi>living</hi>; and that it was a common thing among <hi>Christians</hi> to say to any one of them <hi>Memor esto me√Æ,</hi> Remember me in your prayers; which appears by the whole scope of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> where he speaks of giving <hi>alms,</hi> and the effect of them on those who received them in making them mindful of them. It cannot be denyed, but some of them did use such expressions to those who were near their <hi>Martyrdom</hi>; but still this only shews the requesting it of them, when they were sure they heard them; but it proves not any solemn <hi>Invocations</hi> of them when they were dead. But if we should grant, that there are expressions intimating a <hi>desire</hi> that <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven should pray for them, which is the utmost you can make of the citation out of the <hi>Sermon</hi> on St. <hi>Stephen</hi> (which with the rest <hi>de Sanctis</hi> is vehemently suspected, and the other on <hi>Job</hi> is counterfeit) yet there is a great deal of difference to be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween such a calling upon <hi>Martyrs</hi> (of whom only St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks) out of a desire of their prayers; and a solemn and direct praying to them in the most <hi>Sacred offices</hi> and <hi>publick devotions:</hi> which is used and approved in your <hi>Church.</hi> For whatever there might be of <hi>private devotion</hi> (not to call it <hi>superstition</hi>) this way in St. <hi>Austins</hi> time, in desiring the <hi>prayers</hi> of <hi>departed Saints</hi> whom they could have no ground at all to believe they heard them; yet you can bring no evidence of any <hi>use</hi> of this in the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offices</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> much less of that direct <hi>Invocation,</hi> which we most of all charge your <hi>Church</hi> with. That then which began in meer <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical addresses,</hi> went somewhat further, when they began to grow more confident that in some extraordinary way or other the <hi>Saints heard</hi> them; but still this kept it self within the bounds of the <hi>cultus dilectionis &amp; societatis,</hi> that <hi>respect</hi> which arose from <hi>Love and Communion</hi>; but it was a good while after before it obtained a place in the <hi>publick Offices,</hi> and yet longer, before it came to that height of <hi>Religious Invocation,</hi> which is more practised then pleaded for in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For although great endeavours be used to smooth over these gross abuses with fair distinctions, of <hi>relative and absolute, direct and indirect worship</hi>; yet the general practise is uncapable of being <hi>palliated</hi> by these narrow coverings, there being the most <hi>formal</hi> and <hi>direct Invocations</hi> used to <hi>Saints</hi> for spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and temporal blessings. Which being allowed of in common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise and the most <hi>sacred Offices,</hi> can never be excused from as great <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> as the Heathens were guilty of, in the worship of their <hi>Inferiour Deities.</hi> I conclude this therefore with that of <hi>Spalatensis,</hi>

This</hi> (you say) <hi>cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Gods Covenant and promise made to</hi> David (<hi>as Protestants vainly pretend) but of</hi> Davids <hi>piety and vertue by which he was acceptable to God.

The like was done by</hi> Daniel, Moses, Hieremias <hi>and other Prophets praying unto God, and desiring their petitions might be heard for</hi> Abraham, <hi>for</hi> Isaac, <hi>for</hi> Israels <hi>sake, and for the sakes of other Holy men, who had lived before, and been in their times persons acceptable to God.</hi> And for this you quote St. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> So far you have very fairly rendred <hi>Bellarmin</hi> exactly in <hi>English.</hi> But we are yet to seek,<note place="margin">

If not, then they cease to be merits, and the giving the reward, (though an act of <hi>Justice,</hi> the Promise supposed) yet in it self is wholly an act of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi>; if they have, then the full recompence is received by that <hi>reward,</hi> and nothing further can be obtained for others on their account. But in the sense it is to be suspected you take <hi>merits</hi> in, we as well assert, that the proportioning the <hi>reward</hi> in Heaven to the <hi>merits</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> is injurious to the <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>Christs merits,</hi> as their obtaining mercies for others by reason of them. Only this latter adds to the dishonour, in that there is not only supposed a <hi>proportion</hi> between Heaven and them; but, as though that were not enough, a further <hi>efficacy</hi> is attributed to them, for obtaining <hi>mercies</hi> for others too. His Lordship therefore does not <hi>go about to pervert the sense of the prayers used in your Missal</hi>; but the plain words and sense of them evidently shew, how contrary they are to Christian Doctrine and Piety. <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s saying, that the <hi>Saints</hi> may in some sense be called our <hi>Redeemers,</hi> cannot be vindicated by that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> That <hi>he became all things to all men, that he might save some</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.23.</note> because <hi>salvation</hi> respects the <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>Christs death,</hi> the promotion of which may in some sense be attributed to the <hi>Instruments</hi> of it, such as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was here on Earth; but <hi>Redemption</hi> respects the <hi>merits</hi> by which that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was obtained, and so belongs wholly to <hi>Christ,</hi> and cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to any <hi>Saints,</hi> either in Earth or Heaven. When you can prove that any subordinate <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Gods Power</hi> are called <hi>Numina,</hi> you may then excuse <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for calling the <hi>Saints</hi> so; but that is so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous a sense of the word, that it needs no confutation.</p>
               <p>We are now come to the <hi>last Errour,</hi> which his Lordship here charges your pretended <hi>General Councils</hi> with, which is,<note place="margin">¬ß. 26.</note> concerning <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>Images. Of which,</hi> his Lordship sayes, <hi>That the Ancient Church knew it not. And the Modern Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is too like to Paganism, in the practice of it;</hi>

it. And this, without any care had of millions of souls, unable to understand her subtilties, or shun her practice.</hi> Here you say, <hi>The Bishop is very bitter</hi>; but no more than the nature of the thing required. All the Answer you return to this, lyes in these things. 1. <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>teaches no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the Worship of Images,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 294.</note> 
                  <hi>but what the second Council of</hi> Nice <hi>did nine hundred years ago; which is, that they must be had in Veneration, and due Reverence, but not have Divine Worship given to them.</hi> 2. <hi>That Images were in common Vse and Veneration too, amongst Christians in the Ancient Church.</hi> 3. <hi>That what abuses are crept in, are not to be imputed to the Church, but to particular persons.</hi> This is the substance of what you say to the end of the <hi>Chapter</hi>; as to which a brief Answer will suffice, because I design not a full handling the Question of the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi> If that which you say in the <hi>first place,</hi> be true, it doth the more prove that which his Lordship intends, <hi>viz.</hi> that not <hi>one</hi> barely, but <hi>two</hi> of those you own to be <hi>General Councils,</hi> have erred in this particular. If either those <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> or you, had intended to have dealt fairly and honestly with the world, they and you should have declared, what that <hi>Veneration</hi> and<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> is, which is <hi>due</hi> to Images; What difference you put between that, and the <hi>Worship</hi> due to <hi>God</hi>; and, Whether the same pretences and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses would not as well have justified the <hi>Pagan Idolatries</hi>? For this was it which his Lordship charged you with, that you came too near <hi>Paganism</hi> in your practice. But as to this you answer nothing, but that if you do, so did the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> too: But, Is that a sufficient excuse for you? It is well enough known, What kind of <hi>Council</hi> that was; How much it was opposed by the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Frankford</hi>; How many persons both in the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches,</hi> declared themselves against the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of it? But, What a pitiful plea is it for you to say, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>had silenced all calumnies, by saying, That you attribute no Divinity to the Images, but only worship them with such honour and reverence as is due to them?</hi> Would not any considerate <hi>Heathens</hi> have said as much as this is? But, the Question is, Whether that <hi>Veneration</hi> of them which is used by you to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Images, be <hi>due</hi> to them, or no? This you should have undertaken, and set the distinct <hi>limits</hi> between the <hi>worship</hi> due to <hi>God,</hi> and that which is given to these. You should have proved, that this is no prohibited way of <hi>worship</hi>; for, if it be, it can in no sense be <hi>due</hi> to them. For, since <hi>God</hi> may determine the <hi>modes</hi> of his own <hi>worship,</hi> what he hath <hi>forbidden</hi> in his service, becomes <hi>unlawful</hi>; and, so long as that command continues in force, all acts of <hi>worship</hi> contrary to it, are a <hi>positive</hi> kind of Idolatry. For, as there is a kind of <hi>Natural Idolatry</hi> lying in the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>false Gods</hi> instead of the <hi>true</hi>; so there is that which may be called <hi>Positive Idolatry,</hi> which is a worshipping <hi>God</hi> in a way or manner which he hath <hi>forbidden.</hi> From whence the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> in the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> are charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> although they acknowledged the true <hi>God,</hi> and designed that for a <hi>Relative worship</hi> to him. If it were so then, you should have shewed us, How it comes to be otherwise now? Where it was, <hi>God</hi> repealed the second <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>? or, What there was in it typical and ceremonial, that it must cease to oblige at <hi>Christ's coming?</hi> or, What <hi>Reasons</hi> it was built on, which were only proper to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and cannot extend to the <hi>Christians</hi> too? and, Why <hi>Relative Worship,</hi> and the helps for <hi>memory</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> would not as well have justified the use and worship of <hi>Images,</hi> before <hi>Christ</hi> as after? And why the same reasons from the danger of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:101069:313"/>
of <hi>God</hi> (and what other reasons you will give of that prohibition then) may not hold as well still? These, and many other things, if you would have vindicated the practice of your <hi>Church</hi> you ought to have insisted on. But since you omit them wholly, and think to put us off with repeating the decree of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> you only shew the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your cause, and of those unintelligible subtilties which are used to defend it.</p>
               <p>To what his Lordship saith, <hi>That, in</hi> Optatus <hi>his time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>the Christians were much troubled upon but a false report,</hi>

                  <hi>that an Image was to be placed upon the Altar; What would they have done, if Adoration had been commanded?</hi> You answer, <hi>That it was either some Idol, or common Image of a Man, or of the Emperour, or the Governour of the Province,</hi> or something or other, but you cannot tell what. But if it had been any of all these, How easie had it been for them to have vindicated themselves by saying, That if it had been the <hi>Image of Christ,</hi> or some <hi>Saints,</hi> they would then have worshipped it, but they could not otherwise. But we see, it was not because it was such or such an <hi>Image,</hi> that the displeasure was taken, but that it was <hi>any</hi> at all; and this was then justly looked on as a strange thing, being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> from <hi>Christ's</hi> time till that. This you deny, and say, <hi>That the Images of Christ and the Saints were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use and veneration too, amongst Christians in the Ancient Church.</hi> How is it possible to deal with you, that dare with so much confidence obtrude such notorious falsities upon the world? There being scarce any thing imaginable, in which there are more express testimonies for so many ages together then against the use or veneration of <hi>Images</hi> in the <hi>Ancient Church.</hi> With what scorn and contempt do the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the use of <hi>Images,</hi> and that not in regard of an <hi>absolute,</hi> but a <hi>relative Worship?</hi> If you had read the discourses of the <hi>Christians</hi> in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, such as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus, Tertullian, Minutius Felix, Arnobius, Lactantius, Athanasius, Eusebius,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin</hi> where they dispute against the <hi>Heathens,</hi> not meerly for worshipping <hi>Idols,</hi> but for any worship of <hi>Images,</hi> though meerly as they are <hi>signs</hi> or <hi>symbols</hi> of the proper <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> you could not possibly have uttered so gross a falshood as that foregoing, unless you were resolved to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to your conscience in it. If you think the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> brings off all this by saying, <hi>Men must not believe there is any Divinity in Images,</hi> and that it was the worship which arose from such an apprehension which the Fathers disputed against; I assure you, you are greatly deceived. For there is no such difference between the <hi>Heathens</hi> apprehensions, and yours, as to the worship of <hi>Images,</hi> as you imagine. <hi>Who is such a fool,</hi> saith <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, to think that these are gods, and not the bare Images of them.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 28.</note> And I would not charge you with more faults than you are guilty of, since you have enough without it. An evidence of which, is your discarding all persons from your communion, who are not such <hi>Bigots,</hi> as to approve all the abuses and corruptions among you: Which sufficiently appears by your censure of <hi>Cassander;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 298.</note> 
                  <hi>Who</hi> (you say) <hi>seemed to many to halt between God and</hi> Baal; <hi>and, although he was not actually excommunicate, yet you would have us believe he was meritoriously so, because he favoured Heresie so much.</hi> By which we see, that we must not judge all of the <hi>Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> who profess themselves to be of it; for so <hi>Cassander</hi> did to his death. But, whoever offer to find the least fault with the practices or Doctrine of your <hi>Church,</hi> let them pretend never so much to be of it, yet they may <hi>be excommunicate, sententi√¢ juris</hi>; and so not only <hi>Cassander,</hi> but <hi>Erasmus, Fspencaeus, Ferus, Barns, Picherellus,</hi> and all other persons of reason and ingenuity among you, ought not to be looked on as <hi>persons</hi> of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, whatever their pretences be. It seems your <hi>Church</hi> bears none but <hi>Hectors,</hi> and in a short time none shall be accounted <hi>Papists,</hi> but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>: but it is hard to determine, Whether this discovers more the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> or <hi>tyranny</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi>; which loves her degeneracy so much, that she <hi>proscribes</hi> all who dare in the least to tell her of her <hi>faults.</hi> But, <hi>How can she be found fault with, that takes such excellent care to prevent all abuses, as appears by the caution of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>in the present case of your worship of Images?</hi> For, say you, <hi>As to any matter of abuse in this kind, crept in amongst the ignorant, we have already shewn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 297.</note> 
                  <hi>how careful the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>was to prevent and provide against all inconveniencies that could reasonably be foreseen or feared.</hi> So it seems, by the admirable Caution used by the <hi>Council,</hi> to prevent giving <hi>undue Worship</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi> by telling men, <hi>They must only give that which was due</hi>; when all the Question was, What
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:101069:315"/>
was <hi>due</hi>? and, What not? So it seems, by the care used to instruct the people concerning the nature of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> and the danger of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> So it seems, by the leaving out the <hi>second Commandment</hi> in the <hi>offices</hi> of frequent <hi>use,</hi> lest the peoples consciences should check them, for doing that which <hi>God</hi> had severely prohibited. So it seems, by the <hi>unintelligible subtilties</hi> concerning the kind of that <hi>Worship</hi> which is to be given to the <hi>Image</hi>; when yet a mistake there, makes the person who gives it, guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> So it seems, by the continuance of the most gross <hi>abuses</hi> in this nature still in your <hi>Church,</hi> in this matter of <hi>Images.</hi> Of which such things are related by eye-witnesses, that the most gross <hi>Heathen Idolatries</hi> were not more unreasonable, absurd, and ridiculous, than they are. And if people continue ignorant, and sottish enough, all is well; but if with <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander,</hi> they charge you with any <hi>corruptions,</hi> then they stand <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously excommunicate:</hi> and it is well if they escape so; for, although <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander</hi> did, <hi>Father Barns</hi> did not. But, plead as long as you will for the care your <hi>Church</hi> hath taken to prevent all abuses in the worship of <hi>Images</hi>; as long as the worship of <hi>Images</hi> continues, it is impossible to prevent the <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in it; since that is a great <hi>abuse</hi> it self, and gives occasion to all others. For, the vindication of your Doctrine depends on such <hi>Met√†physical Niceties,</hi> which the minds of people are uncapable of; and, however they may serve you in disputation, are impossible to be reconciled with the <hi>practice</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> and the apprehensions of those who yield the worship you allow to <hi>Images.</hi> And therefore it is no wonder at all what <hi>Llamas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the <hi>Spanish people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 298.</note> 
                  <hi>that they were so besotted on their old worm-eaten Images, that when they were to have new ones in their rooms, they begg'd with tears to have their old ones still.</hi> But, although <hi>you grant these people guilty of indiscretion, yet by no means of Idolatry, because they did not call them their gods.</hi> If you think none were <hi>Idolaters,</hi> but such as did believe their <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> to be <hi>gods</hi>; I doubt you may find the number of <hi>Atheists</hi> as great as that of <hi>Idolaters</hi> in the world. But if we may guess at peoples <hi>apprehensions</hi> by their <hi>actions,</hi> these seemed as much to believe them to be <hi>gods,</hi> as any <hi>Heathens</hi> you can instance in. Your vindication of <hi>Llamas</hi> from saying, <hi>That the Images of Christ, and the Saints, as they represent their exemplars, have Deity or Divinity in them</hi>; as it is undertaken somewhat fearfully, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> (you say) <hi>you hope to clear his meaning, whatever his words seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 299.</note> so at last it stands on the sandy foundation of <hi>relative and absolute Worship,</hi> which being taken away, that and your <hi>Images</hi> fall together.

                  <note place="margin">P. 279.</note> 
                  <hi>and rent the Peace of the Church of Christ, by such dangerous, such superstitious vanities. For better they are not, but they may be worse:</hi> And I fear are so.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the possibility of Salvation in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Protestants Concessions ought not to be any ground to preferr the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> How far those Concessions extend. The unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of Romanists, if they yield not the same to us. The weakness of the Arguments to prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Church the safer way to salvation on Protestant Principles. The dangerous Doctrines of Romanists about the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of salvation, by the Sacrament of Pennance. The case parall'eld be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>between the Donatists and Romanists, in denying salvation to all but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and the advantages equal from their adversaries Concessions. The advantage of the Protestants, if that be the safest way which both parties are agreed in, manifested and vindicated in several particulars. The Principle it self at large shewed to be a meer contingent Proposition, and such as may lead to Heresie and Infidelity. The case of the Leaders in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and others, distinguished. The Errours and Superstitions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, make its communion very dangerous in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe main thing which now remains to be discussed, is, Whether the Communion of your <hi>Church,</hi> or ours, be rather to be chosen,<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> in order to <hi>salvation.</hi> For <hi>that</hi> being the great end of our <hi>Faith,</hi> the tendency to the promotion of that, ought to be the Rule, by which we should embrace or continue in the society of any <hi>Church.</hi> And, since the regard men ought to have of their eternal welfare, doth oblige them to make choice of the best means in order to it, the bare remote <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> in any <hi>Church,</hi> ought to have no force or consideration at all in the determining their choice in a matter of so great importance. As, supposing a <hi>Pilot</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> whose only desire is to bring his ship safe into his desired <hi>Port,</hi> should be told, that there are two passages homewards; the one free and open, in which there is no danger; the other amidst many <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Shelves</hi> in which yet there is a <hi>possibility</hi> of escaping: Would not he be accounted a very weak man, that should chuse this latter way, meerly because it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible he may escape; and neglect the other, in which there is no danger of miscarrying? So it is here in our present case, the <hi>Protestants</hi> confess there is a <hi>possibility</hi> for some to escape in the Communion of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; but it is as men may escape with their lives in a <hi>shipwrack</hi>; but they undertake to make it evident, there can be no danger, if they observe the principles of <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>; VVould it not be madness in any then to neglect this, and make choice of the other, meerly because <hi>Protestants</hi> agree with you, that there is a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> for some in the <hi>Roman Church</hi>? Yet this is the great Argument you make use of, whereby to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte</hi> such persons, who want judgement enough to discern the weakness and <hi>sophistry</hi> of it. That therefore we are now to enquire into, is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Communion, or ours, be more eligible upon principles of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and prudence, in order to <hi>Salvation?</hi> And two things are insisted on in behalf of your <hi>Church</hi>; first, <hi>That Protestants grant the possibility of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in your Church,</hi> but you deny it in ours, and therefore yours is the safer way. Secondly, <hi>That the Faith of Protestants doth not stand upon those sure grounds which your Faith doth.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note>As to the <hi>first,</hi> there are two things to be considered. 1. How <hi>far we grant a possibility of salvation to those in your Church.</hi> 2. <hi>What can be infer'd from that Concession in the choice of Religion.</hi> The occasion of entering upon this debate was the <hi>Lady's Query, Whether she might be saved in the Roman Faith</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 280.</note> to which his Lordship answers in <hi>General,</hi> that <hi>the ignorant that could not discern the errours of that Church, so they held the Foundation and conformed themselves to a religious life, might be saved; and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the Lady, that it must needs go harder with her even in point of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, because she had been brought to understand very much for one of her condition, in these Controverted causes of Religion. And a person that comes to know much had need carefully bethink himself, that he oppose not known truth against the Church that made him a Christian; for salvation may be in the Church of</hi> Rome,<note place="margin">P. 282.</note> 
                  <hi>and they not find it that make surest of it.</hi> And after, he explains himself more fully, <hi>That [might be saved]</hi> grants <hi>but a possibility, no sure or safe way to salvation; the possibility, I think saith he, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to the ignorants, especially because they hold the Foundation and cannot survey the Building. And the Foundation can deceive no man that rests upon it. But a secure way they cannot go, that hold with such corruptions when they know them. Now, whether it be wisdom, in such a point as salvation is, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake a Church in the which the ground of salvation is firm, to follow a Church in which it is but possible one may be saved, but very probable he may do worse, if he look not well to the Foundation; judge ye.</hi> So that still his Lordship asserts the <hi>Protestants</hi> way to be the only <hi>safe</hi> way to <hi>salvation</hi>; and that in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> there is only a <hi>limited possibility</hi> of it, which is such, that he say's, A. C. <hi>or his fellows can take little comfort in.</hi> For as he after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himself,<note place="margin">P. 285.</note> 
                  <hi>Many Protestants indeed confess, there is salvation possible to be attained in the Roman Church; but yet they say withall, that the errours of that Church are so many, (and some so great, as weaken the Foundation) that it is very hard to go that way to Heaven, especially to them that have had the truth manifested</hi>; and a little after, <hi>But we have not so learned Christ, as either to return evil for evil in this heady course, or to deny salvation to some ignorant silly souls, whose humble peaceable obedience makes them safe among any part of men that profess the Foundation Christ.</hi> And in another place, <hi>I do indeed for my part (leaving other men free to their own judgement) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a possibility of salvation in the Roman Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 299.</note> 
                  <hi>But so, as that which I grant to Romanists, is not as they are Romanists, but as they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that is, as they believe the Creed and hold the Foundation Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, not as they associate themselves wittingly and knowingly to the gross Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions of the Roman Church. And I am willing to hope there are many among them, which keep within that Church, and yet wish the superstitions abolished which they know, and which pray to God to forgive their errours in what they know not, and which hold the Foundation firm, and live according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and which would have all things amended that are amiss, were it in their power. And to such I dare not deny a possibility of salvation, for that which is Christs in them, though they hazzard themselves extreamly by keeping so close to that which is superstition, and in the case of Images comes too near Idolatry.</hi> The substance then of what his Lordship saith, is, that the <hi>Protestant</hi> way is a safe and secure way to <hi>salvation</hi>; that in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> there is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hazzard</hi> made of it, which all who love their <hi>souls</hi> ought to avoid; but yet for such, who by reason of <hi>ignorance</hi> see not the <hi>danger,</hi> and by reason of honesty keep close to <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and repent of all miscarriages known or unknown, he dares not deny a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="613" facs="tcp:101069:316" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for them. But he is far from asserting it of those, who either know the corruptions of that <hi>Church</hi> and yet continue in them, or such who wilfully neglect the means whereby they may be convinced of them. So that you strangely either mistake or pervert his Lordships meaning when you would inferr from these passages, <hi>That he asserts a possibility of being saved to those who joyn with the Roman Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 301.</note> 
                  <hi>though their ignorance be not invincible, and though all or the chief motives which the Protestants bring against you be never so sufficiently proposed to them.</hi> For he still speaks either of such, whose meer <hi>ignorance</hi> doth excuse them where the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> are held and a life lead according to them, or else of such who condemn your <hi>superstitions</hi> as far as they are discovered to them, and sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to find impartially the way that leads to Heaven; Of such as these he dares not deny a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you are the most uncharitable persons in the world, if you dare assert the contrary of <hi>Protestants.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> You expresly grant <hi>a possibility of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to those who joyn with the Protestant Church, in case of invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>; and dare you deny it where there is a preparation of mind to find out and embrace the most certain way to Heaven, where all endeavours are used to that end, and where there is a conscientious obedience to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> so far as it is discovered? If you dare peremptorily deny a <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> to such persons, meerly because not of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> this prodigious uncharitableness would make us question the <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi> of your <hi>salvation</hi> more, while you persist in it. For, What is there more contrary to the <hi>design</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> then this is? From whence must we gather the terms of <hi>salvation,</hi> but only from thence? But it seems by you, although men give never so hearty an assent to the Doctrine of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and live in the most universal obedience to it, and abound in the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> of which <hi>Charity</hi> is none of the least; yet if they be not in the Communion of your <hi>Church,</hi> there is no hopes of <hi>salvation</hi> for them. But, Who is it the mean while that hath the disposal of this <hi>salvation?</hi> Is it in your <hi>hands</hi> or <hi>Christs?</hi> If it be in His, we dare rely on His promise, although you pretend to know His mind better than He did himself. For, notwithstanding a sincere endeavour to know and obey the will of <hi>God,</hi> be the great <hi>Fundamental</hi> in order to <hi>salvation,</hi> which is delivered us by the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi>; yet it seems by you, there may be this, where there may be not so much as <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>salvation.</hi> By which assertion of yours, you are so far from working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any, but very weak persons, to bring them over to your <hi>Church,</hi> that nothing can more effectually prejudice it among all such who dare believe <hi>Christ</hi> to be more <hi>Infallible</hi> then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For what is this else, but to make heaven and eternal salvation <hi>stalk</hi> to the <hi>interess</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> and to lay more weight upon being in your communion then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most indispensable precepts of <hi>Christianity?</hi> But when we consider how many among you dispute for the possibility of the <hi>salvation</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and yet deny it to those who own all the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>; when we see how much you lay the weight of salvation upon being in your <hi>Church,</hi> and what wayes you have for those who are in it to reconcile the <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> with the practise of <hi>sin,</hi> What can we otherwise imagine, but it is the Interess of your <hi>Church</hi> that you more aim at than the <hi>salvation</hi> of <hi>mens-souls.</hi> For you have so many wayes to give <hi>indulgence</hi> in <hi>sin</hi> to those who desire it, and yet such ready wayes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and such an easie task of <hi>repentance,</hi> and so little troublesome means
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:101069:317"/>
of obtaining <hi>grace</hi> by the <hi>Sacraments, ex opere operato,</hi> that it is hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving what way a man should sooner take, who would live in his sins and come to heaven at last, then to be of your <hi>Church.</hi> And yet you who are so <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>gentle,</hi> so <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>indulgent</hi> to the <hi>sons</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> are not more ready to send those who are out of it to the <hi>fire</hi> in this world than to <hi>eternal flames</hi> in another. But <hi>we have not so learned Christ,</hi> we dare not deal so inhumanely with them in this world, much less judge so uncharitably as to another, of those who profess <hi>to fear God and work righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> though they be not of the same opinion or communion with us. Yet, we tell men of the danger of <hi>hazzarding</hi> their <hi>salvation</hi> by <hi>erroneous doctrines and superstitious practises,</hi> and suppose that sufficient to perswade such who sincerely regard their future <hi>happiness</hi> to avoid all such things as tend so much to their eternal <hi>ruine.</hi> And such who will continue in such things, meerly because there is a <hi>possibility</hi> some persons may be saved in them by reason of <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> are no wiser men then such, who should <hi>split</hi> their <hi>ship</hi> upon a <hi>rock,</hi> because some have escaped upon a <hi>plank</hi> notwithstanding. So that considering on what terms we grant this <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>salvation,</hi> this Concession of ours can be no Argument at all to judge yours to be the <hi>safer</hi> way; and if upon the same terms you deny it to us, it shews how much more <hi>unsafe</hi> your way is, where there is so much of <hi>Interess</hi> and so little <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you attempt to prove against all <hi>Protestants</hi> whatsoever, that yours is the safer way to <hi>salvation:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 301.</note> Your first Argument in short is, <hi>Because we grant that you may be saved upon our own principles, but you deny that we may be saved upon yours.</hi> And what is there more in this Argument (but a multitude of words to little purpose) then there is in that which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship examines? For the main force of it lyes in this, That is the safest way which both parties are agreed in; and therefore although you would have your <hi>Major proposition</hi> put out of all doubt, yet that wants more proof then I doubt you are able to give it. For although we grant, Men may be saved who have true <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and a holy <hi>Conversation without any such Sacrament of Pennance, which you make necessary for conveying the grace of Justification</hi>; yet, What security can thence come to a man in the choice of his <hi>Religion,</hi> since we withall say, That where there is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the corruptions and errours of your <hi>Church,</hi> it is hard to conceive there should be that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> which we make necessary to <hi>Salvation.</hi> You go therefore on a very false <hi>supposition,</hi> when you take it for granted <hi>that we acknowledge, that all those whom you admit to your Sacrament of Pennance have all things upon our own principles which are necessary to Salvation.</hi> And so your <hi>Minor</hi> is as false as your <hi>Major</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, viz. <hi>That many are saved in the Roman Church according to the principles which are granted on both sides.</hi> But you would seem to prove, <hi>That all admitted by you at death to the Sacrament of Pennance</hi> (as you call it) <hi>have all things necessary to Salvation upon Protestant principles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 302.</note> 
                  <hi>because,</hi> you say, <hi>That Faith, Hope, true Repentance, and a purpose of Amendment are necessary to the due receiving the Sacrament of Pennance, and these, are all which Protestants make necessary to Salvation.</hi> But supposing that, Is it necessary that all those things must be in them, which make the necessary requisites to this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of yours? Do none receive this <hi>unworthily</hi> as many do a far greater <hi>Sacrament</hi> than this, granting it to be any at all. It seems <hi>Salvation</hi> is very easie to be had in your <hi>Church</hi> then, for this <hi>Sacrament</hi> is supposed by you, to be given to men upon their <hi>death-beds,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:101069:317"/>
when,</hi> you say, <hi>It cannot be supposed that men will omit any thing necessary for the attaining Salvation; and by vertue of this Sacrament they receive the grace of Justification, whereby of sinners they are made the Sons of God and heires of eternal life.</hi> But I assure you, we who believe, Men must be saved only by the terms of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> make no such easie matter of it as you do; we profess the <hi>necessity</hi> of a <hi>through-renovation</hi> of <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable in order to <hi>happiness,</hi> for <hi>without holiness no man shall see the Lord:</hi> and although we take not upon us to judge the final estate of men whose <hi>hearts</hi> we know not; yet the <hi>Gospel</hi> gives us very little ground to think, that such who defer the work of their <hi>Salvation</hi> to their <hi>death-beds</hi> shall ever attain to it; The main design of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> being, The turning mens souls from <hi>sin</hi> to <hi>God</hi> in order to the serving him in this world, that they may be <hi>happy</hi> in another. For if <hi>Salvation</hi> depended on no more then you require, the greatest part of the <hi>Gospel</hi> might have been spared, whose great end is to perswade men to <hi>holiness of heart and life.</hi> It is not a meer <hi>purpose</hi> of <hi>amendment,</hi> when men can sin no longer, that we make only necessary to <hi>Salvation:</hi> But so hearty a <hi>repentance</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> past, as to carry with it an <hi>effectual</hi> reformation; without this, men may flatter themselves into their own <hi>ruine</hi> by your <hi>Sacraments of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> and such contrivances of men, but there can be no grounded hopes of any freedom from eternal misery. And their <hi>Faith</hi> too, must be as <hi>weak</hi> as their <hi>Repentance shallow,</hi> who dare <hi>venture</hi> their <hi>souls</hi> into another world, upon no better <hi>security</hi> than that <hi>By receiving the Sacrament of Pennance they are made the Sons of God and heirs of eternal life.</hi> But you betray men into stupid ignorance and carelesness as to their eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and then deal most unfaithfully with them, by telling them that a <hi>death-bed Repentance</hi> will suffice them, and the <hi>Sacrament of Pennance will presently make them heirs of eternal life.</hi> So that although your <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> be very unreasonable, and your <hi>Superstitions</hi> very <hi>gross,</hi> yet this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness to the souls of men makes all true lovers of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and of the <hi>Salvation</hi> of mens souls, more averse from your <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practises,</hi> then any thing else whatsoever. For what can really be more pernicious to the world, then to flatter them into the hopes of <hi>Salvation</hi> without the performance of those things, which, if the <hi>Gospel</hi> be true, are absolutely necessary in order to it? How quietly do you permit the most stupid <hi>ignorance</hi> in such who are the <hi>zealous practisers</hi> of your <hi>fopperies</hi> and <hi>superstitions?</hi> What excellent arts have you to allure <hi>debauches</hi> upon their <hi>death-beds</hi> to you, by promising them that in another world, which our principles will not allow us to do? How many wayes have you to get the <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> or at least to delude people with the hopes of it, without any serious turning from <hi>sin</hi> to <hi>God?</hi> What do your <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of <hi>bare contrition,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments working grace ex opere opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> of <hi>Indulgences, Satisfactions, regulating the intention,</hi> and the like, tend to, but to supersede the necessity of a holy life? And at last you exchange the inward hatred and mortification of sin, for some external <hi>severities</hi> upon mens <hi>bodies</hi>; which is, only beating the <hi>servant</hi> for the <hi>Masters fault.</hi> So that it is hard to imagine any Doctrine or way of <hi>Religion</hi> which owns <hi>Christianity,</hi> which doth with more apparent danger to the souls of men undermine the foundations of Faith and Obedience than yours doth. And as I have at large shewed the former, How destructive your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are to the <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; so it hath been fully and lately manifested by a learned <hi>Bishop</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> What Doctrines and practises are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

so many among your selves make unnecessary for the pardon of sin? But it is just with <hi>God,</hi> that those who are so ready to condemn others, should be condemned by themselves: and if your Consciences do not condemn you here, your Sentence may be the greater in another world.</p>
               <p>Your second Argument against <hi>Protestants</hi> is,<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Because they want certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith by denying the Infallibility of Church and Councils</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 304.</note> but this hath been so throughly sifted already, that I suppose none who have read the preceding discourses will have the least cause to stick at this: and therefore we proceed to the Vindication of your censures from being guilty of the <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Charity.</hi> For you are the men, who would have us <hi>thank God, when you condemn us to hell,</hi> that we escape so; and are <hi>angry</hi> with us, that we do not believe that you most <hi>entirely love us,</hi> when you <hi>judge us to eternal flames. For,</hi> you say, <hi>that your denyal of Salvation to us is grounded even upon Charity.</hi> If it be so,<note place="margin">P. 305.</note> you are the most <hi>charitable</hi> people in the world, for you deny <hi>Salvation</hi> to all but your <hi>selves</hi> and some <hi>Heathens. But,</hi> say you, <hi>If Salvation may be had in your Church as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants confess, and there be no true Church or Faith but one, it follows that out of your Church there is no Salvation to be had.</hi> To which his Lordship had fully answered, by saying, <hi>Tis true, there is but one true Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 284.</note> 
                  <hi>and but one true Church; but that one both Faith and Church is the Catholick Christian, not the particular Roman.</hi> So that this passage is a meer begging the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and then threatning upon it, without all reason or charity. And all your declamations about <hi>the way of knowing the Doctrine of the Catholick Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 306.</note> have been spoiled by what hath been said already upon that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. We come therefore to that which is the proper business of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> which is to examine the strength of that <hi>Inference</hi> which is drawn from the <hi>Protestants</hi> concession of the <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> viz. <hi>That thence it follows, that the Roman Church and Religion is the safer way to Salvation.</hi> Two things his Lordship observes the force of this Argument lyes in, <hi>the one directly expressed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 285.</note> viz. <hi>The consent of both parties of the possibility of Salvation in the Roman Church</hi>; the other <hi>upon the By,</hi> viz. <hi>That we cannot be saved because we are out of the Church.</hi> And of these two he speaks in order. First he begins with the <hi>confession:</hi> as to which his Answer lyes in three things, 1. <hi>That this was the way of the Donatists of old, and would hold as well for them as the Church of</hi> Rome. 2. <hi>That if the principle on which this Argument proceeds be true, it will be more for the advantage of Protestants then of your Church.</hi> 3. <hi>That the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple it self is a contingent Proposition, and may justifie the greatest Heresies in the world.</hi> By this methodizing his Lordships discourse, we shall the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter discern the strength of your Answers to the several particulars of it. In the first place he shews <hi>How parallel this is with the proceedings of the Donatists; for both parts granted that baptism was true among the Donatists,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 286.</note> 
                  <hi>but the Donatists denyed it to be true baptism among the Catholick Christians, and therefore on this principle the Donatists side is the surer side, if that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple be true, That it is the safest taking that way which the differing parties agree on.</hi> To this you Answer nothing, but what will still return upon your selves and discover the weakness of your Argument.<note place="margin">P. 307.</note> For the crimes of <hi>Schism, and unsoundness of Faith,</hi> are still as chargeable upon you though we may grant a possibility of Salvation to some in your <hi>Church.</hi> And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly discern any difference between the judgment of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> concerning the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and ours concerning you; for, if they judged the <hi>Donatists</hi> way very dangerous because of their <hi>uncharitableness</hi> to all others,
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:101069:319"/>
so do we of yours; but if they, notwithstanding that, hoped that the misled people among them might be saved; that is as much as we dare say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you. And you very much mistake, if you think the contrary, For his Lordship no where saith, as you would seem to impose upon him, <hi>That a man may live and dye in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and that none of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours shall hinder salvation, whatsoever motives he may know to the contrary.</hi> But on the other side,<note place="margin">P. 296.</note> he plainly saith, <hi>That he that lives in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, with a resolution to live and dye in it, is presumed to believe as that Church believes. And he that doth so, I will not say, is as guilty, but guilty he is more or less, of the Schism which that Church first caused by her corruptions, and now continues by them and her power together. And of all her damnable opinions too, and all other sins also, which the Doctrine and mis-belief of that Church leads him into.</hi> Judge you now, I pray, Whether we think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of those in your <hi>Church,</hi> than the <hi>Orthodox</hi> did of the <hi>Donatists?</hi> So that if the Argument doth hold for you, it would as well have held for them too. And therefore his Lordship well inferrs, <hi>That this Principle, That where two parties are dissenting, it is safest believing that in which both parties agree, or which the adversary confesses, may lead men, by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, into known and damnable Schism and Heresie; for such, you say, the Donatists were guilty of.</hi> And such his Lordship saith, <hi>there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 298.</note> 
                  <hi>in your Church too; for,</hi> saith he, <hi>in this present case there's peril, great peril of damnable, both Schism and Heresie, and other sins, by living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith, tainted with so many superstitions, as at this day it is, and their tyranny to boot.</hi> I pray now bethink your self, What difference is there, between the Orthodox judgement of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and ours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your <hi>Church?</hi> And therefore the comparison between <hi>Petilian</hi> the <hi>Donatist,</hi> and his Lordships <hi>adversary</hi> holds good still; for, all your Answer depends upon a mistake of <hi>Protestants</hi> granting a <hi>possibility of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 315.</note> as I have already shewed you. And, in what way soever you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this agreement, you cannot possibly avoid, but that it would equally hold as to the <hi>Donatists</hi> too; for the concession was then as great, in order to Salvation, as it is now.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note>But, you say, <hi>Whether he asserts it or no, it must needs follow from the Bishops Principles, that there can be no peril of damnation by living and dying in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, because he professedly exempts the Ignorant, and grants as much of those who do wittingly and knowingly associate themselves to the gross superstitions of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, if they hold the Foundation Christ, and live accordingly</hi>; From whence you argue, <hi>That if neither voluntary nor involuntary superstition can hinder from Salvation, then there is confessedly no peril of damnation in your Church.</hi> And yet his Lordship saith, <hi>All Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants unanimously agree in this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 302.</note> 
                  <hi>That there is great peril of damnation for any man to live and dye in the</hi> Roman <hi>Perswasion. And therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>that is a most notorious slander, where you say, that they which affirm this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of damnation, are contradicted by their own more learned Brethren.</hi> By which we see the unjustice of your proceeding, in offering to wrest his Lordships words contrary to his express meaning: and since all your Argument depends upon your adversaries confession, you ought to take that confession in the most clear and perspicuous terms, and to understand all obscure expressions suitably to their often declared sense. Which if you had attended to, you would never have undertaken to prove that this Lordship grants, that there is no peril of damnation in your Church, which he so often disavows, and calls it, <hi>a most notorious slander</hi>; and, <hi>a
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:101069:319"/>
most loud untruth, which no ingenuous man would ever have said.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 301.</note> And even of those persons whom he speaks most favourably of, he saith, <hi>That although they wish for the abolishing the superstitions in use, yet all he grants them is, a possibility of Salvation, but with extreme hazard to themselves, by keeping close to that which is superstition, and comes so near Idolatry.</hi> Are these then such expressions which import <hi>no peril of damnation</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church?</hi> And therefore when he speaks of the <hi>possibility</hi> of the <hi>Salvation</hi> of such <hi>who associate themselves wittingly and knowingly to the gross superstitions of the Romish Church</hi>; he declares sufficiently, that he means it not of those who do in heart approve of them, but only of such, who though they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced they are gross <hi>superstitions,</hi> yet think, they may communicate with those who use them, as long as they do not approve of them. Which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of theirs, though he looks on it as dangerous, yet not as wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of Salvation. But since, your Answer to this, is,<note place="margin">P. 316.</note> 
                  <hi>That he mistakes very much, in supposing such persons to belong to your Church and Communion:</hi> you are not aware, How much thereby you take off from the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants Confession, since those whom we contend for a possibility of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for, are such only whom you <hi>deny</hi> to be of your <hi>Churches Communion,</hi> and so the Argument signifies much less by your <hi>confession,</hi> than it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Thus we see, how this Argument upon the same terms you manage it against us, would have held as well in the behalf of the <hi>Donatists</hi> against the Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> For what other impertinencies you mix here and there, it is time now to pass them over, since the main grounds of them have been so fully handled before.</p>
               <p>We therefore proceed to the <hi>second Answer</hi> his <hi>Lordship</hi> gives to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>viz. That if the Principle on which it stands, doth hold,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>it makes more for the advantage of Protestants, than against them.</hi> For if that be safest which both parties are agreed in, then 1. <hi>You are bound to believe with us in the point of the Eucharist.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 286.</note> 
                  <hi>For all sides agree in the Faith of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>that in the most blessed Sacrament, the worthy Receiver is by his Faith made spiritually partaker of the true and real body and blood of Christ, truly and really, and of all the benefits of his passion. Your</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks add a manner of this presence, Transubstantiation which many deny; and the Lutherans Consubstantiation, which more deny. If this Argument be good then, even for this consent it is safer communicating with the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>than with the</hi> Roman <hi>or</hi> Lutheran; <hi>because all agree in this Truth, not in any other Opinion.</hi> You say, <hi>This can hold no further than communicating in the belief of this Opinion</hi>; let that be granted, and, Doth it not then follow,<note place="margin">P. 308.</note> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s Opinion is <hi>the safest</hi> upon your own ground? <hi>No,</hi> say you, <hi>for it is not such a common consent as doth exclude the manner of presence, by trans-, or consubstantiation.</hi> But, How sensless an Answer is this! for the Argument proceeds so <hi>far</hi> as all are agreed: and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> asserting that <hi>real presence,</hi> which all acknowledge as simply <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> in order to the effects of it; her Communion is more desirable on this account, than of either of those <hi>Churches</hi> which offer to define the manner of <hi>Christ</hi>'s presence, since even the greatest men of your perswasion, as <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> assert the belief of <hi>Transubstantiation not to be simply necessary to Salvation,</hi> and <hi>that the manner of it is secret and ineffable.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 309.</note> It is therefore quite beside the purpose, when you offer to prove, <hi>that</hi> Suarez <hi>believed Transubstantiation:</hi> for, although he did so, yet since he grants it <hi>not simply necessary to do it</hi>; his Lordships Argument in behalf of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> holds firm still, unless you can prove, that <hi>Suarez</hi> held
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:101069:320"/>
the belief of that to be as <hi>necessary,</hi> as the belief of the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>spiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> But you, after, attempt at large to prove, <hi>that the real par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Christ in the Sacrament in your sense, is quite different from that of Protestants</hi>: If you mean a <hi>corporal participation,</hi> indeed it is so; but that is not it, which is now enquired after; but, Whether you do not allow any <hi>real</hi> and <hi>spiritual presence</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> besides the <hi>corporal manducation</hi> of that you call his <hi>body by Transubstantiation.</hi> If you do not, you would do well to shew, what <hi>effects</hi> that hath upon the <hi>souls</hi> of men; if you do, then still the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is of the <hi>safer</hi> side, which holds that in which all are agreed. Which is as much as we are here concerned to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, as to this subject, the Controversie it self having been so lately handled.<note place="margin">P. 303.</note> 2. His Lordship instances, <hi>in the Article of our Saviour Christ's descent into Hell; both are agreed as to the Article of descent, but the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>differs in the explication; therefore it is safer holding with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which owns the Article without defining the manner.</hi> But,<note place="margin">P. 317.</note> you say, <hi>He proceeds on a false supposition, for both are not agreed, what is meant by Hell, whether it be the place of the damned or no:</hi> But this doth belong to the manner of <hi>Explication,</hi> and not to the <hi>Article</hi> it self, which both equally own, and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath the advantage there. 3. He instances, in the <hi>Institution of the Sacrament in both kinds; in which it is agreed by both Churches, that Christ did institute it so, and the Primitive Church received it so. Therefore according to the former Rule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis safest for a man to receive the Sacrament in both kinds.</hi> This (you say) <hi>is as little to the purpose as the former, because you do not agree that he did it with an intention, or gave any command that it should be alwaies so recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>; but still you are quite besides the business; for that is not our Question, but, Whether it be more <hi>safe</hi> to adhere to that which <hi>Christ instituted,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church practised,</hi> as you confess your selves; Or to your <hi>Church,</hi> which prohibits the doing that which you confess <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Primitive <hi>Church</hi> did? And we see, how great your <hi>Charity</hi> is, when you <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a possibility of Salvation to those who assert that Christs Institution is unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 318.</note> 
                  <hi>or that all who communicate are bound to receive in both kinds.</hi> For all other things concerning this subject, I must referr the Reader to the precedent Chapter,<note place="margin">P. 306.</note> in which they are fully discussed. 4. <hi>The dissenting Churches agree, that in the Eucharist there is a sacrifice of duty, and a sacrifice of praise, and a sacrifice of commemoration. Therefore it is safest to hold to the Church of</hi> England <hi>in this, and leave the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to her super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions that I say no more.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 319.</note> Here you still pretend, <hi>you differ in sense</hi>; but all this is only to say, you assert more than we do; which we grant, but assert upon your Principle, that we are on the safer side. And so in the <hi>intention of the Priest you agree with us as to the necessity of matter and form, and therefore it is safer holding to that,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 307.</note> 
                  <hi>than believing the necessity of the Priest's intention, which many deny.</hi> And if the Rule doth hold, as you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, That that which both are agreed in, is safer than the contrary; it will hold in matter of Opinion too, that it is safer to believe no more is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> than both parties are agreed in. The last Instance is, <hi>That we say, there are divers errours, and some gross ones, in the</hi> Roman <hi>Missal; but you confess there is no positive errour in the Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England; <hi>and therefore it is safest to worship God by that, and not by the</hi> Roman <hi>Mass.</hi> This you answer as all the rest, by running off from the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;<note place="margin">P. 320.</note> for, you say, <hi>It cannot be safer to use that, because you Catholicks say, That to use it in contempt of the</hi> Roman <hi>Missal is certainly damnable sin, and
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:101069:320"/>
destructive of Salvation.</hi> But, as it is not material what you say in this case, so it is not at all to the purpose; for, if your Rule holds good, it must be <hi>safer</hi>; and, if it be not, you must confess the Principle is false, <hi>That what both parties agree in, is the safest to be chosen in Religion.</hi> The same might be at large proved concerning the main things in difference between us, that, if this Principle be true, we have very much the advantage of you: as, You and we are agreed, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>God's Word,</hi> but we deny that <hi>Tradition</hi> is so, therefore it is safer adhering to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and let <hi>Tradition</hi> shift for it self. You and we are agreed that there are sufficient <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Credibility,</hi> to believe the <hi>Scripture</hi>; but we deny that there are any such <hi>Motives</hi> to believe the present <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is safer to believe the <hi>Scripture,</hi> than the present <hi>Church.</hi> So that this Principle, if improved by these, and other <hi>Instances,</hi> will redound more to our advantage, than yours, considering that in the case we grant it as to you, it is joyned with a <hi>Protestation</hi> of the <hi>extreme hazzard</hi> which those run, who venture on your Communion, on the account of it; but there is no such danger upon the agreement with us in those Principles which are agreed upon between us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Lordship answers truly, <hi>that this Proposition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>That in point of Faith and Salvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 288.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis safest for a man to take that way which the adversary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, or differing parties agree in, is no Metaphysical Principle, but a bare contingent Proposition, and may be true or false as the matter is to which it is applied, and so of no necessary truth in it self, nor able to lead in the Conclusion. Because consent of disagreeing parties, is neither Rule, nor Proof of Truth. For</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pilate, <hi>disagreeing parties enough, yet agreed against Truth it self. But Truth rather is, or should be, the Rule to frame, if not to force agreement.</hi> And to prove this further, his Lordship shews,<note place="margin">P. 308.</note> 
                  <hi>That if this Principle hold good, that 'tis safest to believe as the dissenting parties agree, or as the adverse party confesses, a man must be an Heretick in the highest degree, if not an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</hi> For, 1. <hi>In the Question between the Orthodox and Arrian concerning the Consubstantiality of the Son of God with the Father; The Orthodox con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that which the Arrians asserted,</hi> viz. <hi>that Christ was of a like nature with his Father; but they added more,</hi> viz. <hi>that he was of the same nature. Therefore upon this Principle it would be safest holding with the Arrians.</hi> 2. In the Question <hi>about the Resurrection; the dissenting parties agree, that there ought to be a Resurrection from sin, to the state of grace, and that this Resurrection only is meant in divers passages of Scripture, together with the life of the soul, which they are content to say is Immortal; but they deny any Resurrection of the body after death. And therefore if this Principle be true, it will be safest to deny the Article of the Resurrection.</hi> 3. In the great Dispute about <hi>the Vnity of the Godhead; all dissenting parties, Jew, Turk, and Christian, and all sects of Christians, agree in this, that there is but one God; and so by virtue of this Principle, men will be bound to deny the Trinity.</hi> 4. In the Article of <hi>the Divinity of Christ, The dissenting parties agree fully and clearly, that Christ is man; but the Hereticks deny him to be God: if it be therefore safest to go by the consent of dissenting parties, or the confession of adversaries, it will be safest believing that Christ is a meer man, and not God.</hi> From whence his Lordship most evidently proves, <hi>That this Rule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 311.</note> 
                  <hi>To resolve a mans Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, in which the dissenting parties agree, or which the adverse party confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is a meer contingent Proposition, and is as often false as true. And false in as great, if not greater matters than those, in which it is true. And where it is true, you dare not govern your selves by it; the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:101069:321"/>
those things which that Rule proves.</hi> And his Lordship justly admires, <hi>that while you talk of Certainty, nay, of Infallibility, you are driven to make use of such poor shifts as these, which have no Certainty at all of Truth in them, but inferr Falshood and Truth alike. And yet for this also, men will be so weak, or so wilful, as to be seduced by you.</hi> But now it is time to take notice, what Answer you return to these pregnant <hi>Instances</hi> which his Lordship uses; and you think to take off all this by one General Answer, <hi>viz. That the Rule speaks this precisely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 321.</note> 
                  <hi>and no more,</hi> viz. <hi>that when two parties differ in point of Religion, 'tis in prudence safest to take that way wherein both parties grant Salvation to be obtainable; but in the former Instances, Salvation was not allowed by the Orthodox to the dissenters.</hi> But, how poor an Evasion this is, will be very easily discovered. For, 1. If that Principle be true, it must be built on that which his Lordship disproves, <hi>viz. That when two parties disagree, it is safest believing that which both consent in.</hi> For, let any reasonable man judge, on what account I ought to make choice of your <hi>Religion</hi>; you say, <hi>Because both parties are agreed that men may be saved in your Church</hi>; well then, I ask, Why I ought to believe that which both parties are agreed in? Doth it not necessarily resolve it self into this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>That it is safest believing that which both parties consent in?</hi> For if this be not safest, Why should I be more inclined by their consent, than otherwise? So that if you let go this, you let go the only foundation on which that Principle stands. For if the consenting <hi>parties</hi> may agree in a <hi>falshood,</hi> What evidence can I have, but that this is one of those <hi>falshoods</hi> they may agree in? And therefore it is far from being the safest way to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon that which the dissenting parties agree in. And because <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> is a matter of the highest moment, if the Principle will not hold as to matter of particular Opinion, much less certainly in the most weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affair of mens eternal <hi>Salvation.</hi> And it ought to be a safe Principle indeed, which men should venture their souls upon, and not so uncertain <hi>Topical</hi> an Argument as this is. So that it is so far from being a matter of <hi>prudence</hi> to make choice of Religion on such a Principle, that no man can be guilty of greater weakness or imprudence, than by doing so. 2. If this Principle should be limited only to a <hi>possibility of Salvation,</hi> yet, as to that, it is easie to discover, how false and uncertain a principle it is, because it it generally the nature of <hi>Sects,</hi> to be <hi>uncharitable,</hi> and to deny <hi>Salvation</hi> to all but themselves: Whereas the Orthodox <hi>Christians</hi> in all ages have hoped the best of those who were mis-led among them; and on this ground it would still be safer to be on the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> than the <hi>Churches</hi> side. You have therefore gained an excellent Principle for the advantage of your <hi>Church</hi>; which, if it hold for you, will hold as well for the most <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Sectaries</hi> that are in the world. Nay, we may go somewhat further; and, What think you if <hi>Heathenism</hi> it self will be proved the safest way to Salvation? For many of you agree with them, <hi>That many of them might be saved, without any explicite knowledge of Christ</hi>; but they deny, <hi>you can be saved by it:</hi> If then this Principle be found, farewel the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and welcome <hi>Philosophy.</hi> If you say, <hi>They are only some among you who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the possibility of the Salvation of Heathens</hi>; you know, the very same Answer will hold as to us;<note place="margin">P. 301.</note> for, you confess, <hi>That many Protestants grant no more to you, than you do to them, in order to Salvation.</hi> If you say, <hi>That Heathens may be saved only on supposition of a general Repentance</hi>; that is all that any of us say as to you. So that if the Argument will hold one way, it must the other too; and it argues, you are very much to seek for proofs,
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:101069:321"/>
when you make use of this to perswade men to be of your <hi>Church.</hi> And you have no cause to triumph in the Conversion of such, who suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be imposed on by so palpable a piece of <hi>Sophistry</hi> as this is. But your way is to deal with the weakest, and such as are capable of such ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie <hi>impressions</hi> as these are.</p>
               <p>His Lordship, from that which was expressed, comes to that which was implyed in this Argument, <hi>viz. That we cannot be saved, because we are out of the Church.</hi> As to which, he saith, <hi>We are not out of the Catholick Church, because not within the</hi> Roman. <hi>For the</hi> Roman <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 313.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Church of</hi> England, <hi>are but two distinct members of that Catholick Church, which is spread over the face of the earth. If you can prove, that</hi> Rome <hi>is properly the Catholick Church it self, speak out, and prove it.</hi> This, you say,<note place="margin">P. 321.</note> 
                  <hi>you have done already</hi>; but, how poorly, let the Reader judge. But, when you add, <hi>That in the day of account, the</hi> Roman <hi>Church will be found not an elder Sister, but a Mother</hi>; it will be well for her, if it prove not, only in the sense where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Babylon</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> is called so,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.5.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. the Mother of Harlots and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Controversie,</hi> you tell us,<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>goes on touching</hi> Roman-<hi>Catholicks Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and we must follow it;<note place="margin">P. 222.</note> though without breaking it into several <hi>Chapters,</hi> as you do, that so we may lay together all that belongs to the same subject. And here his Lordship distinguishes <hi>the case of such, whose calling and sufficiency gives them a greater capacity for understanding the Truth; and such, whom, as S.</hi> Augustin <hi>speaks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 214.</note> 
                  <hi>the simplicity of believing makes safe. So that there's no Question,</hi> saith he, <hi>but many were saved in corrupted times of the Church, when their leaders, unless they repented before death, were lost.</hi> Which he understands, <hi>of such Leaders, as refuse to hear the Churches instruction, or to use all the means they can to come to the knowledge of the Truth. For if they do this, erre they may, but Hereticks they are not; as is most manifest in S.</hi> Cyprian<hi>'s case of Re-baptization. But when Leaders add Schism to Heresie, and Obstinacy to both, they are lost without Repentance, while many that succeed them in the errour only without obstinacy may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. That is, in case they hold these errours not supinely, not pertinaciously, not uncharitably, not factiously,</hi> i. e. <hi>in case all endeavours be used after Truth and Peace, and all expressions of Charity shewed to all who retain an internal Communion with the whole visible Church of Christ in the fundamental points of Faith. Such as these he confesses to be in a state of Salvation, though their mis-leaders perish.</hi> This is the summ of his Lordships discourse. Which you call,<note place="margin">P. 323,</note> 
                  <hi>a heavy doom against all the</hi> Roman <hi>Doctors in general</hi> (for what you say before, is a meer declamation and repetition of what hath been often examined.) But you ask, <hi>How could they be all lost, who by the Bishops own Principles, were members of the true visible Church of Christ, by reason of their being baptized, and holding the Foundation?</hi> But, Doth his Lordship say, that all such as are within the <hi>Church,</hi> are undoubtedly saved? For he only faith, <hi>That no man can be said simply to be out of the visible Church, that is baptized, and holds the Foundation.</hi> The most then that can be inferred meerly from being within the <hi>Church,</hi> is only, the <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> notwithstanding which, I suppose you will not deny, but many who have a possibility of Salvation, may yet certainly perish. For many may hold the <hi>Foundation</hi> it self <hi>doctrinally,</hi> who may not hold it <hi>savingly</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a pitiful inference, because he grants they are members of the <hi>Church,</hi> therefore it follows from his Principles, <hi>they cannot be lost.</hi> But you are in a very sad condition, if you have no other ground for your <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
                  <pb n="624" facs="tcp:101069:322"/>
but being members of that which you account the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 15.2.</note> When <hi>Christ</hi> himself saith, <hi>Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he taketh away</hi>; How much more such, who have nothing else to plead for their <hi>Salvation,</hi> but that they are in the <hi>Church?</hi> It is not therefore the bare <hi>doctrinal</hi> holding that <hi>Faith</hi> which makes them members of the <hi>Church,</hi> which can give them a title to <hi>Salvation</hi>; unless all sincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours be used to find out, what the will of <hi>God</hi> is, and to practise it when it is known.<note place="margin">P. 324.</note> But, you say, <hi>Your leaders did not refuse the Churches instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for they taught as the Church taught for many hundred years together; and, What other means could they be bound to use than they did, to come to the knowledge of the Truth?</hi> Yes, there were other means which they most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinely neglected themselves, and most dangerously with-held from others, <hi>viz. the plain and undoubted word of God,</hi> which is the only Infallible Rule of Faith. And let any <hi>Church</hi> whatsoever teach against this, it must incurr the same <hi>Anathema</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> pronounces against <hi>an Angel from Heaven,</hi> if he teaches any other Doctrine.

But, if we grant you that liberty to suppose your selves to be the <hi>whole and only Church,</hi> you will not more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily acquit all your <hi>Doctors,</hi> than condemn <hi>Protestants,</hi> both teachers and people.

               <head>CHAP. V. The Safety of the Protestant Faith.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The sufficiency of the Protestant Faith to Salvation, manifested by disproving the Cavils against it. <hi>T. C</hi>'s tedious Repetitions passed over. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Possession at large consider'd. No Prescription allowable, where the Law hath antecedently determined the right. Of the Infallibility of Oral Tradition. That, contrary to the received Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and in it self unreasonable. The Grounds of it examined. The ridiculousness of the Plea of bare Possession, discovered. General Answers returned to the remaining Chapters, consisting wholly of things already dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed. The place of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Cornelius</hi> particularly vindicated. The proof of Succession of Doctrine lyes on the Romanists by their own Principles.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALthough this Subject hath been sufficiently cleared in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, concerning the resolution of Faith;<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> yet the nature of our task requires that we so far resume the debate of it, as any thing undiscussed already offers it self to consideration. For I cannot think it a civil way of treating the Reader, to cloy him with Tautologies, or Repetitions; nor can I think it a way to satisfie him, rather by some incidental passages, than by a full and free debate. In all those things then, which we have had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to handle already, I shall remit the Reader to the precedent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; but whatever hath the face of being new and pertinent, I shall readily examine the force of it. The occasion of this fresh Debate was a new Question of the <hi>Lady; Whether she might be saved in the Protestant Faith?</hi> In answering whereof, you say, <hi>The parties conferring are put into new heats; Vpon my soul (said the Bishop) you may. Vpon my soul (said Mr.</hi> Fisher) <hi>there's but one saving Faith, and that's the Roman.</hi> Since the confidence seems equal on both sides, we must examine, Which is built on the stronger reason. And his Lordship's comes first to be examined; which he offers very freely to examination. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>to believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and the Creeds; to believe these in the sense of the Ancient Primitive Church; to receive the four great General Councils so much magnified by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; to believe all points of Doctrine generally received as fundamental in the Church of Christ, is a Faith, in which to live and dye, cannot but give Salvation. And therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>I went upon sure ground in the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my soul upon that Faith. Besides, in all the points controverted between us, I would fain see any one point maintain'd by the Church of</hi> England, <hi>that can be proved to depart from the foundation. You have many dangerous errours about the very foundation, in that which you call the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith; but there I leave you to look to your own soul, and theirs whom you seduce. Thus far his Lordship.</hi> Two things you seem to answer to this. 1. <hi>That such a Faith may not be sufficient.</hi> 2. <hi>That ours is not such a Faith.</hi> 1. <hi>That such a Faith may not be sufficient, because you suppose it necessary to believe the Infallibility of the present Church, and General Councils:</hi> But that we are now excused
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:101069:323"/>
from a fresh enquiry into; but you would seem to inferr it from his own principles <hi>of submission to General Councils.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 328.</note> But by what peculiar Arts you can thence draw, that some thing else is necessary to be believed in order to Salvation besides what hath been owned as Fundamentals in all ages, I am yet to learn. And sure you were much to seek for Arguments, when you could not distinguish between the necessity of external submission and internal assent.</p>
               <p>But the second is the main thing you quarrel with, <hi>viz. That the English-Protestant Faith is really and indeed such a Faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> and this you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake at large to disprove.<note place="margin">P. 329.</note> You ask first, <hi>Whether we believe all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or only a part of it?</hi> we answer, All without exception that is <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, i. e.</hi> hath any evidence that ever it was of <hi>Divine Revelation. In this,</hi> you say, <hi>we profess more then we can make good, seeing we refuse many books owned for Canonical by the Primitive Church, and imbrace some which were not.</hi> But in both you assert that, which we are sure you are never able to defend; since we are content to put it upon as fair a tryal as you can desire, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Church of England</hi> doth fully agree with the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> as to the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Which hath been already made good by the successful diligence of a learned <hi>Bishop</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Cosens</hi> Scholastical history of the Canon of Scripture.</note> to whom I refer you either for satisfaction or confusion. But you are the men whose bare words and bold affirmations must weigh more then the greatest evidence of reason or <hi>Antiquity.</hi> You love to pronounce, where you are loath to prove; and think to bear men down with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, where you are afraid to enter the lists. But our Faith stands not on so sandy a Foundation to be blown down with your biggest words; which have that property of wind in them to be leight and loud. When you will attempt to prove that the <hi>Books</hi> call'd <hi>Apocrypha</hi> have had an equal testimony of Divine Authority with those we receive into the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> you may meet with a further Answer upon that Subject. Just as much you say to disprove <hi>our believing Scripture, and the Creeds in the Primitive Church</hi>; For, you say, <hi>The Fathers oppose us,</hi> we deny it: you say, <hi>The Councils condemn us,</hi> we say and prove the contrary. You offer again at some broken evidences of the <hi>Popes Supremacy from Councils and Fathers</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 330.</note> but those have been discussed already: and the sense of the <hi>Church</hi> at large manifested to be contrary to it. But I fear your matters lye very ill concocted upon your stomack, you bring them us so often up; but I am not bound to dance in a <hi>circle</hi> because you do so. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed; but when I hope to do so, you pull me back again to the <hi>Infallibility of Councils</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> the question of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> and the <hi>Greek Church</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 331. P. 332.</note> and scarce a page between, but in comes again the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> as fresh, as if it had been never handled before. But I assure you after this rate,<note place="margin">P. 334: P. 335.</note> I wonder you ever came to an end, for you might have writ all your life time after that manner. For the <hi>decretal Epistles</hi> (those impregnable testimonies) St. <hi>Cyprian, Optatus, Hierom, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin, the Council of Sardica, Ephesus, Chalcedon,</hi> and all the baffled and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent proofs you could think on, must be pressed to do new service, though they had run out of the <hi>Field</hi> before. And this you call a General Consent of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>; but I must beg the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not to be scared with these <hi>vizards,</hi> for if he touches them they fall off, and then you will see them blush that they are so often abused to so ill an end. But this is not the only subject (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi>) which you give us so often over, but, within a page or two following, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                  <pb n="627" facs="tcp:101069:323"/>
again <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> with as much ceremony as if it had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; but till you have Answered what I have said already,<note place="margin">P. 337.</note> all that you have here is vain and impertinent: in the next page <hi>enter Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation:</hi> in the following, <hi>enter</hi> again <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">P. 339.</note> &amp;c. to the end of the Chapter. In all which I find but two things new, the one about <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which we shall meet with again; and the other you call a <hi>Note</hi> only by the way, but it is so rare a one, it ought to be considered.</p>
               <p>Which is,<note place="margin">P. 333.</note> 
                  <hi>That Protestants ought to prove their Faith agreeable to that of the Primitive Church by special undeniable evidence;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>but they have not the like reason to require it of you Catholicks</hi> (good reason for it) <hi>but,</hi> you say, <hi>not that you are unable to do it,</hi> (no, who would ever suspect that, who reads your book?) <hi>but because you are in full and quiet possession of your Faith, Religion, Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by immemorial tradition and succession from your Ancestours, that you do, upon that sole ground of quiet possession, justly prescribe against your Adversaries. And your plea,</hi> you say, <hi>must in all Law and equity be admitted for good, till they do by more pregnant and convincing arguments disprove it, and shew that your possession is not</hi> bonae fidei, <hi>but gain'd by force or fraud, or some other wrongful and unallowed means.</hi> To this, because I have not yet considered it, I shall now return the suller Answer. And it appears that the proof lyes upon you: For they who challenge <hi>full and quiet possession</hi> by vertue of <hi>immemorial tradition</hi> and <hi>succession</hi> from their <hi>Ancestours,</hi> ought to produce the conveyance of that <hi>tradition</hi> from him who alone could invest them in that possession. For although this title of <hi>possession</hi> be of late so much insisted on by those who see the weakness of other Arguments and are ashamed to use them, yet whosoever throughly searches it, will find it as weak and ridiculous as any other. For it is plain in this case the full <hi>right</hi> depends not upon meer <hi>occupancy,</hi> but a <hi>title</hi> must be pleaded, to shew that the possession is <hi>bonae fidei</hi>; so that the Question comes from the bare <hi>possession</hi> to the <hi>goodness</hi> of the title and the validity of it in justice and equity. Your title then is <hi>immemorial tradition</hi> from your <hi>Ancestours:</hi> but here several things are to be <hi>contested,</hi> before your <hi>prescription</hi> be allowed, 1. That no <hi>antecedent Law</hi> hath determin'd contrary to what you challenge by vertue of <hi>posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> For if it hath, no <hi>prescription</hi> is allowable in it. For, <hi>prescription</hi> can only take place where the <hi>Law</hi> allows a liberty for <hi>prescription</hi>; but if the <hi>Law</hi> hath antecedently determin'd against it, <hi>possession</hi> signifies nothing, but the liberty to make good the <hi>Title.</hi> Would any man be so mad, as to think that <hi>prescription</hi> of threescore years would have been sufficient in the <hi>Judaical Law,</hi> when all possessions were to return to their first owners by <hi>Law</hi> at every year of <hi>Jubilee?</hi> So then the matter to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired here, is, What liberty of <hi>prescription</hi> is allowed by vertue of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; for since he hath made <hi>Laws</hi> to Govern his <hi>Church</hi> by, it is most sensless pleading <hi>prescription,</hi> till you have particularly examin'd, how far such <hi>prescription</hi> is allowed by him. Let us then suppose, that any of the matters in difference between us, are one way or other deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by him, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> be <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> or no, Whether the present <hi>Church</hi> be <hi>Infallible</hi> or no. What do you say? Hath he determined these things, or hath he not? If he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them one way or other, it is to no purpose in the world to plead <hi>possession</hi> or <hi>prescription</hi>; for these signifie nothing against <hi>Law.</hi> So that the question must be wholly removed from the <hi>plea</hi> of <hi>possession,</hi> and it
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:101069:324"/>
must be tryed upon this <hi>issue,</hi> Whether <hi>Christ</hi> by his <hi>Law</hi> hath determined on your side or ours? It may be you will tell me, <hi>That in this case pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription interprets Law, and that the Churches possession argues it was the will of Christ.</hi> But still the proof lyes upon your side, since you run your self into new bryars; for you must prove that there is no way to interpret this <hi>Law,</hi> but by the practise of the <hi>Church,</hi> and which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> of all, That the <hi>Church</hi> cannot come into the possession of any thing, but what was originally given her by the <hi>Legislator.</hi> Which is a task neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily incumbent on you to prove, and I suppose you will find so much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in it, that you had as good run back to <hi>Super hanc Petram,</hi> and <hi>Pasce oves,</hi> as undertake to manage it. He that undertakes to prove it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the <hi>Church</hi> should claim <hi>possession</hi> by an undue title; must prove it impossible, that the <hi>Church</hi> should ever be deceived. And herein we see the excellent way of this proof. For suppose the matter in dispute be the <hi>Roman Churches Infallibility, this,</hi> you say, <hi>you are in possession of</hi> (though that be the thing in question), well, we will suppose it, that we may discern your proofs. I demand then, On what account do you challenge this? you say, <hi>By prescription.</hi> I further ask, How you prove this <hi>prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> sufficient? you say, <hi>Because the Church cannot challenge any thing but what belongs to her.</hi> I demand a proof of that: your Answer must be, <hi>Because the Church cannot be deceived</hi>; so that the proof at last comes to this, <hi>The Church is Infallible because she is Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but suppose this <hi>Infallibility</hi> challenged, be only an <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Tradition,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> and not a <hi>Doctrinal Infallibility</hi> in either <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Councils.</hi> Yet still I am as unsatisfied as ever. For I ask, Whether am I bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what the present Church delivers to be Infallible? <hi>Yes.</hi> On what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count am I bound to believe it? <hi>Because the present Church cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in what the Church of the former age believed, nor that in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and so up till the time of Christ.</hi> But, 1. How can you assure me, the present <hi>Church</hi> obliges me to believe nothing, but only <hi>what, and so far,</hi> as it received it from the former <hi>Church?</hi> What evidence can you bring to convince me, both that the <hi>Church</hi> alwayes observed this <hi>rule</hi> and could never be deceived in it? For I see the <hi>Roman Church</hi> asserts, that things may be <hi>de fide</hi> in one age, which were not in another; at least <hi>Pope, and Councils</hi> challenge this, and this is the common Doctrine maintained there, and others are looked on as no members of their <hi>Church</hi> who assert the contrary; but as persons, at least <hi>meritoriously,</hi> if not <hi>actually,</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. Where then shall I satisfie my self what the sense of your <hi>Church</hi> is, as to this particular? Must I believe a very few persons whom the rest disown as Heretical and Seditious persons? or ought I not rather to take the judgement of the greatest and most approved persons in that <hi>Church?</hi> And these disown any such Doctrine; but assert that the <hi>Church</hi> may determine things <hi>de fide</hi> which were not so before: in which case I ask, Whether, when a thing is <hi>de novo</hi> determined to be <hi>de fide,</hi> that <hi>Church</hi> believed as the precedent did, or no? If it did, How comes any thing to be <hi>de fide</hi> which was not before? If it did not, What assurance can I have that every age of the <hi>Church</hi> believes just as the <hi>precedent</hi> did, and no otherwise? when I see they profess the contrary. And if a thing may be <hi>de fide</hi> in one age, which was not in a foregoing, then a <hi>Church</hi> may deliver that as a matter of Faith at one time, which was never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted so before: by which means the present <hi>Church</hi> may oblige me to believe that as a matter of <hi>Faith</hi> which never was so in <hi>Christ</hi> or the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
                  <pb n="629" facs="tcp:101069:324"/>
times, and so the <hi>Infallibility</hi> on the account of <hi>Tradition</hi> is destroyed. 2. What security is there, that in no age of the <hi>Church</hi> any practises should come in, which were not used in the precedent? You may say, <hi>Because they could not be deceived what their fore Fathers did</hi>; but that satisfies not, unless you prove that all the <hi>Church</hi> in every age looked upon it self as obliged to do nothing at all, but what their <hi>fore-Fathers</hi> did. For although they might know never so much what was done by them, if they did not judge themselves bound to observe unalterably what they did, this doth not hinder at all, but new <hi>customs</hi> and opinions might be introduced in the <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore I cannot but justly wonder, that any men of parts who professedly disown the vulgar wayes of establishing the <hi>Roman Church</hi> should think to satisfie themselves with <hi>Orall Tradition,</hi> and cry it up as so impregnable a thing. <hi>Because no age of the Church can be deceived in what the foregoing did and taught.</hi> Whereas a very little of that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which these men pretend to, might acquaint them, that the <hi>force</hi> of it doth not lye in their <hi>capacity</hi> to know what was done by others, but in their <hi>obligation</hi> not to vary at all from it. For the main weight of the Argument lyes here, <hi>That nothing hath been changed in the Faith or Practise of the Church,</hi> which being the thing to be proved, the bare knowledge of what was believed or practised, is not sufficient to prove it; for men may know very well what others believe and do, and yet may believe and do quite contrary themselves. But the only thing to be proved in this case is, That every age of the <hi>Church,</hi> and all persons in it looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as obliged, not to vary in any thing from the Doctrine or practise of the precedent age. And I pray let me know by what demonstrative <hi>medium</hi> can this be proved; for no less then <hi>demonstrations</hi> are spoken of by the magnifiers of this way; although there be so little evidence in it, that it cannot work but upon a very weak understanding. Must that <hi>obligation</hi> to observe all which the <hi>precedent age</hi> believed or practised be proved by <hi>reason, particular testimony,</hi> or <hi>universal tradition?</hi> And let the extollers of this way take their choice, so they will undertake to bring evidence equal to the weight which depends upon it. It is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what <hi>reason</hi> should inforce it, but such as proves the impossibility of the contrary: And they have <hi>understandings</hi> of another <hi>mould</hi> from others, who can conceive it impossible that men should not think themselves <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> and do all just as their Predecessours did. If <hi>particular testimonies</hi> could be produced, they signifie no more, then their own judgements; but we are enquiring for the judgement of every age of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the persons who live in it. And to prove an <hi>universal tradition</hi> of this <hi>obligation</hi> is the most difficult task of all, for it depends upon the truth of that which is to be proved by it. For if they did not think themselves <hi>obliged</hi> to believe and do what their Predecessours did, they could not think themselves bound to deliver such an <hi>obligation</hi> to their <hi>posterity</hi> to do it. And therefore you must first prove the <hi>obligation</hi> it self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can prove the <hi>universal tradition</hi> of it. For although one age may deliver it, yet you cannot be assured that a former age did it to them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you can prove, the same sense of this <hi>obligation</hi> ran through them all. But this is so far from being an <hi>universal tradition,</hi> that the present age from which it begins was never agreed in it, as I have shewed already.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is to no purpose to prove the <hi>impossibility</hi> of <hi>motion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 5.</note> when I see men move: no more is it to prove that no <hi>age</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> could vary from the foregoing, when we can evidently prove that they have done it.
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:101069:325"/>
And therefore this Argument is intended only to <hi>catch</hi> easie minds that care not for a search into the History of the several <hi>ages</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but had rather sit down with a superficial subtilty<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> than spend time in further enquiries. For this Argument proceeds just as if men should prove the world <hi>eternal</hi> by this <hi>medium</hi>; The present age sees no alteration in it, and they could not be deceived in what their fore Fathers believed, nor they in theirs, and so on <hi>in infinitum</hi>; for no men did ever see the world made: and therefore it was never made, and so eternal. But if we go about to prove by reason the production of the <hi>world,</hi> or by <hi>Scripture</hi> to shew that it was once made, then this <hi>oral tradition</hi> is spoiled. And so it is in the present case; These men attempt to prove there could never be any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Faith or practise of the <hi>Church</hi> since <hi>Christs</hi> time; <hi>for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age delivers what it had from the precedent, and so up till the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church:</hi> but in the mean time, if we can evidently prove that there have been such alterations in the <hi>Church,</hi> then it is to no purpose to prove that impossible which we see actually done. And this appears, not only because the <hi>Scripture</hi> supposes a <hi>degeneracy</hi> in the Christian <hi>Church,</hi> which could never be, if every age of the <hi>Church</hi> did infallibly <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> as the precedent up to <hi>Christs</hi> time did; but because we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce clear evidence, that some things are delivered by the present <hi>Church</hi> which must be brought in by some age since the time of <hi>Christ.</hi> For which I shall refer you to what I have said already concerning <hi>Communion in one kind, Invocation of Saints, and Worship of Images.</hi> In all which I have proved evidently, that they were not in <hi>use</hi> in some ages of the <hi>Christian Church</hi>; and it is as evident that these are delivered by the present <hi>Church</hi>; and therefore this principle must needs be false. For by these things it appears, that one <hi>age</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> may differ in practise or opinion from another, and therefore this <hi>oral tradition</hi> cannot be infallible. And yet this is the only way whereby a <hi>prescription</hi> may be allowed, for this offers to give a sufficient <hi>title</hi> if it could be made good. But <hi>bare possession</hi> in matters of Religion is a most sensless plea; and which would justifie <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism</hi> and <hi>Mahumetism</hi> as well as your <hi>Church.</hi>

the <hi>Popes Supremacy, Transubstantiation, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> And what then? Do you not believe them still? Yes doubtless. But, What is your quarrel with us then? Do we hinder you the <hi>Possession</hi> of them? <hi>No, but we ought to believe them too.</hi> But, Why so? <hi>because you are in possession of them.</hi> What, Must we then believe whatever you do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or false? If this be the meaning of your <hi>Possession,</hi> you ought well to prove it, or else we shall call it <hi>Vsurpation.</hi> For it is a most ridiculous thing for you to talk of <hi>Possession,</hi> when the Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any such things in the world or no, as those you say you are possessed of? We deny your <hi>Churches Infallibility,</hi> the <hi>Popes Supremacy, Purgatory, &amp;c.</hi> You must first prove there are such things <hi>in rerum natur√¢,</hi> as <hi>Purgatory, Transubstantiation, &amp;c.</hi> before you can say, you are <hi>possessed of them:</hi> You must convince us, that your <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Infallible,</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> was made <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church by Christ,</hi> and then we will grant you are in full possession of them, but not before. So that you see, the Question is not concerning the manner of <hi>Possession,</hi> but of the things themselves, which you call your <hi>Faith, Religion,</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> in opposition to ours; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impossible to plead <hi>Prescription,</hi> where there never was any <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> at all. And therefore you clearly mistake when you call us, <hi>The Aggressors,</hi> for you are plainly the <hi>Imposers</hi> in this case, and quarrel with us for not believing what you would have us; and therefore you are bound to prove, and not we. So that there is nothing you could challenge any <hi>Possession</hi> of in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but some <hi>Authority</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> had, which you elsewhere confess <hi>he might he deprived of, as he was in King</hi> Henry<hi>'s time</hi>; and which we offer to prove that he was not <hi>Possessor bonae fidei</hi> of, but that he came to it by <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi> and was deprived of it by a <hi>legal Power.</hi> Thus I have fully examined your Argument from <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,</hi> because it presents us with something which had not been discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed before.</p>
               <p>But having taken a view of all that remains, I find that it consists of a bare Repetition of the Controversies before discussed,<note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> especially concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>grounds of Faith,</hi> the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>General Councils,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi>; So that if you had not an excellent faculty of saying most, where there is least occasion, I should wonder at your design in spending several <hi>Chapters</hi> in giving the same things, under other words. Unless it were an ambition of answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every clause in his Lordships Book, which carried you to it, though you only gave over and over what you had said in many places before. Which is a piece of <hi>vanity</hi> I neither envy you for, nor shall I strive to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate you in; having made it my endeavour to lay those grounds in the handling each Controversie, that there should not need any such fruitless repetitions as you here give us. His Lordship, though he complains much of it, was forced by his <hi>Adversaries</hi> importunity to return the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers in effect, which had been given before by him in the proper places; but, whosoever compares what his Lordship saith, with what you pretend to answer, will find no necessity at all of my undergoing the same tedious and wearisome task. Instead therefore of a particular Answer, I shall give only some <hi>general strictures</hi> on what remains of these subjects, where there is any appearance of difficulty; and conclude all with the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that being a subject which hath not yet come under our enquiry. Your main business is to perswade us, <hi>that yours is the only saving Faith</hi>; which you prove by this, <hi>The saving Faith is but

                  <hi>yours is confessed by us to be a saving Faith still; therefore yours is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saving Faith.</hi> But if you had considered on what that confession depends, you could have made no Argument at all of it; for, when we say, that your <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>saving,</hi> we mean no more but this, that you have so much of the common truths of <hi>Christianity</hi> among you, that there is a possibility for men to be saved in your <hi>Church</hi>; but, Doth this imply, that yours is a <hi>saving Faith,</hi> in that sense wherein it is said, There is but one <hi>saving Faith?</hi> for in that Proposition it is understood of all those common fundamental Truths, which the <hi>Christian Church</hi> of all ages hath been agreed in And the saying, There is but <hi>one saving Faith,</hi> is of the same sense with the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, There is but <hi>one true Religion</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>The substance of what you would inferr from the saying of <hi>Athanasius</hi> his <hi>Creed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 351.</note> 
                  <hi>Which if a man keeps whole and inviolate</hi> (as you would have it) is this, <hi>That a man is equally bound to believe every Article of Faith.</hi> But you cannot mean, that it is simply necessary to do it, for that you disclaim else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, by your distinction of <hi>things necessary from the matter and the formal reason of Faith</hi>; and therefore it can only be meant of such to whom those <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> are sufficiently proposed, and so far we acknowledge it too, that it is necessary to Salvation for every man to believe that which he is convinced to be an object of Faith. For otherwise such persons must call in question <hi>God's Veracity</hi>; but if you would hence make it necessary to believe all that your <hi>Church</hi> proposes for matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> you must prove, that whatever your <hi>Church</hi> delivers, is as infallibly true, as if <hi>God</hi> himself spake; and when you can perswade us of this, we shall believe whatever is propounded by her. When you say, <hi>We cannot believe all Articles of Faith on the same formal reason,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 352.</note> 
                  <hi>because we deny the Churches Infallibility,</hi> it is apparent, that you make the <hi>Churches</hi> testimony the <hi>formal reason</hi> of Faith; and that you are bound to prove the <hi>Church</hi> absolutely <hi>Infallible,</hi> before we can believe any thing on her account. Neither doth it follow, <hi>Because we deny that, therefore we pick and chuse our Faith</hi>; for we believe all without reservation,<note place="margin">P. 353.</note> which you, or any man can convince us was ever revealed by <hi>God.</hi> As to what at large occurrs here again, about the <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of Councils</hi>; there is nothing but what hath been sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered on that subject;<note place="margin">P. 355, &amp;c.</note> and so reserving the Question of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which is here brought in by his Lordship, as a further Instance of the errours of <hi>General Councils</hi>; I pass on to the two last Chapters: In which we meet again with the objected inconveniencies,<note place="margin">P. 373.

Church</hi> be understood or no? His Lordship saith, <hi>Not,</hi> and gives ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reasons for it; you maintain the contrary; but the business may be soon decided upon a true state of the occasion of writing that <hi>Epistle.</hi> Which in short was this; It seems, Letters had been sent in the name of <hi>Polycarp Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Adrumyttium,</hi> directed to <hi>Cornelius</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; but <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> and <hi>Liberalis</hi> coming thither, and acquainting the <hi>Clergy</hi> there with the resolution of the <hi>African Bishops</hi> to suspend communion either with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or <hi>Novatianus,</hi> till the return of <hi>Caldonius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> who were sent on purpose to give an account of the proceedings there, the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of <hi>Adrumyttium</hi> upon this writing to <hi>Rome,</hi> direct their Letters not to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> but to the <hi>Roman Clergy.</hi> Which <hi>Cornelius</hi> (being it seems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by some, as though it were done by S. <hi>Cyprian's Counsel</hi>) takes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at, and writes to <hi>Cyprian</hi> about it. Who gives him in this <hi>Epistle</hi> the account of it, that it was only done, that there might be no dissent among themselves upon this difference at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they only suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their sentence till the return of <hi>Caldonius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> who might either bring them word that all was composed at <hi>Rome,</hi> or else satisfie them, Who was the lawfully ordained <hi>Bishop.</hi> And therefore, as soon as they understood that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was the lawful <hi>Bishop,</hi> they unanimously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for him, and order all Letters to be sent to him, and that his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion should be embraced. This is the substance of that <hi>Epistle.</hi> But, it seems <hi>Cornelius</hi> was moved at S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s suspending himself, as though it were done out of dis-favour to him; which <hi>Cyprian</hi> to clear himself of, tells him, That his design was only to preserve the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>we gave this advice to all those, who the mean time had occasion to sail to</hi> Rome, ut Ecclesiae Catholicae radicem &amp; matricem agnoscerent &amp; tenerent; <hi>that they would acknowledge and hold to the root and matrix of the Catholick Church,</hi> by which his Lordship understands, <hi>the Vnity of the Church Catholick,</hi> you, <hi>the particular Church of</hi> Rome. But it is apparent, the meaning of this <hi>Counsel</hi> was, to prevent their participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Schism.</hi> So that if, upon their coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> party was evidently known from the other (which they might, I grant, soon understand there, by the circumstances of affairs) they should joyn themselves with that <hi>part</hi> which preserved the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Which I take to be the true meaning of S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> But in case the matter should prove disputable at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the matter be referred to other <hi>Churches,</hi> then by virtue of this advice, they were bound to suspend their communion with either party, till the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> had declared it self. By this account of the business, all your Arguments come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for they only prove that which I grant, <hi>viz. That in case it appeared at</hi> Rome, <hi>Which was the Catholick party, they were to communicate with it:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 391. P. 392.</note> but this was not, because the <hi>Catholick party</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> was the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (for on that account the party of <hi>Novatianus</hi> might have been so too, if <hi>Novatianus</hi> had been lawful <hi>Bishop</hi>) but their holding to the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> would oblige them to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate only with that <hi>part,</hi> which did preserve the <hi>Vnity</hi> of it. For the Controversie now at <hi>Rome</hi> was between two <hi>parties</hi> both challenging an equal <hi>right</hi>; and therefore if S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had only advised them to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> because that was the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>matrix</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> his advice had signified nothing; for the Question was not between the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other <hi>Churches,</hi> in which case it might have been pertinent to have said, they should adhere to the <hi>Church</hi>
                  <pb n="634" facs="tcp:101069:327"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> because that was the <hi>root, &amp;c.</hi> But when the difference was at <hi>Rome</hi> it self between two <hi>Bishops</hi> there, this reason had been wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; for the only reason proper in this case, must be such as must <hi>discriminate</hi> the one <hi>party</hi> from the other, which this could not do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was equally challenged by them both. And had belonged to one as well as the other, in case <hi>Novatianus</hi> had proved the lawful <hi>Bishop,</hi> and not <hi>Cornelius.</hi> And therefore the sense of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words must be such as might give direction, which <hi>party</hi> to joyn with at <hi>Rome,</hi> on which account they cannot import any priviledge of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> over other <hi>Churches,</hi> but only contain this advice, that they should hold to the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and communicate only with that <hi>party</hi> which did it. This reason is so clear and evident to me, that this place cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of any <hi>priviledge</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> above other <hi>Churches,</hi> that if there were nothing else to induce me to believe it, this were so pregnant, that I could not resist the force of it.</p>
               <p>But besides this, his Lordship proves that elsewhere S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaks in his own person with other <hi>Catholick Bishops,</hi>

But you are still so very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, that though no more be said of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> than might be said of any other <hi>Apostolical Church,</hi> yet because it is said of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> it must import some huge Authority, which if it had been said of any other, would have been interpreted by your selves into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For so do you deal with us here; for, because it is said, that they who joyned with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> did preserve the Unity of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 394.</note> therefore it must needs be understood, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>Catholick.</hi> But he must have a very mean understanding, that can be swayed by such trifles as these are: For, Was there not a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> and <hi>Schismatical</hi> party then at <hi>Rome?</hi> and if they who joyned with <hi>Novatianus,</hi> did separate from the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> then they who were in communion with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> must preserve the <hi>Vnity</hi> of it. And, Would not this Argment as well prove the <hi>Catholick</hi> party at <hi>Carthage</hi> to be the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>matrix</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as well as at <hi>Rome?</hi> But such kind of things must they deal with, who are resolved to maintain a cause, and yet are destitute of better means to do it with. So that I cannot find any thing in all your Answer, but what would equally hold for any other <hi>Church</hi> at that time, which was so divided as <hi>Rome</hi> was; considering the great care that then was used to preserve the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> And what particularly S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s apprehension was concerning the <hi>Nature</hi>

                  <hi>That she did well to desert the Protestant Communion</hi>; you must prove that it can be no sin to follow the dictates of an erroneous conscience. For such, we say, it was in her, and, you denying it, all this discourse signifies nothing, but depends on the truth of the matters in controversie between us.

So that while you are charging him <hi>falsly</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing dissimulation, you do that which is more, in saying that which you cannot but know to be a great untruth.</p>
               <p>If <hi>our Religion be not the same with yours,</hi> as you eagerly contend it is not,<note place="margin">P. 402.</note> let it suffice to tell you, that our <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>Christianity,</hi> let yours be what it will.

               <p>In your following discourse, you are so far from giving us <hi>any hopes of peace with your Church,</hi> that you plainly give us the reason,<note place="margin">P. 403<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

                  <note place="margin">P. 404, &amp;c.</note> For his Lordship saith, <hi>It may be our duty not to oppose General Councils in case they erre, and yet it may be no pride not to believe known and gross errours of General Councils</hi>; and I pray, What shadow of a contradiction is here?

               <argument>
                  <p>The Advantage which comes to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, thence the boldness of our Adversaries in contending for it. The Sense of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church concerning Purgatory, explained. The Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Greek and Latin Church concerning it. The Difference in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about Purgatory. Some general Considerations about the Sense of the Fathers, as to its being an Article of Faith. The Doubtfulness and Vncertainty of the Fathers Judgments in this particular, manifested by S. <hi>Austin</hi> the first who seemed to assert a Purgation before the day of Judgement. Prayer for the Dead used in the Ancient Church, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr Purgatory. The Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> vindicated from our Adversaries Calumnies. The general Intention of the Church distinguished from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinions of particular persons. The Prayers of the Church respected the day of Judgement. The Testimonies of the Fathers in behalf of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, examined; particularly of the pretended <hi>Dionysius, Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian, Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Basil, Nazianzen, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius, Hilary, Gregory Nyssen, &amp;c.</hi> And not one of them asserts the Purgatory of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi> doth not contradict himself about it. The Doctrine of Purgatory no elder than <hi>Gregory 1.</hi> and built on Cred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>THese general Answers being dispatched, there remains only now this Question concerning <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be discussed.<note place="margin">¬ß. 1.</note> Which being the
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:101069:328"/>
great <hi>Diana</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> no wonder you are so much displeased at his Lordship for speaking against it; for by that means <hi>your craft is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be set at nought.</hi> There being no Opinion in your <hi>Church</hi> which brings in a more constant revenue, by <hi>Masses for the dead,</hi> and <hi>Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> besides <hi>Casualties,</hi> and <hi>Deodands,</hi> by dying persons, or their friends, in hopes of a speedier release out of the pains of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> So that if this Opinion were once out of <hi>Countenance</hi> in the world, you would lose one of the best Arts you have of upholding the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi> For then farewel <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and <hi>years</hi> of <hi>Jubilee</hi>; farewel all those rich <hi>Donations</hi> which are given by those at their death, who hope by that means to get the sooner out of the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> to a place of rest and happiness. For, What Engine could possibly be better contrived to extort the largest gifts from those whose riches were as great as their sins, than to perswade them, that by that means they would be sooner deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the <hi>Flames</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and need not doubt but they should come to Heaven at last? And, Would not they be accounted great <hi>Fools,</hi> that would not live as they pleased in this world, as long as they could <hi>buy</hi> themselves out of the pains of another? And by this means your <hi>Church</hi> hath not only <hi>eaten,</hi> but <hi>grown fat, by the sins of the people</hi>; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly observed by <hi>Spalatensis,</hi>

                  <hi>That the Doctrine of Purgatory hath been that which hath most inriched the Church of</hi> Rome; which he gives as the reason of the most zealous contending for that Doctrine among those of your party, who find so much advantage by it. And we might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily believe there was something extraordinary in it, when you tell us; <hi>It is therefore firmly to be believed by all Catholicks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 371.</note> 
                  <hi>that there is a Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; yea, we are as much bound to believe it, as we are bound to believe (for Instance) the Trinity or Incarnation it self: because, since it is defined by the Church, we cannot lawfully, or without sin and peril of damnation deny or question this doctrine.</hi> We had need then look to our selves, who look on this Doctrine as a meer figment, that hath no foundation at all either in <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>; but much more had you need to look to your selves, who dare with so much confidence obtrude so destructive a Doctine to a <hi>Christian life,</hi> without any evidence of the truth of it, to be believed as much <hi>as the Trinity or Incarnation it self</hi>; which expressions take them in the mildest sense you can give them, carry a most insufferable boldness with them. But these are not all the bold words which you utter on this Subject; for you say elsewhere,<note place="margin">P. 350.</note> 
                  <hi>That</hi> Bellarmin <hi>doth not more boldly, than truly affirm, yea evidently prove, that all the Fathers, both Greek and Latin, did constantly teach Purgatory from the very Apostles times, and consequently that it must be held for an Apostolical Tradition, or nothing can be.</hi> So then, if confidence would carry it, we must not only tremble at the fears of <hi>Purgatory</hi>; but we must firmly believe it as <hi>an Article of Faith,</hi> and as a most undoubted <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before we can digest these things, we must see a little more ground for them, than as yet we do;<note place="margin">¬ß. 2.</note> and therefore you must be content to hear our reasons, Why we neither look on it as a <hi>matter of Faith</hi> or <hi>Apostolical tradition</hi>; in order to which nothing is more necessary, then to enquire what you mean by <hi>Purgatory.</hi> For as long as you can shelter your selves under General words, you think you are safe enough; but when we once bring you to a fuller explication of your meaning, <hi>Purgatory</hi> it self is not half so evident as those <hi>impostures</hi> are whereby you would maintain it.
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:101069:329"/>
But for our clear understanding this Controversie, we must find out what your <hi>Doctrine</hi> is concerning it; for, as confident as you are of it, there are not a few among you who are afraid to declare what you mean by it, lest by that means the world should see how far it is from having foundation either in <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity.</hi> We are therefore told by some either are ashamed of the Doctrine it self, or loth to betray their cause (who by declaring themselves) that your <hi>Church</hi> requires no more then to believe that there is a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> for which they avouch the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> which only defines <hi>That the sound Doctrine concerning Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory should be taught.</hi> This was indeed necessary to be said by such who do not at all believe the <hi>Roman Doctrine</hi> concerning it, what ever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; but rather agree with the <hi>Greek Church</hi> about the middle <hi>state</hi> of <hi>souls.</hi> But although the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> did not expresly define what they meant by <hi>Purgatory</hi>; yet the sense of the <hi>Council</hi> concerning it, is easie to be gathered from the comparing of places together in it. For the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> in the last <hi>Session</hi> when it passed the decree of <hi>Purgatory</hi> referrs us to two things, by which we may fully understand the meaning of it; For in the Preface to the Decree, it saith, <hi>That the Catholick Church had, in this and former Oecumenical Councils, taught that there was a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>; by which we may understand, What this <hi>Purgatory</hi> is, which was now decreed, and you say, we are bound to believe it as an Article of Faith. Now in all the former Decrees and <hi>Anathematisms</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> there is no place which seems to concern the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> so much as the thirtieth <hi>Anathema</hi> of the sixth <hi>Session</hi> in these words, <hi>Si quis ita reatum poenae aeternae deleri dixerit; ut nullus remaneat reatus poenae temporalis exsolvendae vel in hoc seculo vel in futuro in Purgatorio, antequam ad regna coelorum aditus patere possit; Anathema sit. If any one shall affirm that the guilt of eternal punishment is so forgiven, as that there remains no guilt of temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be paid, either in this life, or hereafter in Purgatory; before there can be any entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven; let them be Anathema.</hi> From whence it evidently follows, that the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> as it is taught by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> doth depend upon this principle, <hi>That there is a guilt of temporal punishment remaining after the sin is pardoned, which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral punishment is to be satisfied for, either in this life, or in Purgatory.</hi> So that all those who are in <hi>Purgatory</hi> are there on that account, that they might satisfie the justice of <hi>God</hi> for the <hi>temporal punishment</hi> of sin. For the <hi>guilt</hi> of mortal <hi>sin</hi> being remitted by the merits of <hi>Christ,</hi> the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is supposed still to remain, which being exchanged from <hi>eternal</hi> to <hi>temporal</hi> by the <hi>keyes</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> this <hi>punishment</hi> remains to be satisfied for, in the pains of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> But this punishment being <hi>temporal,</hi> the <hi>possibility</hi> of a <hi>release</hi> from them is necessarily supposed before the day of judgement; for the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> in the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> declares that the <hi>souls</hi> there detained are relieved by the <hi>prayers of the Faithful, and especially by the sacrifice of the Altar. Which,</hi> in the 22 Session, it saith, <hi>is offer'd</hi> pro defunctis in Christo nondum ad plenum purgatis, <hi>for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in Christ not yet fully purg'd.</hi> So that the satisfaction of the <hi>debt</hi> of <hi>temporal punishment which remains when the sin is pardoned, and the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of souls from thence to Heaven by the prayers of the living and the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mass,</hi> are the main Foundations of the Doctrine of your <hi>Church</hi> concerning <hi>Purgatory.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 3.</note> And this will further appear by the state of the Controversie between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Church</hi> upon this Subject. For the main thing which
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:101069:329"/>
the <hi>Greeks</hi> objected against the <hi>Latins,</hi> was this temporary punishment for sin, in a future state: For they say, in their <hi>Apology</hi> delivered into the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Basil, We own no Purgatory fire, nor any temporary punishment by fire which shall have an end; for we received no such thing by tradition, nor doth the Eastern Church confess it.</hi> And afterwards; <hi>We deny that any souls pass through this fire to eternal fire; for in saying so,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>we should weaken the consent of the whole Church: and it is to be fear'd, if we should assert such a temporary fire, that people would be apt to believe that all the fire in the other life were only temporary; by which means they would fall into such neglect and carelesness, that they would make the more fuel for eternal fire.</hi> And therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>That they neither have nor shall assert any such Purgatory fire.</hi> But you would seem to perswade us,<note place="margin">P. 358.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Contest between the Greeks and Latins was only, whether the fire of Purgatory were material or no</hi>; For you say, <hi>The Greeks in the Council of</hi> Florence <hi>never doubted in the least measure, nor denyed Purgatory it self, but only question'd, Whether the fire were mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial or metaphorical.</hi> But if you speak of those <hi>Greeks,</hi> who held to what was generally received in the <hi>Greek Church</hi>; you are very much deceived therein, for the sense of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> was fully delivered by them in this <hi>Apology,</hi> penned, as is supposed, by <hi>Marcus Ephesius</hi> but the year before at the <hi>Council of Basil</hi>; and herein they not only dispute against the <hi>fire,</hi> but against any such <hi>state</hi> of <hi>purgation</hi> after this life, by the undergoing any temporary punishment for sin. For thus that <hi>Apology</hi> ends; <hi>For these causes the Doctrine proposed of a Purgatory fire is to be cast out of the Church,</hi>

                  <hi>as that which tends to slacken the endeavours of the diligent, and which hinders them from doing their utmost to purge themselves in this life, since another purgation is expected after it.</hi> Is not this plain enough for their denyal of any state of <hi>purgation</hi> after this life, by which men might satisfie for the temporary punishment of sin, and be translated out of that state to the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> And thence, although in the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Vnion</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. at the concluding the <hi>Florentine Council,</hi> no more was concluded, <hi>than that those penitents who departed this life, before they had satisfied for their former sins by worthy fruits of pennance, should have their souls purged after death,</hi> poenis purgatoriis, <hi>with purgatory punishments,</hi> yet <hi>Marcus Eugenicus</hi> utterly refused to subscribe it thus; which certainly he would never have done if all the Controversie had been only, <hi>Whether the fire were real or metaphorical.</hi> And the whole <hi>Greek Church</hi> utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused those terms of union,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and therefore <hi>Alphonsus √† Castro</hi> recounts the denying <hi>Purgatory</hi> among the errours of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> indeed do not believe that any souls enjoy the <hi>beatifical Vision</hi> before the day of Judgement, and on that account they allow of <hi>prayer for the dead,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with any respect to a deliverance of souls out of <hi>purgatory,</hi> but to the participation of their happiness at the <hi>great Day.</hi> But there is a great deal of difference between this Opinion, and that of your <hi>Church</hi>; for they believe all souls of believers to be in expectation of the <hi>final Judgement</hi> but without any temporary punishment for sin, or any release from that punishment by the <hi>prayers of the living,</hi> which your <hi>Church</hi> asserts; and is the proper <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi> concerning <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Which is not, Whether there be any <hi>middle state</hi> wherein the souls of the Faithful may continue in expectation of the <hi>final consummation</hi> of their happiness at the <hi>great day</hi>; nor, Whether it be lawful in that sense for the <hi>Church</hi> on earth to

               <p>Which we may the easier believe, since there are so many among your selves,<note place="margin">¬ß. 4.</note> who do not think themselves obliged to own this Doctrine of your <hi>Church</hi> concerning <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Nay, we have not only the confession of several of your party, that your Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> was not known in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> as <hi>Alphonsus √† Castro, Roffensis, Polydore, &amp;c.</hi> and of others, that it cannot be sufficiently proved from <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Petrus √¢ Soto, Perionius, Bulenger,</hi> whose testimonies are produced by others; but there are some persons of note among you, who have expresly denied the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self, and confuted the pretended reasons which are given for it. <hi>Petrus Picherellus,</hi>

                     <hi>Punitio ergo in Purgatorio est res in opinione human√¢ posita: quae nec ex Scripturis nec Patribus, nec Conciliis deduci potest firmiter: Immo, (salvo meliori judicio) opposita sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia eis conformior videtur.</hi> Barns Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholico.

                  <hi>That the punishment of souls in Purgatory, is a thing which lyes meerly in humane opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which cannot be firmly deduced from Scriptures, Fathers, or Councils.

How comes that Authour not to be answered, and his reasons satisfied? But if you be not agreed among your selves, What this <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is, you are most unreasonable men, to tell us, We are as much bound to believe it as the <hi>Trinity, or Incarnation.</hi> We ask you, What it is we are bound to believe? You tell us, according to the sense of your <hi>Church, The punishment of souls in a future state, out of which they may be delivered by the prayers of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and translated into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; Another he denies all this, and saith, We are in effect only bound to believe, That faithful <hi>souls</hi> do not enjoy their full happiness till the <hi>resurrection,</hi> and that there is no deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at all out of any state in which mens souls are after death, till the day of Judgement; and that the prayers of the <hi>Church,</hi> only respect that <hi>Day</hi>; but that the former Doctrine is so far from being an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that it is contrary to <hi>Scripture, Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> If such a state of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation wherein faithful souls are at rest (but according to different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of grace which they had at their departure hence, and look for the

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Nothing ought to be looked on as an Article of Faith among the Fathers, but what they declare, that they believe on the account of Divine Revelation.</hi> As to all other things which they assert, we may look on them as <hi>private opinions</hi> of <hi>particular persons,</hi> but not as such things which were received as <hi>Articles of Faith.</hi> For whatsoever is received as such, it must be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the account of <hi>Gods revealing</hi> it, who only can oblige us to believe with that assent which is required to <hi>Faith.</hi> And if it be so as to all other things, much more certainly as to the <hi>future state</hi> of <hi>souls,</hi> of which we can know nothing certainly without <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> For since the <hi>remission</hi> of <hi>sins,</hi> and the <hi>happiness</hi> of the <hi>future life,</hi> depend upon the <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we can define nothing as to these things any further then <hi>God</hi> hath declared them. If <hi>God</hi> hath declared that <hi>remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of <hi>sins</hi> lyes in the taking away the <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>punishment,</hi> it will be a contradiction to say, That he pardons those whom he exacts the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin from, purely to satisfie his <hi>justice</hi>; if he hath declared, that the <hi>souls</hi> of the faithful are in joy and felicity assoon as they are delivered out of this sinful world, it is impossible they should undergo <hi>unsufferable pains,</hi> though not to <hi>eternity.</hi> I dispute not now, Whether he hath so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed these things, but that it is impossible for any thing to be looked on as an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but what hath clear <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> for it. And therefore, although many testimonies of the <hi>Fathers</hi> might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one way or other, as to these things; when they speak only their own fancies and imaginations, and not what <hi>God</hi> hath revealed, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, all put together, make the opinion they assert to be an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> Nothing is more apparent, then that the <hi>itching curiosity</hi> of humane nature to know more then <hi>God</hi> hath revealed, concerning the future state of souls, did betimes discover it self in the <hi>Church.</hi> But the strange diversity of these <hi>Imaginations</hi> were a sufficient evidence, that they speak not by any <hi>certain rule,</hi> but according to their different <hi>fancies</hi>; and therefore that they did not deliver any Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> but only their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinions. If you would therefore prove, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> did own <hi>Purgatory</hi> as an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> you must not think it enough to prove, that one or two of the <hi>Fathers</hi> did speak something tending to it, but that
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:101069:331"/>
all who had occasion to mention it, did speak of it as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and that which came from an immediate <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is no reason, That should be looked on as an Article of Faith, which, they who seemed to assert it most, did build on such places, which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themselves to be very obscure.</hi> For since they deduced it from <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> it is apparent that they did not believe it on the account of any <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written word,</hi> or <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> conveyed meerly by <hi>Tradition</hi>; and since they confess the places to be very <hi>difficult,</hi> it is unreasonable to judge, that they looked on that as a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> which they supposed was contained in them. As for instance, St. <hi>Austin</hi> in several places asserts, that all things necessary to be believed are clearly revealed in <hi>Scripture</hi>; and withall he sayes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de fide &amp; oper. c.</hi> 15, 16.</note> that the place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. <hi>is very difficult and obscure,</hi> and that it is one of those places in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith are hard to be understood; and therefore it is not conceivable that S. <hi>Austin</hi> should make any thing a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which he founds upon this place. And this is the great and almost only considerable Place, which he or the rest of the <hi>Fathers</hi> did insist on, as to the nature of that <hi>purgation</hi> which was to be in a future state.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That cannot be looked on as an Article of Faith to such persons, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their own doubts concerning the truth of it.</hi> For whatever is owned as an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> by any person, is thereby acknowledged to be <hi>firmly believed</hi> by him. Now upon our enquiry into the <hi>Fathers</hi> we shall find, the first person who seemed to assert that any faithful <hi>souls</hi> passed through a <hi>fire of purgation before the day of judgement,</hi> was St. <hi>Austin:</hi> but he delivers his judgement with so much fear and hesitancy, that any one may easily see that he was far from making it any Article of Faith. We must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider then, that in St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s time, there were many, who though they denied <hi>Origen</hi>'s opinion as to the <hi>Salvation</hi> at last of all <hi>persons</hi>; yet were very willing to believe it, as to all those who died in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that though they passed through the <hi>flames</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> for their sins, yet at last they should be saved; and for this they mainly insisted on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. where it is said, <hi>That some should be saved, but as by fire. Such,</hi> say they, <hi>build upon the foundation gold, silver, pretious stones, who to their Faith add good works: but they, hay, wood, and stubble, whose life is contrary to their Faith; and yet these latter, they asserted should come to Heaven at last, but they must undergo the torments of Hell first.</hi> Against these St. <hi>Austin</hi> writes his book <hi>de fide &amp; operibus,</hi> wherein he proves that such <hi>as live in sin shall be finally excluded the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; And when he comes to the interpretation of that place, he gives this account of it, That those who do so love <hi>Christ,</hi> as rather to part with all things for him than to lose him, but yet have too great a love to the things of the world, shall suffer grief and loss on that account. <hi>Sive ergo in h√¢c vit√¢ tantum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ista patiuntur,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. de fide &amp; oper. c.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>sive etiam post hanc vitam talia quaedam judicia subsequun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; non abhorret, quantum arbitror, √† ratione veritatis iste intellectus hujus sententiae. Whether,</hi> saith he, <hi>men suffer these things in this life, or such judgements follow after it; I suppose this sense of S.</hi> Paul<hi>'s meaning is not dissonant from truth.</hi> So far was he from being certain of it, that he puts in, <hi>quantum arbitror,</hi> as far as I suppose; and yet he would not define, whether that loss which they were to suffer were only in <hi>this life</hi> or no. And, in his <hi>Enchiridion</hi> to <hi>Laurentius,</hi> where he disputes the very same matter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Enchirid. c.</hi> 69.</note> he saith, <hi>Tale aliquid post hanc vitam fieri incredibile non est; &amp; utrum ita sit quaeri potest, &amp; aut inveniri aut latere, Nonnullos fideles per ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:101069:331"/>
quendam purgatorium, quanto magis minusve bona pereuntia dilexerunt, tanto tardius citiusve salvari. It is not incredible that such a thing should be after this life, and it may be enquired after whether it be found to be so or no, that some faithful souls pass through a purging fire, and are saved sooner or later according to the degree of their affection to worldly things.</hi> Will any man in his wits think that St. <hi>Austin</hi> spake this of any <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> or that was generally received in the <hi>Church</hi> as an <hi>Apostolical Tradition?</hi> Did he ever speak so concerning the <hi>Trinity</hi> or the <hi>Incarnation of Christ</hi> which you parallel with <hi>Purgatory?</hi> What would men have thought of him, if he had said of either of those Articles, <hi>It is not incredible they may be true,</hi> and <hi>it may be enquired into whether they be or no?</hi> Whatever then St. <hi>Austins</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion was, we see he delivers it modestly and doubtfully, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding it as an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Apostolical Tradition if any be.</hi> And the very same he repeats in his Answer to the first <hi>Question</hi> of <hi>Dulcitius</hi>; so that this was all that ever he asserted as to this Controversie. What you offer to the contrary from other places of St. <hi>Austin</hi> shall be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its due place.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Where any of the Fathers build any Doctrine upon the sense of doubtful places of Scripture, we have no further reason to believe that Doctrine, then we have to believe that it is the meaning of those places.</hi> So that in this case the enquiry is taken off from the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and fixed upon the sense of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which they and we both rely upon. For since they pretend themselves to no greater evidence of the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> then such places do afford: it is the greatest reason that the argument to perswade us be not the testimony of the <hi>Father,</hi> but the evidence of the place it self. Unless it be evident some other way, that there was an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>Tradition</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times concerning it, and that the only design of the <hi>Father</hi> was, to apply some particular place to it. But then such a <hi>Tradition</hi> must be cleared from something else, besides the sense of some ambiguous places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that <hi>Tradition</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to be <hi>Vniversal</hi> both as to time and place.</p>
               <p>These things being premised,<note place="margin">¬ß. 6.</note> I now come particularly to examine the evidence you bring, <hi>That all the Fathers both Greek and Latin did constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach Purgatory from the Apostles times, and consequently that it must be held for an Apostolical Tradition or nothing can be.</hi> And as you follow <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> in your way of proving it, so must I follow you; and he divides his proofs you say into two ranks. First, <hi>Such who affirm prayer for the dead.</hi> 2. <hi>Such who in the successive ages of the Church did expresly affirm Purgatory.</hi> First, with those <hi>who affirm prayer for the dead;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 306.</note> 
                  <hi>Which</hi> (you say) <hi>doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily infer Purgatory, whatever the Bishop vainly insinuates to the contrary.</hi> The <hi>Question</hi> then between us is, Whether that <hi>prayer</hi> for the <hi>dead</hi> which was used in the <hi>ancient Church,</hi> doth necessarily inferr that <hi>Purgatory</hi> was then acknowledged? This you affirm; for, say you, <hi>If there were no other place, or condition of being for departed souls, but either Heaven or Hell, surely it were a vain thing to pray for the dead; especially to pray for the remission of their sins, or for their refreshment, ease, rest, relaxation of their pains, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients most frequently do. From whence,</hi> you add, <hi>that Purgatory is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyably proved, that the Relator finding nothing himself sufficient to Answer, was forced to put us off to the late Primate of</hi> Armagh<hi>'s Answer to the Jesuits Challenge.</hi> Which, you say, <hi>You have perused, and find only there, that the Authour proves that which none of you deny,</hi> viz. <hi>That the prayers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorations used for the dead had reference to more souls than those in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:101069:332"/>
But,</hi> you attempt to prove, <hi>That the nature and kind of those prayers do imply that they were intended for other ends, than meerly that the body might be glorified as well as the soul, and to praise God for the final happy end of the deceased: Whereas that Answerer of the Jesuite would,</hi> you say, <hi>by his allegations insinuate to the Reader a conceit, that it was used only for those two reasons and no other; Which,</hi> you say, <hi>you must needs avouch to be most loudly untrue, and so manifestly contrary to the Doctrine and practise of the Fathers as nothing can be more.</hi> A high charge against two most <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend</hi> and <hi>learned Primates</hi> together: against the one, <hi>as not being able to Answer, and therefore turning it off to the other</hi>; against the other, <hi>for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing most loud untruths, instead of giving a true account of the grounds of the Churches practise.</hi> It seems, you thought it not honour enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one, unless you led the other in triumph also; but you do neither of them, but only in your own fancy and imagination. And never had you less cause to give out such big words then here, unless it were to amuse the spectatours that they might not see how you fall before them. For it was not the least distrust of his sufficiency to Answer, which made his Lordship to put it oft to the <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Armagh,</hi> but because he was prevented in it by him, <hi>Who,</hi> (as he truly saith) <hi>had very learnedly and at large set down other reasons which the Ancients gave for prayer for the dead without any intention to free them from Purgatory.</hi> Which are not only different from, but inconsistent with, the belief of <hi>Purgatory</hi>; for the clearing of which, and vindicating my <hi>Lord Primate</hi> from your calumnies rather then answers, it will be necessary to give a brief account of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on that subject.<note place="margin">Answer to the Jesuits chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <hi>p.</hi> 195.</note> He tells us therefore at first, That we are here prudently to distinguish the <hi>Original institution of the Church,</hi> from the <hi>private opinions</hi> of <hi>particular Doctors,</hi> which waded further herein then the general intendment of the <hi>Church</hi> did give them warrant. Now he evidently proves that the <hi>memorials, oblations,</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> made for the <hi>dead</hi> at the beginning had reference to such as rested from their <hi>labours,</hi> and not unto any souls which were thought to be tormented in that <hi>Vto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Purgatory,</hi> whereof there was no news stirring in those dayes. This he gathers first by the practise of the ancient <hi>Christians</hi> laid down by the Authour of the <hi>Commentaries</hi> on <hi>Job,</hi> who saith, The memorials of the <hi>Saints</hi> were observed as a memorial of rest to the souls departed, and that they therein rejoyced for their <hi>refreshing.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, they offered Sacrifices for them, whom he acknowledgeth to have received of the Lord <hi>Palms</hi> and <hi>Crowns</hi>; and in the Authour of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Hierarchy,</hi> the party deceased is described by him to have departed this life <hi>replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Divine joy, as now not fearing any change to worse, being come unto the end of all his labours, and publickly pronounced to be a happy man, and admitted into the society of the Saints</hi>; and yet the <hi>Bishop</hi> prayes, that <hi>God would forgive him all his sins he had committed through humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and bring him into the light and band of the living, into the bosoms of</hi> Abraham, Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>into the place from whence pain, and sorrow, and sighing flyeth.</hi> And Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> shews that the funeral Ordinances of the <hi>Church</hi> were appointed to admonish the living, that the parties deceased were <hi>in a state of joy and not of grief</hi>; and therefore they sung at the <hi>Burial, Return my soul to thy rest, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.</hi> And this he proves likewise from the <hi>Ancient Liturgies,</hi> wherein prayers are made for all <hi>Saints, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs,</hi> and others. And S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> after
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:101069:332"/>
he had said, <hi>That</hi> Valentinian <hi>and</hi> Gratian <hi>were both blessed, and enjoyed the pleasures of everlasting life</hi>; and yet subjoyns his <hi>Orizons</hi> for them. Thus he prayes for <hi>Theodosius, of whom he had said, That he enjoyes everlasting light, and continual tranquillity:</hi> And so for his Brother <hi>Satyrus,</hi> when he had pronounced of him before, <hi>That he had entred into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The same doth <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> for his Brother <hi>Caesarius.</hi> Now, Is it possible you should think that Prayer for the <hi>Dead,</hi> as used in the the Ancient <hi>Church,</hi> doth necessarily inferr <hi>Purgatory</hi>; when they who made these <hi>Prayers,</hi> did suppose the persons they made them for, to be at <hi>rest,</hi> and in <hi>joy,</hi> and in the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> And I hope that is a different state from that of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Therefore you see, it is not barely proved, that some different accounts are given of <hi>Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> but such as are exclusive of it, and those such as appear from the eldest times of the <hi>Church,</hi> when such Prayers were used. Now, having thus shewed, for whom these <hi>Prayers</hi> were made, he proceeds to shew, of what kinds they were, <hi>whereof,</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">P. 204.</note> 
                  <hi>some were Eucharistical</hi> for the blessed estate of the party deceased; others <hi>deprecatory,</hi> and <hi>petitory,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> would forgive him <hi>his sins,</hi> keep him from <hi>Hell,</hi> and place him in the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi>: which, though at first well meant, were turned to an ill use afterwards, when these <hi>intercessions</hi> began once to be applied not only to the good, but evil livers also, unto whom by the first Institution they were never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And he at large proves by very many examples,<note place="margin">P. 224.</note> that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Intention of the <hi>Church</hi> in her supplications for the Dead, was, That the whole man (not the soul separated only) might receive <hi>publick remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of <hi>sins,</hi> and a solemn acquittal in the judgement of that great Day, and so obtain both a full escape from all the consequences of sin, and a perfect consummation of bliss and happiness. And of this nature he shews af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards were the Prayers of the <hi>Church</hi> used in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his time, which <hi>A√´rius</hi> was condemned for rejecting of; and he plainly proves,<note place="margin">P 265.</note> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> comes nearer the Opinion of <hi>A√´rius,</hi> than they would seem to do. For they agree with <hi>A√´rius,</hi> in rejecting that kind of praying and offering for the Dead, which was used in the <hi>Church</hi> at that time; which was for such as were believed to be in bliss. For, since the <hi>Romanists</hi> say, That without the supposition of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> Prayer for the Dead would be unprofitable, and at that time the souls they prayed for, are supposed to be already in <hi>bliss</hi>; therefore they do as much condemn those Prayers for the <hi>Dead,</hi> which were then used, as <hi>A√´rius</hi> did. And it is very strange, if the releasing of <hi>souls</hi> out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> had been any ground then of <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Dead,</hi> that <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> among all his far-fetcht Reasons, should never assign that, which you think to be the only proper ground of such Prayers. Thus we see, what was the general Intention of the Church in those Prayers which were made for the Dead, and how far this was from inferring <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides this,<note place="margin">¬ß. 7.</note> there were several <hi>particular Opinions</hi> among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Fathers</hi> touching the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>souls separated</hi> from their <hi>bodies</hi>:<note place="margin">P. 229<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </note> and according to the several apprehensions which they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they made different interpretations and applications of the <hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>praying</hi> for the <hi>Dead</hi>; whose particular intentions and devotions in that kind, must of necessity therefore be distinguished from the general inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole <hi>Church.</hi> Thus there were two Opinions much in <hi>vogue</hi> among many of the <hi>Fathers, viz. of souls being kept in secret receptacles till the day of resurrection,</hi> and the <hi>purging of them in the fire of conflagration at
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:101069:333"/>
the day of judgement</hi>; of which Opinion were not only S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> but <hi>Origen, Lactantius,</hi> S. <hi>Hilary.</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and others. Now according to these Opinions they interpreted the <hi>Vse</hi> of <hi>praying</hi> for the <hi>Dead.</hi> And thence S. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith,<note place="margin">P. 207.</note> 
                  <hi>That the oblations and alms usually offered in the Church for all the Dead that received Baptism, were thanksgivings for such as were very good, propitiations for such as were not very bad; but as for such as were very evil, although they were no helps of the Dead, yet were they some kind of consolations of the Living</hi>; but this was only a private exposition of the <hi>Churches</hi> meaning in her Prayers, because it is not to be found in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the former <hi>Fathers</hi>; and, because it suiteth not well with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice of the <hi>Church,</hi> which it intendeth to interpret. For it is somewhat too harsh an interpretation, to imagine that one and the same act of praying, should be a petition for some, and for others only a thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Some other private Opinions there were besides these, as that of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> That <hi>God did not alwaies cast grievous sinners into Hell, but that the Prayers of the Church might keep them from being cast into Hell</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 241.</note> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That an augmentation of Glory might be procured for the Saints,</hi> and either a total deliverance, or a diminution of torment at least, obtained for the wicked;<note place="margin">P. 243.</note> to which S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and others incline. Besides, there were different Opinions concerning the benefit which the Dead received; by the Prayers of the Living. For the Authour of the Questions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers in <hi>Justin Martyrs work's, Gregory Nazianzen, Theodoret, Diodorus Tarsensis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 270.</note> and S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> all conclude that there is no release to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for the sins of those who were dead. But others supposed, the <hi>Dead</hi> might receive profit by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Living,</hi> either for be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of their <hi>sins,</hi> or the <hi>ceasing</hi> of their <hi>punishment</hi>; but they were not agreed as to the nature of the <hi>sins,</hi> which might be pardoned, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the benefit which they received, whether their punishment were only lessened, or at last extinguished. And <hi>Stephanus Gobarus</hi> in <hi>Photius,</hi> tells us, That though some held these things, yet the true sentence of the <hi>Church</hi> was, <hi>That none at all was freed from punishment.</hi> But, that still this was a Question in the <hi>Church,</hi> Whether the Dead received profit by the Prayers of the Living, that <hi>learned Authour</hi> more at large proves; but my design is only to give a very brief extract of his discourse, that you may from thence see, how far, by the <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>praying for the Dead,</hi> you are from gathering the necessary belief of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by this a full Answer is given to what you object <hi>concerning the practice of the Fathers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>to pray for the soul, and not the body; and that when we pray for them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 361.</note> 
                  <hi>they receive ease, comfort, and refreshment by our Prayers, and that they obtain pardon, and mercy, and deliverance from pain for them, and that by the help of our Prayers they are brought to eternal rest and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> But all this falls short of your purpose, unless you can prove that any of them either believed or prayed that any such <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>refreshment</hi> were obtained by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Living</hi> before the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Resurrection.</hi> That they prayed, <hi>That God would have mercy upon them in that day,</hi> we deny not, which implies <hi>ease, comfort, refreshment, pardon, deliverance from pain,</hi> and <hi>eternal happiness</hi>; but then all this referrs not to any <hi>purgatory-pains,</hi> which they had undergone before, but those <hi>eternal pains</hi> which their sins deserved, if <hi>God</hi> should deal in justice with them.

day. For the Scriptures (as my <hi>Lord Primate</hi> truly saith) every where do point out, that <hi>great day</hi> to us, as the <hi>day</hi> wherein <hi>mercy and forgiveness, rest and refreshing, joy and gladness, redemption and salvation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Answ. p. 227.</note> 
                  <hi>rewards and Crowns,</hi> shall be bestowed upon all <hi>Gods Children,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.16.18. 1 Cor. 1.8. Act. 3.19. 2 Thes. 1.6, 7. Phil. 2.19. 1 Thes. 2.16. 1 Pet. 1.5. 1 Cor. 5.5. Ephes. 4.30. Luk. 21.28 2 Tim. 4.8. Luk. 14.14. From whence it is no improbable deduction, that even the <hi>souls</hi> of good men, do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their full and compleat felicity, till the great day: not that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sleep or undergo any <hi>Purgatory pains</hi>; but that they are at rest from their labours, and in a blessed condition, but still waiting with a solicitous expectation for the glorious Coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> that they may then receive the reward prepared for them before the beginning of the world. But, Whether those souls be in <hi>Heaven</hi> (as it notes a place, and not a state) whether the <hi>degrees</hi> of their <hi>happiness</hi> be proportionable (till the <hi>great day</hi>) to the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> which they had when they left the world, are Questions of more curiosity, than necessity to be resolved. But, as long as the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth insist so much on the proceedings of the great <hi>day,</hi> both as to rewards and punishments, we do not condemn the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> in those prayers which did thus respect the day of <hi>Resurrection.</hi> If any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> had any particular Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and of the benefit which came to them by the Prayers of the Living; we are no more concerned to defend them, than you are to defend those whom you acknowledge to hold, that no souls did enjoy the <hi>beatifical vision</hi> before the day of judgement, against whom <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> and others dispute at large. Since you therefore confess your selves that some of the greatest of the <hi>Fathers</hi> did for many ages hold erroneous Opinions crncerning the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> With what reason can you press us with the Testimonies of those whom you refuse your selves? And since they had so many different Opinions concerning the state of <hi>souls,</hi> it seems strange that none of them (at least till S. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s time) should hit upon such a state of <hi>Purgation,</hi> whereby they might be freed from pains before the day of judgement. And yet we find not one of them, which did so much as dream of that <hi>Purgatory</hi> which you call <hi>the upper Region of Hell</hi>; or of any punishment, which they who dyed in favour with God, should undergo between death and judgement, out of which they might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Prayers of the Living. Many of them indeed supposed that <hi>souls</hi> were kept in <hi>secret receptacles</hi>; but they were far from asserting that they underwent at all any pains equal to the <hi>damned,</hi> much less that any souls were translated thence to glory upon the <hi>intercessions</hi> made for them; others supposed that the <hi>souls</hi> of all good men were at last to pass thorow the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>conflagration</hi> at the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>judgement</hi>; others, that the souls of wicked men might either escape, or have their torments mitigated; but all this while your <hi>Purgatory</hi> was unthought of, and was not conceived till afterwards, through the <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>superstition</hi> of some, countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by pretended <hi>apparitions</hi> and <hi>visions</hi> of souls departed, till at last it grew to be one of the favourite-Opinions of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> From whence it may easily appear, how very much you were deceived, when you would inferre, because <hi>Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> as it is now used in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> doth necessarily suppose <hi>Purgatory</hi>; therefore it must do so in the <hi>Ancient Church:</hi> for, although we should grant the same <hi>Prayers</hi> to be still used, yet since they are used for a quite different intent, that may be supposed by you, which was not at all supposed by them, nor could be
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:101069:334"/>
inferred from what they did. And yet it is plain, that in some cases, you have changed the <hi>Prayers</hi> for the <hi>Saints,</hi> into <hi>Prayers</hi> to them: For, whereas in the old <hi>Gregorian Sacramentary,</hi> it was, <hi>Grant unto us O Lord, that this oblation may profit the soul of thy servant</hi> Leo;<note place="margin">Answer to the Jesuit. p. 210.</note> in the latter Books it is turned into this, <hi>Grant unto us O Lord, that by the intercession of thy servant</hi> Leo, <hi>this oblation may profit us.</hi> From whence you may see, that your Prayers are changed from what they were: For the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed universally for all <hi>Saints and Martyrs</hi>; but you think it a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them to <hi>pray</hi> for them; and therefore from your kind of Prayers for the Dead, we may well say, that <hi>Purgatory</hi> is supposed; but we cannot possibly inferr it from those <hi>Prayers</hi> which were made for such, who, if any, were supposed in a state of Bliss and happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 9.</note>And that the intention of your <hi>Church</hi> is quite different from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi> we now come more fully to make manifest; because none of them did believe that Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which you assert. But herein we must follow your footsteps, and consider the many authorities which you produce out of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> and undertake to vindicate in behalf of <hi>Purgatory</hi>; to which I give this general Answer, That some Authours are counterfeit, and the places supposititious; of those that are <hi>true,</hi> some speak only of <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and <hi>Oblations</hi> made for them; others respect the day of <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>Conflagration,</hi> others the <hi>purging</hi> of the <hi>wicked,</hi> others only of a <hi>purgation</hi> in this life; but none of them all speak of any <hi>Purgatory pains</hi> of those who dye in favour with <hi>God,</hi> which they undergo as the <hi>temporal punishment of sin, from whence they may be delivered by the Prayers of the Living</hi>; which is the only thing you should prove from them. And this I come to make appear by the examination of the particulars, as they occurr in order.</p>
               <p>The first you begin with, is, <hi>Dionysius Areopagita</hi>; and, <hi>Is not he,</hi> say you,<note place="margin">P. 361.</note> 
                  <hi>an Authour of the first three hundred years?</hi> As though this had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been questioned by any? If you had asked, Whether he had been an Ancient and Learned Authour, living sometime within the first four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; you should not have met with any opposition from me. But if you will needs have him to be the true <hi>Dionysius,</hi> you must prove it better than by meer referring us to what <hi>Bellarmin, Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Del-Rio</hi> have said upon that subject; and you are very strangely deceived when you say, <hi>That only</hi> Erasmus, <hi>and</hi> Valla, <hi>and some few others, did doubt of it; but at present you suppose few learned men doubt of the matter.</hi> For, even <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> himself doubts of it; and, What think you of <hi>Habertus, Sirmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Confirm. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Launaeus, Petavius?</hi> Are not all these with you learned men, who have all declared their doubts of it? and so will any one else do, that impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially examines the Arguments brought on both sides. But we have no reason to insist longer upon this, since you say, <hi>It is sufficient that he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for a Writer of great Antiquity</hi>; Well, But what is it then this Authour saith? only that <hi>Prayers were made for the deceased party, that God would forgive his sins, and place him in the Light and Country of the Living: But,</hi> say you, <hi>both the Arch-Bishop and Primate would have thought that man a Papist, who would have made the like prayer for his deceased friend in their hearing.</hi> And very good reason they might have to think so, when they know beforehand that your intention of praying for the <hi>Dead,</hi> is, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their souls from the pains of purgatory; but, if they had heard one use such a Prayer in the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> they could not have imagined, it was for any such intention, since the same person in <hi>Dionysius</hi> is said to be <hi>reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:101069:334"/>
with divine joy, and not fearing any change to the worse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dionys. Areop. de Eccles. Hier. cap.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>but knowing well that the good things possessed, shall be firmly and everlastingly enjoyed</hi>; as he speaks at his entrance upon that discourse: And, <hi>if this be in effect to teach Purgatory,</hi> as you would have it, you must set your <hi>Purgatory</hi> a great deal higher than you do; for, you say, It is but an <hi>upper Region of Hell</hi> a little after, when <hi>Dionysius</hi> speaks of those who were in a Region of rest and happiness.</p>
               <p>Your second Authour is <hi>Tertullian</hi>; and three Citations you produce out of him. In the first, he only mentions the <hi>oblations for the Dead,</hi> which we have confessed to be used already,<note place="margin">

Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. c.</hi> 3. <hi>De Monog. c.</hi> 10.</note> but without any respect to <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> In the second, a mention is made of begging of God <hi>refrigerium, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment for the soul of one departed:</hi> this were some thing to the purpose, if you had first proved, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> did suppose that soul to be then in the pains of <hi>Purgatory</hi>; for then it were but reason to think this <hi>refrigerium</hi> did relate to the easing of them. But he elsewhere tells us, what he means by this <hi>refrigerium, Sinus Abrahae interim refrigerium praebiturus est anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus justorum,</hi> by which he understands not any <hi>deliverance</hi> from <hi>pains,</hi> but contentment in expectation of the future <hi>Resurrection.</hi>

                     <hi>C.

And, since they supposed different degrees of <hi>refreshment</hi> which the souls had in the <hi>bosom</hi> of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> this prayer only notes the desire of the continuance and increase of it, and not being under present pains for the want of it.</p>

               <p>The next place to be examined, is the noted one of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus</hi>:<note place="margin">¬ß. 10.</note> where he gives an account of the difference between the lapsed persons who become penitents, and the Martyrs. <hi>Aliud est ad veniam stare, aliud ad gloriam pervenire; aliud missum in carcerem non exire inde, donec solvat novissimum quadrantem; aliud statim fidei &amp; virtutis mercedem acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere;
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:101069:335"/>
aliud pro peccatis longo dolore emendari, &amp; purgari diu igne, aliud peccata omnia passione purg√¢sse. It is one thing to stay in hope and expectation of pardon, another thing to come presently to glory: 'tis one thing to be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prison, and not to come out thence, till you have paid the last farthing; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receive presently the reward of our Faith: 'tis one thing to be amended for sins by long grief, and to be purged with fire a great while; another to have purged away all his sins by suffering Martyrdom. Did not S.</hi> Cyprian, say you, <hi>think of Purgatory, when he taught this?</hi> No, that did he not, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your own Writers. For <hi>Rigaltius</hi> tells us, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> here speaks of the severities of <hi>pennance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rigalt. observ. ad Cypr. p.</hi> 68.</note> which the lapsed persons underwent in order to <hi>pardon</hi>; and compares them with the present <hi>felicity</hi> which <hi>Martyrs</hi> were possessed of. And this was that purging <hi>fire</hi> in order to their amendment, which he insists on, to shew what great disparity there was between the state of these <hi>penitents,</hi> and the <hi>Martyrs</hi>; thereby to shew, that though penitents were admitted by the <hi>Church,</hi> yet it was with so much severity, that might give little encouragement for men to fall in hopes of admission. For that was the main thing which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> there discourses of.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Albaspin. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> And thus likewise <hi>Albaspinaeus</hi> understands it, of such who suffered pennance all their life time, and were absolved only at the point of death; these were they who were <hi>held in prison till they paid the utmost farthing.</hi> Neither may it seem strange that this should be called a <hi>purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire</hi>;<note place="margin">

And this seems a great deal more probable to be S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s meaning, because he speaks most clearly of any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the immediate happiness of all <hi>Gods Children</hi> after death, in his excellent Book of <hi>mortality</hi>; wherein he comforts the <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> against the fears of death, by reason of the raging plague, which was then among them. <hi>It is for him,</hi> saith he, <hi>to fear death, that would not go to Christ; it is for him not to be willing to go to Christ, that doth not believe he shall begin to raign with him</hi>; with much more to the same purpose throughout that Book, which, I pray read, and then tell me, Whether St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did think of <hi>Purgatory</hi> or no.</p>

<pb n="652" facs="tcp:101069:336"/>
God would mingle Mercy with his Justice, and that after they had been sufficiently purged by fire they might escape at last.</hi> If he had intended only a mitigation of their <hi>torments</hi> who were <hi>Christians,</hi> the opposition could not lye as it doth, between the <hi>eternity</hi> of some, and the <hi>clemency</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in others, but the <hi>eternity</hi> must have been confessed in both, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position made only in the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>torments</hi> of such who were not <hi>Christians</hi> above such as were. If St. <hi>Hierome</hi> doth (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends) elsewhere contradict this, by so much the less is his testimony of any validity in this case, it being plain what his meaning is here; but that seems the less probable, because he writ his <hi>Books</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> in which he asserts the same, not long before his death. This <hi>purging fire</hi> then, of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> makes little for your purpose, since it is only a more refined branch of <hi>Origens Hypothesis,</hi> and is understood of a <hi>fire</hi> after the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and that of Hell, and not of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and wherein wicked men shall be purged if they dyed in the <hi>Churches Communion,</hi> and not such who repented of their sins in this life. But if St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himself do not speak to the purpose, you hope one under his name may do it (and we must needs say <hi>Purgatory</hi> hath been alwayes beholding to <hi>forgeries</hi>) for you cite his <hi>Commentaries on the Proverbs,</hi> which are rejected as counterfeit by <hi>Sixtus Senensis, Canus, Marianus Victorius,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>But from St. <hi>Hierome</hi> we proceed to St. <hi>Basil, who,</hi> you say, <hi>teaches the same Doctrine with him</hi>;<note place="margin">¬ß. 12.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 365.</note> if he doth, it is very little for your comfort. But so far was St. <hi>Basil</hi> from asserting your Doctrine, that although he speaks of a <hi>purging fire,</hi> he speaks not at all concerning it in another <hi>life,</hi> but only of that which purgeth out <hi>sins</hi> in the <hi>souls</hi> of men in this life.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Comment. in Isa.</hi> 9.</note> For he calls the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> working upon mens souls, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
                  </gap>, which <hi>consumes sin</hi> within them; as may be seen by comparing his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on the sixth and the ninth of <hi>Isaiah</hi> together. And where he afterwards speaks not of an utter <hi>rejection,</hi> but an <hi>expurgation</hi> as by <hi>fire</hi>; it is plain that he understands it of the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>affliction</hi> in this life, and not the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>Purgatory</hi> in another. But where ever you meet with <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>purging,</hi> you think it impossible to be understood of any thing but your <hi>Purgatory</hi>; it seems you are hugely possessed with the fears of it, that you think you meet with it, where ever you go. But if you will needs have St. <hi>Basil</hi> to speak of a future state,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>P.</hi> 367.</note> but no such place, as yet appears in any edition of <hi>Theodoret.</hi> And the same <hi>Greeks</hi> tell you, if you consulted the honour of <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> you would
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:101069:336"/>
spare him too, because he was a favourer of the <hi>Origenical Hypothesis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>redintegration</hi> of all things; and so many places are produced out of him wherein he makes the nature of all pains to be Purgatory, that the <hi>Patriarch Germanus</hi> (of whom <hi>Photius</hi> speaks) had no other way to vindicate him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Biblioth. Cod.</hi> 233.</note> but by saying that the <hi>Origenists</hi> had foisted many places into his works. If you will therefore say, <hi>That it is a groundless calumny, to say that any of the Fathers did corrupt the Christian Doctrine by the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of</hi> Plato; you must either deny that <hi>Origen</hi> and his followers ever asserted any Doctrine contrary to <hi>Christianity,</hi> and therein contradict the fifth <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi>; or that any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> had any touch of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen's</hi> opinion: both which I suppose are tasks you will be unwilling to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake. But whether their opinions are true or false (which we are not now enquiring after) to be sure they are far enough from your Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which supposeth the Sin pardoned in this life, and yet the <hi>punishment</hi> undergone for it in another: which Doctrine if it were granted at all reasonable, it would be much more, asserting it to be after the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> when the body might endure pains as well as the soul, than so absurdly as you make the <hi>soul</hi> only to suffer, and that too in a way the most unlikely of all other, <hi>viz.</hi> by a <hi>material fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is time we come to the succour of St. <hi>Austin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">¬ß. 13.</note> who it seems hath his share of <hi>Purgatory</hi> in this life; for, you say,<note place="margin">P. 368.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath the ill hap to be used the worst of all other.</hi> Because his Lordship represents him as <hi>dubious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi> (as no doubt he was) in this point: which argues indeed that he was a <hi>Novice</hi> in your <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> but thereby the more a <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But you are the man, that, let St. <hi>Augustin</hi> say what he will him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, will prove to his face, that he could not possibly be thought to deny or doubt of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> And it is a Combat worth seeing, to see you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute against St. <hi>Augustin</hi>; but you do it so pittifully, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains as uncertain as ever he was. The only place which seems to the purpose, <hi>Constat animas purgari post hanc vitam, &amp;c.</hi> is so notorious a counterfeit, that not only <hi>Vives</hi> confesses, no such words appeared in the ancient Copies; but they are wholly left out, not only in the <hi>Basil Edition</hi> 1556. but in that of <hi>Lyons</hi> 1560. and in the later <hi>Lovain</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The other places, you confess your self, relate to the benefit which the dead receive by the prayers of the living, of which a large account hath been already given without any supposition of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Whether St. <hi>Austins</hi> doubts did referr only to the circumstances of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and not to the thing it self, I leave it to the consideration of any reasonable man, who will read the places already cited, wherein those doubts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. By which one may see at what rate you use your expressions, when you can have the face to say, <hi>That S.</hi> Austin <hi>no less constantly teaches the Doctrine of Purgatory, than he doth the Doctrine of Heaven and Hell.</hi> Which after the language of the <hi>Sorbon</hi>-Censures, is a <hi>false, rash,</hi> and <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous assertion,</hi> and as ungrounded as <hi>Purgatory</hi> it self. The remaining testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> and St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> only speak of <hi>prayer</hi> for the <hi>dead,</hi> and the benefit of that, and so offers nothing new to our consideration. But at last we are come to a man who did in good earnest believe <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and was the first of any name in the <hi>Church</hi> who did so, and that is <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> 1. But whosoever reads in his <hi>Dialogues</hi> the excellent arguments he builds it on, and confirms it with, will find as much reason to pitty his <hi>superstition</hi> and <hi>credulity,</hi> as to condemn his <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And <hi>after this time,</hi> his Lordship saith truly, <hi>Purgatory was found too warm a business to be
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:101069:337"/>
suffer'd to cool again; and in the after-ages more were frighted, then led by proof into the belief of it.</hi> And although amidst the variety of judgements among the <hi>Fathers</hi> concerning the state of the dead, not one of them affirmed your Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> before <hi>Gregory</hi> 1; yet by all means you will needs have it to have been still owned as an <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> and an <hi>Article of Faith.</hi> But I commend you, that knowing the weakness of the arguments brought from the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> you at last take <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in the <hi>Churches Definition</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 372.</note> on the account of which you say, <hi>We are as much bound to believe it as any other Article of Faith, yea as the Trinity or Incarnation it self.</hi> But this holds for none, but only those who so little understand the grounds of their <hi>Religion</hi> as to believe it on the account of your <hi>Churches Infallibility</hi>; which is so far from being any ground of <hi>Faith,</hi> that if we had nothing more certain then that, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish our <hi>Faith</hi> upon, you would be so far from making men believe <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi> on that account, that you would sooner make them question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were either <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell.</hi> But though your <hi>Church</hi> be so far from <hi>Infallibility</hi> that we have found her guilty of many Errours, yet the <hi>Word of God abideth for ever,</hi> which alone is the sure Foundation for our <hi>Faith</hi> to rest upon. And so I conclude with your own <hi>Prayer: I beseech God to give all men light to see this Truth, and Grace to assent unto it; to the end, that by living in the militant Church in the Vnity of Faith, we may come at last to meet in Glory in the triumphant Church of Heaven, which we may hope for by the merits of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory world without end.</hi>
