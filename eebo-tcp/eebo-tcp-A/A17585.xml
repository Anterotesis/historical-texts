            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WAS there ever any Realme since Christs Incarnation professed Christian religion so universally through all the parts thereof, even to the utmost corners, in such puritie, both for doctrine, discipline, and publick worship, with such libertie, and for so many yeares together, as our realme hath done? In the Apostles dayes we read not of whole cities, let be kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es, to have professed the name of Christ. Soone after the departure of the Apostles, sundrie corruptions entred into the Church, and the mysterie of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which was working under ground in their time, was advanced by little and little, till it came to the full ripenesse. Neither was there any Nation free from the open profession of Paganisme the first 300 years. Since <hi>Constantines</hi> time, that Christianitie began to prevaile above Gentilisme, there hath been no Church, which hath not been defiled with much superstition, &amp; corrupted with many errors, till the dayes of late Reformation. From the first time of reformation to this houre, no reformed Church hath spred it self so universally through any Kingdome, with such puritie of profession, but either their profession is not so universall, being intermingled with <hi>Papists, Anabaptists, Lutherians,</hi> or not so poore, as in our neighbour Church.</p>

            <head>II.</head>
            <p>WAS there ever any Nation which sealed their profession with Oaths, Covenants and Subscriptions, so universally, and so oft, as our Church hath done? How often hath the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, called the Kings Confession been subscribed by persons of all Estates through the Realme, or by particular persons from time to time, as occasion was offred to require their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription? A more fearfull oath cannot be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then is taken in the end of that Confession, in these words: <hi>Promising and swearing by the great name of the Lord our God, That we shall continue in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the doctrine and discipline of this Church, &amp; shall defend the same according to our vocation and power, all the dayes of our lives, under the paines conteined in the Law and danger both of Body and Soule, in the day of Gods fearfull judgement.</hi> This is the Promissorie oath. The Assertorie oath, where upon it is grounded, is this: We, therefore willing to take away all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition of hypocrisie, and of such double dealing with God, and his Church, protest and call the <hi>Searcher of all hearts for witnesse,</hi> That our mindes and hearts do fully agree with this our Confession, Promise, Oath, and Subscription. So that we are not moved for any worldly respect, but are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded only in our consciences, through the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and love of Gods true Religion, printed in our hearts by the holy Spirit, as we shall answere to him in the day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed. To underly the paines conteined in the Law, and danger both of Body and Soule
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18918:3"/>
in the day of Gods fearful judgement, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to him in the day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, are not lightlie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, but to be pondered deeply, and ever to be remembred, specially when we have to do with this our Confession.</p>

            <p>I Appeale to every mans conscience, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have adhered to all the generall and particular clauses of this our Confession, or not? When we say in this Confession, that we detest and abhor the Antichrist, his five bastard Sacraments, with all his Rites, Ceremonies, and false Doctrine added to the ministration of the true Sacraments, without the word of God, his cruell judgement against Infants departing without the Sacrament, his absolute necessity of baptizing: do we not protest that we will abhor and detest, confirmation one of the five bastard Sacraments, kneeling, which is a Rite added to the ministration of the Supper, without the warrand of Gods Word, and invented by the Antichrist, private Baptisme, which is grounded upon the necessity of baptisme and doubting of the Salvation of all Infants dying unbaptized; When we protest we abhorre and detest his dedicating of dayes, do we not condemn observation of aniversary holy dayes? And when wee protest wee detest and abhor not only his own worldly Monarchie, but also his wicked hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, Do we not condemne the degrees of Bishops and Archbishops? When wee say, we abhor and detest all contrarie religion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18918:4"/>
(to wit, to the former Confession mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned immediately before, and the Christian faith receaved, beleived, and defended by the Church of Scotland) but chiefly all kinde of Papistrie in generall, and particular heads, even as they are now damned and confuted by the word of God; and Kirk of Scotland. Doe wee not condemne Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Bishops, Holy dayes, kneeling, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, private Baptisme, seeing all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular heads were damned by our Church either in the former Confession, the first or second Book of Discipline, and Acts of generall Assemblies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said Confession was sworne to and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and if any preased to practise them after they were damned, the censures of the church was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them. Have we not of late failed in all these particulars, and consequently violated our oathes, promises, and subscriptions, underlying the danger both of body and soule in the day of Gods fearfull judgement, unlesse we repent, which we cannot seriouslie do, except we recover, so far as in us lyeth, what is lost, to the losse of any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thing whatsoever, to the spending of the least drop of our blood, and defend what is yet reserved whole and sound, with the same hazard? For what is that hazard or losse in comparison of all the paines conteined in the Law, and danger both of body and soule, in the day of Gods fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgement. Let no man deceive himselfe, thinkeing to deceave God with evasions and shifts. The Searcher of all hearts knoweth what was thy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18918:4"/>
meaning, when thou saydest. <hi>We call the Searcher of all hearts to witnesse, that our mindes and hearts do fully agree with this our Confession, Promise, Oath and Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And what was the meaning of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with which thou protested thou would not use double dealing, was too manifest both in practise, preaching, and the authentick Records aboue mentioned. And put the case the particular heads above specified, had been a matter indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, howbeit they were not so esteemed by our church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet who can deny but thus far at least was intended to eschew all occasions and provocations to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and superstition and therefore the oath, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in a matter indifferent, was lawfull, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, as long as they remaine occasions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to tyrannie, and corruption; yea, as long as the forbearance of them is not proved to be a sinne. For great regard should be had even to a rash oath if it be not or prove not unlawfull, for the reverence we ought to carry to the <hi>great name of God.</hi> Remember of the breach of the oath made unto the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi>

            <p>IOyning all the three former <hi>Quaeres</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I aske, If ever a Realme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Christian Religion so universally, in such puritie, with such Libertie, for so many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and sealing their profession with such solemne promises, oathes, and subscriptions (if there were any such to be found in any Historie) that did make such defection, as if they did, if the heavie judgement of God did not overtake them?

the consideration of our oathes, subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and solemne Covenants, I aske, If any of the Reformed Churches in any realme, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, professing the Gospell in the same puritie, and so many yeares, as we have done, hath made so great defection as many of us have done, Have they returned to their vomit, taken up that which they rejected and condemned, remaining still a reformed Church, and not overturned with force of armes? If not, then suppose we had never sealed our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession with such solemne seales, our defection is singular and our punishment will be examplarie, unlesse we repent, recover what is lost, and defend what remaineth uncorrupted.</p>

            <p>WHereunto doth this defection tend? Doth it not tend first to perfite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie with the English Church, then at last will it not end in full conformitie with the Romane Kirk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The intent of the first is professed by his Majestie in expresse termes extant in print: and therefore be not deceaved with the promises and protestations of our usurping and pretended Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats. As for example, They will say to you, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie careth neither for <hi>He Saint</hi> nor <hi>Shee Saint,</hi> but for dayes dedicat to Christ. They lie: For his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie observeth both he and She Saints dayes, as well as dayes dedicat to Christ. So howbeit you could digest both a Christmas Preaching &amp; a Christmas Pye, which once ye lothed, ye must and shall ere it be long, do as much for <hi>Saint Bartholomew, Virgin Mary</hi> the <hi>Innocents,</hi> &amp; all the rest of their Saints, &amp;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18918:5"/>
for five Ceremonies ye shall have fiftie, yea, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. All the Relicts of Rome, which are lying like stincking filth in their Church, shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us, the paterne of their altar, their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, their Hierachie, and Romish policie, shall be set up in our Church. This defection tendeth yet further, <hi>to wit,</hi> to conformitie with Rome. What meaneth the Bishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before his fifth Book, to exhort his Majestie to proceed as he hath alreadie begunne, to restore the Christian church to unitie: Papist, Lutherian, formalist, and Calvinist, must then be all reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, &amp; united in one. How I pray you are we united to the English Church? We must yeeld all to them, they would not yeeld any thing at all to us, no not a hoofe, sayd <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terberrie,</hi> neither are they urged to yeeld any thing unto us. But we are unmercifully dealt with to yeeld unto them. Shall we for conformitie with the Lutherian the next day except of his monstrous opinions, and other fond ceremonies, after the same manner, and the third year for reconciliation with Rome, drink of the diep of her abhominations? Or, how shall that great worke come to passe? neither <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>Rome</hi> giveth the least token of their comming towards us. Yea wee must play the fooles, and turne our face to them, and take our journey first to <hi>England,</hi> then to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> hath not ridden all the foordes of <hi>Tweed</hi> well, whatsoever is intended, this our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie will of it self tend in the end to full Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

For, suppose wee should give place to these disturbers of our church, who for their own gaine and glorie, have laide aside all respect to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the gaining of soules, and the well of their Brethren, yet Poperie should increase more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie, as it hath done in our neighbour Church.</p>

Chancelours and Officialls, and medling with the administration of civill Affaires, as best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming his Grandeur. This Bishop is not Pauls Bishop, nor yet the Bishop which was first erected in the Ancient Church; He differeth as far from him as the Consull in a Senate doth from a King or Monarch. So, seeing he is neither the divine, nor humane Bishop, He must be that Satanicall, brought in by the Antichrist. It were wearisome to goe through the calling and functions of their Suffraganes, Deanes, Canons and Prebanderies, Organists, Singing boyes, Pistlets, Gospellers, Preists, Deacons, who are halfe Priests: their Fasts, their Eawes, their Feast-dayes, their crossing, Kneeling, Bishopping, Houseling of the sicke, Baptisme by supposition; private Baptisme, copes, capes, Tipets, Surplices, Rochets, Churching of women, Marriage, toyes, Funerall rites, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures waried superstisiously at Service, the forme of their Prayers, and the rest of their Ceremonies. It sufficeth, that the best &amp; worthiest among them, hath continually pleaded against them, that they had never quyet possession in their own church: that they were disused in many Congregations in the latter years of Queen Elizabeth, of worthie memorie, till they got strength againe, immediatly after the Kings Coronation; that they are obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely by authoritie, not liked off by many of the Formalists themselves, who do temporise only, with a bad conscience, how shall wee then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to a church enthraled, and under bondage?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18918:7"/>
How many times have the Godlie among them put up their Prayers to God, and prefered petition to King and Parlament for the church policie of Scotland, and the libertie of that pure Profession, which we have enjoyed many years; and shall that our glorious Garland be stamped underfoot: The morning clouds which eclipsed the beginning of their Reformation remaine unscattered to this day: and shall they be suffred to come within our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon: Not in our morning, but after many years, at the noone tyde of our day, to obscure the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospell, which hath shined to us in as cleare and pure brightnesse, as ever to any nation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the charges which must be bestowed upon these idle functions, and supestitious Ceremonies; If the Abbeyes be recovered out of Noblemens hands, I perswade my selfe, they will eyther bee converted to the maintenance of Deanes, Canons and Prebendaries, Organs, Copes, and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull uses; orels in time be restored to the old Crowes to builde their nests in againe.</p>

            <p>IF there were a time of Conformitie to bee graunted, which wee will never graunt; yet, is this a fit time? when the reformed Churches abroad are in so great hazard, and some presently under the fiery tryall. When the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and all his adherents, hath resumed fresh courage to prosecute their bloudy designes, hoping wholy to extirpate true Religion out of Europe: is it time to conforme to them, to take on the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their profession?

            <p>IF the Antichristian governement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described, and the many supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be not matters of weight, but trifles; which they shall never be able to prove with sound and solid arguments, why are we persecuted for them? Is it a small matter to turne a Minister out of his Office, wherein hee hath served many years, to send him and his familie, wife &amp; children, to begge their Bread, so farre as in them lyeth. For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dedicated themselves to the service of GOD, and spent their former time in studies, they are unable to make shifts, as Artizans and Tradesmen can doe. Was there ever a persecutor since the dayes of Christ, who with one breath did both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute, and pronunce the cause wherefore he did persecute to be a trifle. Our persecutors then are worse by many degrees, then the Ethnicke, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, or Popish persecutors, and consequently the worst that ever were. Our case is yet the more to be pitied, that we are denyed the protection of Law: when we would flie to the Sanctuarie of Iustice, we are shut backe, like unworthie beasts, and no more pitied, then if we were dogges, left or redelivered, into the hands of mercilesse Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who have given testimonie out of their own mouthes, of the loyaltie, and good behaviour of those whom they have persecuted.</p>

            <p>AFter so many <hi>Quaeres,</hi> and expostulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in all humility and reverence, to the honorable, the true, and native estates of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18918:8"/>
Nobles, Barronnes, and Burgesses: not regarding that bastard estate of Prelates, I would demand two things: First, Why they suffer the high Commission, a court not established by the Statutes of the realme, thus to tyrannise over the church, over dutifull and loyall Subjects, fyning, confyning, suspending, depriving, warding, and directing the Lords of Secret Counsell, to banish, or to give our letters of horning, against Ministers or other Professors, for not conforming to Popish ceremonies against their conscience. The Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the highest court of the realme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should provide that no strange court be set up to oppresse the Subjects, without their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and consent, and therefore it is, not only our <hi>Quaere,</hi> why it is not, but our request, that it may be put downe. For it is the strangest, the most tyrannicall, and lawlesse court, that ever came in this Land, lyker to nothing, then to the Spanish Inquisition, where unto it will turne in the end to the full, as Papistrie increaseth. That one or two Archbishops, with two or three associats, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, or civill persons, such as they please to assume to themselves, being nominate in the Kings Letters Pattents, should judge in all Ecclesiasticall causes, and inflict both temporall and spirituall censures, and punishments, according to their pleasures, is contrarie and repugnant to the word of God. For spirituall power, neither Prinees nor Parlaments, may give to Ecclesiasticall, or civill persones neither are Ecclesiasticall persons capable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18918:8"/>
of the power of the Temporall Sword. Seeing then, neither the one, nor the other can be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done, this high Commission, so much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at in our neighbour church, should not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to have place amongst us. Next, I demand in all humility &amp; reverence, Why acts of pretended and null assemblies, are ratified in Parlament, and Statutes made, where with our pretended Prelats, make snares to entrap their brethen, &amp; where with they countenance their tyranny: Was ever the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assemblie convocat in time of Parlament, or their advice and information sought, since these alterations began. In England, howbeit the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats sit in the upper House as Barrons, yet they have besides, a convention of the Clergie, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the convocation House, which representeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most our generall Assemblie (for they have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) whose advice was never neglected, no not in time of Poperie. What hath our church deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as thus to be neglected and misregarded, and the report, advice, consent and vote of Prelats to be taken, who are both judge and partie in this cause; The Acts of that corrupt, and pretended assembly at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> were not only ratified, and confirmed, but also under name of explanation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and Bishops exeemed from the judgement and censures of the generall assemblie. Shall the like be done now for that pretended &amp; null assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie holden last at <hi>Perth,</hi> God forbid that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Estates should make so light account of their own credits among the reformed churches.</p>
