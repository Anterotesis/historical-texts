            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from abroad some years since,
He was troubled to find his name
in Print, but somewhat satisfied
to see his Lines so ill rendred that he might justly
disown them, and say to a mistaking Printer, as one
did to an ill Reciter,—<hi>Male dum recitas,
incipit esse tuum.</hi> Having been ever since pressed to
correct the many and gross faults (such as use to be in
Impressions wholly neglected by the Authors) his answer
was, that he made these when ill Verses had more favour
and escaped better, than good ones do in this age; the
severity whereof he thought not unhappily diverted by
those faults in the impression, which hitherto have hung
upon his Book, as the Turks hang old rags (or such like
ugly things) upon their fairest Horses and other goodly
Creatures, to secure them against fascination; and for
<pb facs="tcp:53889:3"/>

               </gap> (maimed to that degree that himself
scarce knew what to make of many of them) might that
may at least have a Title to some Admiration, which is
no small matter, if what an old Author observes be true,
That the aim of Orators, is Victory; of Historians, Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

and of Poets, Admiration; He had reason therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
those faults in his Book whereby it might be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siled
to some, and commended to others.</p>
            <p>The Printer also be thought would fore the worse, if
those faults were amended; for we see maimed statues
sell better than whole ones, and clipt and washt Many go
about when the entire and weighty lies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are the reasons which for above twelve years past he has
opposed to our request; To which it was replyed, that as
it would be too late to recal that which had so long been
made publick, so might it find excuse from his Youth
(the season it was produced in) And for what had been
dome source and now added, if it commend not his Poetry,
it might his Philosophy, which teaches him so chearfully
to bear so great a Calamitr, as the loss of the best part of
his fortune (torn from him in Prison, in which, and in

giving him farther Trouble by, importuning him
for a new Permission, to Collect all that I can find,
either left out of the former Edition, or such as
have been since made by him; to which I am the
more encouraged, because the first (thô most of
them were compos'd Fifty or Sixty years since) seem
still New, which would be more strange in so
changing a Language, had it not been by him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd,

Dissolving at one stroke the battered Boat,</l>

                  <l>The shining steel her tender sides receive,</l>
                  <l>And there like Bees they all their weapons leave.</l>
                  <l>This sees the Cub, and does himself oppose</l>

Now would the men with half their hoped prey</l>

                  <l>She by the Rocks compell'd to stay behind,</l>

                  <l>Their fury falls, and all their Darts are thrown.</l>
                  <l>Their Lances spent; one bolder than the rest</l>
                  <l>With his broad sword provok'd the sluggish beast:</l>
                  <l>Her oily side devours both blade and heft,</l>
                  <l>And there his Steel the bold Bermudian left.</l>
                  <l>Courage the rest from his example take,</l>
                  <l>And now they change the colour of the Lake:</l>
                  <l>Blood flows in Rivers from her wounded side,</l>

And raise the flood to that propitious height,</l>

                  <l>She swims in blood, and blood do's spouting throw</l>

                  <l>Their fixed Javelins in her side she wears,</l>

Well proves this kindness what the Grecians sung,</l>

                  <l>Through Rocks they'd hew her passage to the main.</l>
                  <l>But how instructed in each others mind,</l>

                  <l>Of full revenge, renew the fight with fire:</l>
                  <l>Standing a looff, with lead they bruise the scales,</l>
                  <l>And tear the flesh of the incensed Whales.</l>
                  <l>But no success their fierce endeavours found,</l>
                  <l>Nor this way could they give one fatal wound.</l>

               <l>POets we prize, when in their Verse we find</l>
               <l>Some great employment of a worthy mind.</l>
               <l>Angels have been inquisitive to know</l>
               <l>The Secret, which this Oracle does show.</l>

What was to come <hi>Isaiah</hi> did declare,</l>
               <l>Which she describes, as if she had been there;</l>
               <l>Had seen the Wounds, which to the Reader's view,</l>
               <l>She draws so lively, that they Bleed a new.</l>
               <l>As Ivy thrives, which on the Oak takes hold,</l>
               <l>So with the Prophets may her lines grow old;</l>
               <l>If they should die, who can the World forgive?</l>
               <l>Such pious Lines! When wanton <hi>Sapho</hi>'s live.</l>
               <l>Who with his Breath his Image did inspire,</l>
               <l>Expects it should foment a Nobler fire:</l>
               <l>Not Love which Brutes as well as Men may know;</l>
               <l>But Love like his, to whom that Breath we owe.</l>
               <l>Verse so design'd, on that high Subject wrote,</l>
               <l>Is the Perfection of an ardent Thought:</l>
               <l>The Smoke which we from burning Incense raise,</l>
               <l>When we complete the Sacrifice of Praise.</l>
               <l>In boundless Verse the Fancy soars too high,</l>
               <l>For any Object, but the Deity.</l>

What Mortal can with Heav'n pretend to share</l>
               <l>In the Superlatives of Wise and Fair?</l>

               <l>A Giants habit on a Dwarf we place.</l>
               <l>Sacred should be the Product of our Muse,</l>
               <l>Like that sweet Oil, above all private use:</l>
               <l>On pain of Death forbidden to be made,</l>
