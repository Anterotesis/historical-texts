            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are few I presume that heare me this day but some what they haue heard of the great victories which it hath pleased Almighty God lately to give to those of the <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches</hi> in forraigne parts, professing our religion; in which regard that we might in some sort expresse our mindfulnesse
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18484:4"/>
of them our well-wishing to them, our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for them, and our rejoycing with them: I haue made choice of these words at this time by Gods gracious assistance to bee opened vnto you.</p>
            <p>In the Chapter going before we read of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull great defeate by <hi>Barak</hi> the sonne of <hi>Abino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and <hi>Deborah</hi> the <hi>Prophetesse</hi> (who at that time judged <hi>Israel</hi> though a woman) given to the forces of <hi>Iabin</hi> King of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which were utterly routed, pursued &amp; put to the sword by the <hi>Israelites</hi> not so much as a man left alive all the way from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Kishon</hi> even to <hi>Harosheth</hi> of the Gentiles, being sprinkled with bloud and bestrewed with dead carkases, and for <hi>Sisera</hi> the Generall of the Armie under <hi>Iabin,</hi> the day being thus lost he forsakes his chariot and flies for his life, and in his flight at the motion of <hi>Iael</hi> the wife of <hi>Heber</hi> the <hi>Kenite</hi> turnes aside into her tent, where being curteously entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and tyred with wearinesse, giving himselfe to his rest, he fell so soundly asleepe that <hi>Iael</hi> taking the opportunity stole upon him, and with a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in her hand fastened a naile in his temples, so fully home that hee never rose againe from the place.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> and by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18484:4"/>
all the people take up a song of triumph, a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and solemne hymne, to the Lord of Hosts the <hi>Author</hi> of the victorie, which takes up this whole Chapter, in imitation of <hi>Moses</hi> and the men of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Miriam</hi> the sister of <hi>Moses</hi> with the women on the other, who after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the cruell oppression of the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the overwhelming of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the red Sea, thus sing unto the <hi>Lord</hi> (which it should seeme was the burden of their song,) <hi>For</hi>

               <hi>he hath triumphed gloriously, the horse and the rider hath he throwne into the Sea.</hi> And such a song was that which the daughters of <hi>Israel</hi> tooke up (perchance in imitation of this) after the vanquishing of the <hi>Philistines;</hi> they goe forth to meete <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in their returne from that slaughter with tabrets and instruments of musicke, singing, and dancing, and as they played they answered one another and said, <hi>Saul</hi> hath slain his thousands and <hi>David</hi> his<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 7.</note> ten-thousands; Nay the very Gentiles after victorie obtained, they had their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> too, or songs of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph which they called a <hi>Poean, Poeana canamus;</hi> and againe, <hi>dicite Io Poean, &amp; Io bis dicite Poean:</hi> and if they did thus to their heathenish gods which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede were no gods but Idoles, how much more should wee doe the like to the true and everliving God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18484:5"/>This Song (as it is thought) was composed by <hi>Deborah,</hi> which I am the rather induced to beleeve, not only because shee was a woman of singular gifts and graces, and above all indued with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Spirit, because shee stirred up and spurred forward <hi>Barak,</hi> assisting and encouraging him with her presence and counsel in the whole action, but chiefely because in the 12 <hi>ver:</hi> shee thus rouzeth up her selfe, <hi>Awake, awake Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song:</hi> but by whom-soever it is composed it is certainly a most excellent divine hymne, and of a marvellous loftie high straine, as will easily appeare to any man that reads it with attention and judgement.</p>
            <p>The words of my Text they are the very upshot and close of the song, and in that respect no doubt the more considerable. They containe in them a prayer, a double prayer, spreading it selfe into two branches, whereof the one is an <hi>Imprecation</hi> against Gods enemies, <hi>so let all thine enemies perish O Lord;</hi> the other a Petition, <hi>but let them that love him be as the sunne when he goeth forth in his might;</hi> the Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is for the perishing of Gods enemies; the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for the flourishing of his friends, because first his enemies must perish before his friends can flourish, as darknesse must first be dispelled before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18484:5"/>
light come in place, and sicknesse expelled before health be recovered: these two being like the two buckets of a well, or the two scales of a ballance, the falling of the one is the rising of the other, as the house of <hi>David</hi> grew stronger by the weakning of <hi>Sauls</hi> house, and <hi>Rome</hi> erected her trophies in the ruines of <hi>Alba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Imprecation being thus delivered by a Prophetesse, containes a Prediction, as the Petition doth likewise a position, and in some translations is so rendred. In the Imprecation we are first to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether or no it be lawfull and how farre to pray against others; Secondly, what these ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God are; Thirdly, by whose hand they are to fall and to perish; and lastly, the manner of their perishing out of this word, <hi>So: so let all thine enemies perish O Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which gives occasion to this doubt in the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 44.</note> first place, is the words of our <hi>Saviour, Love your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.</hi> Wee are to know then, that we must pray for <hi>our</hi> enemies, but against <hi>Gods</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; this was the practice of the <hi>Prophet David,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This rubbe being thus remooved, I now come to the second part of this first branch, which is what these enemies of God are. The enemies of God either acknowledge no God, as professed <hi>Atheists,</hi> or acknowledge a God but not the true God, as <hi>Idolaters,</hi> or the true God but goe not to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18484:7"/>
him the true way, that is, by IESVS CHRIST, as <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Iewes;</hi> or goe to him by IESVS CHRIST, but not by him alone, as <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists;</hi> or goe by him alone, but (withall) fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to themselves, and obstinately maintaine some <hi>erroneous</hi> opinion in fundamentall points, as <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> or are sound enough in fundamentall points, but out of an affectation of singularity separate themselves from the congregation, as <hi>schismaticks;</hi> or lastly, joyne themselves to the congregation, but either with false hearts as <hi>hypocrites,</hi> or foule hands as prophane persons, having both of them a forme of godlinesse, but denying the power thereof: these may all of them in some sense, though in a diverse manner, &amp; in a different degree, be termed the enemies of God. And againe, to speake gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, they are all Gods enemies who blaspheme Gods name, who with hold Gods right, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Gods day, who dishonour Gods house, who abuse Gods word, whou nreverently or unworthi ly receive Gods Sacraments, who despise Gods ordinances, who neglect Gods commandements, who disgrace or disesteeme Gods ambassadors.</p>
            <p>But by the enemies of God here in this place undoubtedly are to bee understood the enemies of his Church, that is, such as persecute it, or for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18484:8"/>
sake oppose themselves against it: such an indissoluble linke and reciprocall connexion there is betwixt God and his Church, that it cannot be but that the enemies of the one should be the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the other. <hi>The reproches of them that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi>

               <hi>thee are falne upon me,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist</hi> as a member of the Church; and againe, <hi>Doe I not hate them O Lord that hate thee? and am I not grieved with</hi>

               <hi>those that rise up against thee? I hate them, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred, I count them mine enemies.</hi> And as Gods enemies are the Churches enemies, so the enemies of the Church, are Gods enemies, and therfore they are Gods enemies because they are the Churches enemies; <hi>Loe thine enemies make a tumult, and they</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 83. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that hate thee have lift up the head:</hi> and why were they <hi>thine</hi> enemies? the reason is there immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>They have taken crafty counsell against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones;</hi> because they tooke counsell against his people, and consulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Church, therfore were they <hi>his</hi> enemies: <hi>Remember Lord (saith the same Prophet) the reproch</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 49.</note> 
               <hi>of thy servants, wherewith thine enemies have reproched them,</hi> therefore they were <hi>His</hi> enemies because they reproched his servants, that is, his Church; and in this very Chapter, <hi>Curse ye Meroz</hi> (saith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Lord) <hi>curse bitterly the inhabitants thereof,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:18484:8"/>
               <hi>because they came not up to the helpe of the Lord against the mightie:</hi> wherby he intitles the Churches quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells to the Lord. But above all we have to this purpose in the ninth of the <hi>Acts</hi> a singular testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the mouth of the Lord himselfe, as it were an oracle speaking to us from heaven, where wee read that when <hi>Saul</hi> (who afterward was called <hi>Paul</hi>) was breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the <hi>Disciples</hi> of the Lord (that is, the Church) and to that end was upon his journey to <hi>Damascus,</hi> being amazed with an exceeding bright light, which shone round about him, he heard a voice saying unto him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> and he said, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> and the Lord said, <hi>I am Iesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kicke against the pricks; Iesus whom thou persecutest?</hi> why <hi>Iesus</hi> was then in heaven and <hi>Saul</hi> on earth; <hi>Saul</hi> clothed with misery and mortality here below and <hi>Iesus</hi> above sitting at the right hand of God in glory and majesty farre enough out of <hi>Sauls</hi> reach, how then could <hi>Saul</hi> persecute <hi>Iesus?</hi> surely none otherwise but because he persecuted the members of his Church, which <hi>Iesus</hi> takes to heart as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had beene persecuted in his owne person.</p>
            <p>The reason here of is apparent, the Church is the spouse, and he the husband of this spouse, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18484:9"/>
Church the body and he the head of this body, the Church the family and he the father of this family, the Church the armie and he the Generall of this armie, the Church the kingdome and he the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne of this kingdome; and if the spouse suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer can the husband be insensible of it? if the body suffer can the head be insensible of it? if the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffer can the father of the family be insensible of it? if the armie suffer can the generall be insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it? if the kingdome suffer can the soveraigne be insensible of it? nay a far neereunion there is betwixt Christ and his Church than betwixt the husband and the spouse, <hi>for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they two shall be one flesh:</hi> one flesh they are, but the wife liues not by the soule of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as the Church doth by the spirit of Christ the wife feeds not upon the flesh of the husband as the Church doth upon the flesh of Christ, the wife is not bought with the bloud of the husband as the Church is redeemed by the bloud of Christ, and by this meanes becomes neerer unto him than his owne right hand, dearer than the apple of his eye.</p>
            <p>Here is our comfort then, there being so many obligatory relations and mutuall ingagements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and his Church, the enemies of the Church are therby made his enemies, <hi>and if God be on</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:18484:9"/>
               <hi>our side who shall be against us?</hi> To fight against God is as if a man should spit against the winde which carries it backe in his owne face; the furie of Gods enemies against his Church is but as the ratling of a violent haile-storm upon the tiles, which makes a great noise for the time as if it would beate down the house, but is cast off as soone as it comes on and then lies on the ground, and within a while melts away; or as the proud surges of the sea which come swelling and roaring towards the rocke, as if they would rend it in peeces and carrie all before them, but the issue is that they dash themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rock and so turne into froth, but the rock being onely washed remaines where it was; so is it with the Church which is built upon the rock, the windes may blow and the flouds arise, and the raine beate upon it, but it falls not, because tis, built upon a rocke, <hi>and the gates of hell shall never be able to prevaile against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third considerable point in this Imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the hand by whose power the enemies of God shall perish, that is, by the hand and power of him whose enemies they are, and therefore doth <hi>Deborah</hi> (as we see) by an apostrophe turne her to the Lord and directs her speech to him, <hi>So let,</hi> or so shall <hi>all thine enemies perish O Lord,</hi> that is,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18484:10"/>
they shall thus perish by thy hand; and hence it is that in so many passages shee ascribes the victorie wholy to the Lord; <hi>Deborah said unto Barak, Vp,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>discomfited Sisera and all his charriots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak:</hi> it is not said, that <hi>Barak</hi> discomfited them before the Lord, but the Lord before <hi>Barak:</hi> and againe in the 23. of the same Chapter, <hi>So God subdued on that day Iabin the King of Canaan before the children of Israel.</hi>

            <p>Though <hi>Barak</hi> signifie lightning, yet was hee but as a thunder-bolt in the hand of God against <hi>Sisera,</hi> and though <hi>Deborah</hi> signifie a Be, yet no doubt but her diligence and providence in assisting <hi>Barak</hi> was overruled and guided by the providence of God; and so much her selfe upon the matter confesseth in this very song: they fought from heaven, the starres in their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or paths fought <hi>against Sisera: they fought from</hi>

himselfe (though by religion a <hi>Pagan</hi>) by his letters signified to the Senate, and thereupon gave not onely that legion the name of <hi>fulminatrix,</hi> but strait charge that none should be put to death or punished for being Christians.</p>
            <p>All which considered great reason had <hi>Gideon</hi> in the crie of his souldiers to preferre the sword of the Lord before his owne, as tis in the seventh Chapter of this booke; <hi>The sword of the Lord and of Gideon;</hi> not the sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> without the sword of the Lord, nor the sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> in the first place, and then the sword of the Lord; but first, <hi>the sword of the Lord,</hi> and then the sword of <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> the sword of the Lord to direct, and the sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> to execute; the sword of the Lord as the primarie esficient, and the sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> as the subordinate instrument, the sword of the Lord without the sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> in the ordinary course, will doe nothing, and the sword of <hi>Gideon</hi> without the sword of the LORD at all can doe nothing.

But let them that love him be as the Sun when hee goeth forth in his might: upon which I shall insist the lesse, because I have already dwelt so long upon the former. In the handling therof I will first treat of that kinde of divine love which is here to be understood, and of the severall degreestherof; secondly of the semblance of such as are therwith inflamed to the sun; thirdly, of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to the sun when he goeth forth in his might.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:18484:17"/>Love is a passion of the mind, or that point of the soule by which it longeth to bee united to the thing it loves; <hi>Amor meus pondus meum, eo feror quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun<expan>

            <p>Againe, love is as it were <hi>prima mensura,</hi> the principall and primarie measure of al the other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the soule; as our love is, so is our hatred, our hope, our joy, our feare, our griefe; proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the measure of our love, to the thing we affect is our hatred to that which opposeth against it, our hope of attaining it if we have it not, our joy in possessing it if we have it, our feare of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it even when wee possesse it, and lastly, our griefe for the losse when we are deprived of it.</p>
            <p>Now for the generall kindes of love; it is either unlawfull as immoderate, selfe love, irregular car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love, inordinate worldly love; or lawfull, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18484:17"/>
that either <hi>naturall,</hi> betweene those of the same bloud, or <hi>morall,</hi> between those of the same vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualities, or <hi>civill</hi> betweene those of the same Citty and Corporation, or <hi>Spirituall,</hi> between those of the same mysticall body of IESVS CHRIST; and yet a more transcendent than all these is <hi>Divine</hi> love, which first reflects upon God, and then from God and for Gods sake upon other things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: <hi>Qui aliquid amat praeter Deum &amp; non propter Deum, non amat Deum;</hi> hee that loves any thing or person beside GOD, and not in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, loves not God. God then we are all to love, because he is God, most beautifull and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, most wise, most powerfull, most holy, most just, most true in himselfe; we are likewise to love him, because he is <hi>Good</hi> to all his creatures in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and to us in particular; and for Gods sake we are to love those things which belong unto him, but specially his Church, than which nothing in this world is to him more pretious, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly his; and this love doe I take to be understood here in this place, let those that love him be as the sun; for as by Gods enemies in the former part of the verse are to bee understood the enemies of his Church, so by his friends in this latter part are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to be understood the friends of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18484:18"/>
Church, and of that Gospell and truth which by that Church is professed.</p>
            <p>Of this love there are different degrees; whereof the first is to wish well unto it, and to pray for it, that GOD would be pleased to raise up Kings and Queens to be nursing fathers and nursing mothers unto it, that he would stirre up the Princes of the earth to be a protection to it, and to shrowd it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wings of their authority, that the vinyard which his owne right hand hath planted, be not devoured either by cunning of wily Foxes, or by the rage of the wilde Bore out of the forrest.</p>
            <p>A second degree of this love is, to preferre the peace, the libertie, the prosperitie of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our owne private concernements, as the arme offers it selfe to the blow for the preservation of the head wherein consists the safety of the body, and the elements forsake their proper motions for the good of the Vniverse; thus did <hi>Vriah</hi> that worth souldier and faithfull servant of the Lord and o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
