         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN obſervance of your Requeſt, and to
perform my Promiſe upon it, I have
permitted the publiſhing this Diſcourſe:
But as to what induced you, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to deſire it of me, I am yet to ſeek,
how to make a tolerable Conjecture. Only in
this I ſatisfy my ſelf, that whatſoever is
found defective in it, ſo as not to deſerve
a Publick View, may poſſibly be ſhelter'd
under an interpretation, that it was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of me as from your own Perſonal kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to me; improved perhaps, for the
<pb facs="tcp:50902:3"/>
ſake of an Excellent Perſon Your worthy
Father, my moſt Eſpecial Friend, now
with God.</p>
            <p>And for that reaſon, tho' I might pleaſe
no body elſe, I ſhould be bery unworthy of
your Friendſhip, and his Memory, if I
ſhould not think it ſufficiently ſatifactory
to my ſelf, that I have pleas'd you.</p>
            <p>This is the true Figure of my Mind and
Thoughts, by which I am always ready
to approve my ſelf</p>

               <bibl>ACTS xvi. xxx.</bibl>
               <q>Sirs, What muſt I do to be ſaved?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I ſhall not Abridge my intended Uſeful Enlargments
upon ſo plain and ſhort a Text.</p>
            <p>There needs no far fetch'd train of Pretexts for a
long Introductive Preface to Uſher it in.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall I trouble you with any Hiſtorical Narrative
of the Jaylor's Perſon, or of thoſe Circumſtances in
which he was at that time, when he made his Pious
Requeſt to the Apoſtles, to know what he ſhould do
to be Saved.</p>
            <p>Such as are Conſiderable enough for your Notice,
will Occur in the following Periods of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>But the ſum of my Deſign at preſent is, only to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
your Attentions with two Uſeful Subjects of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
Naturally deduced from the Text, and from
what relates to it.</p>
            <p>I. The Firſt is, to repreſent the Jaylor's Intent and
Meaning, as to what kind of Salvation it was, which
he Enquired after, when he deſired the Apoſtles to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him, What he ſhould do to be Saved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50902:4"/>
II. The Second, ſhall be to Exhibite an Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable
Argument, that the ſame Rational Motives
which induced the Jaylor then to Enquire for Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how he might be Saved, ought always to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Minds and Thoughts, and to begin the ſame
preſently without Delay upon any Pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>And tho' it then happened, that the Jaylor went
about it, when he lay under the preſſing Senſe of his
own certain Ruin, upon the fear of his Priſoners
eſcape, according to the ſeverity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Law
in ſuch a Caſe; yet I ſhall prove the Obligation to be
the ſame upon us at all Times, and in all Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Theſe Two I ſhall perſue with the cleareſt Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
I can.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Firſt propoſed Subject, that is, what
kind of Salvation it was, which the Jaylor Enquired
after. I am ſatisfied it was Ultimately the Salvation of
his Soul in a future World; tho' with a deſire alſo to
be Directed by what Means he might come to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of it.</p>
            <p>And I know not any Expoſitor that ſo much as
queſtioneth this Senſe of it, and I am ſure the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Anſwer, in directing him to Embrace the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, how it was to be Obtained, doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
Evince it.</p>
            <p>And now we being thus aſcertained, that the
Jaylor's Concern was for the Salvation of his Soul
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50902:4"/>
in another World, it can't be preſum'd, that I ſhould
let ſuch a mighty Caſe and Subject paſs, without
ſome remarkable Reflexions upon it, by way of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The Salvation of Souls in an Eternal State, being a
matter of the higheſt Importance, and moſt valuable
Concern, with which the Mind of Man can poſſibly be
Affected.</p>
            <p>But becauſe this ſhort ſpace of time, in which I am
to manage it, will not admit ſuch Enlargements of
Application, as were expedient; I ſhall therefore
limit your Attentions to ſuch only, as may be adjudg'd
moſt ſeaſonable, that is moſt accommodable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Needs of Mens Minds according to the Humour
of the Times in which they are to Act, and Converſe.
Thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11.) to ſerve the
Time, in a proper Senſe.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as we live in an Age, obſervably,
by Mens Lives and Actions, of great Degeneracy
from Religion, and in which they ſeem too generally
to be very Careleſs and Inconſiderate of what ſhall
become of them in the other World, I thought it now
Expedient, to move my Application towards the care
of ſuch a Dangerous, and almoſt Epidemical Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>And for that End, perhaps it might be thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and ſufficient enough, if I ſhould intenſly only
Urge, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s formidable Caution, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3.)
<hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our preſent Caſe requires much more; For we
are not now only to Caution Men from Neglecting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50902:5"/>
their Salvation; but it's Incumbent upon us at this time,
to take ſpecial Care, how to preſerve Men from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a real Unbelief, or at leaſt into a heedleſs
uncertain Faith of any ſuch State of Salvation at all:
Nay, ſometimes from making it a Ridicule, and
oftimes from ſome Mens mocking at all thoſe Religious
Methods deſigned for the attainment of it.</p>
            <p>And you know but little of the World, if you have
not heard, that there be many of the Ingeniouſly Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
who having no other Expedient to ſolve the folly
and unreaſonableneſs of their Leud and Prophane Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
are neceſſitated, to ſave their Credit, to ſtudy
all that is poſſible, to become ſpeculative Unbelievers,
as Atheiſts, particularly as to the Faith of another
World.</p>
            <p>And from the Influence of thoſe Mens accuſtomed
Buffoonries, and leud Examples, it is, that too many
of the unheeding and careleſs part of common Men,
are encouraged to grow every day more and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned,
whether there be any ſuch things, as a
Judgment to come, or a future State at all: And are
reſolved to run the hazard of a <hi>come what will on it,</hi>
rather than quit their Scandalous Senſualities, and
Unjuſt Practices; or live unconformably to the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a vitious and fooliſh World.</p>
            <p>And if the Caſe ſtand thus with us, (as I am afraid
it is too true) then ſurely it can't be thought, but that
the beſt Uſe and Application which ought to be made
of this great Subject in hand, were to undertake an
arguing ſome Mens Minds and Reaſons into a firm
Belief, and others into a more ſenſible apprehenſion,
that there is infallibly ſuch a State to come, in which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50902:5"/>
there will be the certain Events of Eternal Salvation, or
Damnation.</p>
            <p>And I hope this will be accounted a contending for
the Faith (<hi>Jude</hi> 3.) in a very approveable ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And tho' at this time I muſt not preſume to go
through with it, with ſuch enlargements of Proof, as
ſo great a Caſe requires, yet I ſhall endeavour it (I
hope) to your ſatisfaction, by contracting my Thoughts
into a leſſer Compaſs, leſt I ſwell this Paragraph of my
Diſcourſe, into an unallowable Proportion.</p>
            <p>And therefore to ſhorten the Work, I ſhall not trouble
your Patience, as to the Proof of another Worlds Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
by what may be ſaid about the Souls Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
as it hath been, and ſtill is, the more general
Senſe of Mankind. And for this I could produce a
Cloud of Witneſſes, both from Hiſtorical and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Authorities, if time would admit.</p>
            <p>And tho' many of thoſe Philoſophers ſpake variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly
and uncertainly; and the Learned, Ancient Poets
very Romantickly in their Ingenious Fictions; and the
numerous <hi>Mahometans</hi> at this day moſt fondly and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
of the ſurviving State of Humane Things: Yet
it's enough to ſhake the Foundations of all Atheiſtical
pretenſions, that they all intimated an agreement in the
main Point of a future Exiſtence; they could not get
leave of their Reaſon to avoid the Senſe of it.</p>
            <p>And then, as for their wild Ways of ſtating the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it, it doth not at all invalidate the Truth, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirms it: For as much as in any Chriſtians
themſelves, eſpecially the School-men, have run the
Notion of the State of the dead, into almoſt as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Conjectures, as ſome Heathens had done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50902:6"/>
And all this ariſeth from Mens undutiſul Curioſities,
to open the Curtain upon that Secret, which Almighty
God, for Reaſons (I doubt not) accountable to himſelf,
and for the good of Mankind, hath concealed from our
preſent perfect Knowledge. 'Tis now ſaith the Apoſtle,
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, darkly, or as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
in a Riddle, as the original Word imports.</p>
            <p>It's ſufficient for God's Deſigns, that there ſhould be
ſo much known in all Ages concerning that State, as
might ſerve for a ſufficient Reaſon and Encouragement
to oblige Men to live Good and Vertuous Lives; and
to affect their hopes, that all ſhall be well in the End
with them, who truly Fear him and honeſtly Serve
Him.</p>
            <p>But now to avoid all Cenſure of being too ſhort in
ſo mighty a Caſe, and withal conſulting the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of my Time, I ſhall enlarge upon ſuch Proofs
(and ſuch only) as may be improved from all unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
Mens Obſervations, as they may eaſily and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
occur to their Thoughts and Notice.</p>
            <p>In which I doubt not but to ſay ſo much, as may give
a full ſatiſfaction to all, that need a further aſſurance in
that Important Point of a Life to come, and of the
Jaylor's great Salvation in that State.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, Let our ſtudied Unbelievers, and all
others whoſe Minds are any ways diſordered as to any
real Senſe of another World, but engage their
Thoughts and Reaſon to look firſt Abroad upon the
Species of Mankind in general, and then think, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it's any way probable, that God ſhould Create a
ſort of Creatures, who of all Viſible Beings, are only
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50902:6"/>
Endued with Rational and Reflecting Minds; and yet
be Naturally ſubjected to greater and more numerous
Miſeries and ſenſible Calamities, than all other the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting
Beings of the whole World beſides, put all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even with an Exception to thoſe, which Men may
be ſaid voluntarily to bring upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>So that if it were poſſible, that all the Miſerable of
Mankind were at any time in one View to be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that every ſorrowful Heart were to tell the ſad
Stories of his own afflicted Mind: That is, if all thoſe
who at any preſent time lay under the preſſing ſenſe of
Pains and Torments; All that are pining in languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſeaſes, or pinch'd with wants of Neceſſaries:
All that are withering out their old Age in Contempt,
Uſeleſsneſs, and as a Burden to others: All that
are made Drudges, to ſerve the Ambitions and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of a few: And Laſtly, all ſuch, as in a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of extremity in troubles of Mind, Body, or
Fortune, lay under Temptations, to Sigh out their time
in heavy Wiſhes never to have been at all: I ſay, if all
theſe could poſſibly be placed in one Proſpect, who is it
that would not be too apt to think, that a great part of
Mankind would even ſeem to Live in an Hoſpital of
the Miſerable, rather than in a Region of ſo much Eaſe
and Convenience, as might acquit the Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the great Creator, why he gave Man a Being,
and then permitted him to Live in ſuch hazzards of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poſſibly Miſerable a thouſand Ways; and at laſt in
a ſhort time to be ſhut up in a Night of nothing, like a
dead Fly, whithout any following Compenſation? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but the belief of another World, can poſſibly
ſolve this Difficulty in a thinking Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50902:7"/>
But further, let our ſilly Prodigals of their Souls,
(as concurrent with this) make another proſpect of
the State of Mankind, from an univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Obſervation of the promiſcuous Uſages and
Events of the Good and Evil in this World: Which
puzzel'd the Minds of the moſt Learned Oppoſers of the
Chriſtian Religion, as might eaſily be ſhewn if time
would allow it.</p>
            <p>And from thence let our Bravadoes in Unbelief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
whether it's poſſible, that any Man of Reaſon
ſhould entertain ſuch unworthy Thoughts of a Wiſe
and Kind Creator, that ſuch numbers of Unjuſt and
Unworthy Men ſhould ever be permitted to have it in
their power, to ride in Triumph upon the Necks and
Ruins of the Good and Harmleſs, and that ſuch Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
good Men, muſt remedileſly bear the Characters
of the Unfortunate to their Lives End; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Nothing, without any poſſible Redreſs for the
Future.</p>
            <p>And how can this be ſolved to the Honour of the
Great God, without a Belief, that Mankind ſhould
elſewhere Exiſt after their Mortal Durations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be Bleſſed with the Great Salvation in the Life to
me?</p>
            <p>And this is the firſt Reaſoning Experiment to be
made by Obſervations from Abroad, to aſcertain the
Being of another World, and a State of Salvation to
be expected in it.</p>
            <p>2. The next Advertiſement I give to thoſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
Minds to Believe the Being of another World,
is, That they would turn the uſe of their Reaſon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50902:7"/>
inward, and look if they can't make ſome Obſervations
from every Man's created Nature within, to give them
a full Aſſurance that there is ſuch a State in future.
That is, let them try, whether there be not ſome Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
or Qualifications, ſovereignly implanted in their
Natures, which muſt exert their Operations with the
ſame Neceſſity, that inanimate Beings muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Conduct of that Inſtinct and Impulſe which the
Creator put upon their ſeveral Natures, oftimes to act
contrary Motions and Operations. And then let them
obſerve, whether there be nothing in thoſe Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which God implanted in Man's Nature on purpoſe
out of Kindneſs to prevent his <hi>Vndoing</hi> in another
World by Sin and Impenitence: And which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
an Evidence for the aſſur'd Exiſtence of ſuch a State
to come.</p>
            <p>Now of thoſe natural Qualifications, though there be
many, yet I ſhall inſtance but in two only.</p>
            <p>The Firſt of thoſe natural Diſpositions or Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is, that unavoidably Men's Minds will have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie,
and ſometimes a tormenting Senſe of Guilt upon
them, after Crimes committed: And which muſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
ſomething that is very terrible to come, after their
mortal Lives are ended.</p>
            <p>And this may eaſily be manifeſted to be true, when
it's obſerv'd, that ſuch a Senſe of Guilt will perſue
ſuch Criminals, though their Crimes were committed
with the profoundeſt Secrecy; and when thoſe guilty
Perſons enjoy'd all the Advantages of Human Life to
divert and extinguiſh their terrifying Apprehenſions of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50902:8"/>
And further, in Proof of this, though I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
as many Authors upon that Subject, as almoſt in
any other Caſe whatſoever, yet I only chuſe now to
offer what the Heathen Poet <hi>Juvenal</hi> could aver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors,
<q>
                  <l>—Non tamen hoſtes</l>
                  <l>Evaſiſſe putes, quos diu conſcia facti</l>
                  <l>Mens habet attonitos, &amp; ſurdo verbere caedit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Though they had, ſaith he, conquered all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
abroad, yet their Conſciences created ſome more
terrible ones within; which ſeverely ſcourg'd them
with the inviſible Stroaks of their own guilty Minds.</p>
            <p>It was this intolerable Senſe of Guilt, that choak'd <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
with Sorrow; when it's probable, he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have ſhifted well enough in the World with what
he might get from his Bag-office, and with the Bargain
he had made to betray his Maſter, had not his guilty
Mind arreſted him with the unſupportable Terrors of a
Judgment, and a Hell to come.</p>
            <p>Whence is it elſe, that ſuch a Senſe ſhould always float
upon the Surface of Mens guilty Minds and Memories!
Witneſs that of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, when diſtreſſed in a
Caſe of a foreign Nature, <hi>Verily, ſay they, we are guilty
concerning our Brother, (Gen.</hi> 42. 21.) And as it was
with <hi>Herod,</hi> when they were conjecturing, who Chriſt
ſhould be, he quickly had it ready in his guilty Mind,
<hi>It's John, ſaith he, whom I beheaded (Mark</hi> 6. 16.) And
hence come the frightful Conflicts of moſt dying wicked
Men, when their Souls are convuls'd with unaccountable
Terrors, after a long continued Habit of Impenitence,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50902:8"/>
and a wilful Diſregard to all God's indearing Tenders of
Grace and Mercy.</p>
            <p>It can't be ſuppoſed, but that they muſt have then a
ſenſe of ſome Terrible thing to come after their laſt
Breath ſhould Land them into another ſtate of Beings.
This Terror they could not at that time avoid, by all
the confident Pretenſions which they before made uſe
of, to elude that their Natural diſpoſition, which God
had purpoſely Implanted in their Natures, that by
their ſenſe of ſuch an unhappy ſtate of Mind, they
might the more readily and naturally look out for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
by taking wiſer meaſures for their own everlaſting
Good and preſent Eaſe.</p>
            <p>But then Secondly, There is another Quality natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
implanted in all Mens Minds by a Merciful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and conſequent to that Natural ſenſe of Guilt; and
that is, that all Wicked Men muſt neceſſarily and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
endure the ſorrowful and ſhameful work of
Repenting themſelves of their wicked Actions at one
time or other. Either in this World by Improving
that natural neceſſary Quality with a timely Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to Salvation, or elſe it will Exert it ſelf to be
an Everlaſting Puniſhment (perhaps the ſevereſt) in
ſuch Wicked Mens endleſs Scenes of Miſery.</p>
            <p>And as this Diſposition was naturally given to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
by God's Mercy, ſo it will for ever acquit his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
tho' ſuch Wicked Men be Eternally Puniſhed for
Sins tranſiently committed in time:</p>
            <p>Becauſe the duration of their Puniſhments ſhall be no
longer, than according to the impreſt Inſtinct of their
Natures, which the Good Creator gave them in Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50902:9"/>
And further it may be ſuppoſed, that in their Sinning
State, they could not be alogether inſenſible of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of their Beings, eſpecially if they had as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
conſulted their Reaſon, as they did Voluntarily
all along, attend to the vain Solicitations of their lower
Appetites and Affections to over-rule that beneficial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of their Nature, to their own Eternal Ruin.</p>
            <p>And thus I have Arraigned our reſolved Unbelievers,
and inconſiderate Halters in the Faith, at the Bar of
their own Reaſon, only upon what may be deduc'd
from matters of common Obſervation from abroad,
and within, if attended to <hi>with ſerious</hi> Conſideration.</p>
            <p>But I have yet more to ſay to ſtumble our pretenders
to the unbelief of another World: And that is, that
beſides theſe Demonſtrations from natural Obſervations,
there is moreover a ſufficient Revelation by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion, which <hi>brought Immortality to light,</hi> (2 Tim.
1. 10.)</p>
            <p>Not but that a Good God, had before allowed
his World of Rational Beings a demonſtrable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
by ſome natural Evidences, of a State to come,
ſufficient for their Safety then, if they would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the uſe of their natural Underſtandings;
and alſo to ſuch Divine Aſſiſtances, which may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
an Impartially Good God might beſtow upon
them, in the Name of Chriſt (<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 13.) That is,
for the Sake or Cauſe of the Lamb Vertually ſlain from
the Foundation of the World (<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8.) Otherwiſe
how could it reaſonably be affirmed, <hi>that he died for all
Men,</hi> (2 Cor. 5. 15.) or <hi>That he taſted death for every
Man,</hi> (Heb. 2. 9.) if all of the former World were
abſolutely Excepted from all the Benefits of his Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50902:9"/>
Redemption, which Redemption will be Propitious
to all them, who are not wilfully guilty of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it; or which being known, do not as wilfully
refuſe the Conditions of it, and ſo make themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of its Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>And now the Reaſon, why Almighty God might ſo
long reſpit the aſcërtaining Mankind of another Life
by Revelation, I am apt to believe, it was becauſe the
World, upon ſeveral poſſible accounts, (beſt known to
Himſelf) was not in Temper, nor yet in fit Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
to receive an aſſurance of ſuch a State to come,
by that happy Method.</p>
            <p>But as ſoon as God ſaw the World was Prepared, and
in Circumſtances to admit it, he then opened the Doors
of Heaven, and ſent forth his Holy Son to Proclaim it,
with the mighty Credentials of Divine Atteſtation.</p>
            <p>So that the Being of a future World is now (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.) made Credible by a ſufficient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
which before (as to the greateſt part of Mankind)
was only to be made demonſtrable by natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and rational Evidence.</p>
            <p>And that it may be ſaid, that we are now Saved by
Faith (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5.) that is, if we act all the methods of
our Salvation by the Influence of that Powerful Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And it's a great Mercy of God to the general
State of Mankind, that it ſhould be ſo: It being far
eaſier to Mens Minds in common, to Believe by Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
than to depend upon the neceſſity of Reaſoning
by Demonſtration; or as the <hi>Jews</hi> had it by obſcurer
intimations, and by ſome Prophecy not to be unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
till that fulneſs of Time, or ſeaſonable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
was come, when the long expected <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould
appear. (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:50902:10"/>
Now what can our Hectoring Unbelievers, or Men
of careleſs and inconſiderate Minds ſay to all this?</p>
            <p>Can they, dare they, Controul the Validity of ſuch
a Divine Atteſtation, as the Goſpel Exhibits for another
World? Either they muſt plainly and poſitively prove,
that the whole Goſpel is Falſe, and the Religion of it a
Cheat, and our Saviour an Impoſtor; or they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
loſt and undone by their Atheiſtical Pretenſions,
upon which they licence themſelves to live in their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and Leud Practices; or at beſt to act only for
their Worldly Eaſe, and preſent Pleafures.</p>
            <p>I ſay again, are they ſure, Infallibly ſure, that they
have Arguments ſufficient enough to over-rule the
Truth of Chriſtiantty, ſo as to adventure the Eternal
Loſs of their Souls upon it?</p>
            <p>A Truth which even to this day hath ſo controul'd
all publiſh'd Conteſts by fair Trials of Learning, that
the Vaſt Nations which do now Embrace a Religion
in oppoſition to it, are neceſſitated to let their People
creep in the dark ſhades of Ignorance, to preſerve their
fond Perſuaſions from any Learned Diſcourses, or Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Inquiſitions.</p>
            <p>And now who would Venture the Loſs of an Eternal
Safety, upon the hazard (if it were no more) that
Chriſtianity ſhould not prove to be true at laſt?</p>
            <p>The very Doubt of it upon ſuch likelihoods of Truth,
do not ſo much commend the Diſcretion of ſuch, as
take a liberty from thence to act only for the Concerns
of the Vain and Tranſient World, and then loſe their
Souls at laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50902:10"/>
This is the laſt Part of my Arguing Application, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
the <hi>Exiſtence of the Great Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having diſpatch'd my Firſt Subject of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
upon that future Salvation, which the Jaylor
Enquired after, and made the beſt Uſe and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I could think proper, as to the Ages Irreligious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
I am fairly prepared to undertake the next Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
I promiſed you.</p>
            <p>And that is, To demonſtrate by an uncontroulable
Argument, that there is an Obligation upon every Man
whomſoever, in the very inſtant, in which they now
exiſt, without any pretenſions, to make any delay of
following the Jaylor's Example, in ſeeking after, and
then acting, what they ſhould do to be Saved.</p>
            <p>And to make this Argument plainly Convincing, I
ſhall move to the Concluſion of it, from theſe three Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable
Premiſes, apartly to be Conſidered.</p>
            <p>I. Firſt, I hope I need not Queſtion your Belief, but
that the only Seaſon in which it is poſſible for any Man
to perſue and finiſh the Work of his Salvation, muſt be
acted in the compaſs of his Mortal Life.</p>
            <p>For when that ſhort Scene is over, there will be no
after Attempts to be made; no Rafts to ſave Life, after
that Natural Shipwrack.</p>
            <p>The fooliſh Virgins knock'd too late for Admiſſion:
The undreſſed Gueſt had no Apology for himſelf, when
the time was elaps'd, in which he might have put on
his Wedding Garment. This the Firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50902:11"/>
II. Secondly, as my next Promiſe, let me perſuade
you to conſider, what the Worth is, which muſt be
done in that ſhort Seaſon, before you can ſecure your
Salvation at laſt.</p>
            <p>And that I may aſſiſt your Thoughts and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
therein, give me Leave to offer a ſummary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
in few Words, of that Work, which is to be
done to attain your Salvaion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I deſire you to conſider, what Work your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Faculties have to perform, that is, fully to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
what that whole Will of God is, which muſt
be done, if you expect ever to enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven, ſaith our Saviour (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21.)</p>
            <p>And are you ſure, that you have done all that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
poſſible in that Point, to avoid the Danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,
for the willful Ignorance of your Duty in any
Part of it?</p>
            <p>And then have you inform'd your ſelves, how many
unruly Paſſions you are to ſubdue; how many impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Appetites to be reſtrain'd; how many Temptations
to conteſt and overcome; ſometimes in Caſes, which
may perhaps make a Self-denial as ſevere, as if you were
obliged to <hi>pluck out your righ Eye,</hi> or <hi>cut off your right
Hand,</hi> as our Saviour advertiſeth (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 29, 30.) in a
particular Caſe?</p>
            <p>Then conſider how nice and numerous the Caſes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and a peaceable Life are; and then to underſtand
how neceſſary it is, that Satiſfactions are to be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when Breaches are made as to either Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50902:11"/>
After that I may put you in mind, how many Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of doing good God hath allowed you; and for the
Omiſſion of which, you will be accountable at the laſt
Day (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.)</p>
            <p>Then advertiſe your ſelves, how many Prayers and
Acts of Devotion will be ſufficient, to anſwer St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Injunction of performing them without ceaſing (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
5. 17.)</p>
            <p>And are you ſure, you have diſcharged your Duty of
receiving the holy Sacrament, with that Frequency,
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25.) and which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men in holy times carefully practiſed.</p>
            <p>But to ſhorten this my Undertaking, take all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
into a general View of your Conſciences,
and examin your ſelves, whether you live knowingly,
deliberately, and habitually in the Tranſgreſſion of any
one of them.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, then conſider what muſt follow, that is,
either your inevitable eternal Ruin, or a timely Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>And when it is come to the Caſe of repenting, are you
ſure you have found out the true Notion of that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Duty, and the various Acts and Circumſtances of
performing it? It may coſt you ſome Labour to be
delivered from the miſtaken Senſes of them both.</p>
            <p>And then when you come to lead a new Life (the
chief End and Deſign of repenting,) and that you can't
but obſerve the many Failings and Imperfections, which
the greateſt Care can't always avoid; And that then,
nothing elſe but an intire Sincerity of Endeavour will
avail; Your next Work then muſt be, how to acquit
your Conſciences, as to the Reality of that Sincerity.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50902:12"/>
A Caſe that hath perplexed ſome very good Mens
Minds unto their Lives End.</p>
            <p>Now take all this whole work into one View, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
think with your ſelves, whether every Man is
not neceſſarily oblig'd on that account, inſtantly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon the Jaylor's Deſign in Enquiring what he
ſhould do to be Saved.</p>
            <p>But if it be Objected, in confront to my Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Work, (that the Apoſtles did only advertiſe
the Jaylor, to Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and he
<hi>ſhould be ſaved (Ver.</hi> 31.)</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this, it's to be preſumed, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
intended that he ſhould afterward take upon him,
and proceed in, the whole Diſcipleship of Chriſt, of
which Faith was to be but an entring and an initiating
Grace, and Duty.</p>
            <p>Had the Jaylor gone no further than Believing, he
had ſtumbled at the Threſhold of all his Hopes; as too
many amongſt us (I fear) have done, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make Faith, as it were, an abridged Sum of
the Goſpel-Condition, not conſidering that if they
would enter into Life, beſides their Faith, they muſt
keep <hi>(All)</hi> the Commandments (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17.) to which
Faith was only deſigned to be a Beginning, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to be a conſtant and neceſſary Attendant upon
the whole Work. This is the Second of the Premiſes.</p>
            <p>III. The Third and Laſt, which gives the full force
to the Argument for a ſpeedy preſent Undertaking the
Jaylor's Enquiry after his Salvation, 'Tis the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of every Man's Continuance in this ſhort Life to do ſo
Great a Work: Always fearing, leſt too long a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50902:12"/>
neglect, ſhould provoke God to cut a Man
off before it's done. Our time is in God's Hand, (as the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 17.) that is, unaccountably to
ſhorten or lengthen it as he pleaſes. 'Tis his Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</p>
            <p>And then who could think, that any Man, who hath
the leaſt ſpark of Faith, or even of Reaſon in his Mind,
could be ſo deſperately adventurous, as to defer the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Saving Work for his Soul one Hour longer,
leſt in the very next (beyond which he hath no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
aſſurance to Exiſt,) he be left to an impoſſibility
of ever-after, either to Act or Hope for his Deliverance,
from being as Miſerable a Wretch as can enjoy a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>I ſay, if the Caſe ſtands ſo with him, why ſhould he
any more ſit down to Eat, or go about to cloſe his Eyes
to Sleep, <hi>(quis hoc ſub Caſu ducere poſſit Somnos?)</hi> one
Night more, till he hath taken a firm Reſolution, the
next Mornining to make an Entrance upon that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Work?</p>
            <p>And for the keeping him awake in that preſent Night
to think of it, it were well for him, if his Conſcience
would lay him down in that poſture, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ingeniouſly describes, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 20.) that is, that
<hi>his Bed ſhould be ſhorter then he can ſtretch himſelf upon it,
and his Covering narrower then he can wrap himſelf in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if his Uneaſineſs can perſwade him to bethink
himſelf of Enquiring after, and then Acting for his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Salvation, it would prove the moſt Propitious
Night, that ever he were like to enjoy in his whole
Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50902:13"/>
Oh conſider this ye that forget God, leſt he pluck
you away before your Work is done, and there be none
to Deliver you. Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord,
and put not off from day to day, (<hi>Ecclus.</hi> 5. 7.)</p>
            <p>And thus I have fairly repreſented to you, as well as
I could, the Concluſive ſtreſs of my deſigned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
why every one of you, even the Youngeſt,
Strongeſt, and moſt Proſperous amongſt you, ſhould
in this inſtant go about to begin, and then to go on in
the buſineſs of the Jaylor's Enquiry, <hi>What ſhall I do to
be Saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now preſuming that I have ſaid enough to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
your Reaſon of the certain Exiſtence of a State to
come, in which Salvation is to be attained; And alſo
plainly repreſented the Great Work you have to do in
order to it; (with an aſſurance that the Goſpel hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
it to be no leſs) my Deſign now is, to ſtir up
your Minds with the moſt Affectionate and Zealous Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
preſently, without any pretence of Delay on any
account whatſoever, to enter upon that moſt Important
Buſineſſ, by the force of two perſwasive Motives, with
which if you refuſe to be Affected, I know not what
can be ſaid more to bring you to a ſenſe of Religion,
and to the care of your Eternal Welfare.</p>
            <p>I. The Firſt of them, which I offer to the Minds of
the delaying Neglecters of their own Salvation, is to
Conſider, that God in his Infinite Loving kindneſs hath
ſo ordered it, that in the ſame inſtant in which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate
Sinner begins with the Jaylor to be Enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after his Saving Buſineſs, in the ſame inſtant he
makes his firſt Step towards God's beginning Favour;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50902:13"/>
and if he ſhall Religiouſly go on for his own Everlaſting
Intereſt, he may aſſure himſelf then of his peculiar Love
and Bleſſing, but not till then.</p>
            <p>As if God had moſt kindly confin'd, almoſt all the
Services to be done to himſelf, to ſuch Actions only
which Man is oblig'd to perform for his own chiefeſt
Good and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And as if God ſhould ſay to them, Do but mind your
own principal Concern: Be but Wiſe for your ſelves:
Do but forbear ſuch things as muſt Infallibly tend to
your Eternal Ruin, I am Served, I am then Pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Be but your own Friends, and I am then your, even
upon thoſe Terms, and for that very Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But if Men reſolve Obſtinately to continue in their
Delay, and ſtill go on to neglect their own Saving Good,
they are to Believe, that ſo long God hath nothing to do
with them, any more than they have to do with God.
For all that unhappy while of delay, God is, as it were
an Alien to them, and ſtands at diſtance from them:
And that not only as a Stranger, but as yet as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Only ſo far Reconcil'd to them, that as ſoon as they
ſhall go about to Mind and Act for their own Chiefeſt
Good and Intereſt, they ſhall readily be accepted to
Peace with him.</p>
            <p>Oh then I Beſeech you all, that are at this time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of your Obſtinate or Careleſs Neglect hitherto,
don't let God and your Souls ſtand at theſe odds any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but preſently go about your Salvation-buſineſs with
this certain Encouragement, that you ſhall then aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
come to God, as to your Friend, and into his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50902:14"/>
Arms, which are always open Joyfully to receive
you. He will then become your Guide, your Protector,
and Bleſſing, (Oh dread that heavy Word) but not
till then. This is the Firſt Perſwasive Motive.</p>
            <p>II. The next is, with an aſſurance, that as that Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Work will bring you firſt to God, and to his Favour,
and to a Communion with him; ſo the firſt Step you
make toward your own Salvation, you do not only
come to Him, but you come to be your ſelves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to your own Rational Nature, as you are Men.</p>
            <p>For all the while that inconſiderate Men refuſe to Live
according to the Meaſures of Religious Wiſdom, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their own Safety in a future World, they are not
to be accounted in a Moral ſenſe Rational Creatures, but
are to be reckon'd among ſuch, as are beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or out of their Senſes, (as it's vulgarly Phraſed)
that is, they all the while may be thought to act as mad
or diſtracted Men. Or it may be ſaid of them, that
they have changed their Human Natures into another
Species of Beings, that is, by ſome Sins, into the Nature
of Devils, (St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls ſome of them (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 3)
Or that they may have aſſumed the Nature of Brutes
in other Sins, (St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls ſome ſuch bruit Beaſts,
<hi>2 Pet.</hi> 2. 12.) Or they may be ſaid to act according to the
ſenſeleſs Humour of Fools, (our Saviour calls one of them
by that name, (<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20.) but by no means, they
muſt not be allowed to act according to the Quality,
Reaſon, and ſober Counſels of Intellectual Beings.</p>
            <p>And if ſome ſuch half or no Men, who drown their
Intellectual Faculties, in the pleaſures of Senſe: And
others who imploy their Minds and Time in the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50902:14"/>
of ſome heightning degrees of Wealth or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
ſhall be offended, and think themſelves too wiſe to
be ſo reproached by theſe my ſevere Repreſentations;
and ſhall ſcornfully Deride us, as the greateſt Fools for
doing ſo; let them tell themſelves, that for certain at
one time or other, eſpecially when they are in a near
proſpect of their Dying Periods, they will juſtifie us to
their Coſt, that all that I have ſaid is true. And then
may wiſh, that I had expoſed their Follies with greater
degrees of Severity, that they might caution their
Friends and Relatives, no longer to play the Fools in
ſuch comparatively ridiculous ways of Living, as muſt
neceſſarily hazard the loſs of God's Love, and Favour;
the ſweet Peace of their own Minds, and their being
Eternally at laſt Undone in a future World.</p>
            <p>And then let them conſider, whether their Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Principles, or their hopes of any worldly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
can ſhelter them from thoſe dreadful Events.</p>
            <p>But now on the other hand, let them be aſſured, that
whenſoever any of thoſe ſinful and fooliſh Delayers ſhall
begin to enter upon thoughts, and ſincere purpoſes, to
act for their Eternal Salvation; they ſhall certainly then
make the firſt Step, and begin to be themſelves; come
into their Wits, come out out of Bedlam, and act their
own Rational Natures, ſo as to deſerve the honourable
Title of being Men.</p>
            <p>Of this the wiſe <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> gives us a clear aſſurance,
<hi>Fear God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and keep his Commandments,</hi> (Eccl.
12. 13.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>This is Man.</hi> Not as ſome
miſtakingly would have it, the Duty, or the whole Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Man; but poſitively this is Man; which he was
not juſtly to be ſo accounted, till a Religious Mind and
Life had made him one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50902:15"/>
And then further, when he goes about to turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be a Man (St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it the new Man,) he
will every day be more and more improving himſelf for
a Happy Life, even in this VVorld; ſo far as a mortal
State will admit of it, with the common allays of the
Worlds unavoidable Inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>His Pious Mind will never let him want a directive
Guide how to manage his beſt Proſperity diſcreetly, and
ſatiſfactorily to himſelf; and create a Love and a Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from all that depend upon him; and moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
a Friendſhip from all thoſe, with whom he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and holds Neighbourly communions.</p>
            <p>And if it happens, that any adverſe Fortune, or croſſ
Accidents ſometimes occur, his wiſe and religious Mind
will be ready to ſuggeſt Reaſons enough, why he
ſhould bear them patiently; ſometimes even Eligibly;
and always Thankfully.</p>
            <p>And if he hears the noiſe of VVars and National
Commotions, when VVorldly Men are harraſſing their
Minds with Fears and paſſionate Concerns for Parties
and Intereſts, he bears the Character of the <hi>Pſalmiſt's
Bleſſed Man that fears the Lord, (Pſal.</hi> 112) that is,
(Verſe the ſeventh) <hi>He will not be afraid of any Evil Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
for his Heart ſtandeth faſt, and believeth in the Lord.</hi>
He quietly awaits God's Pleaſure in the Iſſue and Event
of things, and is content that he ſhould be Glorified ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his Mercy, or Juſtice, as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>And if our Pious regarder of his Salvation, ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the days are coming on, in which he is like
to have no pleaſure in them, he will be ſo far from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
himſelf with murmuring complaints, that God
gave him a Mortal Life on thoſe (as Worldlings ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50902:15"/>
hard terms; that he ſhall intellectually rejoyce,
that God and Nature allows him ſuch a reſpit, in which
he may have time perfectly to Extirpate the very relicts
of every evil Habit, contracted perhaps in the inadvertent
part of his Life. And then that all the beguiling temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the vain VVorld, are now growing every day
more and more pleaſantly inſipid to him.</p>
            <p>And then it being preſum'd that in his declining Age
he may have leſs to do with the Affairs of the VVorld,
and but little attendance to be given to the Satiſfactions
of Senſe, he finds that he hath a happy leiſure, to be
endeavouring to dreſs up his Soul with ſuch Divine
Qualifications, as may make himſelf as like, as poſſible,
to the Nature of that Good God, eſpecially in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
Univerſal Love and Goodneſs; unto whoſe
Beatifical Preſence he hopes ere long to have a merciful
admiſſion.</p>
            <p>And when he is endeavouring to finiſh that principal
deſign, he finds that he hath time alſo, to form his
Mind with thoſe obliging Qualities, and Graces, which
may adapt him to be a fit Companion in that Bleſſed
Society; where the Holy Angels, and the Spirits of
Juſt Men made Perfect, (being all of a Piece in their
Tempers) do keep up a ſweet and happy Communion
of Joy and Love, without any ſuch interruptions, as
they met withall in the former froward VVorld.</p>
