            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>After I had ended my ſpeech, I had ſome ſhort diſcourſe with him in the Perſian tongue who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things told me, that concerning my trauell to the City of <hi>Samarcand,</hi> he was not able to doe me any good, becauſe there was no great ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt the Tartarian Princes and himſelfe, ſo that his commendatory letters would doe me no

good. Alſo he added, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> did ſo deadly hate all Chriſtians, that they would certainely kill them when they came into their Country. So that he earneſtly diſwaded me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iourny, if I loued my life and welfare; at laſt he concluded his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with me by a ſum of mony that he threw downe from a windowe through which he looked out, into a ſheete tied vp by the foure corners, and hanging very neer the ground a hundred peeces of ſiluer, each worth two ſhillings ſterling, which cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:19146:15"/>
I had but twenty ſhillings ſterling left in my purſe by reaſon of a miſchance I had in one of the Turkes Cities called <hi>Emert</hi> in the country of <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi> where a miſcreant Turke ſtripped me of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all my monies, according as I wrote vnto you in a very large letter the laſt yeer, which I ſent from the Court of this mighty Monarch by one of my Countrimen that went home by Sea in an Engliſh ſhippe laden with the commodities of this <hi>India,</hi> which letter I hope came to your hands long ſince.

Of theſe gratuities which haue been giuen me willingly, would I ſend you ſome part as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the filiall loue and affection which euery child bred in ciuility and humility ought to performe to his louing and good mother: but the diſtance of ſpace betwixt this place and <hi>England,</hi> the hazard of mens liues in ſo long a ioureny, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the infidelity of many men, who though they liue to come home, are vnwilling to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the things they haue receiued, doe not a little diſcourage me to ſend any precious token vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; but if I liue to come one day to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> againe (for thither doe I reſolue to goe once more by the grace of Chriſt, and therehence to take my paſſage by land into Chriſtendom ouer renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Greece)</hi> I wil make choice of ſome ſubſtantial &amp; faithfull Countriman, by whom I will ſend ſome prety token as an expreſſion of my dutifull and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient

reſpect vnto you. I haue not had the opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſee the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> as yet ſince I came into this country, but I haue reſolued to goe to him when I come next into his Territories, and to ſearch him out whereſoeuer I can find him in his Kingdome; for ſeeing I can diſcourſe with him in his Perſian tongue, I doubt not but that going vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in the forme of a Pilgrime, he will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertaine me with good words, but alſo beſtow ſome worthy reward vpon me beſeeming his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and perſon; for which cauſe I am prouided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand with an excellent thing written in the Perſian tongue that I meane to preſent vnto him: and thus I hope to get beneuolences of worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to maintaine me in a competent maner in my whole pilgrimage till I come into <hi>England,</hi> which I hold to be as laudable &amp; a more ſecure courſe then if I did continually carry ſtore of mony about mee. In the letter which I wrote vnto you by an Engliſh ſhip the laſt yeere, I made relation vnto you both of my iourny from the once holy <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> hither and of the ſtate of this Kings Court, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of this Country, therfore I hold it ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to repeat the ſame things againe, but what the countryes are, that I meane to ſee betwixt this and Chriſtendome, and how long time I will ſpend in each country, I am vnwilling to aduertiſe you of at this preſent, deſiring rather to ſignify that vnto you after I haue performed my deſigne then before; howbeit in few words, I will tell you of certaine Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:19146:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of great renown in former times, but now part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruined, that I reſolue (by Gods help) to ſee in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> where I now am, namely ancient <hi>Babilon &amp; Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> Tower, ſome few miles from <hi>Niniue,</hi> &amp; in the ſame the Sepulcher of the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> ſpacious &amp; goodly; <hi>Caire</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> heretofore <hi>Memphis,</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the famous Riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> where <hi>Moiſes, Aron,</hi> &amp; the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> liued with king <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whoſe ruined Palace is ſhewed there til this day, &amp; a world of other mouable things as memorable as any City of the whole world yeeldeth, ſauing only <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> but in none of theſe or any other Cities of note do I determin to linger as I haue done in other places, as in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Azmere,</hi> in this Eaſterne <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> onely ſome few daies will I tarry in a principall city of fame, to obſerue euery principal matter there and ſo be gone. In this City of <hi>Agra</hi> where I am now, I am to remaine about ſix weekes longer, to the end to expect an excellent oportunity, which then will offer it ſelfe vnto me to goe to the famous Riuer <hi>Ganges,</hi> about fiue daies iourny from this, to ſee a memorable meeting of the gentle people of this country called <hi>Baieans,</hi> whereof about foure hundred thouſand people go thither of purpoſe to bathe and ſhaue themſelues in the Riuer, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a world of gold to the ſame Riuer, partly in ſtamped mony, &amp; partly in maſſy great lumpes and wedges, throwing it into the Riuer as a ſacrifice, and doing other ſtrange Ceremonies moſt worthy the obſeruation, ſuch a notable ſpectacle it is, that
<pb facs="tcp:19146:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no part of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> neither this which is called the great <hi>Aſia,</hi> nor the leſſer, which is now called <hi>Nato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> the like is to be ſeen; this ſhew doe they make once euery yeere, comming thither from places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a thouſand miles off, and honour their Riuer as their God, Creator, and Sauiour; ſuperſtition and impiety moſt abominable in the higheſt degree of theſe brutiſh <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> that are aliens from Chriſt &amp; the common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> After I haue ſeen this ſhew, I wil with all expedition repaire to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Lahore,</hi> twenty daies iourny from this and ſo into <hi>Perſia</hi> by the helpe of my bleſſed Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I imported vnto you ſome good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that happened vnto me ſince I wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto you the laſt yeere from the Kings Court, &amp; ſome litle part of my reſolution for the diſpoſing of a part of my time of abode in <hi>Aſia:</hi> Therefore now I will draw to a concluſion; the time I cannot limit when I ſhall come home, but as my merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God and Sauiour ſhall diſpoſe of it.

            <p>THe Coppy of a ſpeech that I made extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in the <hi>Italian tongue</hi> to a Mahometan at a Citie called <hi>Moltan</hi> in the <hi>Eaſterne India,</hi> two daies iourny beyond the famous Riuer <hi>Indus,</hi> which I haue paſſed, againſt <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Religion, vpon the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a diſcurteſie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto mee by the ſaid Mahometan in calling me <hi>Gtaur,</hi> that is infidell, by reaſon that I was a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: the reaſon why I ſpake to him in <hi>Italian,</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he vnderſtood it, hauing been taken ſlaue for many yeeres ſince by certaine Florentines in a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wherein hee paſſed from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> towards <hi>Alexandra,</hi> but being by them interrupted by the way, he was carried to a Citie called <hi>Ligorne</hi> in the Duke of <hi>Florences</hi> Dominions, where after two yeeres he had learned good <hi>Italian,</hi> but he was an Indian borne and brought vp in the Mahometan Religion. I pronounced the ſpeech before an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred people, whereof none vnderſtood it but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but hee afterward told the meaning of ſome part of it as far as he could remember it to ſome of the others alſo. If I had ſpoken thus much in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky,</hi> or <hi>Perſia</hi> againſt <hi>Mahomet</hi> they would haue roſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me vpon a ſpitt; but in the <hi>Mogols</hi> Dominions a Chriſtian may ſpeake much more freely then hee can in any other Mahometan Country in the world. The ſpeech was this as I afterward tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it into Engliſh.</p>

rediculous <hi>Alcaron</hi> doſt hope for Paradice, wherein thy Maſter <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Riuers of Rice, and to Virgins the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Angels vnder the ſhaddowe of ſpacious Trees, though in truth that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice be nothing elſe then a filthy quagmire ſo full of ſtincking dung-hils that a man cannot walke two ſpaces there but he ſhall ſtumble at a dung-hill and defile himſelfe, but where this Paradice is, not one amongſt a thouſand of you knoweth, therefore I will tell thee, it ſtandeth in a Country ſcituate betwixt Heauen and Earth called <hi>

               <p>Learning (which is the moſt precious Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell that man hath in this life, by which he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the knowledge of diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things) commeth to man either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we otherwiſe cal inſpiration, or by induſtry: Learning by reuelation I cal that which God doth infuſe from aboue by his ſpecial grace, vnto thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will vſe as the inſtruments of his glory, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour or trauell doe aſpire to a moſt eminent degree of knowledge.

neither of theſe meanes haue the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans acquired any meane, much leſſe any ſingular learning, for as <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelfe was a man of a very ſuperficiall and meane learning, ſo neuer was there any one of his Diſciples in any part of the world that was indued with any profound knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but wee Chriſtians by the one and the other meane, haue attained to the moſt exquiſite ſcience that can be incident to man: <note n="*" place="margin">I mean the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of our Sauiour.</note>ſome of our men that neuer were brought vp in Studies hauing been ſo expert in a generall learning (onely by Gods ſpeciall illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as thoſe haue ſpent forty yeeres in the practiſe thereof, and others by continuall practiſe of writing and reading, haue beene ſo excellent, that they became the very Lampes and Stars of the Countries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liued. Theſe things being ſo, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſible come to paſſe that the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God ſhould deale ſo partially with mankind as to reueale his will to a people altogether miſled in ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as you Mahometans are, and conceale
<pb facs="tcp:19146:22"/>
it from vs Chriſtians that beſtowe all our life time in the practiſe of diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane diſciplines, and in the ardent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Gods holy name with all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and purity of heart?

I pray thee let this mine anſwere be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for thee not to ſcandalize mee in the like manner any more, for the Chriſtian Religion which I profeſſe, is ſo deare and tender vnto mee that neither thou nor any other Mahometan ſhal ſcotfree call me <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aur,</hi> but that I will quit you with an anſwer muchto the wonder of thoſe Mahometans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
