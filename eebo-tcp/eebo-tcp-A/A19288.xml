            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And this may also stop the prophane mouth of the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Libertine,</hi> that though hee turne the grace of God into wantonnesse, imagining his security and senselesnesse in sinne, to bee the assurance of his happinesse, yet the Word is holy, yeelding no apperance, much lesse allowance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, yea righteous herein is the mighty Word, in giuing him vp to such a reprobate sense, through his peruerting of the chiefe errand thereof, (the mercy of God in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus to repentant sinners) which if he could rightly apply, might make him capable thereof: yea, meruailous is the wisedome of God herein, that by the contrary apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

of the promise, and preparation thereunto by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, hee confounds the peruersenesse and prophanenesse of the <hi>Libertine:</hi> If yet <hi>the filthy will be filthy still,</hi> let him know this for his further confusion, that as the Lord will not faile eft-soones, to awaken his senselesse conscience with some inward quawmes, or outward crosses to confound him in his security, that so hee may bee forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and seeke to the power of the Word, which hee hath so abased: so if for all this he will not be reclaimed, but by mistaking and mis-applying the mercy of God, shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bee cast into a deeper sleepe, the Lord shall glorifie his Word in giuing him vp to a spirit of giddinesse, euen to heape vp teachers vnto himselfe according vnto his lusts, that may answer him according to the stumbling blocke of iniquity, which he hath set vp in his heart, that so he which could not commit sinne so securely, but that his heart did sometimes smite him for the same, might new continue in it more freely and desperately, as being warranted hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by such accursed deceiuers.</p>
               <p>Behold here the wisedome of the wicked in sin; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue withall the wisedome of God in taking them in their craftines, that they may securely reuell in wickednes, their first policy is to make their conscience senselesse, and that they may bring it to this passe, their desperate wisedome is to multiply sin with greedines, that so by this custome and outrage, they may grow to an habite; and so by often put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the iron in the fire, may in the end harden and stupifie their harts: that as it falls out with those which often drinke strong payson, that in the end they can digest the same without any sense or danger, so the wicked by often drinking in of iniquitie with gréedines, become senselesse at length, both of the euill and of the danger thereof: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as they take occasion to commit any notorious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage whatsoeuer, so they become hereby obuious to the scandall and danger of the world, which cannot but take notice of what themselues are senselesse of, &amp; by it clamorus

and iust scandall, either awaken them to repentance, or conuince them to punishment. Behold how the Lord takes the wise in their craftines: They desire to be senselesse of sin, that they may commit it more greedily, and the more greedily they commit the same, the more they prouoke the world through their scandall, and it one danger, to awaken them thereout: what remedie is now left in carnall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to make vp the breach, and lull them a sléepe againe. Behold againe the hight of this wisedome in sin, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue how the Lord takes the wicked in their craftines. If <hi>Elia</hi> will Prophesy no good, but euill vnto vs while wee sleepe in sin, yet welfare <hi>Zidkiah,</hi> that will warrant good successe therein, flattering vs that wee may go vp and prosper, because hitherto it hath gone well with vs, and though he lie falsely; yet he will walke in the spirit, that hee may deceiue more effectually, yea hee wants not his rough garment of tything mint and comin, yea he will not spare herein to humble flesh by voluntary deuotions of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage penances, and such like trash to the satisfying of the flesh, euen in a great shew of wisedome to abase the same. And what now shall be spared for the sinne of the soule, though it be to the parting with our substance, yea our first borne, and all yea which is the hight of this delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shall not a greater sinne be made a price for the lesse? shall not the murther of Princes become an expiation for all our personall sinnes. Behold here the depth of the Mistery of iniquity, and admire with me the Justice of God in taking the whore and her accursed brood in their owne craftines, that while they estéeme their owne blood vile, that they may murther the Lords annoynted, they haue iustly brought the Kings of the earth vpon their heads to secure themselues in subuerting Antichrist, whom otherwise they could haue bene contented still to haue made their band for the satisfying of their lusts.

               <p>Well, thus we see how the Lord takes the wise in their craftines. That the world may securely reuel in sin, the false Prophet must bee a snare vpon <hi>Mispah</hi> to cry ayme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that so the blind leading the blind, both may fall into the ditch.</p>
               <p>And is not this prouidence of God very remarkeable, in these daungerous dayes of the contempt and peruerting of the word of God? that though the Lord feedeth the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with good and wholesome food, yet the daintie and full stomake, is either choaked with chaffe, or puffed vp with wind, that so seeming that which he is not, he may not see what truely he is, and thereby be both preuented of sound curing, and withall hardened to destruction.

               </p>
               <p>First, that the Gospell is not properly the <hi>cause</hi> of these <hi>euils,</hi> but onely 1 the <hi>ignorance</hi> thereof, 2 <hi>peruerting</hi> the light, to the <hi>iustifying of sinne,</hi> or else our want of <hi>loue,</hi> and so <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That as <hi>Ignorance</hi> breeding <hi>Error,</hi> and so <hi>Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to the truth, is the <hi>Mother</hi> of all that <hi>grosse wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> that is discouered thereby: So in that <hi>Popery</hi> is the chiefe and onely <hi>Patron of ignorance,</hi> so it becomes also the very <hi>Chaos</hi> of all <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>delusions,</hi> and so proues the <hi>maine Broker</hi> to all <hi>grosse</hi> and desperate <hi>wickednesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That whereas the <hi>weapons</hi> of <hi>Popish warfare</hi> are <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carnall</hi> and <hi>diuellish</hi> vsing these as her last refuge, when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9122:12"/>
her <hi>Paper bolts,</hi> and <hi>enchantments</hi> will not preuaile, to roote out and destroy all her <hi>opposits:</hi> as being that <hi>Scarlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured Whore,</hi> whom nothing will secure and satisfie but the <hi>bloud of Saints,</hi> and all such as shall oppose her <hi>Tyranny:</hi> Therefore, howsoeuer all <hi>other sinnes</hi> are harbored in her <hi>bosome,</hi> as beeing <hi>ashamed</hi> to haue them knowne to the world: Yet this <hi>sinne of Murther</hi> is her cheife <hi>darling</hi> and <hi>glorious sinne,</hi> whereof she is so farre from being ashamed, as that she <hi>raignes only thereby,</hi> and triumphs therewith; not onely vpon her <hi>pretended power of the secular sword,</hi> whereby she arrogates supreme authority ouer <hi>life</hi> &amp; <hi>death:</hi> But especially vpon pretence of the <hi>Power of her Keyes,</hi> whereby presuming ouer the <hi>soules</hi> as well as the bodies of men, she thereby confirmes and iustifies this her vnsatiable <hi>thirst of bloud,</hi> as either seruing for the good of their <hi>soules,</hi> whose <hi>bodies</hi> she butchered, or else by cutting off such <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Leapers,</hi> thereby <hi>securing</hi> the estates of others.

Behold the righteous doome of <hi>Iehoua</hi> against the <hi>Whore:</hi> And obserue we wisely herein, the <hi>Progeny</hi> of this bloudy sinne and issue thereof.</p>
               <p>Shall we now further way this <hi>sinne</hi> in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <note place="margin">The hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnusnesse and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this sinne.

               <p>First, then let vs <hi>measure</hi> it, by the <hi>obiect</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which is committed: and heere consider wee these <hi>particulars.</hi> First the <hi>Murtherer,</hi> doth what lies in him to take a way <hi>the life of God</hi> himselfe, in that hee destroyes his <hi>Liuely Image</hi> in <hi>Man:</hi> not so much, that outward frame and <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> were <hi>like vnto man</hi> in his outward feature, as some carnal <hi>Capernaites</hi> haue drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: as those <hi>Acts of the Diuine soule,</hi> which it exercised in the bodie, these the boudy hands, do wholy abolish, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>man in</hi> regard of his better part was made after the <hi>Image of God,</hi> yea hereby the <hi>life of God,</hi> his prouidence and other acts of his gouernment is in a manner extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in that <hi>creature</hi> who is thus by cruell hand cut off from that holie regiment.</p>

               <p n="3">3 The <hi>Murther</hi> in destroying his <hi>Brother, destroyes himselfe,</hi> not only in that his brother wasis owne flesh, but in that he necessarily exposeth himselfe either to be his <hi>owne Butcher,</hi> though the horror of his conscience, as many haue done, or else iustly lies open to the <hi>sword of the Magistrate,</hi> who aboue all other sinnes will not suffer this vnreuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>Yea, doth not the <hi>Murtherer in sinning willingly,</hi> &amp; plotting his cruelty with deliberation, and desperatenes, doth he not heerein commonly <hi>murther his owne soule,</hi> as excluding himselfe through this wilfulnes, the mercy of God.</p>
               <p>What should I speake of those fearefull euents that haue followed the same? hath not the <hi>Father murthered</hi> the <hi>sonne</hi> comming home as a stranger, for lucre of his mony, &amp; when he came to the notice thereof, did he not first <hi>murther his wife,</hi> that procured him thereto, and afterward <hi>layd violent hands vpon himselfe?</hi> And did not this accident bring his <hi>onely daughter</hi> to an <hi>vntimely end,</hi> and so the whole <hi>roote</hi> and <hi>branches</hi> were wholly cut off vtterly.

               </p>
               <p>And is not the <hi>common Parents</hi> hereby depriued of many a good <hi>member,</hi> doth not the <hi>common Mother</hi> hereby lament the losse of many a <hi>Nursing Father,</hi> and so is exposed to combustions and desolations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:9122:14"/>
Behold heere the haynousnesse of <hi>this sinne</hi> by the consideration of the <hi>Obiect,</hi> against which it was committed.</p>
               <p>And may wee not hereby also guesse at it greatnesse, in regard of the <hi>subiect</hi> that committeth the same?</p>
               <p n="1">1 Is not the <hi>Murtherer</hi> a <hi>Traytor</hi> in the highest degree, both committing <hi>treason</hi> against God, whose Image hee thus defaceth, and beeing guilty of <hi>treason,</hi> against his Prince and Countrey, whom he depriueth of their guard and glory: Is not he a <hi>Traytor</hi> to his <hi>Brother,</hi> in surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing him so cruelly? Is he not a <hi>Traytor against himselfe,</hi> in betraying his owne life and soule hereby to the graue and destruction.</p>
               <p>Surely, if of all other the <hi>hypocrite</hi> shall be <hi>beaten with many stripes,</hi> then must the <hi>Murtherer</hi> looke for his ful pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because hee <hi>crowcheth and boweth</hi> to onsnare his poore <hi>Brother,</hi> he kisseth and betrayeth, fawneth and stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, saluteth and smiteth, speakes peaceably with his tongue, when his hand is ready to shed bloud: and all this with a breath, to take away breath, and triumph more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in his masked wickednesse.</p>
               <p>What should I say, <hi>the Murtherer is an Atheist?</hi> If he thought the eye of God were vpon him, hee durst not thus wilfully deface the Image of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Murtherer is an Idolater,</hi> in defacing the Image of God, and setting vp the <hi>Idoll of reuenge</hi> in his heart, which he adores aboue all that is called God, either Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the Magistrates sword, Gods Image in his brother, his life in himselfe.</p>
               <p>In a word, as there is not any sinne wherein the <hi>Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> hath not a share, so herein is his case most fearefull, and desperate, that not sinning of infirmity but of malice, and digested hatred, as herein horesembles his <hi>father the Diuell,</hi> so hereby he casts himselfe desperately vpon his malice, to indure <hi>vnquenchable torments,</hi> for the recompence of his <hi>vnsaciable malice.</hi>

               <p>These are some causes and occasions of this grieuous sinne, vnto which, if we shall adde what may bee collected from the consideration of the <hi>subiect</hi> formerly deciphered, we may conclude, that as the <hi>want of Gods feare,</hi> is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall cause of falling into this sinne, so <hi>obstinacy and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart,</hi> proceeding there-from, doth much enflame and harden therein: yea, an enraged and <hi>guilty soule,</hi> doth oft-times prouoke hereunto, out of hellish despaire.</p>
               <p>As touching the <hi>Effects</hi> of this grieuous sinne, let that suffice which hath beene spoken concerning the haynous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, onely giue mee leaue to adde some cautions herein.</p>
               <p>That though it be a grieuous sinne to shed bloud: yet this neither doth <hi>debarre the Magistrate</hi> and his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">Two Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> from <hi>executing of Iustice</hi> against <hi>Malefactors,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>Deputies vnto the Lord</hi> herein, and haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hereunto from his <hi>Word;</hi> neither doth it priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any <hi>Priuate man</hi> vpon any instinct whatsoeuer, to presume hereunto, though some inferiour calling in the Family hath beene wickedly thought by some to warrant the same, because the power of <hi>life &amp; death,</hi> is in the hands of the <hi>Supreame Magistrate,</hi> and such as are immediately deputed from him thereunto.</p>
               <p>Though aboue all other murthers, that of <hi>our selues</hi> is most vnnaturall and monstrous: therefore, as wee may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9122:15"/>
not <hi>iustifie</hi> any such particular sinnes, by any <hi>example of Sampson,</hi> or particular instinct. So wee must bee meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous chary and tender in condemning absolutely their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, that through violence of <hi>Tentation,</hi> or such like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, haue <hi>made away themselues,</hi> because either they were not themselues in that distemper, and so it shall not be imputed vnto them, or it was done, <hi>not without some reluctation,</hi> and so the Lord may <hi>haue mercy</hi> vpon them: onely let vs be carefull not to <hi>imitate</hi> them herein, and so leaue them to the Lord, to whom they <hi>fall</hi> or <hi>stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus of the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Iudgement</hi> of this sinne.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now in the last place to consider such <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Antidotes to preuent murther.</note> as may preuent the same.</p>
               <p>The <hi>principall</hi> whereof is to <hi>maintaine peace with our God:</hi> because, if our wayes do please him, he will not only <note place="margin">To maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace with God.</note> make our <hi>enemies</hi> to be at peace with vs, that we may not feare to be prouoked, either by <hi>bridling</hi> their <hi>corruptions,</hi> as he did sometimes <hi>Labans</hi> &amp; <hi>Esaus,</hi> or <hi>turning their hearts towards vs,</hi> as he hath done the hearts of many <hi>persecutors.</hi> But will also incline <hi>our hearts</hi> to be at <hi>peace</hi> with our <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> either by giuing vs <hi>wisedome</hi> to <hi>ouercome their euill with good,</hi> or affording vs <hi>Patience</hi> to beare with our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; or sustaining vs with <hi>meeknesse,</hi> neither to prouoke, nor be prouoked by them.</p>
               <p>Now we shall wisely <hi>Maintaine peace with God.</hi> How,</p>
               <p n="1">1 If we <hi>walke closely with him</hi> according to his will, with all power and diligence, not leaning to our owne <hi>Wisedome,</hi> but relying on his reuealed word, and not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming</hi> of ought either <hi>beyond,</hi> or <hi>short</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If, <hi>though we faile and slip daily</hi> (as who can cleare himselfe therein) yet <hi>we shall daily iudge our selues,</hi> and by repentance renue our <hi>couenant</hi> with the Lord, warring daily with our corruptions, and maintaining the <hi>spirituall combat,</hi> hereby we may preserue our <hi>Peace with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 If, séeing <hi>our best workes are mixed with such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> that if the <hi>Lord</hi> should be <hi>seuere to marke what is

done amisse,</hi> euen when we doe our best, we shall neuer be able to abide it, we shall therefore daily <hi>deny our best righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi> and labour <hi>to be found in Christ,</hi> renuing our right in him: hereby we shall renue and <hi>Maintaine our Peace with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 And yet seeing <hi>the grace of God shalbe sufficient for vs,</hi> in what soeuer <hi>wants</hi> or <hi>extreamities</hi> may befall, if now we can <hi>in patience possesse our soules,</hi> not repining at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of our God, but being <hi>contented</hi> therewith in all occasions, we shall so <hi>hunger</hi> after what wee want, as that we can be <hi>thankfull</hi> for that which we <hi>haue,</hi> and so <hi>husband</hi> the same with all vprightnes and diligence to the glory of our God, and the generall good: this is an excellent meanes to maintaine Peace with God, Lastly, that we may <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Peace with God,</hi> let vs still <hi>nourish enmity</hi> against <hi>the world:</hi> because the <hi>Amity of the World is Enmity</hi> against <hi>God:</hi> so vsing the <hi>good</hi> therein, that we <hi>hate the euill</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and so vsing the <hi>good</hi> that we <hi>trust</hi> not therein, so <hi>enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the things thereof, as that we are still ready <hi>to part</hi> with them at the <hi>Pleasure of the giuer: accounting</hi> all things <hi>as doing,</hi> that we may <hi>win Christ,</hi> and yet by our wise hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie, <hi>laying vp a good foundation by them,</hi> against the day of Christ.</p>
               <p>Thus may we maintaine peace with God.</p>
               <p>A second preseruatiue against this bloody sinne is to maintaine peace with Men, I say so farre, as possible we may to haue peace with all men.</p>
               <p>This we shall do,</p>
               <p>If we be carefull to giue vnto each his due, according to their callings and occasions, as comfort to whom comfort belongs, tribute to whom tribute. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 If we can in all wrongs, <hi>looke vp to God,</hi> and <hi>so leaue vengeance vnto him,</hi> as considering wee haue deserued in his Justice a thousand fold more.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If we be <hi>quicke in prouoking</hi> to goodnesse, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing the same, and <hi>slow to wrath</hi> or any such occasions

               <p>
                  <hi>Thus may we</hi> maintaine peace with men.</p>
               <p>A third <hi>Preseruatiue</hi> against this <hi>Monstrous sin,</hi> is <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> to <hi>auoyd the occasions thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which are those before touched.</p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:9122:17"/>
Lastly, also take we some good directions how to weede it out. and here there are.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>instructions</hi> for the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> that seeing the sword is put in his hands, therefore he beware how hee suffer the <hi>Murtherer to escape,</hi> least he heare that sentence, <hi>because thou hast suffered a man to escape that was appoynted to death, therefore thy life shall go for his life, thy people for his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Whereas there hath bene of antient time (when trialls of titles depended rather vpon valour then truth) an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner of disciding great differences, by <hi>single com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> betweene <hi>two parties,</hi> this as it is vtterly vnlawfull, and so no better then <hi>murther,</hi> because they are not <hi>equall meanes</hi> to discide controuersies. And 2. It falleth out that he is <hi>Conquerour before men,</hi> who is <hi>guilty before God:</hi> therefore the <hi>Magistrate</hi> must in no wise giue way to these, lest he be guilty of the blood that is spilt hereby.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Much lesse may he tollerate those <hi>single combates,</hi> that rise vpon <hi>quarrels,</hi> and vaine <hi>pleas of reputation, Valour, disgracefull speeches,</hi> &amp;c. because they haue neither any sound <hi>warrant</hi> from the <hi>Word;</hi> no, not in any reason, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity may be endured.</p>
               <p n="4">4 As for <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> and <hi>Popish Receptacles,</hi> for <hi>Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> neither may the <hi>Magistrate</hi> allow of these, because the Lord hath expresly commanded, <hi>That such an one shall be taked from his Alter and die, Exod.</hi> 21. 14. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>Ioab</hi> was serued in the like case, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 24.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Seeing <hi>populous assemblies,</hi> vnder pretence of <hi>Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> are vsually occasions of <hi>Quarrels,</hi> and so of <hi>murthers:</hi> therefore the <hi>Magistrate</hi> must be meruailous wise, in giuing an Inch, lest the <hi>People</hi> take an Ell, rather studying to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains the vnbridled corruption of the people, with such as may humble the flesh, then to yeeld them any occasion, to turne their <hi>liberty into wantonnesse,</hi> remembring that the pretence of such liberty, hath beene the colour to draw
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9122:17"/>
vnlawfull <hi>assemblies</hi> together, and so prouoke to <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and great blood shed. Consider the blood that was spilt in iest, when <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> met together with their companies, and tell me whether that <hi>iest</hi> were not in <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> that <hi>merriment, madnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus for the <hi>Magistrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Priuate men,</hi> let them wisely obserue those rules, deliuered formerly for preuention of this sinne, and the same will also enable them to wéede it out.</p>
               <p>And thus hitherto of this bloody sinne, together with the <hi>Nature, Haynousnesse, Causes</hi> and <hi>Meanes to preuent</hi> the same.</p>
               <p>It followeth now that wee make some particular <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> hereof vnto the instance in hand, that so wee may discerne the truth of this <hi>Description,</hi> confirmed in this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:</hi> And therein wonder at the <hi>wisedome</hi> and <hi>proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God,</hi> in permitting so horrible a wickednesse, and after so long concealing thereof, in due season discouering the same.</p>

                  <hi>Maine Roote,</hi> and ground whereof, was this.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This was the first Scoene of this bloudy Tragedy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> obserue we the <hi>Roote,</hi> and foundation of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and that the rather, because it is not our owne conceit, but the sensure of the <hi>right Honorable</hi> and <hi>thrice Reuerend Iudge,</hi> who vpon <hi>Nortons</hi> appearing at the Barre, did so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9122:19"/>
for the abuse of our owne, and so as opportunity and power is on our hand, such an effecting our desires, as by the close conuayance thereof, may be free from blame or shame. Behold here then the <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>prouocations</hi> to this bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy sin, <hi>Luxurie</hi> threatens <hi>want,</hi> and feare of <hi>want</hi> breeds <hi>couetousnesse, couetousnesse</hi> leads vs blindfold to <hi>make pray</hi> where we fasten first, and <hi>opposition</hi> begets <hi>murther</hi> to conceale, or <hi>Iustifie</hi> the same.

cannot labour, and so <hi>high minded</hi> they are, that they are ashamed to begge, and therefore their <hi>last refuge</hi> is either to turne <hi>Cheators</hi> in gaming, or <hi>huntsmen on the high way,</hi> or <hi>Pandors</hi> to baudy houses, or which is the fayrest, <hi>Laysie Abby-lubbers,</hi> I should say <hi>Almes-men,</hi> to be fatted vp in the sty, and hardned to destruction.</p>
               <p>Before I passe this <hi>first Scoene,</hi> obserue wee yet one thing more in this <hi>bitter roote,</hi> namely, his manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in this <hi>Bloody Tragedy.</hi> At the first <hi>very Fayre,</hi> and charitable to the outward shew, féeding them with money, and feasting them with good cheere, sorting them with <hi>boone companions,</hi> to passe the time away mercily, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, to cheat them of their money, and make them secure: At the next bout, more roughly yet conuayed with great cunning, and secrecy, <hi>vnder pretence of Law, casting into prison,</hi> and if this will not doe the feat, then at the last, <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> &amp; <hi>confusion:</hi> iust so dealt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with the <hi>Israelits,</hi> and so this bloudy <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dealt with these <hi>Widdowes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and surely such are all the wayes of sinne, such and no <note place="margin">Vse.</note> better, is the successe of all <hi>sinners,</hi> though the wine bee pleasant in the <hi>cuppe,</hi> and sweete in the going downe, yet in the end it bites like a serpent, and kils like a Coskatrice, <note place="margin">Pro. 23.</note> though <hi>Iael</hi> inuite <hi>Sisera</hi> into her <hi>Tent,</hi> and lull him <hi>asleepe,</hi> yet in the end <hi>shee fastens him with a naile to the ground.</hi> Looke we therefore to the end of sinne, and so the sweete beginning shall not deceiue vs, and distrust wee then the wicked most, when they most fawne vpon vs, because though their <hi>lips drop hony,</hi> yet swords are in their hearts, and they may be <hi>sheathed in our bowels,</hi> before wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them.</p>

Thus when <hi>Babilon</hi> saith, shee <hi>sits as a Queene</hi> and <hi>shall see no euill,</hi> then her plagues shall come vpon her in one day, so righteous is the Lord that iudgeth the whore. Well thus <hi>these poore</hi> soules are now buried in <hi>the pond,</hi> yea <hi>a block</hi> is layd vpon them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shall not rise againe.

who were informed that <hi>Ireland</hi> had receiued them, no <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> them by their <hi>enemies,</hi> who knew well enough where they were. If <hi>guilt of sinne</hi> troubled, yet feare of discouery bit it in, and <hi>policy</hi> sought to <hi>drown the conscience</hi> by surfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in sin: that so <hi>Peace</hi> might be at home, as all was quiet abroad. And so <hi>foure yeares</hi> are passed ouer in great iollity and security. And by this time euen the memory of these murthered soules was buried with them. What now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained? Surely, where man vsually ends, there God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth: and while the wicked slept securely, the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God was bestirring it selfe.

               <p>Namely, that seeing <hi>murther</hi> is so <hi>crying a sinne,</hi> that it calls for speedy and continuall vengeance in the eares of the Lord, how notwithstanding it comes to passe, that the <hi>Lord differs the discouery</hi> and recompen<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and auenge our blood on them that dwell vpon the earth.</hi> But also by the <hi>reuenge</hi> vpon <hi>Sauls Posterity,</hi> for his

slaughter of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> which was not executed many yeeres after, and the histories of our age doe witnesse no lesse, that many murthers haue laine hid, some 20. some ten yeeres, some more, some shorter time: If wée desire to bée satisfied in the true <hi>reasons</hi> of this <hi>Diuine prouidence,</hi> 1 some may be giuen in respect of the <hi>murtherers:</hi> 2 others in regard of the <hi>murthered:</hi> 3 some concerne the <hi>Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World:</hi> and 4 some immediately concerne <hi>God himselfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>murtherers,</hi> the prouidence of God is wonderfull in deferring the <hi>discouery of their sinne,</hi> euen to a long time after, <hi>for these Reasons:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some tending to their <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others tending to their further <hi>condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those that tend to their <hi>good,</hi> are</p>
               <p>First, that by the patience of God, in deferring their discouery and vengeance, <hi>they might be prepared meane while to repentance,</hi> and so be better fitted to what end the Lord hath appoynted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the <hi>patience of the Lord</hi> towards them, if they will not make vse of it for <hi>themselues,</hi> yet hereby they may bée further <hi>seruiceable for the common good,</hi> in those places and callings wherein God hath set them: as for <hi>education of their Posterity,</hi> for the maintaining of peace and order abroad, yea happily for the sauing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, howsoeuer themselues are reprooued. So was <hi>Iudas</hi> a long time concealed from others, though long before knowne to his <hi>Master,</hi> for the execution of his calling, and seruing his Lord therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reasons</hi> tending to the <hi>condemnation</hi> of these <hi>blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suckers,</hi> are,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the Lord forbeares the <hi>discouery of them,</hi> not onely to make them <hi>Instruments of his further Iustice,</hi> in peruerting and hardening others, but also,</p>
               <p n="2">2 This forbearance is a meanes to harden them in their sinne, and drowne them in se<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urity, that so their surprizall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9122:22"/>
being more suddaine, may prooue more <hi>deadly</hi> and fatall to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Hereby they are also nourished in their <hi>Atheisme</hi> and contempt of <hi>Gods prouidence,</hi> and so prouoke the Lord in due time to auenge himselfe in their confusion.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Murthered,</hi> there may bee some <hi>Reasons</hi> of <hi>Gods silence</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> euen in regard of them. 1 That the <hi>crying of bloud from the earth</hi> so long deferred to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, may be a <hi>Simbole</hi> vnto them, of an answer from God at length, because no crie shall be in vaine, which he hath warranted in this word. 2 That the <hi>cry of Bloud,</hi> though <hi>a long time deferred,</hi> yet at length answered, may <hi>Type</hi> vnto them, <hi>their resurrection from the dead.</hi> The case herein being much alike. That as the <hi>bloud</hi> though consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yet hath a loude cry for vengeance, and shall in due time be recompenced; so the <hi>bodies,</hi> though rotten in the graue, yet because they <hi>rest in hope,</hi> doe therefore in their <hi>Manner cry for their raising vp againe,</hi> and so in due time shall obtaine their desire. <hi>Euen as the creature made subiect vnto vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him that hath subiected the same in hope, doth therefore earnestly waite</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 19 20.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Reuelation of the sonnes of God, that it also may be deliuered from her bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the Children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Touching the World.</hi> This <hi>Patience of God</hi> respecteth it also. And that, to <hi>try it affection to Gods Iustice,</hi> and such as are taken away, whither they <hi>find any want</hi> of them, whither they thinke the <hi>World is not well rid of them,</hi> and that they may be heard of no more, and such like.</p>
               <p>But the maine ground of this <hi>Prouidence</hi> is in <hi>regard of God himselfe:</hi> and that in these respects.</p>
               <p>As first to <hi>Iustifie his great Patience,</hi> to such horrible sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: whom he is so farre from taking in their sinnes, that he <hi>respites</hi> them many times to <hi>commit greater euils,</hi> that so he may make them <hi>more inexcuseable</hi> in the day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:9122:23"/>
2 <hi>His wisedome</hi> is herein magnified, that by <hi>respiting</hi> the wicked in such horrible sinnes, <hi>the guilt of the conscience</hi> is hereby so encreased, and at length <hi>enraged,</hi> that though all other meanes fayle, yet their <hi>owne tongues</hi> shall be forced to bewray them, to ease the inward pangs, and so to <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Lord</hi> euen out of their owne mouthes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Lastly, hereby <hi>the Lord reserues</hi> vnto himselfe alone the <hi>glory of his Iustice:</hi> that when all sides are husht, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers secure,</hi> the <hi>murthered forgotten,</hi> the world carelesse, all hope past: Then doth the righteous Lord make <hi>himselfe knowne by executing of vengeance,</hi> to <hi>the stopping of the mouth of Atheisme,</hi> that saith, <hi>There is no God,</hi> because the wicked scape scot-frée, and to <hi>the opening of the mouthes of his children</hi> in that gratious acknowledgment, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, doubtlesse there is a God that</hi>

                  <hi>iudgeth the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 And doth not the Lord <hi>discouer herein his absolute power?</hi> that seeing <hi>the times and seasons are onely in his hands: and therefore when he seeth a conuenient time he will execute vengeance:</hi> that it may appeare, <hi>his thoughts, are</hi>

                  <hi>not our thoughts,</hi> therefore howsoeuer we may thinke eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment too much, wherein <hi>vengeance is deferred:</hi> Yet the Lord, will <hi>deferre the time,</hi> that it may appeare to be at <hi>his dispose,</hi> and yet will do it in the <hi>most conuenient time,</hi> which may <hi>make</hi> most for <hi>his glory,</hi> and affecting of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and faithlesse generation.</p>
               <p>And this may serue for the resoluing of this case of Conscience.</p>
               <p>And thus farre <hi>of this third Scaene of this bloudy Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning (as the two former) the <hi>Parties</hi> that <hi>were Murthered,</hi> together with the <hi>manner thereof,</hi> and <hi>meanes to conceale the same.</hi>

Now har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I beseech you, to the second part of the Tragedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Murtherers.</p>
               <p>And here first are presented vnto you, as in a <hi>dumbe shew,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:9122:25"/>
the <hi>carcases</hi> of the <hi>Murthered</hi> raised out of the <hi>Pond</hi> by a <hi>Diuine Instinct,</hi> and in a strange and wonderfull manner, <hi>discouering</hi> and <hi>fastning</hi> vpon the <hi>Murtherers,</hi> and these be the <hi>Actors</hi> in this first <hi>Scoene.</hi> Will you heare the <hi>truth</hi> thereof confirmed by the <hi>story,</hi> then hearken I say againe vnto that which followeth, and conclude with the <hi>worthy Iudge,</hi> that it was <hi>Digitus Dei, the immediate Finger of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pond</hi> wherein these <hi>bodies lay</hi> (you must imagine had a Maister) that occupied the <hi>Farme</hi> and ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was, vnto whose custody the <hi>Lord</hi> hauing committed in trust these slaughtered soules, doth now require of him the discouery and restoring of them, for the satisfying of his Justice. But would you know the manner how the Lord required them of <hi>Him?</hi> marke I beséech you, and wonder at the <hi>wisedome</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> herein. Because the <hi>bloud of the slaine</hi> could not cease crying for vengeance, till they were recompenced: Therefore the <hi>Farmer</hi> can haue no <hi>Peace</hi> in his <hi>mind,</hi> till he clense the Pond, that so their blood may be discouered. Wil you sée the <hi>Hand of God</hi> more cléer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>reiecting the wisedome of the flesh,</hi> and subduing all oppositions, to serue his will? Consider then I pray you the sequell hereof. The <hi>Farmer</hi> cannot rest till the <hi>Pond</hi> be cleased. <hi>Why?</hi> His owne <hi>profit</hi> was against it, because it would be great charge and no benefit to him, that had but a short time to enioy it. And therefore his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> are also against it, as consulting no <hi>Further</hi> then with flesh and bloud. But <hi>God</hi> was <hi>for it,</hi> and therefore he must be <hi>for God,</hi> or else he shall not be for himselfe, nothing will go gowne well with him, till this be done. And therefore he is resolute, it shall be done. Well at length, with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, he sets workemen about it, but <hi>God</hi> will not be <hi>serued by deputies</hi> in so glorious a worke: he that had the <hi>sowre,</hi> while it was not done, shall haue the <hi>sweete</hi> and comfort in doing it himselfe. And therefore when <hi>workemen</hi> giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as dispairing of the successe, or being happily discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by friends, <hi>Himselfe,</hi> with his <hi>Brother,</hi> sets vpon the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9122:25"/>
clensing of the <hi>Pond.</hi> Surely we must imagine, not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profit he expected thereby, for he could not finish it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great <hi>cost</hi> and <hi>losse</hi> too: but the <hi>maine ground</hi> was, his mind must be satisfied, nay to looke vp higher, <hi>Gods iustice must be satisfied,</hi> that so the glory thereof may be reserued intirely to himselfe alone: and therefore when that is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, his mind is at quiet, and his <hi>labour</hi> is at an <hi>end:</hi> and so the feare of his charge, and losse graciously preuented. Shall we obserue how the <hi>Lord</hi> brought all this about, and that with great <hi>speed,</hi> and <hi>wisdome</hi> for his glory. Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and wonder at the <hi>Wisedome of God</hi> herein. The <hi>worke</hi> is begun in the <hi>likeliest place</hi> for labour and carriage, but the Lord will spare the poore mans labour, he meanes not to put him to that cost, as to lade and clense the <hi>whole Pond;</hi> but onely to <hi>discouer the Murthered therein.</hi> And yet he meanes to <hi>abase Him,</hi> in this discouery, euen by the <hi>bruit beasts</hi> that hath no vnderstanding. Will you see the <hi>proofe</hi> hereof in the sequell of the <hi>Story,</hi> Oh marke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and wonder at the wisedome of God herein. Our <hi>workmen</hi> by this time had made worke for the <hi>Teame:</hi> The <hi>Horses</hi> they are brought to the place of their loading. But this is not the <hi>Loade</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> will haue carried out: and therefore the <hi>Horses</hi> will not stay here, howsoeuer they smart, but away they must, where <hi>God</hi> will haue them: Man now must bee <hi>lead</hi> by them, because they are <hi>lead</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> that so the glory of the discouery may be taken from man, and ascribed wholly vnto the <hi>Lord.</hi> And so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much triall and leading them about the <hi>Pond,</hi> they stay at length against the <hi>Place</hi> where the <hi>Bodies</hi> lay, &amp; so gaue ayme to the workmen to renue their labour. And did they find it lost labour, to attend the Lord? No surely, they had not labored many houers, vntill they light vpon the <hi>Bodies</hi> that made amends for all. The <hi>Carcases</hi> are found, <hi>Time</hi> and corruption hauing lest nothing else, and so the <hi>Murther</hi> being <hi>discouered,</hi> the <hi>mind</hi> is at <hi>quiet,</hi> and the <hi>labour</hi> is at an <hi>end,</hi> farther cost is spared, and God hath the <hi>glory,</hi> in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9122:26"/>
vse of <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>brutish</hi> meanes. <hi>Thus of the first part of this first Scoene, namely, the discouery of the Murther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Proceed wee now vnto the <hi>second part</hi> hereof, namely, the <hi>discouery of the murcherers.</hi> And herein also obserue with me a <hi>wonderfull and immediate hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had these <hi>Parties</hi> bene <hi>newly slaine,</hi> their <hi>blood</hi> is vsually a meanes to <hi>peach their murther;</hi> or had their <hi>flesh</hi> not bene <hi>wasted,</hi> and <hi>countenance remayned,</hi> this might haue giuen <hi>some light to</hi> discerne their qualitie and condition; and so to haue made some way for the finding out of the murtherers, but that <hi>carkases</hi> onely of <hi>bare bones,</hi> and those haply <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered,</hi> should haue any <hi>remaindures</hi> left, whereby they might be knowne what they were from others, and so bee meanes to <hi>make knowne the murtherers,</hi> seeing this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all sense, and reason, it must needs be ascribed to to the <hi>finger of God,</hi> euen in such <hi>impossibility</hi> yeelding some <hi>light</hi> to the <hi>discouery</hi> both of the <hi>murthered,</hi> who they were, and also of <hi>the murtherers.</hi> Will you see the <hi>proofe</hi> hereof in the sequele of the <hi>story, oh</hi> then stir vp your harts to wonder at the <hi>prouidence of God.</hi> The <hi>carcases</hi> being thus found, and so <hi>murther</hi> being <hi>discouered,</hi> yet the <hi>great matter</hi> still remained, that <hi>Gods iustice must bee satisfied</hi> in finding out the <hi>offenders;</hi> and that these may be discouered, it is very fit to know <hi>who the murthered were,</hi> that so from them and theirs, matter may be gathered to <hi>sent</hi> out the <hi>murtherers.</hi> The next thing therefore now to bee done, is to find out who the <hi>murthered were.</hi> And because this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concernes, nor indeed is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He taking notice of this <hi>discouery,</hi> causeth the <hi>carcases</hi> to be <hi>taken</hi> charily out the <hi>mud,</hi> and vsing the helpe of a <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon</hi> herein, caused each <hi>carcase</hi> to bee layd out seuerally by it selfe, in it <hi>proportion,</hi> to farre as the bones would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it, and so making <hi>speciall fearch</hi> into each <hi>carcase,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

To this end the <hi>inhabitants</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about were called vnto this spectacle, and so inquiry made amongst them concerning such parties, as were missing within compasse of remembrance: amongst these the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of these children calls to minde hers, that haue beene missing, and with all remembers, what hath bene formerly related to her concerning the same, both how they were <hi>gone for Ireland,</hi> which was the generall voyce, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally she remembers what <hi>Worlich,</hi> one of the <hi>Accessaries</hi> (if not a <hi>Principall)</hi> had told her many months before, <hi>that he had seene her sonne in the Low countries, and was the last man that had him by the hand aliue and dead.</hi> Hereupon <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,</hi> and so much the rather, because vpon the discouery of these in the <hi>pond, Worlich</hi> playd least in sight, and flying to <hi>Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> was there <hi>apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded</hi> vpon this <hi>euidence:</hi> but yet the day was but dawning, more light shortly appeared, by the <hi>wisedome of the Iustice,</hi> the <hi>carcases</hi> were <hi>searched,</hi> and <hi>measured:</hi> And hereupon question made to the <hi>Mother</hi> what markes she could discouer to own them. See the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God herein: all <hi>outward tokens</hi> might seeme to fayle, yet <hi>one</hi> remayned; her <hi>sonne Iohn</hi> was high of stature, <hi>sixe foote long,</hi> this she calls to minde, and ownes him thereby, and so the <hi>measure</hi> of the <hi>carcase</hi> giues him her. And so <hi>one sparke</hi> begets another. Now the remembers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that her <hi>sonne Iohn</hi> had <hi>two teeth broken out of</hi> his <hi>vpper iaw</hi> by a former accident, and the <hi>scull</hi> being <hi>searched</hi> approues the same: and so <hi>both markes</hi> concurring vpon the <hi>same carcase,</hi> the <hi>length</hi> and <hi>iaw marke:</hi> hereby vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conclusion was made, that, that <hi>carcase</hi> was her <hi>sonne Iohns,</hi> and thus by <hi>the one</hi> discouered, the other were gessed also to be hers, the <hi>brother and sister</hi> that 2 <hi>yeares after were cast into</hi> the pond, because they lay in one graue together, and therefore were like to lie in one belly: and so <hi>collected,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:9122:27"/>
that they that <hi>murthered</hi> the <hi>former,</hi> made <hi>also these latter</hi> away, as vsing <hi>one common graue</hi> to <hi>burie</hi> them in. Now all the <hi>mistery</hi> was, who should be the <hi>murtherer</hi> of the <hi>first:</hi> sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition there might be in regard of <hi>Norton,</hi> and his dealings with them formerly, as also of such <hi>instruments</hi> imployed by him to <hi>molest</hi> and oppresse them.

These things were now called to minde by many, to nourish sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion: but yet this was not <hi>sufficient</hi> directly to <hi>chalendge the partie.</hi> Behold then the wisedome and power of God, in making the <hi>Partie</hi> to <hi>chalenge himselfe:</hi> and that by <hi>that meanes,</hi> whereby he sought to hide his sin, and elude iustice. For hearing that such a <hi>scull wanted such teeth,</hi> and so was thereby <hi>owned</hi> by the <hi>mother,</hi> his <hi>guilty conscience</hi> drawes him to the <hi>pond,</hi> and yet in a shew of wisedome, to bewray him the more: he hopes if that <hi>marke bee defaced,</hi> the <hi>eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> wilbe <hi>confounded:</hi> and therefore he takes away the <hi>scull</hi> with him, and foole as he was, that might haue knockt them out himselfe, yet first goes to <hi>a barbar</hi> to plucke out more teeth, that hee might bee a <hi>witnesse</hi> against him: and that out of the mouth of <hi>two or three witnesses</hi> the truth might be confirmed, loe the <hi>barbars</hi> toole shall not do the feat: and therefore vengeance sends this murther to the <hi>smith,</hi> and he at length serues his turne, to <hi>witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</hi> And yet the <hi>sort</hi> must heape more coales one his head, and that in a <hi>shew of wisedome</hi> to <hi>bewray him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi> further: he comes to a <hi>woman</hi> thereby (that knew him well enough &amp; had obserued his <hi>comming</hi> &amp; <hi>going</hi> from the <hi>Pond and doings</hi> there) yet I say he comes like a <hi>stranger,</hi> as hearing of such <hi>strange newes,</hi> and desirous to satisfie his <hi>curious eye</hi> therewith, enquires of her, <hi>where these car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases lay,</hi> she replies vnto him, that hee need make no such enquiry, he was <hi>better acquainted therewith,</hi> and charges

               <p>Well, thus we haue found out one of the <hi>Murtherers,</hi> or rather he hath offered himselfe vnto vs vnsought for, or rather indeede, the <hi>Lord</hi> hath brought him to the <hi>Barre,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his owne wisedome. And so we may also conclued of <hi>Worlich,</hi> faine would he haue béene gone, but the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:9122:28"/>
arrested him at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> with a fearefull sicknesse, and brought him backe againe, and his owne mouth must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray him, to be <hi>priuy,</hi> at least, to the murther, when he told the <hi>Mother,</hi> that hee <hi>was the last man that had Iohn by the hand aliue and dead, in the Low-Countries:</hi> It being proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he was neuer there, and expounded wisely, by the <hi>Reuerend</hi> Lord Chiefe Justice, that he meant by the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> the <hi>bottome</hi> of the <hi>Pond.</hi> So now we haue two of the Actors, or at least, <hi>Accessaries,</hi> time will shortly (God willing) discouer others that are in hold.</p>
               <p>Meane while, blesse we the Lord, for this discouery hitherto, And iustifie we his prouidence in méeting with <hi>sinners in their kinde,</hi> euen by their owne mouthes. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, take we heede of <hi>wisedome in sinne,</hi> because it will prooue greatest <hi>foolishnesse</hi> in the end. Blesse we the Lord for <hi>good Magistrates,</hi> that will sift and bolt out hidden wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse: and pray we heartily for their liues and welfare, by whose meanes we enioy our liues and liuelihoods: yea, that which is most precious aboue all, the hope of <hi>life to come,</hi> in the liberty of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> being wise in our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall places, to shame and discouer sinne, that so wee may bee kept from <hi>participation</hi> and <hi>danger,</hi> there-from, and yet charitable in couering the <hi>infirmities of our Brethren,</hi> least otherwise casting them off by our rigor and indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee force them to breake out through despaire, into desperate wickednesse.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>y that which formerly hath beene related, concerning the discouery of the <hi>murtherers,</hi> and such euidences alleadged thereunto, howsoeuer it may séeme the <hi>matter to bee so cleere,</hi> as that it neede no further triall, yet this being but a preparatiue to ripen the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, that so it might haue it publicke and iudiciall triall at the Barre: It shall be very necessary to adde somewhat concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>solemnity,</hi> of that honorable trial, to the stopping of all gain-saying lippes, and to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of Gods glory, in such righteous proceeding. And heere to say nothing of the <hi>manner of these Trials</hi> by witnesses to proue the fact, and <hi>Iurers</hi> to finde the same, (a course so warrantable, both by the practice of God himselfe, and all Nations, euen by the instinct of Nature, that it shall bee in vaine to light a candle when the Sunne shineth so cleerely:) Giue me leaue, I pray you, to poynt at some things especially remarkeable in this Triall, for the more cléere <hi>iustifying,</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> thereof. As,</p>
               <p>First, that whereas out of the <hi>mouth of two or three witnesses euery truth shall stand:</hi> we haue not onely heere apparant <hi>circumstances,</hi> euen from the mouth and actions of the <hi>Delinquents,</hi> to conuince them sufficiently of the Fact, but also no lesse then 28. Euidences were taken by the <hi>worthy Iustice,</hi> all of great moment, by way of <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> and consequence to proue the same: whereof, though no more then 18. were produced at the Barre, because time (which there is precious) would haue béene otherwise taken vp, and those that were produced in the iudgement of the Honourable <hi>Iudge,</hi> were sufficient, yea, more then enough: yet who could desire more then so many Euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, especially, seeing the rest all aymed at the same end? so cléere was this Triall, so fully iustified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas exception against Witnesses, as it is vsually admitted in honourable Trials so being deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may seeme to challenge the equity of them, this is also
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9122:29"/>
obseruable for the iustifying of this <hi>Triall,</hi> that howsoeuer the accused were obstinate in denying, or faint in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the fact: yet, as there was no iust reason, why they should except against the witnesses, so either they did not except against them at all, or onely made such cauils, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not consonant to reason, or did confound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by their contradiction, or were but triflings to differ or elude Justice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas in such infamous and strange cases, for the further conuiction of them. The <hi>voyce of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is as the voyce of God,</hi> that what generally is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and auouched, by the generallity, carries with it some warrant of truth: it may bee obserued also for the further <hi>iustifying of this Triall,</hi> there hath not beene hard of a more generall consent of the people in any Trialls, desiring the discouery of the truth, and approuing, yea, applauding the detection thereof, then was manifest at this triall.</p>
               <p>Lastly, If <hi>contraries may be gathered by their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> seeing it is the policy and malice of Satan, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the light most, when it shiues most cléerely, may not the obstinacy of <hi>Land,</hi> in opposing such cleere and manifest Euidence, that was brought against him, as prouing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more effectuall to harden his heart, by making him des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, the more cleerely he was conuinced thereby, may not this obstinacy, I say, of that accursed wretch, serue much more to iustifie <hi>the truth of this honorable Triall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I touch this last poynt of speciall purpose, both to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the wise in this particular, whereat the ignorant vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stumble, and also to stop the mouth of all gaine-saying herein. For why should it seeme strange to any, that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders should so differ in the issue of their conuiction, that the one should be <hi>penitent,</hi> and <hi>confesse the fact,</hi> as <hi>Worlich</hi> in part hath done, by referring himselfe to the mercy of the Judge, the other should still remaine obstinate, euen to the death, in the iustifying of himselfe. Haue we not examples of the like in the <hi>Booke of God,</hi> one thiefe beeing penitent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9122:29"/>
on the <hi>Crosse,</hi> and the other continuing obstinate to the death. And may not the eternall decree of God, of two in a bed, electing the one, and reiecting the other, iustifie the execution thereof, in the very last breath, the one iustifying his sinne on the Gallowes, and so condemning himselfe, the other acknowledging his fault, and so interessing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the mercy of God. And is there not apparant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this desperate obstinacy? may not common course preuaile in this case, which is to pleade not guilty to the Fact?</p>
               <p>May not hope of life induce thereunto, thereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, if it may be, with a corrupt, or pittifull and <hi>Ignorant Iurie,</hi> and when once we haue denied the Fact, may not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite or obstinacy continue in that note? Is it not too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that many preferring their credit and good of their Posterity, before their conscience and benefit of their soules, doe therefore stand obstinate in the deniall of that, which their <hi>owne conscience co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinceth them of:</hi> What else meant y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> answer of <hi>Gardiner</hi> to <hi>Bishop Day,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he exorted him on his death-bed, to trust onely in the mercy of Christ, and renounce all Popish trash and selfe-deseruing. Did not the conscience of that <hi>Bloud-sucker</hi> conuince him of the truth? And yet did the glory and credit of his profession carry him contrary in that reply, <hi>that if that gap were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all would be gone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, may not such consequences follow hereupon, that if they confesse the truth, others shal be drawne in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and so either by bribery or flattery, compassion, or such like, many are contented to sell away their owne soules to Satan, for the preseruing of others.</p>
               <p>Doe not these things vsually fall out, and might not <hi>Land</hi> bee hardened in his sinne, by some or all these meanes? Howsoeuer let him die in his sinne, and let vs liue to glorifie God, in making a holy vse of these things: though not absolutely iudging of any by their ends: yet wisely iudging of the end, by the former life: that they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9122:30"/>
which liue desperately, doe vsually die obstinately: And so let vs by the ends of such men, labour to reforme our liues, taking héede of custome in sinne, and hardening our hearts therein, lest when we would, we cannot leaue it, and when we cannot leaue it, we grow to iustifie it, and so not onely die therein, but dye eternally thereby. Concerning further Guidences, and Acts of the <hi>Iurie,</hi> because they are onely matters of Forme, or needlesse in so great light, I willingly passe them ouer, resting myselfe on such collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as I haue gathered for the iustifying of the <hi>Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</hi>

And so according thereunto, Justice administred without respect of persons, &amp; yet with great wisedome, according to the different degrees and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in the committing of the Crime. Heere is no

admittance of <hi>Sanctuarie,</hi> nor any such like protection to frustrate the course of Justice, and nuzling of the wicked in their sinne; so happy are we that God hath taken from our necks that cruell and bloody yoake of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> who not onely maintained his owne tyranny by blood, but also protected others therein: And yet much more in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect miserable, if we shall not bee more thankefull for the <hi>light of the Gospell,</hi> and improoue the time of our visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with more profit and aduantage.

                  <p>YOu Prisoners at the barre, whose liues now stand wayting vpon death, as you looke vp to vs with feare, so wee looke downe vpon you with sorrow. Your feare is to receiue punishment for your mis-doing, and our sorrow is that wee must pronounce it. Yet not without hope to bring you to Repentance, which may gaine you pardon for your sin. But as wee haue the commaundement of God, to warrant, and comfort vs herein, that the malefactor must die: so wee hartily desire of God, that your condemnation may not bee of death vnto death, but rather a meanes to a better life.</p>
                  <p>Now in these cases three things best befit a Iudge, which are Discretion, Correction, and Comfort.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 <hi>Discretion,</hi> to make an offender know his fault.</item>
                     <item>2 <hi>Correction,</hi> to Pronounce, and inflict the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Comfort,</hi> that notwithstanding the denouncing, and inflicting of the punishment yet so to prepare the delinquent vnto death, that he may find life in death, and so see heauen vpon earth, before the world leaues him, and he the world.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Concerning the knowledge of your fault, that will best appeare by your acknowledgment thereof. For without this acknowledgment, there can be no sound Repentance. Thus did God himselfe deale with his seruant <hi>Dauid</hi> in those his vncleane and bloody facts, first to bring him to the sight of those sinnes, he put the case by another, and so brought
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9122:31"/>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> to pronounce sentence vpon himselfe, so my desire is, that each of you would make <hi>Dauids</hi> case your owne. And as in the like facts you would bee ready, in another mans case to pronounce sentence as he did, against the man that had dealt so cruelly; so now to make his example your paterne, to make it your owne case. That as hee being conuinced by the <hi>Prophet</hi> to bee the man, whom he had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the like case of another, was thereby brought to an acknowledgement of his owne sin, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a gratious acquittance: so you also being now conuicted of your heauy and bloody facts, by such apparant euidence: may by <hi>Dauids</hi> example, bee brought to an acknowledgement thereof, and so with <hi>Dauid</hi> obtaine an answere of the pardon of your sin: howsoeuer for the satisfying of the world, and humbling of the flesh, you are like with <hi>Dauid</hi> to answere bloud for bloud.</p>
                  <p>The second thing I noted was <hi>Correction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the better to prepare you for it, tell mee you poore soules that haue had a great portion of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row by your imprisonment, if these three things do not now trouble you more then euer before, that is, <hi>Sorrow, Shame</hi> and <hi>Feare.</hi>

                  <list>

                     <item>2 <hi>Shame</hi> for your present facts.</item>
                     <item>3 <hi>Feare</hi> not so much of your present punishment, which ends in the punishment: as of the iudgement to come, bringing with it eternall torments, and yet beginning but where the other ends.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>To begin with this <hi>last:</hi> (because if it had beene

well remembred by you, it might haue preuented the former, and yet being well applyed may release you from the latter:) that you may take a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression <hi>of that great and generall Assizes.</hi> Be you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, not so much to looke vpon <hi>Vs,</hi> who haue only power <hi>to kill the body,</hi> as to looke vp vnto the <hi>Lord,</hi> who hath power <hi>to destroy both body and soule:</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his <hi>last and dreadfull comming in the clouds,</hi> where each of you must appeare personally, without <hi>Deputy, delay,</hi> or <hi>Aduocate, to receiue according to your workes which you haue done in your bodies, be they good or euill.</hi>

                  <p>And that you may preuent the extremity of that <hi>Iugdement;</hi> my aduice vnto you is, that you would <hi>erectin a iudgement seate your owne soules,</hi> iudging your selues by the euidence of your owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that so you may not be iudged of the Lord. So did <hi>Dauid</hi> obtaine the pardon of his sinne, he had no sooner iudged himselfe for his sinnes: and <hi>confessed</hi> them vnto the <hi>Lord,</hi> but the <hi>Lord forgaue him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of them all:</hi> and no sooner shal you acknowledge your selues <hi>worthy to die,</hi> but the Lord will answere you, <hi>you shall not die, but liue.</hi> For if you be now <hi>dead in sin,</hi> by hardening your harts <hi>in the deniall</hi> thereof: though you be <hi>liuing to the world,</hi> yet you are <hi>dead vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God,</hi> and so shall <hi>neuer die</hi> out of the <hi>punishment of sin,</hi> how soeuer you be <hi>euer dying in the horror thereof.</hi> But if you shall now <hi>dievnto sin</hi> by vnfayned <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> though you may <hi>die for your sin,</hi> by the hand of <hi>man,</hi> yet you shall <hi>liue for euer without sin,</hi> by the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God.</hi> And therefore howsoeuer you must die
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9122:32"/>
temporally to satisfie the Law, yet remember, this is but of <hi>the body,</hi> and that for a time: and consider with all that there is <hi>another death co come, both of body and soule,</hi> wherein you shall <hi>die eternally from-God,</hi> and yet <hi>liue eternall to intollerable torments.</hi> Consider then I pray you <hi>the Terrour of that great day:</hi> where the <hi>fire</hi> howsoeuer <hi>spirituall,</hi> yet shall thereby bee the <hi>more intollerable;</hi> and yet <hi>the conscience</hi> shalbe <hi>more stinging,</hi> then the <hi>fire tormenting:</hi> and the <hi>euerlasting exclusion from the presence of God,</hi> shall make vp the measure of those vnsufferable torments. If they were but for a <hi>hundred,</hi> or a <hi>thousand,</hi> nay a <hi>million of yeares:</hi> yet there were some hope at length of <hi>release:</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the <hi>worme neuer dyeth,</hi> the <hi>fire neuer goet out, because the wrath of God like a riuer of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, doth continually maintaine the same.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>And this by Gods mercy, may <hi>worke in you that hartie and seasonable sorrow</hi> for your present sinnes, whereby you may prepare to your present ends, and so preuent those endles torments.

of the Fact: Wherein, as he did not obscurely bewray himselfe, at least an accessary, though not so cleerely and particularly as was expected for his comfort, yet he spared not to challenge his fellow, standing obstinate on the dent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and by many circumstances conuicted him to<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

And yet behold the power of Gods iustice preuayling on his conscience, though he would not confesse his sinne in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, yet he acknowledged to his shame, what the world tooke too much notice of, and himselfe did formerly <hi>much glory in,</hi> that <hi>he was much delighted in Drunkennnsse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;</hi> yea, which was the hight of his sin, he was <hi>strong to be are his drinke,</hi> and so gloried to draw others into the same excesse, that so hee might pride himselfe in his great power, that could out drinke others, and thereby also more easily make prey of them.
