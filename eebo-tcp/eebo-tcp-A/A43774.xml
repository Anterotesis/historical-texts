            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ood, Drink, and Rayment, are the prime Requiſites of Humane Life. Of Drinks, the Juice of the <hi>Grape</hi> is eſteemed the most Generous; But ſince Providence has not Indulged every Nation with <hi>That</hi> of its own Growth; and for that, tho' the more <hi>Southern</hi> Countrys Enjoy it, yet the more <hi>Northern</hi> that are without it, do by the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Climate moſt ſtand in <hi>need</hi> of ſtrong Drinks; And ſince Ale and Beer is too Cloudy and heavy; and to furniſh themſelves with <hi>Wine,</hi> they exhauſt yearly a great part of their Treaſure and Native Commodities; I thought, if I could find out and inform that part of the World, how to prepare a ſort of Liquor which might Anſwer all the <hi>Ends</hi> and Advantages of <hi>Wine,</hi> and yet be of Your <hi>own</hi> Countries Production, and afforded much <hi>Cheaper,</hi> I might Deſerve well of Your Majeſties and Lordſhips, and all Your Subjects, both now and to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>That which nearest approaches the Nature of <hi>Wine,</hi> is the Juice of <hi>Apples,</hi> Wildings, Pears and other Fruits, (commonly called Cyder, Perry, Currant, Cherry and Gooſeberry-Wine <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And with all or ſome of theſe, Your reſpective Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are, or may be plentifully Furniſht. The Defect hitherto has been, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>few</hi> have applyed themſelves to making of Cyder.

            <p>For all theſe Inconveniences, Here is found a proper and certain <hi>Remedy</hi>; The <hi>SECRET</hi> is brought home to Your Doors, and in the Following Papers ſpread before You; So that hencefoth, after a little Induſtry, You need not (<hi>for</hi> General uſe) be beholden to any Forreiner, for their <hi>Wines</hi> but Furniſh Your ſelves as

well, and abundantly Cheaper, at Home, and Drink for Your own <hi>Healhs,</hi> without Deſpiſing the Diſcoverer in Variety of Liquors of <hi>Your own</hi> Production, altogether <hi>as good</hi> and Satisfactory.</p>
            <p>How this Overture may be Reſented, I am not <hi>Prophet</hi> enough to fore-ſee; The Incredulity of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh (tho justly numbred amongſt the <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt</hi> Monarchs of that Age) is reported by ſome Authors to have cost him the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe loſs of the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Treaſures, which have ſince Enricht all the Kings, Princes, and States of <hi>Europe</hi>: And even <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Importunities of his Lady <hi>Iſabella,</hi> for accepting that proffer'd Prize, and the Diſcovery of that <hi>New World,</hi> from a deſpiſed <hi>Columbus.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Preſent thing, or my ſelf may be <hi>Cenſur'd</hi> or <hi>Contemn'd</hi> at firſt; yet without the leaſt doubt I believe, that a time will come, wherein all or moſt of the Kings, Princes, and States, or at leaſt their Subjects, in thoſe Nations that have <hi>no Wines</hi> of their own, may have Cauſe to Rejoice either in the <hi>Uſe</hi> or <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> which themſelves may make thereof; And that too, without Raiſing any Burthenſome <hi>Taxes,</hi> or putting their Subjects to heavy Charges.</p>
            <p>For as it muſt undoubtedly be of great Profit to all Nations that are unfurniſht with Wine of their own Production, eſpecially, thoſe whoſe <hi>Soil</hi> will afford the Materials (In which reſpect I forget not the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> to whom I made my Endeavours to tranſmit my Propoſals, but by reaſon of the remote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ſmall Entercourſe from hence thither, I could not gain an Opportunity; However I cannot but Recommend it as a thing of great Moment to that Renouned King and Nation, their Countrey being as proper for it as any in the World) ſo as for Climates which yield not Fruits Neceſſary, they will yet however Fare much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too, ſince <hi>leſs VVines</hi> being ſpent in thoſe Nations that uſed to take off the greateſt Quantities (<hi>viz.</hi> two or three Millions worth of Wines and Brandy's <hi>per Annum</hi>) The French, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> must then be neceſſiated to force a Trade, by ſelling them much <hi>Cheaper,</hi> than ever they would have done, were it not for this Diſcovery.</p>

            <p>VVHereas our Soveraign Lord the King, hath been Graciouſly Pleaſed by his Royal Letters Patent, to give and grant unto Me and Partners, the ſole Uſe and Benefit of my Invention in the enſuing Treatiſe Diſcovered; With all the Profits and Advantages that may, can, or ſhall be made thereof; With prohibition to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from doing or imitating the ſame, within all His Majeſties Dominions; For and during the Term of Fourteen Years.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as ſuch our Invention may be very deſirable, uſeful, and beneficial to all or moſt part of his Majeſties Subjects; Therefore to the intent, They may not be with-holden from the ſame, Notwitſtanding it might be abundantly moſt for our particular advantage to keep it in our Hands, and Reſerve it wholly to our ſelves, ſince it is, That we might gain Five or Six Pound by every Hogſhead, when no ſuch is made in our Nation, but by our ſelves. Yet nevertheleſs to demonſtrate the Greatneſs of our Zeal to the Publick; and how ready we are to poſtpone our private Intereſts thereunto; That no reaſonable perſon may have any Colour to Complain; And that all that are willing, may have the opportunity to make ſufficient Benefit of this our Invention; We do by theſe Preſents declare, That we are willing and content, That this our ſaid Invention ſhall be free to all His Majeſties Subjects in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> Upon the Terms, Limitations, and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That every Perſon that ſhall or will ſell the ſaid <hi>Cyder</hi>-Royal, or other Liquors herein after mentioned, either by Wholeſale or Retail, ſhall year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have a Deputation or Allowance from us ſo to do, paying us One and Twenty Shillings and Six-pence <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That any of His Majeſties Subjects in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> paying the like Sum of Twenty One Shilling Six-pence, ſhall for the whole Term of Fourteen Years have the like Deputation or Allowance, to practice or uſe the ſame for his particular uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far, as to make <hi>Cyder</hi>-Royal, and all or any the aforeſaid Liquors, to be ſpent by themſelves and their Reſpective Private Families. And to entertain their Friends therewith in their own Houſes; provided they do not fell, or otherwiſe diſpoſe thereof.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This is the method we propoſe, The Termes whereof are ſo eaſy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97747:4"/>
to thoſe to whom they are offered; That we hope no Loyal Subject may have the leaſt Cauſe to diſlike; Nor any be found ſo unreaſonably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as to oppoſe or contemn the Authority of His Majeſties Gracious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patent, or to envy the Patentees ſo ſmall a Conſideration and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, who out of Love and Good-will to the Publick, are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that which will not amount to one tenth part of the benefit vve might make thereof, if we kept the thing wholly in our own particular Hands and Management.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſing theſe our reaſonable Terms may be readily Embrac'd, we ſhall be Content to abide by and continue the ſame. But however, foraſmuch as we know, That there are a diſcontented troubleſome and envious ſort of people in the VVorld, who are naturally apt not only to envy and abuſe them whom they are beholding to, for their own VVelfare; but alſo delight to affront and contemn the Authority of His Majeſties Laws and Royal Prerogative there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to Venders, <hi>viz.</hi> All ſuch as ſell either by VVholeſale or Retale, vve intend their Deputations or Licences ſhall be but from one year to another; To the intent, that in caſe the method we have propoſed be thwarted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be obſtructed, we may the next year, take to our ſelves the ſole benefit of our Invention granted; And thoſe only to have the ſelling and uttering thereof as ſhall give ſecurity to take it of our ſelves and no others.</p>
            <p>But for thoſe that ſell it not, they upon ſending in their money as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, ſhall freely enjoy the ſame, for our whole Term, upon the condition before offered.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That this way of improving <hi>Cyder, &amp;c.</hi> by me diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is ſo obvious and eaſy, that it deſerves not the Honour of being called a Project or Invention.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>I</hi> crave leave to anſwer—1. That every thing ſeems eaſy when 'tis known, and yet if it be a uſeful thing, thoſe that knew it not before, will be ungrateful not to Acknowledge an obligation to him that firſt taught them. 2. <hi>If</hi> it ſeem now ſo plain when you find it here diſcovered, it vvas lately not ſo; for elſe how came it not to be practiced before? Nay, (though 'tis not difficult to add to things once found out) yet the ordinary Objector, even after I have given the hint, and in general diſcloſed the thing, would perhaps find it not very eaſy to advance his Liquors to the propoſed perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without conſulting thoſe Rules and Inſtructions which I have here laid down, having by frequent Trials and Experiments found them moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The Old Fable is ſignificative, of the Mag-Pye reaching the Wood Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to build a Neſt; to every Direction the other contemptuouſly Cry'd— <hi>This I can do,</hi> and <hi>This I can do</hi>; which at laſt ſo incenſed the Pye, that ſhe left her in the midſt of her work with this Reprimand, —<hi>Then do't, then do't</hi>; and ever ſince the ſimple Pigeon for want of a little patience and gratitude is forc'd to be content with a ſorry imperfect Lodging for her young ones. So in the preſent Caſe, ſuppoſe any ſhall ſay, this is eaſy, I doubt not but to do it and mend it too my ſelf—Be it ſo, yet ſtill <hi>I</hi> know not that you have more reaſon to Boaſt, than the Cobler, who ſays he <hi>mends</hi> what the Shomaker makes, whereas had not the latter firſt made the Shoe, the former would have had no occaſion for ſuch a Vapour.</p>
            <p>3dly. Inventions are to be honour'd and eſteem'd for that Uſefulneſs and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit they afford, rather than for their uneaſineſs to be found out at firſt, or their difficulty to be practiced afterwards; Whether a man by ſagaciouſneſs of Judgment, or a long Induſtry and frequent Eſſays, find out a thing; Or whether it occur to him ſuddenly by the friendly ſuggeſtion of his good Genius, 'tis all one to the reſt of the world. Nay, whenever the thing is really uſeful, the more eaſie 'tis in practice, the more ought it to be valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, becauſe thereby 'tis likely to be more publickly beneficial, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the people are the more beholding to the Inventer. Eſpecially he if
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97747:4"/>
be ſuch an one as this Diſcoverer; who hath at his own coſt and charge, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this thing) found out and contrived certain Expedients by which not only the Wealth of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> might encreaſe at leaſt Twenty, if not Thirty Hundred Thouſand Pounds, and His Majeſties Revenue at leaſt Five, Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>Per Annum</hi> for ever; But alſo all poor People not having any Habitations of their own, or wherewith to Live of themſelves, may be ſo provided for, That there ſhall not be one Beggar in the Nation, nor any have reaſon to Complain for want of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Imployment, Food, Rayment or Habitation.</p>
            <p>As my ſeveral Printed Propoſals preſented to his Majeſty and both Houſes of Parliament, do moſt plainly demonſtrate; Inſomuch that I having preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Petition to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, the thing was ſo readily approved of. That an Order was made for bringing in a Bill Purſuant to the effect of my Propoſals, <hi>Nemine Contra-Dicente</hi>; Which Bill I at my further Charge, procured to be drawn and prepared; And had not the Perſon whom I firſt intruſted, and who promiſed to read my Petition in the Houſe of Commons, from time to time delayed ſo to do, till within a week before the Diſſolution of the Parliament; there is no reaſon to doubt but it had paſt into an Act, and at this day been practiced, to the Ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit of the Nation.</p>
            <p>So that it will be very hard, and the higheſt diſcouragement imaginable to all perſons in future times, to ſtudy to promote the Welfare of their Country, by new and profitable Inventions and Expedients, If a perſon who has thus for many years made it his Buſineſs to ſerve the Publick ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably, to his great expence of time and charge, to the value of divers Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, may not without being Envied, repined at, or obſtructed, be afforded and allowed to reap the benefit of his Majeſties moſt Gracious Grant (whoſe Goodneſs never is wanting to any that find out Improvements advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to his People) eſpecially this preſent Diſcovery, being ſuch as not only tends ſo much to the Publick Utility, but alſo to the great Profit of all that pleaſe to make uſe of it on ſuch eaſy and condeſcending Termes, prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to our own Intereſts, as thoſe herein before offered.</p>
            <p>Which as they are heartily tendred for a General Good, ſo we hope they will be received with that Acceptance and Gratitude, and Reſpect to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Royal Grant, as becomes all Conſiderate Men and Good Subjects.</p>

            <p>
               <label>III.</label> That One Acre of Land planted with Apple-Trees, may be worth by this means to the Planters at leaſt 8 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>; And yet the Cyder thus made to the goodneſs of <hi>French-Wine,</hi> be afforded at 2 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart; As is thus Demonſtrable. <note place="margin">One Acre of Land to be worth 8 <hi>l.

            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Eight-ſoore-Trees, <hi>viz.</hi> Red-Strakes and Golden-Pippins, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be planted upon one Acre of Land; each ſtanding ſixteen Foot diſtant.</item>
               <item>2. Theſe Trees cannot be ſuppoſed to bear leſs than one Buſhel on each, Tree, one with another, that is, eight ſcore Buſhels; And 'tis well-known that twenty Buſhels of Apples will make an Hogs-Head of Cyder; So that there will be yielded eight Hogs-Heads on an Acre.</item>
               <item>3. Theſe eight Hogs-Heads of ſimple Cyder, will make Four Hogs-Heads of Cyber-<hi>Royal,</hi> full as good and ſtrong as <hi>French-Wine</hi>; which at 2 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, is 2 <hi>l. per</hi> Hogs-Head; and ſo the Four Hogs-Heads yield 8 <hi>l.</hi> The Product of one Acre— Which is what was to be Demonſtrated.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But in caſe it be Sold at 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, as moſt certainly it may, during the Term of Fourteen Years: Since it is ſo that this Cyder-<hi>Royal</hi> will be as good as <hi>Wine</hi> Sold at 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart: Then the Product of this Acre thus Planted, may be worth 32 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides the profit of the Graſs or Corn, growing the ſame Year on the ſame Acre of Land: For if you Plant your Trees at the Diſtance of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Foot one way, and but twelve the other (Which is all one with ſixteen Foot before mentioned) you may well enough Plow between them.</p>
            <p>
               <label>IV.</label> But further, If <hi>Gooſe-Berries</hi> and <hi>Currants</hi> be Planted amongſt the Apple-Trees (as very well they may, and that will prove much the better Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry) then there may be more than four Hogs-Heads of <hi>Wine-Royal</hi>; made in a Year of Them, and much better than the other; So that at the ſame price, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, there will thereby be. 8 <hi>l.</hi> more raiſed, that is, 16 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> from the ſame Acre of <hi>Ground.</hi>

               <label>V.</label> But ſince 'tis uſual for Apple-Trees to Bear, ſome Four Buſhels, ſome Five, Six, Seven, and upwards, to Twenty Buſhels, 'tis very probable that one Tree with another, may bear four Buſhels; whence may be Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced 16 Hogs-Heads of <hi>Cyder-Royal</hi>; which at 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart (that is, 3 <hi>l.</hi> the Hogs-Head) comes to 48 <hi>l.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">That probably one Acre may produce as much Cyder and <hi>Wine-Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> as may come to more than 50 <hi>l.</hi> at 3 <hi>d.</hi> a Quart, and at 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, more than 100 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>
               </note> Nor is it unreaſonable to believe that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Gooſe-Berries</hi> and <hi>Currants</hi> may amount to much more than the 8 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> at which we have Computed it. For I know by Reaſon and Experience, that <hi>Currant-Trees</hi> and <hi>Gooſe-Berrie-Trees,</hi> one with another well-Husbanded, may yield One Gallon a Piece: And upon One Rod of Land may be Planted 16 Trees, each 4 Foot from another (which is a competent diſtance) ſo that One Rod may produce two Buſhels of <hi>Currants</hi> and <hi>Gooſe-Berries</hi>; And conſequently there being Eight-Score-Rods in an Acre, there may 16 ſcore Buſhels grow thereon; Which yielding 16 Hogs-Heads of Simple Wine, makes eight Hogs-Heads of Wine-<hi>Royal</hi>; which at 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, comes to 24 <hi>l.</hi> Which being added to the 48 <hi>l.</hi> made by Cyder (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laſt Computation) makes 72 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> at 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart: But Sold or valued at 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, the total Product from one Acre of Ground (now worth not above 20 <hi>s. per Annum</hi>) will amount to double the aforeſaid Value, that is to ſay, to 144 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I know why any ſhould Contemn, or deny this, as an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Calculation; however a thing impoſſible it cannot be, for theſe two Reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That one Apple-Tree may bear 30 Buſhels at a time; and One <hi>Currant-Tree</hi> ſix Gallons, and One <hi>Gooſe-Berry-Tree</hi> 4 Gallons; whereas here I Reckon but 4 Buſhels inſtead of 30, and but one Gallon inſtead of 4, or ſix. — And as for Selling it at 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, this I am ſure of, that the Cyder and Wines made as aforeſaid, are as good, and as well worth 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, as the Wines generally Sold in Taverns. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For that this <hi>Cyder-Royal</hi> being as good as Wine at 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, the Price cannot fail of 8 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, until by a very conſiderable Encreaſe of Plantations, the thing be made Cheaper through the Greatneſs of the Quantity.</p>
            <p>
               <label>VI.</label>As this Method of Improving Cyder and other Liquors before mentioned, renders them more ſtrong and delicious, ſo it alſo makes them much more wholſome for the Body than ſimple Cyder; The heavy, Cold, and Sickly parts being either wholly taken away, or ſo corrected that it becomes no way prejudicial to the Stomach, nor any longer apt to Generate Wind; And I think none will deny, that the Juice of Vegetables growing in our own Soil, and under the ſame Influences with our ſelves, being thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly Improved with their own Spirits only, or the Addition of a little innocent Sugar, are as agreable to our Bodies, and muſt needs be as good and wholſome, as thoſe that are brought from Regions remote, and Climates vaſtly different, and afterwards Brewed again with variety of unknown, and perhaps, dangerous Ingredients. <note place="margin">This <hi>Cyder-Royal</hi> much more wholſom than ſimple Cyder.</note> And much more is the former to be preferr'd, than the latter, in another reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe if Ten times more of it be ſpent than there is of Forreign <hi>Wines,</hi> the Nation will be never the Poorer for it, but on the Contrary much the Richer. <note place="margin">The more Drank, the richer the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>VII.</label> For there is in this Invention not only Strength to Chear the Heart of the weak or wearyed, Delicacy to pleaſe the Pallate of the Curious, Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97747:7"/>
to render it Familiar to the Poor; Private profit to Gratify the Rich, and wholſomneſs to Indear it to due Obſervers of their Health: But alſo publique Advantage to Recommend it to the Regards of Princes, and engage Kingdomes and States in a Concernment to Advance and put it in Practiſe. <note place="margin">Cyder-Royal <hi>of National, as well as private Advantage.</hi>
               </note> For by this Expedient, the wealth and Treaſure of thoſe Realms and Nations to whom it is propoſed, may be greatly preſerved and Augmented; And particularly <hi>England</hi> and the Territories thereunto belonging, may ſave at leaſt Six, if not Eight-Hundred-Thouſand Pounds Sterling <hi>per Annum.</hi> (And the other Nations proportionably) by ſaving ſo much Treaſure as goes out every Year to the Enriching of other Nations, and Impoveriſhing of their own. <note place="margin">The more Drank, the richer the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
            </p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>To this there may be ſome Objections.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe whoſe Lands are Imployed in Raiſing of Barley, will fear that by this Expedient Rich Liquors will be ſo plenty and Cheap, and raiſed by every Body for their own uſe, That Beer and Ale will be neglected; And conſequently, they will in ſome meaſure loſe their former Benefit ariſing by Barley. <note place="margin">The Farmers Objection.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer; <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis as reaſonable, that all others ſhould make the beſt Improvement of their Lands in an Honeſt way, for their own and the Nations good, as that theſe Men ſhould make the moſt of theirs for their private Intereſt. <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Moſt Lands kind for Barley, are proper for ſuch Plantations, and the Owners thereof, as well as others, may make the like Profit in this way, and much more than they did by Barley: For that, one Acre of Land ſo Planted as is before-mentioned, when grown upp, will (without Charge of Plowing and Sowing) produce more Hogs-Heads of <hi>Cyder</hi> and <hi>Wine-Royal,</hi> worth Six-pence a Quart (or Three-pence at leaſt) than it would ſtrong Beer or Ale, worth but Two-pence <hi>per</hi> Quart, if it had been ſown with Barley. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for ſeveral Years yet to come, there will be little danger of the Objected Inconveniences, <hi>viz.</hi> until thoſe Trees hereafter to be Planted, ſhall be grown upp; So in the mean time, until then, there will be more Beer and Ale ſpent than was before this SECRET was diſcovered: Becauſe that <hi>Cyder</hi> which was Sold for twenty or thirty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Hogs-Head, and ſpent inſtead of Beer, will now be advanced to the Price of Five or Six, perhaps Eight or Ten Pound <hi>per</hi> Hogs-Head, and ſo be drank inſtead of <hi>Wine. And laſtly,</hi> When the Plantations ſhall be grown numerous, the Publique Wiſdom of each Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may eaſily prevent any ſuch Inconvenience as is Feared, by laying ſuch an Impoſition on all Home-made Wines and Cyders, as may keep them from being Sold too Cheap, which yet will be no Burthen to the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor they have any Reaſon to Complain thereof, tho' it ſhould be Twenty Shillings on every Hogs-Head, ſo great will their Profit be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Second Objection, as it more immediately concerns <hi>England,</hi> is more Conſiderable, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Objection touching Loſs of Cuſtomes.</note> That this Invention of improving <hi>Cyders,</hi> and other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors of our own production, hindring the Conſumption and Importation of forreign Wines, will much diminiſh his Majeſties Cuſtomes.</p>
               <p>To this is humbly Anſwered, That the loſs of Cuſtomes by decreaſe of Forreign Wines may eaſily be made good; nay the profit to His Majeſty more than doubled, by an Impoſition on theſe Domeſtick Liquors which come in place of them. <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> And as the Publick National Intereſt will readily Embrace and afford ſuch an Impoſition, which tends to the ſtopping of that vaſt Sluce of Treaſure, which Forreigners yearly drain from us; ſo may the ſame be laid without any Grievance to the particular Subjects that are to pay it; Since notwithſtanding the ſame, 'tis evident every Acre may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97747:7"/>
be made worth at leaſt Six Pound <hi>per Annum</hi> (after all Charges deducted) better to the Owners than it was before: And every one for his own uſe may make or have that for Three-pence at moſt, as good as what he paid a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for before. Beſides the publick profit of Enriching the Nation ſeveral Hundred Thouſand Pounds every Year.</p>
               <p>For Example (keeping to our firſt, and the meaneſt Calculation that can in reaſon be imagined) ſuppoſe but Four Hogs-Heads of Cyder-Royal, and as many of Currant and Gooſe-berry-Royal be made upon an Acre; Theſe at three-pence <hi>per Quart</hi> make the product of that one Acre for that year Twenty Four Pound. <note place="margin">An Impoſition of 20<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>per</hi> Hogs-head may be laid on Cyder-Royal, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing the Planter.</note> Now ſuppoſe further, That an Impoſition were laid of one penny <hi>per</hi> Quart, which is Twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Hogs-Head; Then the Kings part or profit from that Acre will be Eight Pound <hi>Per Annum,</hi> and the Planters Sixteen Pound. And ſure the latter has no Cauſe to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, ſince that may be more than Two Cropps of Grain would have brought in.</p>
               <p>And at this Proportion in any Country where there ſhall be One-Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-Thouſand Acres Planted, the King or State may Raiſe to themſelves Six or Eight Hundred-Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Thus Six or Eight hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> may be raiſed to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> And yet at the ſame time much Benefit and Enrich their Subjects, as keeping their Treaſure at home from being Exhauſted by Forreign Nations, and Enjoying for their uſe at 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Quart, altogether as good or better Drink than that for which before they paid 12 <hi>d.</hi> And as for thoſe that Plant it, eſpecially ſuch as have Land of their own, they may by this means keep their Houſes always Plentifully Furniſht with Variety of Rich Delicate Liquors for themſelves, and their Friends, and if there be no Impoſition, the ſame will Coſt them nothing but the Labour of making it: And if there be ſuch an Impoſition, yet (beſides their Labour) it will ſtand them in but one penny a Quart.</p>
               <p>Again, The Decreaſe of Cuſtomes on Forreign Wines may be ſupplyed by laying double or trebble Cuſtoms on what ſhall for the Future be brought in; for ſince there will be no need of it, 'tis but juſt that thoſe that will Gratify their Fancies to the Publique Prejudice of their Countries, ſhould pay for their Humour, which perhaps will make their Out-Landiſh Drinks Reliſh the Sweeter; And yet even they will have no Reaſon to grudge at it, ſince (ſuppoſing them Perſons of Eſtates) their Lands by this Improvement of Cyder at home will be much Augmented in Value. <note place="margin">Cuſtomes on Forreign Wines may be doubled.</note>
               </p>

               <p>There is yet another Objection, —Many People are much againſt Mixtures in Drink, and will be ready to ſay, Here is a Mixture in Your <hi>Cyder-Royal,</hi> and therefore we will not like it— <hi>To which I Anſwer: First,</hi> 'Tis not all Mixtures, but Dangerous or improper Mixtures which ought to be avoided. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This in Truth is not any Mixture at all, ſince only the better part of the ſame thing or kind is added to it, and when all is done, it is but Cyder, or Wine Refined and made better, without any <hi>Compoſition,</hi> but what comes from the Apple, unleſs you will (which is left to your own free Choice) to Gratify <hi>Your own</hi> Pallate add a little Sugar, which all Men know to be <hi>Wholſome</hi> and <hi>Nouriſhing,</hi> eſpecially when 'tis firſt ſo Purg'd and Ordered as herein after is ſet forth; Nor is ſuch Spirits in ſuch Liquors any ways worſe than Gravey with Meat, which makes the beſt ſawce for the Fleſh whence it proceeds: And as the Gravey is the Vital and Nouriſhing part
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97747:8"/>
of Meat, ſo is the Spirit of <hi>Cyder to Cyder.</hi> But if our <hi>Cyder-Royal</hi> he to be refuſed, as being mixt, I deſire to be Inform'd, what Liquor (except fair Water) there is in Common uſe, not much more juſtly liable to the like Exception? <note place="margin">Cyder-Royal <hi>is no Mixture.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But perhaps our greateſt Wine-Bibbers will by no means Change their Out-Landiſh Liquors for Domeſtick Cyder: Becauſe, ſay they, the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity we are to Drink, will make us Sick, before it will make us merry <hi>&amp;c. <note place="margin">The Reaſon why ſimple Cyder makes the Stomach Sick; No ſuch thing to be feared from <hi>Cyder-Royal.</hi>
                     </note> To which I Anſwer,</hi> This is undoubtedly true of your Common ſimple Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but if you pleaſe to Conſider the Cauſe, you ſhall find no room for this Exception againſt our <hi>Cyder-Royal,</hi> for that which uſeth to cauſe this Sickneſs in the Stomack, is the Chilly, Cold, Phlegmatick part of the Cyder, <hi>viz.</hi> That which hath leaſt Spirit in it, is moſt hurtful; That this is ſo, nothing can be more Evident, for that the ſtrongeſt Cyder is moſt free from Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning this Diſtemper. Now this we know, that the Spirits of Cyder are no other but the purer part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſtrong, warm, and lively part, ſeparated from the weak, cold, and melancholly dead part; ſo that Reaſon muſt needs yield, that the Spirits of the Cyder being mixt with Cyder, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but make it both more ſtrong and Pleaſant, and alſo more <hi>wholſome,</hi> for that by this Expedient the Sickly cold and windy part is Cured.</p>
               <p>Moreover for want of ſtrength and Life, ſimple Cyders are apt to Decay and Dye; this we ſee by Experience; for that as the ſtrongeſt ſimple Cyder hath moſt Spirit in it, and therefore Lives longeſt; So the weakeſt Cyder that hath leaſt Spirit in it, will ſoon grow Sickly and Decay; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Expedient muſt needs be ſo farr from rendring Cyder more unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and unkind, that 'tis rather to be eſteemed its moſt infallible Phyſitian or Remedy, for that it Corrects all the ill Humours that cauſe its Sickneſs, or Ill-Effects on Humane Bodies. <note place="margin">Cyder-Royal <hi>will keep bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſimple Cyders.</hi>

               <p>To Cure <hi>Cyder</hi> that is ſubject to Fret is ſomewhat difficult, but the beſt way is to prevent the Cauſes; Which are, either the Gathering of the Fruit before they are Ripe; or making the <hi>Cyder</hi> before the Apples have lain long enough, for until Apples have lain in an Heap while they have ſweat, and are dry again, they cannot be fit for the Preſs. <note place="margin">The Cauſes of <hi>Cyders</hi> Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Cure.</note> But if by Reaſon of warmth, and mildneſs of the ſeaſon, or any other Accident, the <hi>Cyder</hi> ſhould fret and deſtroy it ſelf, the beſt way is to draw it off into another Veſſel; And do ſo once in ſix or ten days, as you ſee cauſe, always taking the Lee from it, as oft as 'tis Rackt. Let not your Veſſel be full by a Gallon; Nor yet ſtopt cloſe, untill by drawing it off, it be made to leave Huzzing and ſputtering; for the fuller and cloſer it is, the more it frets.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97747:9"/>
as will make up your Quantity, and let it Boil to the ſize of a Syrup, and being cold put it into your <hi>Cyder</hi>: But to put in a little <hi>Coriander-Seed</hi> bruized, and tied up in a fine linnen Ragg whilſt it is Boiling, will give it a fine grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſcent.</p>

               <p>So that in any <hi>Nation</hi> that yields 100000 Acres of Land fit to be Planted with <hi>Apples, Currants, Gooſe-Berries,</hi> &amp;c. and wherein there may be found 400000 Perſons that may one with another, Drink a Quart a day (of a Drink ſo Rich, and yet withal ſo cheap, and of their own Production) The Supream Magiſtrate of that Nation may have and raiſe hereby 800000 Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> (which is as much again as above propoſed) to the Publique Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer: Beſides 1661 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> towards the Charge of Collecting it.</p>
               <p>If it be ſtill Objected, that this will be a Grievance to the Subject?—'Tis Anſwered (beſides what has before been ſaid on that Subject) that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch Impoſition, it may be Raiſed by thoſe that make it for their own uſe, much cheaper then Beer, ſince one Acre of Land (<hi>take one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi>) will yield at leaſt; half as much more of the former, as it will of the latter, and with leſs Labour and Charge.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be well Imagined but that there will be found in either of thoſe Nations, 40000 Perſons who one with another will not Drink leſs than a Quart a day a piece, when they can have it upon the matter as cheap or rather Cheaper then Beer, tho' it be altogether as good as Wine; And eſpecially ſince ſuch as have Land in their own Poſſeſſion, may have plenty of it for their own uſe, for nothing but a little of their own Labour and paying a Penny <hi>per</hi> Quart to the King <hi>or</hi> State.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tho' <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> are the Higheſt and more Refined part of the VVorld, yet they are <hi>but few,</hi> Comparatively, in Number: The great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit depends on the Greatneſs of the <hi>Conſumption</hi> of Liquors, and that depends, upon Perſons of an inferior Sphere, and <hi>middle Fortunes</hi>; ſo that altho Princes and Perſons of the firſt Rank ſhould ſtill delight in <hi>Champaigne, Burgundy, Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineack, Greek</hi> or <hi>Florence-Wines,</hi> of any Other coſtly Forreign Liquors, yet this will ſignify little to hinder the General Uſe of <hi>Cyder-Royal,</hi> &amp;c.

               <head>The beſt and quickeſt way of Raiſing a Nurſery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe raiſing of Nurſeries for Orchards being ſo Eſſential to what hath been propoſed, and ſince by Experience I know, that theſe following Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Inconveniences do happen therein, <hi>viz.</hi> That 2 Trees of one ſort of Fruit, and both well Rooted alike, and Planted in one and the ſame Soil, many times the One will grow bravely, and bear a Buſhel at a time, within 6 or 7 Years, and the Fruit good and pleaſant, when the other ſhall be a ſmall ſhrubb, and produce ſmall unpleaſant Fruit, and not half a peck for the others Buſhel.</p>
               <p>Again ſome Trees tho' they are Planted on very good Land, and Husbanded never ſo carefully, will yet never become good nor long liv'd Trees. Whereas other Trees Planted in the ſame Land ſhall grow apace, be very Fruitful and long liv'd. The want of knowing the Cauſes and Remedy of theſe things, hath not only Diſcouraged many from Planting, but hath ſpoiled many hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trees and Orchards.</p>
               <p>As for the Remedy it is (in it ſelf) both PLAIN and EASY; and therefore ſince many People think that they need not be taught any thing that is ſo, and are unwilling ſo acknowledge any Obligation to thoſe that inform them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, what need I ſay any more? Let them find it out.</p>
               <p>However, for the Satisfaction of Perſon more modeſt and grateful, I will at preſent ſhew you the beſt Expedients to prevent both thoſe miſchiefs, which are the great Cauſe why in moſt Orchards little more than half of the Trees prove Good.</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt, Suppoſing 2 young Trees being both very good, let one of them be ſet ſhallow, <hi>viz.</hi> the upper Root not more than an Inch or two at the moſt under Ground, and the deepeſt not above 8 or 9, and Suffer no down-right Root to be upon it; Then ſhall you have it a thriving Tree and bearing good Fruit, If it be Carefully preſerved and kept clear from Suckers and ſuperfluous Branches, which are apt to Sprout up at or near the <hi>Root.</hi> But the other Tree being ſet too deep never thrives, nor proves Fruitful.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Inconvenience, by which the Planter miſſeth his Expectation, that doth ariſe from the Stock or Kernel, on which the Graft is placed; and this I take for a certain Rule, that the Kernels of Fruit produced by a ſhrubb or imthriving Tree, very rarely prove good, and indeed the like may be ſaid of Apple-Kernels in General.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97747:11"/>VVherefore in raiſing of Nurſeries, rather take your Kernels from a Fruitful Crab-Tree that hath a clear Body, a great ſpreading Head, and full of Boughs and Branches; For it may be obſerv'd, that as the Head is full of Boughs and Twigs, ſo proportionably that Stem abounds with Roots and <hi>Fibres</hi>; and as is the Tree, ſo will its Product or Seed be. I have ſo much remarqu'd this, that I would much rather give 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Tree for thoſe ſo raiſed, then a Penny a Tree for ſuch as are raiſed from Shrubs or Apple-Trees.</p>
               <p>From ſuch Kernels as afore-mentioned, I do knew, Trees may be raiſed ready to be Tranſplanted into Orchards, and Produce a Buſhel on a Tree within 10 or 12 Years after the Kernel is put into the Ground; For the doing of which, and to raiſe a Nurſery to the beſt Advantage, I will ſhew you the beſt Expedients my ſelf have Experienc'd by the following <hi>Aphoriſms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>I.</label>As to the Ordering of your Kernels of ſuch Crabs as aforeſaid, either put them in the Ground ſo ſoon as they may be taken out of the Crab, or elſe ſo ſoon as the <hi>Winter</hi> Will give Leave, the ſooner the better; But if you Keep them till the Spring, take care they be kept neither too moiſt nor too dry; If too moiſt, they will Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If too dry, they will not grow, therefore keep them in a mixture of dry ſand within Doors.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>II.</label>So ſoon after <hi>January,</hi> as the Seaſon will permit, ſow your Kernels in Ordinary good Ground (that lies as warm and Lue from the VVind as may be:) Let the Ground be will dugg, and the Kernels be Rak'd in ſo as they lie not too deep; an Inch, as near as you can gueſs, is enough; and when they are come up, preſerve them clear of Graſs and VVeeds, until you have them Tranſplanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>III.</label>The next Spring, <hi>viz.</hi> About 12 Months after your Kernels were ſown, you may draw thoſe that are beſt Grown, and Tranſplant them into a Nurſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>IV.</label>Let your Nurſery-Ground be made good with Dung, and well digg'd, and mixt together, and ſet them in Rows ſo farr apart as that you may digg between <hi>viz.</hi> the Rows at 2 foot diſtance: But in the Rows the Plants may be placed within 9 inches of each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>V.</label>Before you ſet your Plants in the Nurſery, be ſure Crop off the down-right-Root, ſpread the ſmall Roots, and cloſe up the Ground very well about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>VI.</label>The next Spring after this, you may return agnin to your firſt Plantation of Kernels, and draw forth, &amp; Tranſplant into your Nurſery as aforeſaid as many more as have made a good ſhoot, Ordering them as the firſt, &amp; ſo you, may do from year to year; But obſerve the laſt of all are not ſo good as the firſt altho' for the ſecond or third Year they may do well enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>VII.</label>Having thus Tranſplanted your Kernels into a Nurſery, they ought ſtill to be kept clean from Weeds, and alſo the Ground to be kept looſe, that the Roots may ſpread the better, and therefore in the next Autumn before the leaf is off, your Nurſery ought to be digg'd; But never amongſt them but once a Year; Only pull up the Weeds in Spring and Summer, as often as Occaſion requires. And here note, the difference between digging your Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and all other Trees whilſt the Leaf is yet on, and afterwards, is greater than you may at firſt Imagine; For that if it be done whilſt the Sapp is up, if a Root ſhould happen to be cut, the ſame will ſhoot out again, perhaps two for one, But after the Sap is once down, if a Root be Cut, it will not ſhoot forth that Winter, nevertheleſe be not too early in the Seaſon, nor yet too careleſs of the Roots.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>VIII.</label>By that time your Plants have had one or two Summer Growth in your Nurſery, the next <hi>Winter,</hi> or rather near the Spring, cut off all their Tops, about a foot above Ground, and the next <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> after, the biggeſt of them will be ready to be Grafted.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>IX.</label>A Tree that is Grafted, having made two Summers ſhoot, is fit to be Tranſplanted into an Orchard, becauſe there is farr leſs danger of a young Trees not growing or Thriving, than is of an Old One.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>X.</label>In Tranſplanting be ſure do not ſet too deep, To prevent which, this I do, Firſt digg my holes 4 foot ſquare, but no deeper than one <hi>Spit,</hi> or there abouts, <hi>viz.</hi> no deeper than the Roots of the Trees ſhould Lie; For if the Holes be digg'd deep, and fill'd up again before the Tree is Planted, the Tree and all will ſink together and never Proſper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97747:11"/>If it be Objected, That if the holes be no deeper they will not contain the Roots of many Trees, for ſome have Roots as downright &amp; long as a Parſnip; ſome are ſingle, ſome double, and ſome trebble, and all down-right long ones, and ſuch an hole will not receive them.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Away with ſuch Trees, I would rather give 2 <hi>d.</hi> a dozen for them to Burn, than 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Hundred to Plant; and tho' there is ſcarce one of an Hundred but proves thus bad, if they are never Tranſpanted, (eſpecially if they come from Apple Kernels) yet if from Crab-Kernels, and Tranſplanted as before is Ordered, there is hardly one of 400 will prove ſo improper.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>XI.</label>Now as to the Charge of all this; One mans Labour upon one Acre of Land with Crab-Kernels may after 3 or 4 Years raiſe 10000 Trees every Year, which at 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Tree, comes to 125 <hi>l.</hi> which will well pay the Rent of your Land and the Gardeners wages; ſo that the Charge of Planting your Orchard will be very Cheap and Eaſy, for that an Acre of Land Planted with ſix ſcore. Trees, as for the Trees they comes but to 30 <hi>s.</hi> and the Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 18 <hi>d. per</hi> Score, which is 9 <hi>s.</hi> So that by this Expedient, Nurſeries may be raiſed ſo as to afford an Acre of Land to be Planted with the beſt ſort of Trees, and of the beſt Fruit for leſs then 40 <hi>s. per</hi> Acre.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>XII.</label>After your Trees are Tranſplanted into Orchards, the greateſt Care and Charge is to keep them ſafe from being abuſed, either by Weeds that may grow about them, Suckers that may grow out of them between the Root, and ſpreading Boughs, and from all <hi>Cattle, Coneys</hi> and <hi>Hares.</hi> And in caſe they are digged about the Roots (where you may, if you pleaſe, Plant <hi>Turneps, Beans, Peas,</hi> or any other thing that may deſtroy the Graſs or VVeeds,) your Trees will thrive much the better, and grow twice as faſt; But in caſe you Plant <hi>Currants</hi> and <hi>Gooſe-berries</hi> amongſt your Apple-Trees, you may place 4 of them in the ſame Hole with your Apple-Tree (that is, making the hole about 4 foot ſquare, Plant your Apple-Tree in the middle, and a <hi>Currant</hi> or <hi>Gooſe-Berry-Tree</hi> at each corner) and keep them from Weeds, and all will thrive together. But note that for <hi>Gooſe-Berries</hi> and <hi>Currants,</hi> you had need beſtow more Dung than Apple-Trees require; And alſo forget not to mix your Dung and Earth together before the Trees are Planted; For if a <hi>Tree</hi> ſtand in all Dung, 'tis deſtructive to the Root: Mudd and Soil of Ponds, Ditches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as good for this purpoſe as any Dung, provided it be Sun-Burnt and dryed before it be uſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>XIII.</label>As to the Soil moſt proper for Orchards, I do obſerve that all Land proper for <hi>Corn,</hi> as <hi>Wheat, Barley, Rye, Beans, Peaſe,</hi> &amp;c. are kind for that uſe. But the moſt Improper is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hot and dry Sands, and on the other ſide Grounds very wet and Cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>XIV.</label>As for <hi>Currants</hi> &amp; <hi>Gooſe-Berries,</hi> very great may be the profit that may be raiſed by Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them amongſt your <hi>Apple-Trees,</hi> becauſe they will thrive there better than elſewhere. But becauſe the <hi>Currants</hi> love the ſhadieſt Ground moſt, let the <hi>Gooſe-Berries</hi> be Planted in the midſt of your Ground, between your Rows of <hi>Apple-Trees</hi> in the moſt Sunny part.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>XV.</label>As for raiſing of <hi>Currant</hi> and <hi>Gooſe-Berry-Trees,</hi> its very <hi>eaſy</hi> &amp; <hi>ſpeedy,</hi> as thus: Take either of the ſaid <hi>Trees</hi> about the End of <hi>February</hi> or beginning of <hi>March,</hi> lay down every Limb flat with the Ground, cover every Twig with good Earth, and turn out the Tops that they may lie above Ground, and every Twig will both Root and ſhoot forth, ſo that by the next <hi>Winter</hi> you may have of one <hi>Tree,</hi> 40 or 50, perhaps an hundred, well-rooted Plants, fit to be ſo Tranſplanted. Take Care to keep the uncovered Stock, which is between the old Root and the cover'd part, that it run not out in Branches; for if it do, the Twigs will be robb'd of that Nouriſhment as ſhould feed them. Alſo remember to keep them clear of all Graſs and VVeeds that may Annoy them.</p>
