            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>O My deerely beloued Daughter
I haue spoken to thy heart by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
inspirations, but thou wouldest

neuer giue eare vnto my motions,
wherefore since thou diddest care lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to answere me, much lesse to obey
me, I am enforced by the great loue I
beare thee, to write vnto thee, that at
the least thou mayest bee content to
reade what thou diddest neglect to
heare, &amp; by reading both better beare
away my exhortation, and more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imprint it in thy minde. For that

               </gap>ity which moued me to offer my
selfe, not onely to all danger, but euen
to death it selfe, for thy sake, will not
suffer mee to leaue any thing vndone
that may tende to the furtherance of
thy saluation: And although thou dost
not in any sort requite my loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thy hart is inclined to outwarde
vaine, and transitory things, and so by
that meanes too much affected and
addicted to my creatures: Yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
I withdrawe that charity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I am alwaies ready to imbrace
thee, which exceedeth the loue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
father or mother towardes their
children, or of any earthly Parent
whatsoeuer: For I am not onely wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6087:10"/>
to graunt thee my grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
but desirous to accept thee for
my spowse, and will daily enrich thee
with greater and better blessings, than
any that this world can yeeld thee, if
thou wilt follow my counsaile. But
for that thou hast contemned me whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I came to visite thee, and hast not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to my inspirations, thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by this euill custome of thine so
much distracted in thy soule, and so
far beside thy selfe, as thou art neither
able to conceiue what thou hast lost,
nor yet the misery wherein thou art.
And the lesse that thou dost bewaile
and lament thine owne misery, the
more doth thy case deserue to be pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and lamented. VVhat shall I say
O my daughter? thou shouldest be an
example to others, and thy life an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to those that goe astray: the
sweete sauour of thy good conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ought to bee a holsome medicine
for the curing of such as are weakened
with infection of sinne, and thy words
as a consuming fire, to inflame the harts
of those that heare them: But now


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6087:11"/>
thou art thy selfe so corrupted with the
desire of chidish vanities, so busied
with a multitude of vnprofitable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and so subiect to many hurtfull
passions, as thou art distracted in thy
soule, and hast it so much polluted
with filthinesse, as it is possessed with
wandring thoughts and vaine imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
Selfe loue doth as yet raigne
in thee, and till thou mortefie that,
thou canst neuer enter into my bed, or
be partaker of my delights: So as thou
which oughtest to teach others, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
now in neede of being taught thy
selfe. I write not this to the end, that
I meane to reiect thee, but because I
would let thee know how far thou hast
erred, &amp; am desirous that thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
vnderstand thy own losse and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
&amp; I do not only allure thee, but
I do also prick thee forward to returne
from thence, home againe vnto mee.</p>
            <p>VVheresoeuer thou art, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thou dost, or whether so euer thou
goest, my eye is neuer off on thee, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and searching into all thy acts, all
thy motions, and all the secrete inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6087:11"/>
of thy hart.</p>
            <p>And if at any time I spie in any of
these the least vnfaithfulnes to mee,
who am most faithfull, I am iustly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
and angry; for I did suffer not
onely with all patience, but euen with
all willingnes, many despites, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
griefs, and torments for thy sake,
O my most deare daughter, to passe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in silence all the paines and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which I did endure, tell mee I
pray thee, what man would haue suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so many and so great disgraces for
his friend, as I did for thee? And yet I
indured them when thou wert mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
when thou dadst done no good
at all, when thou didst neither loue
nor know mee, yea before thou wert
borne did I loue thee, and suffer these
grieuous and innumerable torments
for thee. VVhy then wilt thou turne
away thy self from me? why dost thou
seeke quietnes without mee? thou art
sickly, and yet wilt wander abroad: If
I forsake thee, who will receiue thee?
who can cure thee? Alas my daughter
how far art thou deceiued? whether so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6087:12"/>
thou turnest thine eyes, or vppon
whatsoeuer thou dost fixe thy minde;
yet shalt thou finde no peace, no ioy,
nor any rest, but in me onely. Thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
deceiue thee, &amp; they which seeme
to loue thee doo abuse thee; and thou
also dost deceiue thy selfe, when thou
refusest a soueraigne medecine that
would helpe thee, and receiuest ranck
poyson, which will kill thee. Alas my
daughter, alas my spouse; I know how
often, beautifull and goodly things in
shew, but vaine things in deed, (which
when they professe most loue &amp; faith
vnto thee, are most ready to beguile
thee) doo allure thy senses, and drawe
thy affection, and how often also they
deceiue thee with their snares, &amp; leade
thee from mee with their guiles. O
deare daughter, remember that thou
art a spouse, and let not the loue of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thing but onely thy husband
enter into thy hart. Desire nothing
but his fauor, that thou maiest be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
in his eyes, and please him, and
be for euer beloued of him. I stande
desiring thee, and waiting for thee, I


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6087:12"/>
with that thou wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dest returne vnto
mee with all thy hart, and forsaking all
these vanities, apply thy selfe wholy to
deuotion, and giue thy selfe daily to
humility, that I might then vouchsafe
to talke with thee in more familiar sort
and reioyce thy minde, with far better
and purer delights, than those wherein
thou hast lyen drowned.</p>
            <p>I require no multitude of workes at
thy hands, wherewith to trouble thee,
but a chast, faithfull &amp; pure hart, which
may seeke to please me, &amp; not delight
it selfe. I desire a sincere loue, and a
feruent deuotion, that is a ready and
forward will to honour and obey mee,
and a sincere &amp; pure intention in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of all those things that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund.

indue thee with greater consolations
and far more excellent blessings, than
either thou darest presume to desire, or
art able to conceiue. I am a husband
that is bashful, and therefore will neuer


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6087:13"/>
come vnto thee, when I see thee busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with other matters altogether vaine
and vnprofitable. VVhen I come I
must finde thee alone, for I stand
knocking at thy dore, being very weak,
and quaking for cold, euen in the same
forme that I carried when I was vnlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Piller, where being bound,
I was whipped and wounded for thy
sake, and this I doo, that I may make an
impression of my selfe in thy minde,
wounded as I was, &amp; that thou imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
me with the armes of thy loue, I
may vnite thee vnto mee, and inflame
thee with my woundes, that doo yet
boyle with the feruent heate of that
charity which I carry towards thee. Oh
if thou wouldest acknowledge me for
thy husband, &amp; loue me as thou ought
to doo, wouldest thou not both quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawe me into thy hart, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I came, with a most desirous will,
attend and long for my comming, and
wouldest thou nor then cloath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and giue fire to warme him that is
a colde, that thou mightest bee made
worthy to receiue againe the chast im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brasings


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6087:13"/>
of my loue, and to inioye the
sweet taste of my spirite?</p>
            <p>How much would it please me that
thou haddest a certaine &amp; firme trust
in me, and were as willing to bee with
me, as I am desirous to bee with thee,
seeing all my delight consisteth in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Children of men. So
should the fortitude of thy minde, be
dayly augmented, and the true sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of thy soule continually increased.
But this trust in me can neuer be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a distrust in thy selfe, &amp; both these
graces, are onely obtained by pouerty
of spirit, which is a most precious Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell.
But I know well inough what doth
with-hold thee from attaining to this
vertue, thy stomacke is ouerlaide with
the loue of this worlde, and by that
meanes infected with such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
coldnes, as it maketh thee to
loath and abhorre the worde of God,
which is the food of thy soule. But if
thou desire to increase in vertue, &amp; to
strengthen thy mind with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that course, thou must receaue
the word of God greedily, disgest it


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6087:14"/>
perfectly, and still retaine the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that within thee. The reason
therfore that thou canst not thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my iustice, is because thou art alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
filled with the cold meat of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conuersation and vanitie, and that is
the cause also why these things do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
thee, which sauour neither of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
nor deuotion. Simplicitie of heart
is loathsome vnto thee, and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of holy meditations, thou accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
as time lost. Thy minde beeing
loaden with the cares of this worlde,
cannot ascend vp vnto mee. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thou raisest it by force for a
while: yet it presently falleth downe
againe into her earthly cogitations: so
as thy soule being distracted, thy heart
inconstant, thy minde wauering, and
thy desires insnared with the loue of
worldlie pleasure: thou art troubled
when thou art awake, and not quiet
when thou art a sleepe.</p>
            <p>And when thou liest in this misery,
O vnwise daughter, then thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainest
that thou art drie and barren,
without my consolation. If this did


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6087:14"/>
happen vnto thee, by the meanes of
my prouidence (as it hath to manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of my friends,) and not by thyne
owne negligence: there were no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the wanting of this sensible
grace of mine shuld molest thy soule.
But seeing thy owne slouth and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
is the cause that thou liest lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
in this barren drienes: If thou
desire my consolation, if thou wish for
my comming, if thou doe long to bee
vnited vnto me, thou must forsake all
those vanities, that doe please thee
without me, &amp; only study to serue me,
indeuouring continually to perfourme
those thinges, which agree best with
my liking, and are most pleasing vnto
me, and making this thy cheefest care,
thou must labour with all thy force &amp;
might, to see my will as nere as thou
canst, in all creatures fulfilled. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
in dooing hereof, let thy whole
studie be to content mee, and to relie
onelie vppon me. So shalt thou finde
my presence more often with thee, &amp;
by it, thy spirit shall be as it were made
dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck with ioy, thy conscience shalbe


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6087:15"/>
comforted, thy heart quieted, &amp; thou
shalt then possesse the perfecte rest of
most sweet contemplation. Oh if thou
hadst once come into that wine Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
out of doubt thou wouldest euen
with a certaine thirstinesse, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desire to be there, and more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
But no man can enter into it, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
such as desire me aboue al things,
loue me aboue all things, esteeme me
aboue al things, &amp; make acount of me
as all in all. For hee that findeth no
other consolation but in me, hee that
thinketh himself vnworthie to receiue
any consolation from me, nay he that
desireth affliction so much in this
world as he taketh himself to be wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
when I send him any consolation
at all, and doth as willingly accept it at
my hands, when I leaue his soule bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
without any comfort, as when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
it with my consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom
all ioy without me is a torment, hauing
his minde wholy fixed vpon me, &amp; his
desire only bent to serue me. Such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as these be, I say are my special friends,
at whose dore I doe freely knocke, &amp;


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6087:15"/>
willingly enter: these are the men to
whome I gladly offer my selfe, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
my secrets. These men am I wont
to visite in sundrie sortes, as seemeth
fittest in my indgment, by stirring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vp in such sort as is meete &amp; agreeable
for the deuotion and loue which they
beare me.</p>
            <p>Sometime I present my selfe to the
eyes of their soules, wounded, naked,
and tormented in all my members, &amp;
that they may finde greater comforte
in the loue they beare me, I shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
my wounds, to the end that they may
touch them, bath them, clense them,
kisse them, &amp; embrace them: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their deuotion in this behalfe
may seeme to worldly men ridiculous
because they knowe not what it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
yet is it most acceptable vnto me
&amp; profitable to them. For then I begin
to forgette all the paines which I haue
suffered, and also all the faultes which
such a spouse of mine hath committed
against me, &amp; do wholy bend my selfe
to comfort her with my spirit, and to
lighten her with my grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:6087:16"/>
And although I stand not in neede
of any thing, yet I make account I
haue gained much, when I finde so
great fideliue in my spouse, as shee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
mee better than eyther her selfe,
or all the world besides. But vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
doth offend me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> much as fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie
doth content me, and is of all
things most grieuous vnto me, because
by it they seeke to renue (as much as
lieth in them) the griefes of my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and vexations of my mind, seeing
I perceaue that all is lost, which I did
of an vnspeake by charitie endure for
them. Therefore, whether outwarde
affliction of thy bodie, or inwarde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of thy minde happen vnto
thee, seek not for externall comforts,
which are nothing worth, but in all thy
distresse flie vnto mee, and make no
complaint of thy griefe vnto any man
but to me onely. For what greater help
can men yeeld thee, than in giuing
thee faire words? If thou hast a Ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father or Confessor, I forbid thee
not to disclose it vnto him, but I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte
thee to lay open before him the


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6087:16"/>
secrets of thy heart, and to direct thy
selfe in all respectes, according to his
counsaile, without yeelding any waie
to satisfie the furie of thy Passion, or
labouring for some eternall comfort,
or boasting before others, of those
vexations which thou dost suffer. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to me in secret, that which thou
wouldest complaine of before men,
committing thy selfe and all things to
my prouidence being quiet without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
care or perturbation of thy minde.
Thou shalt finde (beleeue me) a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
peace in thy soule, and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
by this course at my hands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not such peraduenture at all
times as thou dost imagine or wish for,
yet such as may most of all conforme
thee to my will and pleasure.</p>
            <p>Oh if thou wert taught and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by thine owne experience in all
worldly thinges which trouble thee, to
haue thine eye only fixed vpon me, to
flie vnto me for refuge, to hope in my
mercie with a patient expecting of the
same, to relie vpon me, and withall to
conceaue with how fatherly &amp; louing


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6087:17"/>
a minde, I send thee aduersitie for thy
benifite: there should be no tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so great, that thou wouldest not
with al gladnes and willingnes accept,
yea and prefer it before all ioy or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
whatsoeuer. For albeit thou
shouldest receaue no other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
by it, yet this were sufficient to
comfort and reioyce thy minde, that it
is a fulfilling of my will. If my will bee
done, it doth alwaies please the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
soule, more than the receiuing of
any other benifite, although in truth
my will be neuer but to do that which
may be most for her commoditie.</p>
            <p>It will also help thee very much for
retaining a quiet minde in all aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to lay before thy eyes the acts and
miseries of my life, and euermore to
carry within thee, a liuely represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof. For if thou doe imprint
this in thy minde, it will make thee
thinke all bitter thinges sweet. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
therfore at all times vpon my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and desire at my hands conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
with sighes and teares, that I
may vouchsafe to make a strong and


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6087:17"/>
an effectuall impression in thy heart of
my woundes and passion, that thou
mayest see me crucified at all times, &amp;
in all places, with a heart that doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
suffer with mee, and let the liuelie
representation hereof, banish from thy
soule all other imaginations whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
If thou returne in this sort from
all outward to inward thinges, &amp; shalt
dwell within thine owne selfe, if thou
beholde in thy heart my grieuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and my selfe crucified, if thou
heare me cry when I was replenished
with all sorrow and bitternes, and not
releeued with anye consolation from
my father: My God, my God, why
haste thou forsaken me: thou shalt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inflamed with the vertue of my
passion) haue a desire to immitate me,
to suffer for me, and to serue me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any comfort at all, in contempt &amp;
resignation of thy selfe. They that
serue me with this minde, and are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto me for meere loue onelie, &amp;
continue faithfull vnto me without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other respect but to please me, and
to haue my will wholy fulfilled in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6087:18"/>
these men I say, are my faithfullest &amp;
most speciall friendes. And in what
drines or desolation so euer they may
seeme to be, and with what temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
so euer they may seeme to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed,
and as it were cast off
and forsaken of mee, yet in truth they
are still mine, because they fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
at their own charge, for my cause
against the whole army of wicked te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
which doe continually assault
men in the welfare of this present
world, and will not reuoult from my
Campe although I sometime strike &amp;
punish them.</p>
            <p>But I doe not altogether leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for seeing they haue conquered all
their passions, and renounced all theyr
owne appetites to please me, and for
my sake: yea and haue euen altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forsaken themselues, and giuen
themselues onely to me, in beeing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
wholy to my will: I cannot hold,
but I must also power my selfe into
them, &amp; both fill, nourish and possesse
their soules with my comfort, which is
a hundred times better, purer &amp; swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6087:18"/>
then that worldlie pleasure which
they haue forsaken. They cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
this (as I haue often told thee,
and will not cease to beate into thy
minde) which doe seeke or accept of
any forraine comfort, that proceedeth
not from me, or is not in me. For my
consolation is wonderfull sweet, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
only vpon such as will admitte
me no other. It is also most pure and
therefore cannot bee mixed with anie
consolation that is deriued from my
cretures. But why do I so often repeat
these thinges vnto thee? Truely I doo
it to make thee more wise, watchful &amp;
circumspect, and to the end that thou
shuldest not be snared with these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and earthly delights, nor yet bee
brought by them to forget me, seing I
can neuer forget thee, although that
thy saluation only dependeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my
prouidence, &amp; not mine vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sorte. I wish also that thou shouldest
be alwaies with mee, &amp; by being with
me, inioy all perfect felicity. But why
do not I fulfill this? marry euen for thy
good, that thou maist increase in vertu,


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6087:19"/>
to the great profit of thy soule, &amp; thy
greater glorie. For thou mayest by my
grace daylie increase in goodnes, &amp; be
made euery moment more rich in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
VVherefore seeing this is so, how
foolish dost thou think them to be, &amp;
how much to be lamented, which doe
spend the most precious time of grace
that I haue allotted vnto them, not
only, not to my honour and their own
profit, but to the heauier agrauating of
their damnation by wicked life? Oh
that thou knewest, howe much thou
mightest encrease in the vertues of thy
soule, and in merit by my grace euery
houre, and also how deare a euill time
is, and how damnable the losse therof:
For thou wouldest then out of doubt
take care with more diligence that the
smallest moment shuld not passe thee
vainely, nor yet slip away without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
some benefit to thy soule. VVith
the Sunne rising euery day, there shall
then arise a newe ioy into thy minde,
that I had graunted thee the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
of that day, &amp; by it so much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
space to honour and serue mee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:6087:19"/>
Thinke therefore, and say euerie
houre vnto thy selfe, our Lorde which
loueth me hath vouchsafed to giue me
this houre, this moment, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
the course of my life hetherto,
that I should euen now begin to turne
vnto him, and endeuour my selfe to
please him.</p>
            <p>O my Daughter, euer aboue all
things carrie this opinion, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
moment wherin thou liuest is the
first time, wherein thou beginnest to
doe well, and contemne all that thou
haste done before as nothing worth,
VVhat occasion soeuer, what busines
soeuer, what idle time soeuer, or what
other things soeuer, either may or shall
happen vnto thee, vse them in such
sort as thou imploy them to my glory,
and conuert them to some benefit of
thy owne soule. But this in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
is sufficient. For I haue hetherto
stirred thee vp, &amp; excited thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from all vanities, with shutting the
gates of thy senses against them, and
to returne vnto me with a recollected
and quiet minde. It remayneth nowe


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6087:20"/>
that I adde vnto this, as it were a rule
to teach thee how to liue godly, which
I haue heard thee, by the inspiration of
my grace, desire often at my handes.
For there remayneth as yet bashfulnes
in thee (which I like well) and which
maketh thee ashamed in the opening
of thy infirmities, faults, errors, &amp; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences:
&amp; also grieued that thou hast
this long time heretofore, and dost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
at this present, so vnworthily vsurp
the name of my spouse. But seeing
thou desirest to returne into my grace,
there is nothing that I likewise doe
more affect or desire. For what other
ioy haue I in beeing among you, then
to receiue euery sinner into my fauor:
howe much more then doe I desire or
rather long (as may in reason be iustly
thought) to bring my spouse home vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, when she goeth astray, amongst
the berries and thornes of worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.
Nay I am so desirous to recall
thee, as I will prescribe thee a plaine
path, wherein (if thou walkest) thou
shalt be sure to follow my steps, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wander againe out of thy way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:6087:20"/>
Come therefore vnto me, and by
thy returne, procure me a new ioy, such
as delight in most, and desire euer to
possesse.</p>
            <div type="instruction">

apply thy minde with more dilligence
to carrie away my speeches: I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in declaring these thinges vnto
thee, which I require at thy handes:
continue therfore attentiue, &amp; return

that thou shouldest do, and what thou

by praier whatsoeuer is necessarie for
thee, saying: Deliuer me from my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
O Lorde, I fly vnto thee for
succour, teach me to doe thy will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou art my God: leaue me not
O Lord my God, &amp; depart not from

Incline thy selfe to helpe mee O
Lord, the God of my safetie. Behold
I desire to returne vnto thee, draw me
after thee, and neuer suffer me againe
to bee seperated or withdrawne from
thee. O my daughter, hearken now
to that which I gaue in commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to one of my seruants long agoe,
and endeuour thou also to fulfill it. I
said vnto him.</p>
               <l>Vse euer silence in thy tongue,</l>
               <l>And haue compunction in thy minde:</l>
               <l>Be humble, curteous, meeke &amp; milde,</l>
               <l>If thou in me wilt comfort finde.</l>
               <p>The same words in the same forme
doo I speake vnto thee, hauing made
it in the true measure of a verse (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thou shalt haue lesse neede of
a measure to direct thee when thou
art come to this perfection. But I doo
not now deliuer it vnto thee, as framed
in measure to please thine eares, but as
a foueraigne medicine to cure thy
soule. I haue comprehended al those
thinges, which are necessarie for thee


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6087:21"/>
briefely in this verse, that thou mayest
more easilie retaine them in thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
and more often meditate vpon
them in thy minde. For my will
is, that thou shouldest altogther
applie thy endeuour, to haue a holye
compunction for thy sinnes, and that
leauing all other businesse aside, thou
shouldest onely attend to a continuall
and eternall conuersation, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
weaned from all other pleasures,
to be recollected into thine own selfe,
and so to continue alwaies free from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
distraction or perturbation whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.
Bee silent in thy tongue, &amp; pure
from all filthines in thy heart. Be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and meek, and remember to shew
thy selfe both curteous and gentle in
all thy behauiour towards all sortes of
men. First of all, diligently examine
thy selfe, and looke most neerely and
narrowlie into thy selfe, that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
know what is in thee, which is an
impediment to thee, for the receiuing
of my grace, that is to say, what is in
thee which dooth displease mee, that
thou mayest correct &amp; amend it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6087:22"/>
to what things, &amp; by what means
thou art tempted, and where thou se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thy selfe most sharpely and oftnest
tempted, there seeke to resist them
with greatest dilligence, and most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
endeuour. VVhere thou findest
thy selfe weaker, there appile more
forcible remedies quickly to vanquish
them. VVhere thou perceiuest any
occasion which moueth thee to sin, or
not to profitte in this spirituall course,
there cut off that scandall and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from thee.</p>
               <p>Haue speciall care to present vnto
mee, a pure hart: free from all vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and neuer infected with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
loue to my creatures, nor oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
with any vnnecessary businesse
in this worlde, and labour euermore
withall that thou art able, wholie to
cleaue vnto mee, and still to rely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
mee. The cause why I do exhort
thee, to a continuall exercise of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction,
is that by it thou maiest keep
thy selfe free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forraine or wandring
thoughts, which thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st neuer attain
vnto, except thou bee recollected in

thy mind. Neither canst thou come to
be thus recollected, except thou lead
an internall and solitarie life, priuate to
thy self &amp; withdrawne from al world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affaires. VVherefore marke with a
watchfull eye those vices, concupisen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and wicked inclinationes which
raigne in thee, that thou mayest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

               <p>Many complaine that they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt

but their owne negligence and slouth
is the cause: for that they will straine

cherish, &amp; fauour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they
ought to persecute, &amp; root out of their
minds. Therfore they carrie alwaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them a heauy burden of vnquiet
thoughts, filled with labor &amp; vexation.
but if thou desire to enioy me, haue no

               <p>Banish from thee all vnprofitable

those thinges which are necessarie,

this delight not as a thing which thou

be seperated from that which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
for mans vse, admitting it only for
necessitie, and not desiring it for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Therfore to bee short, haue such a
care and watch ouer all thy senses, as
they may not mooue or turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to anye vaine or vnprofitable

it cannot be done without sin, because

               <p>Be neuer wearied therefore, with
fighting against many temptations,
giue not place, waxe not faint, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffer thou thy selfe to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
with weakenesse in thy hart,
nor desperation in thy minde, but
persecute all vice with a continuall


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6087:33"/>
and mortal hatred, and as often as thou
beginnest to faint, or to decline from
thy former determination, so often rise
againe, and make a new resolution.</p>
               <p>One thing I must needes vvarne
thee of, vvhich hurteth thy selfe, and
offendeth me, vvhich is, that thou art
become sometimes so fainte harted,
vvith thy faults and ouersights, as they
moue thee to vvauer, in follovving of
the good course that thou hast begun,
and almost induce thee to dispaire.</p>
               <p>This is the cause that doth make
thee sit solitarie, pyning &amp; consuming
for verie griefe, and not to returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me that thou mayest rise againe, but
euen vvith a kinde of dispaire to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that all thou haste done before is
vtterly lost and forgotten. And thou
shewest thy selfe by this kinde of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
to bee proude, because when
thou diddest seeme to stand, thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
trust too much in thy owne force
and abillitie, &amp; that maketh thee now
to be so greatly troubled and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in thy minde: because thy hope did
faile thee, &amp; it fell out otherwise then


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6087:33"/>
thou didst expect or looke for. My
will is, that thou shouldest not vse the
help of thy own force and endeuour,
but vtterly to distrust both in them &amp;
thy selfe, and to trust in me only, for
as long as thou thinkest otherwise,
thou art like euerie houre to come to
ruine, vntill thou learnest this lesson,
that when thou reliest vppon thy selfe,
thine owne strength is no greater help
vnto thee to make thee stand vpright,
then if thou wert vnderpropped with
a broken reede. But dispaire not in
me, reposing a most firme hope, &amp; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
confidence in my mercie. And
touching thy selfe, I would haue thee
to dispaire after this sort: not to refuse
thy owne counsaile, thy own industry,
thy own trauaile, and other thinges of
such like kinde which proceede from
thy selfe, but I would haue thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
to vse them, and yet not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon them, confidently to trust or
delight in them, neyther yet would I
haue thee attribute any good thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauest
to thy selfe, or to thine owne
dilligence for both thy selfe, and all


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6087:34"/>
these abillities which thou haste, haue
not power to make thee withstand the
smallest sinne, except thou be assisted
with my grace and mercie. Neither
thinke thou that I will presently pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
into thee, for one earnest praier, a
fewe teares, or one onelie conflict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the temptation of sinne, all
graces, all vertue, and all good gifts,
or that I will for this, send thee anie
suddaine or extraordinarie profitte in
thy spirituall course of life, or that
thou shalt immediatlie come to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to all pietie and holines.</p>
               <p>I require at thy handes daylie
paines, vnfeyned humbling of thy
selfe, and a continuall fidelitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, in fighting against vice. I
looke for, also a firme hope, and an
assured trust in my mercie, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
in thee, that will neyther bee
ouercome with any assault, nor yet
wearied with anye trauaile. And
when thou shalt finde in thy selfe all
these thinges which I haue named,
let there not want a most profound
humilitie, whereby thou mayest bee


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6087:34"/>
brought perfectlye to know thy selfe,
and to confesse that as thou wert
made of nothing by my mercie, so
thou art nothing but by my grace, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
nothing to thine owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and trauaile, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that thou haste deserued nothing,
but ascrybing thy thirst after iustice,
and all other good things which thou
doest to me only.</p>
               <p>Except thou knowest these thinges
thou canst not but erre, and must of
necessitie fall often, vntill thou come
to learne what thou art of thy selfe, &amp;
what thou art by my grace. I forbid
thee not, but exhort thee to labour as
much as thou canst, and to striue for
vertu as much as thou art able; &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thou hast done all, trust not in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
nor in any industry of thy own,
that is without mee, but hope of this,
pray for this, &amp; beleeue this certainly,
that I wil neuer faile to assist thee in all
thy diligent &amp; vertuous labors, not in
respect of thine owne deserts, but in
respect of the loue and charitie which
I beare thee. For seeing that I


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6087:35"/>
haue giuen thee, a will, a desire, &amp; an
inclination to fight, I will also graunt
thee for thy labour in fight (if thou
perseuerest to the ende) a Crowne of
glorie, a triumph of victorie, &amp; a most
happie end of thy combat.</p>
               <p>VVherefore, whether thou beest
in war or at peace with thy selfe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thou doest determine, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
thou beginnest, or whatsoeuer
thou dost enterprise, craue without
ceasing my assistance by praier, and
waite before the gates of my mercie.
Thy praiers shall neuer returne from
me voide, and fruitlesse, although thou
thinke thou haste receaued nothing;
for it is often more profitable for thee,
to pray humbly and earnestly, then to
receaue and obtaine benifites. It is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
more gainefull for thee to trust in
me, &amp; expect my leysure, then senci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to feele, or possesse my consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
VVherefore be thou patient, &amp; long
suffering: &amp; increase in all good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
&amp; in the loue of all that is good,
betweene falling and rising, euer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

seeke to flie or to run awaye from
the battaile, vntill all the fight be fully
ended, &amp; the time be come for thee to
receiue a glorious reward for thy pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
trauaile. And because thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
bee the rather incouraged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in this labour, assure thy selfe that
euen in this life, thy enemies shall bee
daylie diminished, and their force that

                  </gap>d, &amp;
thy selfe by my grace, and vse of sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
wonderfully strengthned, in so
much as that which at the first thou
couldest scarcely scrape out with a file
of iron, thou shalt come in time to
driue away with a blast of wind.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, whensoeuer thou chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
to fall, take this for a general rule,
though thou fallest neuer so often, &amp;
offendest neuer so greatlye, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
without any delay come vnto
me, lamenting thy fault and bewaile
it vvith mee, lying prostrate at my
feete, and rise againe with me, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thy selfe vppon me, that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
thy confidence in my power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing
firmely to amend, and neuer


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6087:36"/>
to offende in it againe. I knowe mans
weakenesse in generall, I knowe also
thine in perticular, and how apt man
is of his of his owne frailtie to fall, &amp;
howe it proceedeth from the mallice
of the diuell for a man to bee vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to stande, or vnwilling to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
after hee is fallen. VVhich
thing cannot onely bee by no meanes
excused, but also receaueth without
my mercie, a heauier damnation. I
require nothing of thee but a good
will, and nothing is in my eyes more
precious then the same.</p>
               <p>VVherefore if thou wantest force,
abillitie, or time to doo good works,
bee not dismaide, for thy good will
doth fullie content mee.</p>
               <p>Retaine euer within thy selfe a good
will, for by it thou mayest satisfie for
all thy defects, &amp; repaire all thy faults,
although thou beest able to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
besides. VVhen thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
mee fardest from thee, then am I
nearest vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Therfore (my Daughter) as soone
as thou shalt finde that thou haste of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6087:36"/>
condemne thy selfe, and
presently running vnto mee, confesse
thy selfe guiltie, and make complaint
against thy selfe vnto mee. Thou
canst not no sooner bee repentant;
then I haue graunted thee my pardon,
neyther canst thou sooner aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse,
then I haue quite remitted
and forgiuen all.</p>
               <p>VVherefore then (O my Spouse)
doost thou stay from returning vnto
mee? Thy safety is not procured
in flying from mee, but in flying vnto
mee.</p>
               <p>I whatsoeuer thou seest that thou
haste most offended: where thou
findest that thou haste oftnest fallen:
to conclude, where thou perceauest
that thou haste most declined from
vertue: there cry oftnest vnto mee,
there sigh vnto mee with more often
grones, and desire with all feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
at my hands, both pardon for thy
sinnes, and the protection of my
grace.</p>
               <p>Bee not wearied with temptations,
but alwaies resiste them as much


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6087:37"/>
as thou canst, neither yeeld thy selfe
as vanquished by them, or as a Prisoner
vnto them. As long as thou resistest,
thou art neuer ouercome. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thou feelest, and art enforced
to suffer (as long as thou sufferest it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy will, and resisting it is I
told thee before) I vvill neuer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it to thee as a fault, because I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
not an account at thy hands of
that thou feelest, but of that to which
thou consentest. To feele motions
of sin, is ingrafted as it were in thy
flesh, but to consent vnto it, resteth
in thy ovvne choyse. There maye
bee a certaine kinde of violence offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
to the flesh and senses, but the
will canne neuer be compelled.</p>
               <p>There are two thinges in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
one the matter whereunto thou
art tempted, and that is a sinne, and
imperfections, these thou must neuer
consent vnto, neyther yet yeeld thy
selfe in any sort vnto them, but resist
them with all thy might. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, that labour and distresse
which thou doost endure in resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6087:37"/>
them: and this thou must pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
abide and yeelde vnto, as long as
it is my pleasure that thou shalt bee
tempted. For thou oughtest not to
resist mee, but to subiect thy selfe
wholly vnto my will, and to resist
those motions which thou art stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto by the meane of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that thou mayest continue still
in my fauour, receiue my grace, and be
partaker of my consolation.</p>
               <p>But I knowe what thou wilt say, for
I am not ignorant of those thinges
which thou dost suffer, and wherewith
thy hart is afflicted. I will tell thee
them therfore, since thou art ashamed
to tell them thy selfe, that by it thou
mayst be the better assured to receiue
remedy, and consolation for them at
my handes. The temptation of thy
flesh doth assault thee, not onely eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, but euery moment. To resist
this continually is troublesome and
grieuous, and to escape it without figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
is impossible. To fight long and
not to bee wounded, is in thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not onely hard, but miraculous


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6087:38"/>
He that is thy enemie, is very familiar
with thee, thou carriest him about with
thee in euery place, thou art not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to destroy him, but thou art
enforced to nourish him. His weapons
are many, his manner of fight diuers,
and his assaults very violent, as the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
heates, the feruent motions, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
allurements, the terrible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations,
the cruell onsets, the sweet
pleasures of all kinde of lust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,
&amp; many such other which
some men doo feele raging in their
flesh like certaine furies of hell. Now
the strong impressions and delectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them being in a manner violent
and ioyned with these fancies, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
sufficient to vanquish all thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the instability, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie
of some mens hart is so
great, that euen in the very moment,
wherein they prepare themselues to
resist these temptations, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
as it were fallen beside them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and cleane forgetting that
which they had determined, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6087:38"/>
to thinke of that which they did
refuse to thinke of before. Now who
amongst these dangers (sayest thou)
can escape safe? who can flee away
from sinne vnwounded? marry a good
and an humble will, for to it there can
no violence be offered. For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thou thinkest, chastity is not pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it, but with the consent of thy
minde, that is, whatsoeuer thou feelest
in thy flesh, shall not bee imputed to
thee for sinne, if thy minde consent
not thereunto: for whatsoeuer is sinne
must bee voluntarie, and as long as it is
not voluntary it is not sinne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with howe great temptations soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thou art oppressed, nay though thy
flesh doo seeme to bee ouerwhelmed
with them, and thy senses as prisoners
vnto them, yet whatsoeuer thou fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
delightfull to thy flesh, keepe thy
minde free, (that is, thy reasonable
will) and then nothing can hurt thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Cry out with the detestation of thy
soule against them, and with a voyce
that doth abhorre them, fie, fie, I will
not, I will not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:6087:39"/>
Turne vnto me with all the force thou
art able, and repeate often this short
sentence. O my God helpe mee; O
mercifull Iesus I will not yeelde vnto
them, helpe mee.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, though most lothsome
and horrible temptations doo creepe
into thy minde, yet for all that bee not
thou dismaide; as they creeped in, so
let them creepe out, and by that gate
wherein they did enter, let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and let not them onely out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
but carry out with them any
thing that is naught, and vnclean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thee, that they may leaue thy house
swept and cleansed. And this thou
maiest easily doo, if thou wilt enter
into a deepe consideration to knowe
thy selfe, and call vpon me onely with
a firme confidence, and with a great
humilitie, neither seeking to spare thy
selfe, nor ceasing to persecute thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
For it is a most present reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
against all inclinations, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as soone as euer thou shalt finde
an euill inclination in thy minde, how
thou art nothing, and hast nothing of


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6087:39"/>
thy selfe but by my grace onely, and
how vnpossible it is for thee, with any
abilitie of thine owne, to resist these
motions, and therefore presently to
flie vnto mee with all thy hart, and to
seeke aide and protection from my
wounds which I suffered for thy sake,
and at the sight whereof, the auntient
enemie of mankind doth yet quake &amp;
tremble. Beleeue me (my daughter)
although thou be haunted as much as
is possible for thee with carnall
thoughts, sensuall motions, violent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
&amp; imaginations, and although
thou feele in this behalfe as much as
may bee deuised, yet as long as reason
hath the vpper hand, and doth gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
them, and as long as thy reasonable
and deliberate will doth not make
choise of them, thou hast neither lost
charitie nor my grace. This distresse
which thou doost sustaine, and these
streights, whereinto my hart is driuen
by the meane of this conflict, may be
a plaine argument vnto thee, that thou
haste not consented vnto them, and
so consequently a great comfort to


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6087:40"/>
thy minde. For if thou had dest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
vnto them, that is, if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
willingly felt those thinges which
thou diddest feele, if thou haddest
willingly retained, those cogitations
which did enter into thy minde, thou
shouldest not then haue felt this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
this combat, and sharpe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
but rather all peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in thy soule. Receiue a similitude
(O my Daughter) at my handes for
thy comfort: If any man in fight hand
to hande bee ouercome, vanquished,
bound, yea and beaten, and although
he be so straightly holden, as hee hath
not abillitie to vse his owne limmes:
yet if he yeeld not himselfe as a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and vanquished, but resisteth with
as much force as hee is able, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
not to this his captiuitie, he can
neuer be said to be conquered or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
In like manner thou shalt neuer
be iudged of me to be ouercom, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou bee tempted of the flesh or
the diuell, except thou consent with
thy minde, and ceasest to resist them.
Thou must feele many thinges, which


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6087:40"/>
thou oughtest not to consent vnto, that
is, which thou oughtest not to feele
with thy good will, and with a certaine

dost doe it, the more easie shalt thou
euer finde it. Remember also, that
as the temptation shal end, so the fight
shall not alwaies continue, and that an
eternall crowne of glorie which is due
to the conquerour doth remaine for
thee. The sharper thy fight is, the
more glorious thy crowne of victorie
shall be. And therefore if thou o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercommest

vnto it. And although in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
especially when a heauy tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth furiously rage in thy flesh,
there are many veniall sinnes wont to
bee committed, (which are giuen as
light woundes to those that fight) yet
notwithstanding, that paine which is
endured by continuing still in fight, &amp;
by resisting of mortall sinnes, doth on
the contrary part take away all that
paine which the veniall sinnes do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue.
Beside, that charitie wherewith
thou fighting for my sake dost auoide
mortall wounds, and takest great paine
in striuing for vertue, doth not onely
heale thy lesser wounds, but also doth
turne them to thy greater glorie and
reward, if thou shalt perfectlye ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
these temptations as the skars of
a Souldiers wounds, which hee recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by fighting manfullie in a moste
fierce battaile, are shewed, after the
victorie to his great honor, &amp; the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the battaile was, the greater is his
glory. Feare not therfore my daughter
if thou art to fight long, or if thy temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

thy sensuality, as to make it in al things
subiect to thy reason, yet alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
it, neuer giue it place, neuer
graunt it peace nor quietnesse. Thy
battaile against it, the conflict which
thou diddest endure in resisting of it,
I will esteeme as a victorie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
ouer it: For it is not onlie good
to ouercome euill, but with all thy
might to resist euill, yea it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
more honourable and profitable
for thee, by continuing in fight to
sustaine longer the assaults of thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie,

then quickly to haue vanquished
him, espeacially when it is done by
my prouidence (which disposeth of
all, euer for the best towardes those
that loue mee) and not by thy owne
slouth or negligence: For I who
am a most vpright and wise iudge, do
marke the trauaile and force of euery
one of my Souldiers, and do more
esteeme in them, their will, then
their abillitie: because to be able to
conquere, proceedeth of my gift,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6087:42"/>
but to be willing to conquere resisteth
in their owne choyse, and yet not
that neyther without my grace.</p>
               <p>Wherefore although my grace
must of necessitie assist you in both,
yet it resisteth more in your owne
choyse to bee willing to doe well, then
to be able to doe well, which I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
(O my Daughter) doo better
allow in thee a will to doe much, then
abillitie to performe much. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
both meet and agreeth with iustice,
that the longer thou fightest, and the
more paine thou takest, thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
receaue the larger reward, and

but euen here grace for grace, that is,

And the Diuell also doth raise

thou mayest bee afraid, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume

               <p>The Diuell doth this, because hee
delighteth to entangle thy minde
with scruples, and perturbations, and
by them to hinder the Saboth of thy
quiet rest. But do not regard them,
doo not feare them, doo not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere

But if thou seeke to resist them, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute

to remooue them, thou shalt still the

               <p>Take heede also that no temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

by making thee weary to resist it, for
this is an vsuall practise of the Diuell
to vexe some with so long and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
a temptation that hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
those by tyring them with
that wicked deuise of his, whome hee
could neither deceiue by subtlety, nor
intise by pleasure. Wherefore thou
hast neede to bee long suffering, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,

to detest those wicked cogitations,
which are throwne into thy minde by
the craft of the Diuell against my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

and are brought in of purpose to
seduce thee; so thou mayest in no

that affliction which I send vnto thee
nor those heauy &amp; troublesome bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
which thou feelest by my will
and prouidence laide vppon thee, nor

vice and iniquitie, but thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
for my sake to beare them pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
and without any grudging.</p>
               <p>Of this also I am to warne thee,
that if thou be tempted with any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
vices, as gluttony and concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
thou mayest more easily van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
the by flying them, then by
fighting with them; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
part, all spirituall vices are euer
ouercome, not by slightly passing ouer
them, but by staying with good consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
vpon them, and dooing the
contrary of that to which they allure
thee. For the temptation of pride
is neither any whitte diminished nor
yet vanquished, by flying all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that may any way mooue thee to


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6087:47"/>
humble thy selfe, that is, by flying all
the meanes that may procure humility
in thee, in hope by that course to abate
the force, and auoide the motions
of that temptation. But if thou wilt
ouercome it, stay aduisedly vpon it, &amp;
enforce thy selfe to doo those thinges
that may humble thee. Thou shalt
after the same sort ouercome enuy, if
presently and violently, as it were in
spight of her, thou dost those thinges
from which shee dissuadeth thee; that
is, if thou speakest to thy brother, if
thou seekest to do him seruice, if thou
dooest humble thy selfe vnto him. In
like manner also, thou shalt neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
slothfulnes by flying all trauaile,
or by neglecting the diuine honouring
and seruing of mee, and by seeking to
withdraw thy selfe, that thou mightest
not be commanded to labour and take
paines, but by enforcing thy selfe with

yea, although thou findest thy selfe
troubled with horrible tentations, and

which doo inuade thy minde. For
this sensible deuotion of thy soule is
not so necessarie, but rather that reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
deuotion of thy will, whereby
thou dost beleeue well of my Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and whereby (notwithstanding
these blasphemous thoughts which do
assaile, and almost ouerwhelme thee)
thou maiest be mooued to doo all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reuerence to my Sacrament,
although it bee against thine appetite,


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6087:53"/>
contrarie to thy liking, and repugnant
to the sence or opinion of thine owne
hart: and lastly, that thou mayest by
this inforcing of thy selfe, against thy
carnall desire, finde thy will ready &amp;
prepared with al obedience to honor
mee, to giue me thankes, to resigne
thy selfe wholy vnto mee, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
thy minde so farre to my liking,
as that it may be best contented with
that which agreeth most with my ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>If thou haste this deuotion (my

may easily commaund and procure in
thee, that is, if thou bee sorrie that
thou haste euer offended me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
neuer to offend me againe,
but to endeuour as much as possiblye
thou canst in all thinges to obey my

Neither let it trouble thee, if euen in

that feare, fainthartednes, and

which is strongest of all in women, &amp;

cleane remoue this fainthartednes, &amp;
fearefull imaginations of thine, thou
shouldest with it also cleane expell
this difficultie &amp; distresse which thou
findest in thy minde. For albeit I
could deliuer thee from al these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations,
yet doe I permitte, some
such distresse as these, to assault thee,
and other of my seruauntes, because
I knowe it is the best meane either to

thou mayest with a quiet minde,

and a most faithfull Sauiour. But
because thou maiest be enflamed with
a greater reuerence, loue, and desire,
toward this blessed Sacrament: I assure
thee that without all doubt, my body
is there sacramentally, deliuered vnto
thee, to be receaued vnder the forme
of bread. Wherefore seeing it is the

which is dead nor without blood, it
followeth of necessitie that together

contained my soul, my blood, my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and my vertues: to all which since
the world is vnited, that is one person

the whole Trinity is present in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,

of all thy happinesse. And because
I would not haue thee drawne from
it, with too much timerousnes of thy

haue commaunded thee to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

what men thinke of thee,
nor what censure they giue of thee,
neyther yet feare their iudgment, so
long as thou doost not wittinglie (as
farre as lyeth in thy power) giue them
any scandall or occasion iustlie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
or backbite thee. For thou
art neyther the better if they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
thee, nor the worse if they
dispraise thee. But thou art in truth
as I account thee, and as thou shewest
to be in my sight. Therefore let not
the commendation of any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
thee, nor yet their dispraises
grieue thee. For what doost thou
gaine by the commendation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6087:70"/>
nothing truelie: But it dooth
rather manie times greatly hurt thee,
because it deceaueth thee, and puffeth
thee vp with pride and vanitie: And
on the contrarie parte, what can the
contemptes, reprehension, abasing,
backbiting, condemnation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of men hurt thee? Truelie
nothing at all, but rather they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitte
thee much, for they bring thee to
know thy selfe, and helpe thee not a
little, to obtaine humilitie of life, and
amendment of thy manners. For by
it thou shalt bee made more wary and
wise, in thy conuersation with men, &amp;
not to trust in them, but to put all thy
confidence in me.</p>
               <p>The iudgment of men therefore is
not much to be cared for, whether
they speak good or euill of thee: Let
them thinke what they will, in the
meane time lift thou vp thy hart vnto
me, and if by searching euerie secret
corner of thy hart, thou findest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it that may offend mee, feare
nothing, but if by this examination
thou findest somewhat, wherein thou


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6087:70"/>
haste offended me, bewaile thy fault,
not because men do despise thee, (for
thou oughtest then iustly both to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and desire that) but because thou
haste offended me, and also giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men by thine example occasion
to sinne. But if any thing bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
or dispraised in thee, which is
not sinne, bee not otherwise or more
mooued therewith, then if some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man were commended or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praised.</p>
               <p>If men praise thee, ascribe it to
their error and good will towardes
thee: if they reprooue thee, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
thee, meruaile not at it. For
what meruaile is it, if men reprooue,
dispise, and condemne thy life, seeing
they also reprooued my life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
all my Doctrine, which was
most innocent, voyde of all spotte,
and which could by no meanes bee
iustly reprehended.</p>
               <p>Reioyce rather, that thou art come
to walke in those steppes, which I had
trode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, that is, if being humbled
and accounted as a caste awaie of all


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6087:71"/>
men, and bee glad that thou sufferest
these persecutions of men. Let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
imagine mischiefe against thee,
I will returne their mischiefes to thy
benefitte: onely endure thou all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie,
and be silent.</p>
               <p>Studdie in all thinges to please me,
and not men: and yet if thou chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
to please men, thinke that they
are deeeiued in their opinion of thee:
because they know thee not as wel as I
do, but do iudge thee thorough their
owne simplicitie, according to that
apparaunce of goodnesse which they
see in thy outward show. But if thou
dost displease them, impute it to thine
owne deserts, &amp; let it make thee more
humble, for if they doe despise thee
for so little faults, as they are able to
see in thee, what would they doe, if
they sawe as perfectly as I, all thy sins
and offences? Delight therefore to
be accounted vile &amp; contemptible, &amp;
though thou bee despised neuer so
much, yet thinke that thou deseruest
to be a great deale more despised then
thou art.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:6087:71"/>
Thou oughtest to account thy selfe
most miserable, most vnworthy, most
vnthankefull, and most needing my
grace and mercie, of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
remembring alwaies that of thy
self thou art meerely nothing, and that
all thy workes which are without mee,
neither sauour any thing of vertue, nor
yet are any thing worth. Whosoeuer
is most wicked, thinke him better, and
more worthy of heauen then thy selfe.
Beleeue that other men doo merite, &amp;
thinke that thou art tollerated here by
my mercie onely. Presume not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in these respects, to compare thy
selfe with any man, but imagine that
thou hast offended mee more then all
men, and that thou art more vile and
vnthankefull to me, then any creature
that liueth: because whatsoeuer is of
thy selfe, either is nothing at all, or els
is sinne. Wherefore to extoll or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
thy selfe, by the meane of those
gifts, which thou hast whollie receiued
from me is intollerable, and a point of
most arrogant pride, For the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
whereof, and for thy greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6087:72"/>
I doo often withdrawe from thee
my sensible blessinges, because thou
knowest not howe to vse them, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
them, in turning them onely to
the magnifiyng of thy selfe, whereas
in truth thou oughtest to challenge or
ascribe nothing to thy selfe, but wholy
attribute all vnto mee. Take heede
therefore that in the petitions which
thou makest vnto me, thou hast no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to thy selfe, but to me onely, lest
thou shewe thy selfe vnthankefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me by pride, or detestable in my
sight by thine owne negligence. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how thou art nothing of thy
selfe, how quick lie thou art vanquished,
when I doo not protect thee: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how thou art not able to endure
the smallest aduersitie, or ouercome
the weakest temptation, when I fight
not for thee. For of thine owne abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thou haste no other power in the
worlde, but onelye to corrupt and
pollute what good thing so euer I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
vpon thee.</p>
               <p>Thou art too apt (my Daughter) to
dispraise other men, which is a token


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6087:72"/>
without doubt of great arrogancie, as
though thou wert worthie to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before those which, thou so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendest,
because thou perhaps
wantest that vice, whereof thou accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
them, and yet are subiect to many
other.</p>
               <p>If thou wert not blind, thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
perceaue that thou deseruest not
by this kinde of dealing, in any sort to
be preferred before them: but rather
thine owne tongue maketh thee more
detestable then they, because it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
openly, thine arrogancie or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie.
My friends are wont to reprooue,
&amp; accuse themselues of their own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and not to finde fault with others:
for they suspect both their workes, &amp;
themselues, neyther will they trust
themselues in anie thing, because they
haue bin by that meane so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.
For they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eare alwaies that

               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:6087:73"/>
Therefore doo thou alwaies either

all men doo not reprooue and detest

               <p>Thou canst not (my Daughter) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
humilitie, except thou loue to

               <head>Of Obedience.</head>
               <p>OBedience, is a most excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and most acceptable vnto me,
that worke which in it selfe is vilest, &amp;
least of all others (if it be done meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for obedience only) it is better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of me, and more profitable &amp;
meritorious vnto him that dooth it:
then infinite others, which men doo
voluntarie, and to please their owne
appetite. Neither canst thou offer
vnto me (beleeue me my Daughter)
a more Noble and woorthie Sacrifice,
then to present mee with an humble
hart, obedient and readie, to doo all
thinges that I shall command. For
it may so fall out, as a man by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
only, may cleaue, leaue, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him selfe for my sake, and so
profitte more, by denying of his own
will, and bee mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re inwardly vnited
vnto mee, then if hee had bestowed


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6087:74"/>
much time, in other most noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises.
Wherefore thou oughtest
(my Daughter) to be alwaies as obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
vnto me, as if I were euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with thee in a corporall forme,
and that thou didst as continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
my presence, as a wife doth her
husband, with whom she dwelleth.</p>
               <p>When anie man shall call thee
from mee, to doo some acte of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
thou oughtest to leaue me, &amp;
obey him. For this is not a forsaking
of mee, but a forsaking of thy selfe:
because thou preferrest my honour
and my will, before thine owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
and consolation, in that thou
doost according to my commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
deny thy selfe, and seekest not
thine owne commodity, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitte
of others. In this sort shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou relinquish thy selfe, and all
care to please thy selfe, or to seeke
thine owne commoditie. For so
shouldest thou not leaue me, but find
that which is a hundred times more
worthie and profitable for thee then
those thinges which thou forsakest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:6087:74"/>
Learne therefore to leaue thy selfe
for my sake, that is, by denying of
thine owne will, to want that fruite,
that consolation, and that profitte
which thou desirest to reape, for by
dooing thy duty in this sort, both thou
honourest me, and not onely loosest
nothing in thy profitte: but also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainest
thinges (though it bee by an
other meane) that are an hundred
timies better. Wherefore esteeme
nothing so precious, neyther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thou any thing so profitable,
as that thou wilt not bee drawne from
it willingly, for obedience sake, with
a minde wholie resigned to my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
For whatsoeuer the thing bee
that for the loue of it, either thou
refusest to performe thine obedience,
or commest to doo it grudgingly, or
vnwillingly, it is the Idoll of thine

thee, than can be expressed. If thou
be in a place where thou haste no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour,
or where thy selfe is superiour;
make all men thy superiours, obeying
their will, and forsaking thine owne.

Marry doo it not of slouthfulnes, but
wheresoeuer thou mayest euen of
thine owne desire, and of purpose to

               <p>Looue the vertue of obedience
from the bottome of thy hart, and
leaue it not as long as thou liuest, not
onlie to thy superiours but also yeeld,
obey, and subiect thy selfe, (whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
thou art not restrained by my

for my sake, and that without beeing
grieued with it, repyning at it, and
disputing about it. And because
thou mayest do this the more franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
respect not the man, who by my
ordinance is thy superiour, whether
he be learned or meet for the office;
neyther seeke to marke or consider,
whether he be learned or vnlearned,
an excellent man, or a base person.
But haue regarde to this onely, that
he is by my prouidence made thy

thee, and in whome thou oughtest to

yeeld to this my prouidence, seeing if
I appoint such a man, I haue as much
care to rule thee, and to make thee

Yea, I haue the like regarde of

it shall bee my pleasure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point

haue thee subiect thy selfe vnto him,
without any seruile feare, or scruple of

thy selfe to bee gouerned by his
iudgement and opinion. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
hee shall determine or appoint
thee, accept it from his mouth as from
mine owne. For I place such supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
ouer my seruaunts sometime, as

in those execises, to the end that
they should not regarde mans wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

them by a simple man (if they
can haue faith and confidence in me)


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6087:76"/>
as by a learned. And therefore,
whatsoeuer they shall be aunswered,
or howsoeuer they shall bee counsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at his hande, let them receaue it,
not as from a man, but as from my
selfe, attributing all to me and my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
and ascribing nothing to the
man, whether hee bee wise or
simple.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldest not therfore go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray,
walke in the path of obedience,
and doo nothing at all without the
counsaile of thy Pastor or Ghostly

               <p>Liue alwaies in simplicitie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie

occasion at anye time to complaine
or murmure, esteeming that alwaies

to mortefie and kill in thy selfe

these words, or rather the affection of

which is as much to say, as if there bee
no respect in the worlde in thee, to

               <p>But if thou renouncest quite thine

of thine, neyther knoweth nor
is able to conceiue: for nothing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the world, but euery bodies see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to please their owne appetite.
Therefore I said to my Disciples: in
the worlde, that is, in those thinges
which are of the world, to witte, your
own desires, which the world seeketh
to satisfie: you shall haue distresse,
but haue confidence, for I haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the world, that both you may
ouercome in me, and haue peace in
me also. Beginne therefore thou also
and taking out this lesson, both mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefie
and plucke vp by the very rootes
all the desires of the world, and all
selfe loue out of thy hart. Otherwise
how canst thou ouercome the worlde
or the Diuell, if they haue their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

vices lodged within thy soule? Throw
out quickly whatsoeuer is in thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6087:78"/>
to my will: and whatsoeuer
fighteth against thee: in thy spirituall
warfare. For neyther the worlde nor
the Diuell can euer come to vanquish
thee, or in a manner to resist thee,
but by the helpe of those thinges
which they possesse in thee. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they which doo persecute thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which doo oppresse thee, which
shew vnto thee, and lay before thine
eyes, thine owne weakenesse: to be
short, which offend thee, that is, which
offend thine owne will in thee, and
consequently thy selfe, because thine
owne will and selfe loue raigneth in
thee. (For otherwise they could not
offend thee, for that these things,
to witte, thy selfe will, and thy selfe
loue, are onely hurt and offended:)
they therefore (as I saide) which doo
thus offend thine owne will in thee,
which shewe thee howe thou haste
not mortified thine owne appetite,
are thy speciall friends and benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
These thou oughtest to loue,
and with all to bee glad, because
they doo persecute thyne owne

and onely dangerous enemie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thou wilt wisely vse, and take
the benefite of this occasion, the more
stronger thou shalt growe, &amp; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
force thou shalt haue.</p>
               <p>The lesse rule that thine owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
hath ouer thee, the more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
haue I still in thee, and the further
that it is banished from thee, the more

of thine owne will, if it doo
thee no other hurt, yet it doth euer
certainely bring this mischiefe vppon
thee, that it suffereth not mee to haue
operation &amp; possession in thee. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it depriueth thee of mee which

thou labourneuer so much, and deuise

after me, let him denie himselfe, that

forsake his owne wil, take vp his crosse
and follow mee. Begin therefore with

this, for this of necessitie thou must

without mee thou art, as though thou

thee, and vnite thee so close vnto me,
as no man shall bee able to hurte or

leaue thy selfe with a glad and

seeke, wish or choose this or
that, of any respect, looue or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which thou carriest to thy selfe,
but let all thinges bee indifferent to
thee, onely thou shouldest for my
sake, esteeme that dearest, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that most, which thou knowest is
most acceptable vnto me. For thou
oughtest to meditate of that prayer
alwaies in thy heart, which I offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto my Father in the Garden,
when I was going to my passion, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>O Lord thy will be done: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
not mine, but thy will be done.
And this also. Teach me to doo thy
will, because thou art my God. Or
els this: Let it be done vnto me accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy good pleasure.</p>
               <p>But wilt thou knowe how much
thou haste forsaken thy selfe, or how


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6087:81"/>
much thou hast mortefied thine owne
will? see, when losse of any thing, when
reproches, when iniuries doo happen
vnto thee, whether thou beest trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with them, and whether thou
beest more troubled when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to thee, then when they happen to
other men. By this thou shalt finde
the loue which thou bearest to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
yea, thou shalt perceiue the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which thou carriest to thy selfe.
For thou dost therefore loue tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
goods, thou dost therefore loue
honor, thou dost therefore loue quiet,
and thou dost therefore loue such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
and transitory thinges, because
thou louest thy selfe. For thou wishest
to enioy these things, whereas if thou
diddest loue me, thou shouldest rather
bannish all these things quite from thy
hart for my sake, and take all aduersitie
as willingly as thou wouldest possesse
happines; to be short, thou shouldest
not bee more, but rather much lesse
troubled when aduersitie happeneth
to thy selfe, then when it happeneth to
others. For thou shouldest neuer bee


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6087:81"/>
greeued with anye accedent in this
world, but onely when thou shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst
thy self vnreuerent or contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

               <p>Therefore, hee that will forsake
himselfe (my Daughter) his onely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

his desire, must tend not partly, but
altogether to mortefie his owne appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
to renounce his owne will, to bee

be in all sorts free, &amp; deliuered from
any impediment whatsoeuer, which
lyeth in the way, and maketh a deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
betwxit him and mee. The least
impediments are cogitations &amp; forms
of creatures which men frame in their

findest an inclination or naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to one thing more than another,
thou art not yet perfectly mortefied,


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:6087:82"/>
but thou haste somewhat remayning
in thee, which thou must mortefie and
extinguish.</p>
               <p>What motion soeuer thou feelest
in thy selfe, that proceedeth not from
mee, what thing soeuer goeth about
to busie, alter, or possesse thy mind,
what likenesse soeuer of any thinge,
doth labour to imprint it selfe within
thy hart, whatsoeuer seeketh to draw
thy liking to it, or to grieue or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme
thee: Endeuor thou with a
recollected minde, close shut within
it selfe, and lifted vp to me, lightly to
passe ouer and careleslie to despise
all hope and feare, gaine and losse,
quiet and laboure, ioy and griefe,
mirth and sadnesse, and all suche
thinges as may seeke to possesse thy
heart with all affection that thou
mayest carrie towardes them. For
if thou fixe thy minde vppon mee,
thou shalt easily tread all these things
vnder thy feete. But if thou louest
thy selfe, if thou haste not wholie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
thine owne selfe, thou shalt
alwaies feele by following of thyne

owne appetite, ioye and griefe, anger
and feare, care and infinite other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
Wherefore thou canst neuer
bee quiet, except thou haste cleane
mortefied thy selfe and forgotten
thine owne selfe whollie. Thou must
quite abandon thy selfe, that thou
mayest liue in me onely, &amp; bend thy
selfe to be wise in me only, &amp; be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
to feele nothing but mee onely.
Thou shalt want nothing if thou bee
content in this sorte to want thy selfe.
Thou shalt want nothing as long as
thou art with me, I will haue care of
thee, I will protect thee, thou canst
loose nothing in loosing of thy selfe
after this sort, for thou shalt finde in
mee, that which is a hundred times
better, then the thinges which thou
haste lost for my sake. Cast therefore
all thy care, all thy trouble, all thy
feare, and euen thy selfe also vpon me
and commit thy selfe to mee. Hope
and trust in me, thy hope cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
thee, neither can it possibly bee

thou mayest mortefie and extinguish
thy selfe, that is by rooting out thy

and by renouncing all those

thou oughtest to labour with all thy

               <p>Once againe I say vnto thee, accept

in all thinges of my prouidence,
with ioy and gladnes, and with looue
&amp; thankesgiuing to me for my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For in all those thinges which
happen vnto thee, I doo intende and
worke thy saluation, and with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler

thee, I send and appoint these thinges
for thee, to the ende that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iest

draw out of things which thou seest
&amp; feelest, and out of all things which
doo happen vnto thee, an occasion to
praise and honour me, that thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
be worthie to vnderstand the true
cause why I permitted them, that is,
with howe great charitie I sent them
vnto thee, and how thou oughtest to
referre all these things vnto my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

that otherwise my good pleasure

thou shouldest suffer somewhat for

benefits which I daylie powre vppon

my iustice to doo with thee whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I will, and it is no more lawfull for
thee to gainesay me, then for the earth
to gainesay the Potter. For what hast
thou to say against mee, who am thy

or sorrowe? But knowing thou hast
committed so much wickednes as
thou hast done, why dost thou not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
desire that that contempt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thou hast despised my goodnesse
shoulde bee punished in thee, and thy

But there is yet another reason to

is, because I am one, which doo loue

all things that are best and most hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for thee.</p>
               <p>And seeing it was my will before I
created thee, that thou shouldest suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
at this houre, and at this moment
those same thinges which thou doost

all thinges, that this my most louing

will, beeing full of all fidelitie and

and with deuotion in thy hart, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

               <p>Receaue therefore all affliction

And when thou suffrest no aduersity,

thinke that my good will is alienated
from thee, &amp; that I am offended with
thee, because I withdraw afflictions &amp;
tribulations from thee, which is the
notablest gift and ornament where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I am wont to honour and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my friends.</p>
               <p>Recount with thy selfe howe great
vexations, how great pesecutions, how
great contradictions, how great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
how great &amp; wearisome toiles
I suffered: how great my most deare
mother endured: and to be short, how
great all my friendes walking in my

but this high waye to the heauenlie
country, which way of necessitie thou
must passe thorough, if thou desirest
to enioy our companie in eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines.
Lastlie consider that there is
nothing so small or so little woorth,
which either thou dost or sufferest for
my sake, but that thou shalt receaue a
very great and glorious reward of me


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6087:89"/>
for it. And yet notwithstanding I will
not haue thee to serue mee, or to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
these things in hope of reward, but
onely of meere loue towards mee. I
know what reward I will giue thee, I
say I will, because I doo not owe it
thee in any other sort, then for that it is
my will to bestow it vpon thee. For all
my gifts are of free grace. Thinke not
thou therefore of any rewarde, be not
so base minded, but thinke of me, with
a more noble, louing, and faithful hart,
and submit thy selfe vnto mee, euen of

whatsoeuer my will is to lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

how great fruit is reaped by tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
thou wouldest esteeme it as
a great happines to glory in crosses &amp;
afflictions. The greater aduersities
therefore that doo happen vnto thee,
and the more contrary that they are
to thy desires, yea, although they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
such desires of thine as are to
please mee) the more earnestly thou
shouldest endeuor patiently to suffer
them, &amp; the more wholly thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:6087:90"/>
resigne thy selfe vnto me. For it
is done by my will and prouidence,
that thy will sometime bee hindered:
yea, euen when it is good, that by this
meane for one vertue thou maiest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
two, and withall maiest receiue
the rewarde of a good worke for thy
good will (although thou be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to put it in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) &amp; for the
aduersitie which did hinder thy will,
thou shalt receiue a crown of patience.
Thou maiest adde to all these, for thy
farther incouragement this one reason
also, that the more thy good will is
tempted by aduersitie, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller
it is found, and the more patient
it is in bearing of crosses, and such
thinges as resist it: the more glorious
the crowne is which I haue laide vp to
reward it. Therefore because I loue
thee, I will haue thee to be wholy and
purely a faithfull Spouse vnto mee. I
will haue thee to serue mee with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all interest in thy selfe, and
to goe, not whether thou wilt, but
whether I sende or leade thee. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must thou seeke withall to serue


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6087:90"/>
thine owne appetite, when thou labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in these thinges to please mee: but
rather as a faithfull, deuout, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
handmaid, which hath no will to
do any thing, but that which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the will of her Mistresse. Thou
must seeke in nothing to please thy
selfe, but me onely, with all sinceritie
and puritie in thy intention, and that
must be alwaies most acceptable vnto
thee which I lay vppon thee to suffer,
whether it be by the hands of men, or
any other meane whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>Respect not therefore men, neither
impute it to men, if thou sustainest any
aduersitie. What blame doth the rod
deserue, if the father seeking to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his sonne doth vse it? why then
art thou angry with men, which being
my instrumentes serue as a scourge to
correct thee? Seeke not therefore to
resist them, or to argue against them,
but haue a speciall care that thine own
impaciencie doo not hurt thy selfe, &amp;
lest thou lose that benefit by repining,
which thou shouldest haue gained by
patient suffering.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:6087:91"/>
Bee therefore curteous and gentle
towardes all men, in taking patiently
whatsoeuer shall happen. Carry a
milde countenance, and vse an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
behauiour, that no choller, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming,
no deiection of thy minde,
nor sorrow appear in thee, nor yet that
any thing be found in thee, which may
make men to thinke, that thou endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
some affliction, or art oppressed
with some trouble.</p>
               <p>If any man reprooue or reproche
thee, shewe him a milde and gentle
countenance holding thy peace, and
smile with a certaine kinde of bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and modestie, in token of thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
which accepteth it in good part,
and which taketh all things well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either thinking of reuenge, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
of an iniurie. Beware that
thou speakest not at that time aboue
two or three words, and that with great
temperance. And by this meane thou
shalt shewe thy selfe so humble and
meeke, as euery man may presume to
reprooue thee, and no man be afraide
to displease thee, or to vse any reproch


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6087:91"/>
towards thee. Learne in all aduersitie
whensoeuer any man doth chide thee,
reproch thee, or iniurie thee, to vse si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
to beare it patiently, and to bee
quiet, and thou shalt assuredly find my
grace, which thou canst neuer attaine
vnto by any other meane, then by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quiet, and suffering patiently what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
I shall lay vppon thee, being as
willing if it stand with my pleasure, to
receiue aduersitie, as to enioy prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p>Thou hast (my Daughter &amp; Spouse

patience and meekenes, neither did I

was a liuely patterne of patience, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millitie,

of all my paines and torments, of
all the derisions &amp; blasphemies, which
mine enemies vsed towards me, of all
their cruell threatnings, of their most
wicked and despightfull countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against mee, what complaint or

of them did I speake sharpely? which
of them did I answere? to which of
them did I wish any harme? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was I not sorry for them, when I
did pray for them all? Followe thou
therefore my example, and haue pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
still ioyned with quietnes and

without murmuring or complaining.
Fight not for thy selfe, defend not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

will fight for thee. Cleaue therefore
in the meane time whole vnto mee, in

all gladnes, rather to suffer any confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for my sake, then either inwardly

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6087:92"/>

I would wish thee to bee alwaies
ready with a ioyfull and deuout hart to
runne and meete any aduersitie, that

selfe vnto me, as one that is willing to
suffer tribulations, to want all thinges
that thou desirest, and both to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
trauaile, and to beare any misery
in what sort soeuer it shall be my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to appoint. Thinke that day
lost wherein thou hast not receiued
some notable crosse. If thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
what great commodity is reaped
by patience, thou wouldest doo great
honour, and shewe great thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to those that afflict thee. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how I, as an innocent Lambe, did
carry a most meeke and quiete

those which did spette vppon

               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:6087:93"/>
In like sort must thou doo, and not

thatis, reioyce, because I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

thee. Seeke no glorie to thy selfe by
my giftes, neither couer to vsurpe or

neither yet ascribe any thing to

               <p>Ascribe nothing at all I say to thy

to thine own worthines, nor reioyce in
it, as if it were thine own acte, but refer

all vnto me, and keepe thy selfe from

from attributing anye thing to thine

so often remember with sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

me, earnestly desiering my grace, and
my fauour onely, which is a most safe
refuge, a most happie hauen for thee,
and that not for a time, but endles and
eternall.</p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer therefore doth busie

thy sences with any cogitations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
anie of my creatures, is, neither
pure, nor without danger in thy soule.
Whensoeuer all thy naturall appetite
receaueth any recreation, comfort or
delight, (if thou seekest to attaine to
a perfect puritie) thou must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
renounce that pleasure whether it
bee in wordes or anye other earthlie
thing. Thou must passe ouer all things
with a free minde, in no sort subiect or
in bondage vnto them, nor adhering
to any but me onely. Take this also
with thee for a certaine rule, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
maketh a man so free from the
loue of himselfe or any other creature
and so far from beeing intangled with
anie earthlie cogitation, as to despise
himselfe and all creatures, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of me in his hart, as his onelie
precious Iewell, esteeming all other
thinges (as they are indeede) as filthie
dung.</p>
               <p>Make a dilligent search in all thy
actions, studies, and desires, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
thee vnto them, &amp; whether thou
speakest or holdest thy peace, whether


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6087:104"/>
thou doost somewhat, or beest at rest,
looke narrowly into the innermost
corners of thy soule, that is into the
verie marrow of thy cogitations and
intentions, and thou shalt often finde
that the originall roote &amp; seed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this groweth, and from whence
this doth spring, which thou thinkest
diuine, is meerely humayne, impure,
and a lewde seeking to please thine
owne appetite.</p>
               <p>Take heede therefore that no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thought enter into thee, nor any
inordinate luste remaine in thee. Oh
if thou haddest thy hart clearely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from the loue of euerie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Oh if beeing wholly conuerted
vnto me, thou diddest desire mee on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
I woulde with as great a desire run
to meete thee, and enter of mine own
accord with as great affection into thy
hart, as if I coulde not liue without
thee, or that without beeing with thee
I could not enioy perfect happines &amp;
contentation.</p>
               <p>This course I know wil seeme grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
vnto thee at the beginning, and


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:6087:104"/>
it cannot be without some troble thus
straightly to note and obserue in all
thinges what thou seekest, what
thoughts possesse thy hart, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thou findest any cogitation that
is not of mee, or for my sake, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to root it out of thy minde. This I
say, will procure thee great labour, and
affliction of thy spirit. For thou shalt
finde both thy selfe, and thine owne
appetite lie lurking in many thinges
wherein thou must of necessitie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
both, and presently mortefie any
desire that is vnlawfull, and inordinate
in thee. For if thou seekest to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thine owne nature, it followeth
of necessitie that thou must doo it by
violence and forcible meanes. And
therefore thou shalt finde as many
crosses, as thou hast wicked or impure
inclinations, which must be mortefied
in thee. But by this meane (my
Daughter) thou shalt first come to
knowe thy selfe, for by seeing thine
owne disabillitie and weakenes in that
thou canst not ouercome thy selfe,
thou shalt be humbled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:6087:105"/>
And whereas before thou though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
thy selfe to bee somewhat, thou
shalt then plainlye finde that thou art
nothing: And if thou persistest in
this course with continuall and inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
labour, that which at the first was
painefull, thou shalt quickly finde to
be very easie. For this dilligent and
daylie looking into thy selfe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
of all thy thoughtes, doth
worke many thinges in thee, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for thy saluation. It will shew
thee thine infirmitie, and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it will breede in thee sorrow, for
those sinnes which thou findest in thy
selfe, and an earnest desire to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
of them. It will also make thee
very carefull to beware of manye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
&amp; to auoid many dangers, into
which otherwise thou wouldest haue
fallen. To conclude, the labour &amp;
distresse which thou sustainest, and the
toyle which thou takest to be clearely
rid of these imperfectious, and the
teares which thou sheddest (because
thou canst not ouercome thy selfe, &amp;
cleane be without those thinges which


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6087:105"/>
thou wouldest altogether forsake (shal

in thy courage, for thou shalt
ouercome all thinges by setling thy
whole trust in my mercie. Haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in me, &amp; thou shalt finde that
I wil make these crosses light for thee,

of other members of my misticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
that by them thou mayest serue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
help others, and both gaine and
draw thy neghbours to the knowledge
of my will, and the dooing of my
commandementes. For peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I gaue not them those thinges
which I gaue thee, because in thee I
prouided, both for them and thy selfe
also, as on the contrarie part, I haue to
the same end with-holden many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from thee, which I bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them. For in these thinges
which I bestowed vppon others, I had


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:6087:110"/>
respect vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, I had respect vnto
thee, &amp; gaue them not for themselues
onlie, but for thee in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
those graces vppon them for
thy benefit. I require therefore at thy
handes, that thou employest my gifts
to other mens commoditie, &amp; he pest
other men most willinglie by them as
much as lieth in thy power. If thou
canst doo somewhat, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
that so by this meane one kinde of
charitie remaining in you all, may
make of many of you one bodie: and
whatsoeuer this bodie hath in one
member, let him employ it to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the rest. For euery member
ought to make one another partaker
of the gifts which euery one of them
receiueth by reason of the vnion of
the bodie and communion of charitie
which is amongst them.</p>
               <p>Let this consideration of my will
make thee (my Daughter) chearefull
to serue thy neighbours, glad to beare
their burthens, meeke to suffer with
them, gentle to comfort them, readie
to succour them, and willing to reioice


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:6087:110"/>
with them, that no enuy at all, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
no emulation, no seeking to
please thine owne appetite, be founde
in thee, nor yet that any of these
thinges may appeare in thy fellowes,
but that there may remaine betweene
you perfect charitie, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
of my gifts one with another,
as betweene the members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
For thou hast nothing that is thine
own. For what hast thou that thou hast
not receiued? Wherefore thou hast
nothing, as I saide, that is not mine,
thou hast nothing that is giuen to thy
selfe alone, that is, thou hast nothing
that is giuen thee for thy selfe onelie,
but all things whatsoeuer thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
are committed to thy custodie
to be altogether emploied for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of the whole bodie of my
Church, &amp; looke vnto it, for I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
an account at thy handes, howe
thou hast bestowed the same. Take
heed therfore that thou be neuer cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away with so profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or thinke thy self so well &amp; so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie
contented in beeing with mee,


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:6087:111"/>
but that (if neither the corporall, or
spirituall necessitie of thy neighbour
doo call thee away from it) thou bee
ready to forsake thine owne consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the commodity of thine owne
deuotion, yea, and the sweete exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
or matter wherewith the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it selfe is nourished, &amp; neglecting
wholly to please thy selfe, bee willing
to runne in hast to helpe thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for my sake. For this is perfect
charitie, not to seeke thine owne, but
thy neighbours benefite. And this
charity is more acceptable vnto mee,
and more profitable for thy selfe, then
all the contemplation or deuotion
that thou canst vse of thine owne.
Moreouer, remember alwaies that in
all thy actions, in all thy affections, &amp;
in all those thinges which either thou
dost or makest choise of, or sufferest
or seekest to auoide, I may be thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
thy middle, and thy ende,
that whatsoeuer thou dost, or leauest
vndone, may be for my sake, and that
in the following of this course, thou
seekest no other thing, but onely my


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:6087:111"/>
glory, and the fulfilling of my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
For the deede is not so accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to mee, in respect of it selfe, when
thou dost succour, or takest compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vpon thy neighbour: but thou art
in dooing hereof most acceptable in
my sight, because thou dooest for my
sake, leaue thy selfe, that is, because
thou forsakest thine owne commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and seekest to relieue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
necessitie. For if thou dost any
thing for any other respect, whether it
be for fauour, friendship, or any speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
bond of kindred or familliaritie, or
for any commoditie, or recompence
which thou lookest to receiue. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
not of it, but reiect it, although it
bee neuer so great and worthy an act.
For I accept of no sacrifice that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto mee, if it bee not offered for
my sake, onely and wholly.</p>

to haue some drinke. In like sort
if thou diddest loue mee perfectly, if
thou diddest long for me vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
thou couldest thinke of nothing
els, but how thou mightest come vnto
me, how thou mightest be vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

that thou wouldest neuer bee satisfied
or contented with that which thou
haste done to mine honour, how great
soeuer it were, but euer grieued and

that the same which thou haste
done alreadie for my honour was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

endeuour thy selfe to doo better, thou
wouldest alwaies thirste to bee more
perfect, thy hart woulde euer burne
with desire to be more neerely vnited
vnto me, to honour me more, &amp; more
fully to fulfil my wil &amp; good pleasure.
They which are inflamed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
&amp; an vnmeasurable loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
anie man or woman, doo loath
meat, drinke, and all other thinges,
which seeme eyther for delightes to

sustaine their bodie, and pine awaie, &amp;
growe sicklie, if they can not enioye
their desire, or if they finde and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
that they are not loued againe.
For they languish with meere loue, &amp;


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:6087:114"/>
that maketh them, that they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take any ioy, nor receaue any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

nor finde any rest, except they
may obtaine that which they loue. (O
my Daughter) thou oughtest to loue
mee in this sorte, that thou mightest
finde in me onlie ioy and consolation,
and without me in all places nothinge
but sorrow and affliction. If thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
rightly loue me as thou shouldest
doe, thou couldest not be in rest vntill
thou diddest possesse me. For there
would a continuall thirste, hunger &amp;
desire burne within thy soule, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
thee to enioye anie quiet at
all.</p>
               <p>O that thou diddest languish with
such a kinde of loue towards mee, or
that hating all other thinges thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
desire mee onelie. O that thou
diddest present thy hart vnto me quite
weaned, and clearely deliuered from
all other loue whatsoeuer, that I may
still draw it after me, and both pearce
it thorough and wounde it to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome

shuldest thou be, if being made quite

besides thy selfe, and drunke with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie
of loue towardes mee, thou
diddest despise all thinges els, thou
diddest loath all my creatures, and
diddest runne only after mee, crying
vnto me, I am wounded with thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
Thou oughtest my Daughter to
be enflamed with so feruent an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towardes mee, as whosoeuer did
come neere vnto thee might perceaue
no other thing els, but only the heate
of thine affection towardes me, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of thee, and whosoeuer did
talke with thee might depart edefied
from thee, and warmed with the
flames of that affection towards me,
which hee found kindled in thy soule,
If therefore thou desirest to loue me,
thou must loue mee with thy whole
hart. I will not allow that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
loue me, and ioyntlie with mee
anie thing els besides me, that is, that
thou shouldest not loue any thing for
anye other respect but for my sake
onelie. I looke to bee loued purely,
and that thou canst neuer doo but
when thou louest mee, for my owne


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:6087:115"/>
selfe, that I onely &amp; no other respect,
whatsoeuer be the cause why thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
me. I will also be beloued with
an infinite loue, and with an vnmeasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
desire, for thou shouldest neuer
finde in thy soule anie end or measure
in louing me, but although thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
loue mee neuer so much, thou
shouldest alwaies desire to loue mee
more. For my loue is not restrayned
within any limits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is infinite and
without any bounds. It neuer think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it selfe satisfied, it can neuer be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or contented with any quantitie,
though it bee neuer so exceeding
great, it will euerie day grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
to be more. For charitie doth
alwaies encrease, and what is charitie
but a good will. As therefore a good
will cannot bee restrained within any
limite, and as it is without all end, so is
charitie likewise. I knowe that thou
haste a will to loue mee with all thy
heart, and that thou desirest to loue
me as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thy selfe alone, as all
my holy seruants do, ioyning all their
loue together. This desire is good, if


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6087:115"/>
it procede not from an appetite of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring,
in respect that thou wouldest
be more excellent then they, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler
aboue them all, as though thou
onely couldest loue mee as much as
all they, when all their loue were put
together. It is a good desire I say, if
it springeth from pure &amp; perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
only, &amp; that thou doest for mine
owne sake, without any other respect,
desire me, loue me, and wish still to
encrease in the loue of me, and seeke
to loue me as much alone, as it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for all other beeing ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Haue care therefore that this
desire of thine proceed not of any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
to bee preferred before others,
but onelye because charitie can neuer
be satisfied or filled, &amp; that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
thereof maketh thee thinke that
how much soeuer thou louest mee, is
much inferiour in thine eyes to that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which thou dost desire to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
towards me, and in no sorte either
answerable, or agreeable to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
               <p>My loue is no idle loue, but it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:6087:116"/>
great thinges where it is indeede.
And where there is no desire but an
vnaptnesse and vnwillingnesse to doo
good workes, there is no loue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubte. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this, if thou wantest abilitie
to do good workes, bee not therefore
discouraged (my Daughter) or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
in thy minde, for thy good will
pleaseth mee as much as if the worke
were done, and is as acceptable in my
sight. I will not require an account of
thee for that I haue not bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee. For it is not the multitude of
workes, but the greatnesse of loue
which delighteth mee. Many good
workes, if they bee presented vnto
mee without charitie, doo pacifie me
no whitte at all. For what is chaffe
to me without wheat? to whomesoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thou doost offer wheat, which is
loue, offer him also chaffe which is
workes. For although I regarde not
workes without loue, yet I will haue
good regarde of thy loue without
workes, so as thou be hindred by disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
necessitie, obedience, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:6087:116"/>
lawfull impediment, in such sorte
as thou art not able to do good works.
For then (as I haue saide) I accept of
thy good will: But where power wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not, if loue remaine it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
it selfe, and exercise it selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
me, and for my sake towardes
her neighbour. For I haue placed him
as a companion with thee in my steed,
that whatsoeuer thou wouldest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
vppon mee, and cannot, thou
mayest bestow vppon him. And that
thou mayest doo it the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I haue promised that I will accept
as well at thy handes, and rewarde as
largely any thing that thou doost to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thy neighbour, as if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
done it to my felfe. For if thou
haste charitie, it worketh so in thee, as
thou louest him for my sake, thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdest
me in him, thou seruest me in
him, thou dooest mee benefits in him,
thou dost beare with mee in him, thou
dost suffer me in him, and if he offend
thee, thou dost forgiue me in him.</p>
               <p>And for this cause I gaue him vnto
thee in my steed, that thou maiest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:6087:117"/>
these good turnes vpon him, as
time and place serueth, and as thou
haste oportunitie offered by mee to
doo the same. For thou must not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that which I repeated before, how
charitie is not to bee measured or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
by the multitude of workes,
but by the greatnesse and sincerity of
thy affection, that is, by the inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of thy mind, ioyned with a pure,
chaste, and internall disposition, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
&amp; intention of thy will, which
the more readie, prompt, feruent, and
desirous it is, to obey me, honour me,
and please me, and the more that shee
renounceth her owne selfe, in seeking
to please mee purelie, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respect, and to preferre mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other creatures, the more
shee is drawne to loue mee, and the
brighter shee doth openly shine in all
good workes.</p>
               <p>O if the children of men did know
how much it pleaseth mee to dwell in
such a soule, howe gladlie I doo offer
my selfe vnto her, which desireth mee
onely, how bountifull I do powre my


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:6087:117"/>
selfe into such a heart as dooth seeke
me only, with a pure intention beeing
withdrawne and free both from the
loue of her selfe, &amp; of any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
beside, desiring me feruently, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
mee whollie, staying for mee
patiently, and refusing to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with any other thing but with me
onely. Nay, such a hart as I speake of,
will not desire to bee comforted by
mee, because shee thinketh her selfe
vnworthie to receaue any consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from me, but desireth onely to bee
satisfied with hauing my good will &amp;
pleasure fulfilled in her. For she only
desireth to doo, to suffer, and to bee in
no other sorte then agreeth with my
pleasure, &amp; then although such a hart
neyther desireth comfort, nor any
thing els, which is without mee, yet I
doo rewarde and enrich her with all
blessings and benefits. For there can
bee nothing wanting in anie creature,
neither can there bee any thing forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the loue of me, that is so good,
but that there shall bee found in mee
things in steede of them, a hundred


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:6087:118"/>
times better, purer, sweeter, pleasanter
and more delightfull than they were.
For whether it be beautie, sweetnesse,
pleasantnesse, delight, loue, truth,
consolation, the continuall enioying
of such thinges as men do like, riches,
glorie, power, and innumerable other
thinges of the same sort, which either
may bring delights to them, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
desire to them: all these thinges,
are after an infinite manner more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and more perfect in me, than
in any creature whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>O my Daughter, the smallest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
which thou feelest by the
presence of my goodnes in thy soule,
doth surmount all the delights of the
worlde, and the pleasure that can bee
taken in any creature whatsoeuer. Yea
all other delightes beeing compared
with it, doth seeme bitter and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt.
Wherefore, if things were
measured by a true and iust account,
it could not bee, but that men woulde
loue mee better then themselues, or
anie other creature. But nowe (it is
a lamentable thing to bee spoken)


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:6087:118"/>
men doo leaue mee which am theyr
greatest good, they despise my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
nay which is more, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their owne true and onelye hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
and fall to loue themselues,
to delight in the world, from whence
all disquietnes of minde, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mischiefes doo proceede. Alas,
why are miserable men so farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued?
If thou delight in loue, why
loue they not me? whose loue is chast,
pure, holy, and simple, which am an
obiect alwaies offered to their eyes of
infinite amiablenes beeing essentially
good in my selfe, being a pure good,
vnmixed, beeing the chiefest and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
good, where the rewarde of
loue also is vnspeakable delight, and
most blessed eternity, wheras the loue
of the worlde on the contrarie parte,
dooth breede nothing in thy soule
but vnquietnesse, bitternesse, distructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
repentance &amp; heuines. Leaue thou
therfore &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne al worldly things
and desire me only, being vnited vnto
me with all thy soule, with al thy hart,
and with all thy will. For as long as
thou dost addict thy selfe to the loue


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6087:119"/>
of creatures, thou shalt finde that
which is in creatures, that is, thou shalt
be defiled and disquieted, with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and vncleane delights, and yet
besides that be neuer satisfied or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.
And thou shalt also be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with vnpure imaginations, and be
distracted with sundry cogitations, that
be lewd and wicked. But I doe collect
that hart which seeketh to bee ioyned
with me, and I vnite it fast vnto mee,
procuring in it by my meanes all
peace, quietnes, and all tranquillity of
conscience.</p>
               <p>Thou oughtest continually to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

loue of all my creatures, and be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

dedicated in thy soule to my seruice.
For no man can bestowe this grace on
thee, neyther canst thou obtaine it by

Wherefore thou must alwaies with

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6087:119"/>
my counsaile, obey my exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and commit thy selfe altogether
to my prouidence. My inspirations
doo neuer disagree from the holie
Scripture, nor from the obedience
which thou must carrie to thy superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.
Therefore if thou submitest thy
selfe vnto them, and reliest in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
vppon thine owne selfe: thou
art sure to walke in all simplicitie &amp;
puritie of hart.</p>
               <p>Loue is an incomprable treasure, &amp;
therefore I should be the store-house
of the same, and it should neuer bee
laid vp, but in me only. O (my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
where thy treasure is there is thy
hart also. If then thou wilt knowe
what thou louest, marke what thou
dost oftnest thinke vppon, what thou
dost with greatest delight, &amp; willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
harken vnto, what thou dost most
feruently desire, what thou doost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in thine owne appetite most
seeke, and bend thy selfe vnto: for
that is, without all doubt thy treasure,
and therein thou findest sweetest rest,
most quiet, and greatest contentation.


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6087:120"/>
And both of them is thy treasure,
both the thing which thou louest, and
the loue wherewith thou louest the
same. But see into how great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
how great vnthankfulnes, &amp; how
great infelicitie men doo fall by this
meanes, for they do purchase to them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues
hell fire, with the expence of
incomparable treasure which is loue.
For if men contemning me, fal to loue
corrupt, vncleane, and fraile thinges,
such as will quickly perish: they doo
with the same loue, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
vppon them procure vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
eternall torment. Let all my
friends therefore bewaile and lament,
this strange and vnnaturall kinde of
dealing, that I am cleane thrust out of
the hart of man, for whome I offered
vp my selfe in sacrifice, and whose sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
I did buy with my precious
blood, &amp; that an other which is mine
enemy dooth possesse it only to this
end, that he may draw them with him
into eternall destruction, into endles
misery, and into vnquenchable fire.</p>

howe all creatures when they haue

that I declare vnto thee, how that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie

to imprint this lesson in thy minde,
that although thou dost endeuour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

that thou haddest done nothing at all.</p>
               <p>I will tell thee (my daughter) what

I must needes tell thee, that it dooth
please mee so much as that internall


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:6087:123"/>
praise which consisteth in the spirite.
A profound contemplation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of thine owne base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
a consideration of thine owne
weakenes, how thou art of thy selfe
meerely nothing, and a modest shame
procured by the meane of thy vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
before my Maiestie: It is a
most sweete smelling sacrifice, and a
most delightfull praise vnto mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou shalt be brought by it with
a shamefast kinde of modestie, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie
to looke into, and to despise
in my glorious presence, thine owne
vilenes, deformednes, vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
wretchednes and miserie, and bee
also mooued to acknowledge howe
thou art of thy selfe meerely nothing,
and therefore bee desirous to humble
and subiect thy selfe before mee, and
euerie one of my creatures, and to be
willing, or rather to wish to bee in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of thine owne basenes, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and troden vnder of them all.
Such a contrite and humbled hart I
can neuer despise, yea the sorrowfull
groane of such a heart, is as muche


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:6087:124"/>
sweeter and worthier sacrifice vnto
mee, than a huge heape of manye
wordes, &amp; a tedious multitude of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
praiers only. Moreouer, thou dost
then likewise truely and righty praise
mee, when I am as acceptable vnto
thee, for sending aduersitie as prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and when thou giuest me as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thankes, and remainest as deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and zelously affected towards me
in thine owne will for the one as for
the other. It is not also the least praise
that thou mayest yeeld me to beware
of sinne, to take great paines in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
after vertue, to thirst for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
and extolling of thy name,
and to seeke only for the fulfilling of
my pleasure, and the setting foorth of
my glorie. Besides this, it is a much
purer kinde of praise, and more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vnto me than any vocall praise,
to keepe thy hart vndefiled, pure, and
free from all vicious affections, from al
slouthfull humors, from all heauines,
vnwillingnes, and frowardnes in thy

if thou finde thy minde so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
and alienated from mee, as
thou canst neither recollect it againe,
not yet returne and lift it vp vnto me,
thinke not that it wandred thus in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that charite, which thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
shewe meerely for my sake: but
that thine owne wicked inclination
hath poluted thee, and that there was
somewhat hidden within thee, which
mooued thee to this, whereof I was


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:6087:129"/>
neither the Author, nor occasion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet was it any way procured by
my meane. Thou wert not belike
circumspect and watchfull enough, &amp;
therefore thou diddest suffer some
humane infirmitie. But remaine not
long estranged or alienated from me,
for I am alwaies readie to receiue thee
againe into my fauour. Let thy mind
therefore be euer occupied in holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
that no moment may passe thee,
wherein thou dost not wound mee, &amp;
seeke to pearce my hart, with the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
darts of thy inflamed desires. Bee
assured (my Daughter) that thou canst
desire nothing at my handes in vaine:
For if thou dost desire mee, thou shalt
finde mee, but if I doo withdrawe and
hide my selfe from thee for a time, I
doo it for thy sake and thy benefit. For
I cannot choose, but graunt my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
to those that call vpon mee and
desire mee: I doo stirre vp these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
in thee, I inspire thy hart with
these motions, and therefore bee sure
that I will also harken to thy petitions
and heare thy praiers. For although


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:6087:130"/>
it shoulde so fall out by the meane of
my prouidence, as thou shouldest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
vnheard of mee to the houre
of thy death, yet it is vnpossible that I
should not at all heare a deuout praier,
but I will euen at that instant render
thee an hundred fold for thy long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing.
Thou shalt then perceiue
that I will giue thee for one petition a
thousand: Thou shalt then finde
that thou art heard at my hands, when
thou canst neuer againe loose the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
thereof. But in all thy praiers,
let this be thy chiefest petition, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
at my hands, that thou maiest pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
mee: For what is more holy?
what is more for my glory, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
mee aboue all thinges, and before
all things? Pray therefore alwaies for
a naked, and only a pure, a most chaste
a most perfect, a most earnest, a most
watchfull, and a most faithfull charitie
towards mee, whereby both thy selfe
and all other reasonable creatures may
cleaue vnto me with a resolute minde
and with such a firme intention, as no

               <p>To obtaine this seperation of thy

thou must of necessitie (as I warned

thee before) haue great watch ouer
thy selfe, and straightly obserue by

thee, what possesseth thee, what
raigneth in thee, to conclude what
thou louest, or inclinest thy selfe vnto,
whether it bee thy selfe, or any other
creature, or me. And thou must thrust
presently out of thy minde whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thou findest there, if it be not my

Therfore except thou seekest me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thou shalt neuer perfectly find me,
&amp; if thou wilt enioy me, banish al cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

between thee &amp; me. Let all creatnres
be banished from thee, but onely such

that thou mayest keepe thy selfe free
and pure vnto mee from them all,
and maiest wholy submit thy selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, and be readie to be disposed in
all such sorts as it shall be my pleasure.
Whatsoeuer shal happen it is enough
for thee that thou knowest it, &amp; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
that it hath happened. Trouble thy
selfe no farther with thinking of it,
neither suffer it to stay within thee, or
to leaue anye memorie or impression
thereof in thy soule: But rely vppon
me, &amp; commit all thy cares vnto me,
passe and flie ouer the multitude, the
variety, and the mutabilitie of these
cogitations, and neuer fix or settle thy
hart but in me only. Seeke therefore
mee onelie, and no more but mee in
all thinges, which am one in all and all
in all, and waite patiently with long
suffering till thou findest me, yea, bee
content to stay &amp; wait for mee againe,


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6087:135"/>
and againe, and neuer bee wearie of
waiting till thou findest mee, reposing
thy selfe vpon my goodnes, and vpon
my most wise prouidence, full of all
loue towards thee with a strong faith,
and an assured trust therein. When
I stay my comming, expect mee pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
for I will come at the last with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt. Bee free and altogether
weaned in this sort (O soule) from all
thine owne desire, be seperated who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
from all loue and delights in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
be alienated from all fancies &amp;
imaginations, and cleaue wholy vnto
mee, in simplicitie and nakednesse of

by me, and forsake cleane thine owne
will, that thou mayest reioyce with me
in all eternitie, where there are ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges past, nor things to come,
but all things present. Aspire alwaies,
and earnestly desire to obtaine this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
nowe, and forsake both thy selfe
and all other thinges, that is thy body,
and sensualitie, and haue thine eye so
fixed vppon eternitie in this present
world, as if thou wert quite seperated


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:6087:135"/>
from it, and clearely deliuered out of
it, beholding all the thinges in this
world a far off, as those thinges which
thou hast wholy forsaken, and from
which thou hast clearely weaned thy

with thee.</p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer thou feelest besides

such as desire to imitate the life of
Christ, and seeke to liue after the

            <p>IESVS CHRIST which was made
man for your sakes, did preach vnto
the world in times past, and did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
them one rule of life by my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
for the saluation of them all, hee
that beleeueth it can neuer erre, and
he that obserueth it, can neuer perish.


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:6087:138"/>
For it onely is sufficient alone for the
saluation of mans soule, beeing well
obserued, and it instructeth a man ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in all vertue &amp; perfection. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if men did liue after that rule,
there were no neede of the rules of
Monkes, there were no neede of any
fratermities, or associations, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of men, that liue vnder one
rule and order, there were no neede
of any Cannons whatsoeuer, seeing
that they which did liue purely, and
sincerely, after the rules of my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
needed no other thing to instruct
them in all perfection. But after men
forsooke the rule of my Gospell, and
euerie man did only thinke vppon his
owne proper commoditie according
to the nature of men, it came then to
passe not without my counsaile &amp; the
direction of my spirite, that many of
my Saints did deuise sundrie meanes
wherby they might roote out of mens
mindes the loue of the world, and of
themseues, which made them quite
forsake mee, and grow cold in the

and beside that they might restore
vnto the world a perfect course of life
howe to obserue my Gospell &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements.
Therefore many of
them haue set downe certaine rules,
how to keepe vnder and cut off those
Passions whereby anye occasion is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to breake the law of my Gospell,
and haue commaunded that those
thinges shoulde bee straightlie obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
which doo stirre vp, purifie, &amp;

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:6087:139"/>
and would not permit the smallest tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
that might be against the rule ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
It appeareth manifestlie also that
some which liued after them added
newe constitutions and many ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
to these rules, and doo more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely
and sharpely punish men for
their transgressions of these ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
then of my Gospell, which is a
very preposterous course, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to all good order: For a man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and punished if he speake
out of time, if he sing out of tune, or
if hee offend in any of these ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
But I had rather (although I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of these) that there should not be
smaller but much greater care had of
euangelicall preceptes, then of these
ceremonies, and that there should bee
a sharper censure against those that
breake my commandement, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such as offend in these ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
As for example, I would not
haue them goe vnpunished which
sweare by my name, which backebite
any bodie, which hate their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
or do any such thing as my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:6087:139"/>
doth forbidde: For there must
needs be appointed sharper discipline,
and there must alwaies bee seuerer
lawes ordained and appointed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
those which doo breake my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
and for the obseruation
whereof, the auntient Fathers in times
heretofore did prescribe sundrie rules.
But what shall I say? I see that you in
these daies doo neither obserue my
Gospell, nor yet the rules of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
fathers: You boast of my words
in your mouth, and of my Gospell in
your common talke, but it appeareth
manifestly, how farre I am out of your
hart, seeing you doo not loue me, nor
my commandements. Returne you
therefore nowe (although it bee late,
which haue walked so long in crooked
paths with your harts vnto me, doo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and beleeue in my Gospell, &amp;
doo not only beleeue whatsoeuer my
Gospell teacheth, but by beleeuing it,
and louing it, doo whatsoeuer it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth.
If you will be Christians, if
you will be my Disciples, imitate me,
learne of me, because I am meeke and


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:6087:140"/>
humble of hart, walke yee, as I haue
walked. Moreouer, if you will bee
Monckes, if you will be Priestes, or if
you will bee religious men, doo those
thinges which are of the spirite, and
mortefie by the spirite the workes of
the flesh. If you be (as you say) E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangicall
and followers of my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
doo those things which my
Gospell doth command you, howe
long will you say vnto me Lord, Lord,
and will not doe those things which I
say? Doe those thinges which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
you, and shewe your selues to
be my friends, not in wordes only, but
in deed and in truth, for hee that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
my wordes, he that hath my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
and doth them, this is he
that loueth mee. And for stirring vp
againe of that feruent zeale which
hath bin heretofore in mens minds, &amp;
for renuing the obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
which is almost worne out of vse:
I deliuer nowe vnto those which are
my friends, and deuoutlie affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, two very short rules: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
of the one is very fitte for such as bee


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:6087:140"/>
lesse perfect, and but new beginners in
following of my seruice, and the other
for such as are more perfect, and desire
with all earnestnes to attaine to a most
chaste loue of me. Wherein there is
taught no heape of ceremonies, or
multitude of praiers, but a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the conscience and inward man,
and a deuotion of the minde. There
is nothing intreated of touching the
collour or fashion of garmentes, but
the desires and endeuours of men are
stirred vp to the honouring &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Euangelicall obedience. And
there is one kinde of fraternitie made
and set downe in this place, whereby
the minds of many may bee vnited in
one, and the intents of all such agree
in one, and do loue and serue me. No
man is heere of necessitie bounde to
vow the obseruations of those things,
(although that a vow doth very much
adorne, strengthen and enrich a good
will) neyther yet doth it make a man,
if men offende therein farther guilty
of a fault, then the transgression of my
law doth pronounce him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:6087:141"/>
But I doo giue a Lawe, to all those
that desire to serue mee, agreeable to
euerie mans abillitie, and I doo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
it in such sort, as euerie man being
assisted by my grace, may keepe and
fulfill it. For my will is, that all men
should be saued, and I haue furthered
them by my helpe vnto it, so farre as it
was my good will and pleasure: And
in this respect I do often forbeare sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and wincke at their infirmities
that are weake, least I should breake a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sunder
a broken reede, or should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish,
or altogether put out smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wood: And therefore being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to gather together vnto mee, all
those that serue mee, I haue deuided
them into two kindes: In the first I
place those that be weake and new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners:
and in the second those that
be more perfect, and long practised in
my seruice, and I haue set downe such
precepts for them both as I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out of my Gospell, and are most
agreeable to their state and vocation,</p>

he cannot at the beginning beware of
all sinnes, yet let him specially beware
of mortall sinnes. If thou therefore
desirest to bee accounted in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of my faithfull seruants, beware of
sinne, and cut off and flie all occasions
of sinning. Eschew euill, and do good
for I will neuer enter into a wicked &amp;

a bodie subiect to sinne: Neuer spare
thy life or temporall goodes, if it may
either deliuer or preserue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
soule from mortall sinne; for
thou oughtest to esteeme more any
soule whatsoeuer, (for the saluation

to be more precious in thine eyes, for

it be in thy selfe or an other. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thou wouldest not haue done
vnto thy selfe, doe not to an other.
Vse no fraude, practise no deceit, doo
no iniurie: And if these thinges bee
offered thee, beare them with silence
for my sake, or at the least complaine
no otherwise of them but iustly, and
after a iust and rightfull manner. For
I haue commaunded my seruantes to
prosecute that iustly which is iust.</p>
               <p>Neuer requite euill with euill, nor
reproche with reproche, neuer repay

the loue of me, who when I was ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

thou oughtest faithfullie to exercise
thy selfe in this exercise, in taking of

For whosoeuer is merciful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

any thing to the least of my seruaunts
whether it be good or euill, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

of thine own head, chiefely in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thinges, where there may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
And therefore thou must not
procure for thy selfe any thing in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to please thine own appetite (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
such thinges onelie as doo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlie

I will take care of thee, I
will take the charge vppon my selfe
to prouide for thee, and let this bee
thine only studdie, to behaue thy self
in such sort, as thou doo nothing to
the derogation of my honour, and
the resisting of my good pleasure.
But to the ende that thy worke may
bee more pleasing vnto mee, by the
denying of thy selfe, (if thou liuest
not in the monasticall course of life)
thou mayest for the vndertaking and

thy obedience heerein to a Priest or

But thou oughtest to bee the rather
enduced by this to rely thy selfe vpon
my mercie, and firmelie to beleeue
that I which haue giuen thee
an aspiration to haue a will to doo
well, and to make a holie vowe, will
also giue thee power and abillitie to
fulfill it: For neither of them proceed
from thy selfe, but it commeth from
my grace both to haue a will to doo
well, and to doo well indeede, and
both to promise and performe those
thinges which are profitable for thy
saluation. Choose a place that is secret
and desire to liue hidd and vnknowne,
and disclose not thy counsailes to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

director and guide of thy conscience.
Bee not carefull or desirous to please
men, seeke not for their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or to haue a name amongst them,
neither yet studie to doo any thing
whereby thou maiest obtaine a great
opinion, praise, or admiration amongst
them, seeing that all things are proper

commendation is due; but endeuour


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:6087:149"/>
rather so to bridle thine affections, as
that thou maiest in all simplicitie and
puritie of hart, thinke worse and more
baselie of thy selfe than of any other,
and be desirous that other men should
conceiue the like opinion of thee; so
as whatsoeuer thou dost, whether it be
a thing worthie of commendation, or
else such a thing as may make thee to
bee contemned, and reproched of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
bee no more mooued with it (if
it be not sinne) either inwardly in thy
minde, or outwardly in thy showe, by
entering into any passion, then thou
wouldest bee if any other man had
done the same; and boast nothing of
thy selfe, glorie nothing in thy selfe,
challenge and ascribe nothing to thy
selfe, by the meane of my gifts, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
no more to thy selfe for any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
that is in thee, or for any good
workes that are done by thy meanes,
then thou wouldest do to a hatchet, or
any other instrument, which is nothing
at all in it selfe, and is able to doo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by it selfe, but if any thing bee
done by it, it is by the will of the


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:6087:150"/>
Artificer which worketh with it, and
which could doo the same by an other
instrument if it pleased him: For in
that it is come to be an instrument, &amp;
that it hath any thing in it selfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may nowe bee imploied to some
vse, it hath not this abillitie of it selfe
nor from any other, but from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer,
who did frame it in such sort, as
it may worke and doo somewhat; but
without an Artificer, or one to worke
with it, it lieth still vnprofitable, and
serueth to no purpose. In like sorte
must he thinke of himselfe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth

my humillitie, and will vndertake to
follow this rule of life, he must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of miseries, defectes, sinnes, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
Moreouer he ought to looke
into euery man, &amp; respect those things
only in them, wherein I haue adorned
them with any grace and vertue, that
he may be brought by this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to acknowledge himselfe alwaies

account of them, then if they were in
another, and let him giue the praise &amp;
glorie of them all to me wholie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

therby. And therfore thou which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest
to be a follower of this rule, must
haue great care of thy selfe, and thou
must so dilligentlie looke into thine
owne behauiour, and bee so watchfull
in all thy actions, as thou neither maist
seeke any thing, nor bend thy selfe to
desire or follow any thing besides me:
that is, thou must desire nothing but
my glorie, and the fulfilling of my
pleasure onelie. Wherefore in what
thing soeuer thou findest thy selfe to
beare rule, that is, in what thing so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thou seekest to please thy selfe, or
findest self loue to raign in thee, there
thou must renounce thy selfe, &amp; omit
wholy the doing of that thing (if thou

               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:6087:151"/>
Thou must complaine to no man
of those crosses which thou sufferest,
except it be to haue counsaile at their
hands; for thou oughtest to receiue
all thinges thankefullie which I sende
thee, and to referre all thinges vnto
mee.</p>
               <p>Therefore howsoeuer the stormes
of affliction shal violently assaile thee,
or in what sorte soeuer aduersitie shall
chaunce to ouerwhelme thee, haue
thou a minde euer readie to endure all
patientlie, beeing whollie subiect to
me, and for mee to all creatures. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
with violence to represse these
motions which rise vp against thee, &amp;
labour cleane to forsake thy selfe, and
be not moued with any passion against
men, neither yet contende, dispute or

meanes to auoid affliction: nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
thy selfe from them, but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to receiue all thinges with silence
in peace and tranquillitie, and with an
indifferent minde, as willing to receiue
aduersitie as prosperitie at my handes;
And bee content to beare them with

all quietnesse in thy soule, as long as
it shall be my pleasure.</p>
               <p>And when thou art in aduersitie,
doo not seeke with a deliberate inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, of sette purpose, for any

but commit all thinges vnto mee,
and patientlie expect the euent, and
end of all things from my hands.</p>
               <p>Thou must confesse thy sinnes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentallie
to a Priest euery weeke
no lesse then once, but thou must doo
it to mee euerie day in praier, and that
very often, with the sorrowe of thy
hart, and with an humble accusation
of thy selfe for thy manifold offences,
and thou must offer thyselfe vnto me,
ready in all things to set forth my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and to fulfill my pleasure.</p>
               <p>Thou must receiue also the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my blessed bodie euerie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
once at the least, if thou canst

thou must not omit to make those cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies
which I set downe in the former
rule in the veneration of my glorious
Sacrament, and in the memorie of my

death. If thou shalt faile in any of
these thinges heretofore recited, thou
shalt not thereby be guiltie of a newe
fault by vndertaking the performance
of this rule, neither shalt thou offend
more by the meane of it, than another
which liueth without this rule and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,

which thou makest by beeing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

committed, and which thou dost not

and better.</p>
               <p>He that will vndertake to followe
this fraternitie or rule, and gouerne
himselfe according to the prescript
