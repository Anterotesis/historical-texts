         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE State of <hi>Purpoole</hi> (so long obscur'd in it self) could no otherwise express its <hi>Grandeur,</hi> but by shewing to Posterity what it was: This moved those ingenious Gentlemen to leave to succeeding Times the Memory of those <hi>Actions,</hi> which they themselves had done; not for the vain Air of Popularity, but generously to give an <hi>Example,</hi> which others might desire to follow.</p>
            <p>Accordingly they have, by this <hi>History,</hi> set forth their Actions, which seem to be writ with the same Gallantry of <hi>Spirit</hi> as they were done.</p>
            <p>The Language it self is all that Age could afford; which, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something for the Modern Dress and Words in Fashion, is not beneath any we have now: It was for that Reason thought necessary
<pb facs="tcp:51650:3"/>
not to clip any thing; which, though it may seem odd, yet naturally begets a Veneration, upon Account of its Antiquity.</p>
            <p>What more could they have wished, than to have found a <hi>Patron</hi> worthy the protecting the Memory of such a <hi>Prince?</hi> And what more can they require, than the Safety of your <hi>Patronage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Fortune, undoubtedly, that reserved it for this happy Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of coming forth under your Protection.</p>
            <p>That strict <hi>Alliance</hi> which ever was betwixt your <hi>States</hi> seems to ask it of you, as the only Person in whom are revived the ancient <hi>Honours</hi> of both Houses: It was certainly a publick Sense of the same personal Abilities (which made that <hi>Prince</hi> so conspicuous) that gives us all a publick View of those Vertues, so much admired in private.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> 'Tis for these Reasons humbly offerred to you, presuming upon a favourable Acceptance of that which naturally falls under your Care.</p>
            <p>May Time perfect the <hi>Character</hi> already so well begun, that Posterity may hear you equal, if not greater than the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Purpoole.</hi>

            <head>Gesta Grayorum: OR, THE HISTORY OF THE PRINCE OF PURPOOLE, Anno Domini, 1594.</head>
            <p>THE great number of gallant Gentlemen that <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> afforded at ordinary Revels, betwixt <hi>All-hollontide</hi> and <hi>Christmas,</hi> exceeding therein the rest of the Houses of Court, gave occasion to some Well-willers of our Sports, and Favourers of our Credit, to wish an Head answerable to so noble a Body, and a Leader to so gallant a Company: Which Motion was more willingly hearkened unto, in regard that such Pass-times had been intermitted by the space of three or four Years, by reason of Sickness and Discontinuances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51650:4"/>After many Consultations had hereupon, by the Youths, and others that were most forward herein, at length, about the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> with the Consent and Assistance of the Readers and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, it was determined, that there should be elected a Prince of <hi>Purpoole,</hi> to govern our State for the time; which was intended to be for the Credit of <hi>Grays Inn,</hi> and rather to be performed by witty Inventions, than chargeable Expences.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, presently they made choice of one Mr. <hi>Henry H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lmes,</hi> a <hi>Norfolk</hi>-Gentleman, who was thought to be accomplished with all good Parts, fit for so great a Dignity; and was also a very proper Man of Personage, and very active in Dancing and Revelling.</p>
            <p>Then was his Privy Council assigned him, to advise of State-Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Government of his Dominions: His Lodging also was provided according to State; as the Presence-chamber, and the Council-chamber: Also all Officers of State, of the Law, and of the House-hold. There were also appointed Gentlemen-Pensioners to attend on his Person, and a Guard, with their Captain, for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>The next thing thought upon, as most necessary, was, Provision of Treasure, for the Support of his State and Dignity. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, there was granted a Benevolence by those that were then in his Court abiding; and for those that were not in the House, there were Letters directed to them, in nature of Privy Seals, to injoin them, not only to be present, and give their Attendance at his Court; but also, that they should contribute to the defraying of so great a Charge, as was guessed to be requisite for the performance of so great Intendments.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51650:7"/>Upon the 20<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Day of <hi>December,</hi> being St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Eve, the Prince, with all his Train in Order, as above set down, marched from his Lodging, to the great Hall; and there took his place in his Throne, under a rich Cloth of State: His Counsellors and great Lords were placed about him, and before him; below the Half-pace, at a Table, sate his learned Council and Lawyers; the rest of the Officers and Attendants took their proper Places, as belonged to their Condition.</p>
            <p>Then the Trumpets were commanded to sound thrice; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the King at Arms, in his rich Surcoat of Arms, stood forth before the Prince, and proclaimed his Style as followeth.</p>
            <q>By the sacred Laws of Arms, and authorized Ceremonies of the same (maugre the Conceit of any Malecontent) I do pronounce my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Liege Lord, Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> rightfully to be the high and mighty Prince of <hi>Purpoole,</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Stapulia</hi> and <hi>Bernardia,</hi> Duke of the High and Nether <hi>Holborn,</hi> Marquis of St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s and <hi>Tottenham,</hi> Count Palatine of <hi>Bloomsbury</hi> and <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> Great Lord of the Cantons of <hi>Islington, &amp;c.</hi> Knight of the most honourable Order of the <hi>Helmet,</hi> and Sovereign of the same.</q>
            <p>After that the King at Arms had thus proclaimed his Style, the Trumpets sounded again; and then entred the Prince's Champion, all in compleat Armour, on Horse-back, and so came riding round about the Fire; and in the midst of the Hall, stayed, and made his Challenge in these Words following.</p>
            <q>If there be any Man, of high Degree, or low, that will say that my Sovereign is not rightly Prince of <hi>Purpoole,</hi> as by his King at Arms right-now hath been proclaimed, I am ready here to maintain, that he lieth as a false Traitor; and I do challenge, in Combat, to fight with him, either now, or at any time or place appointed: And in token here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I gage my Gauntlet, us the Prince's true Knight, and his Champion.</q>
            <p>When the Champion had thus made his Challenge, he departed; then the Trumpets were commanded to sound, and the King at Arms blazoned the Prince his Highness's Arms, as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:51650:8"/>The most mighty Prince of <hi>Purpoole, &amp;c.</hi> beareth his Shield of the highest <hi>Jupiter.</hi> In Point, a Sacred Imperial Diadem, safely guarded by the Helmet of the great Goddess <hi>Pallas,</hi> from the Violence of Darts, Bullets and Bolts of <hi>Saturn, Momus,</hi> and the <hi>Idiot</hi>; all environed with the Ribband of Loyalty, having a Pendant of the most heroical Order of Knighthood of the Helmet; the Word hereunto, <hi>Sic virtus honorem.</hi> For his Highness's Crest, the glorious Planet <hi>Sol,</hi> coursing through the twelve Signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> on a Celestial Globe, moved upon the two Poles, Artick and Antartick; with this Motto, <hi>Dum totum peragra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit orbem.</hi> All set upon a <hi>Chaphew: Mars</hi> turned up, <hi>Luna</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled, <hi>Sapphire</hi> doubted Pearl, supported by two anciently renowned and glorious Griffyns, which have been always in League with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Pegasus.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The Conceit hereof was to shew, that the Prince, whose private Arms were three Helmets, should defend his Honour by Vertue, from Reprehensions of Male-contents, Carpers and Fools. The Ribband of Blue, with an Helmet Pendant, in intimation of St. <hi>George.</hi> In his Crest, his Government for the twelve Days of <hi>Christmas</hi> was resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to the Sun's passing the twelve Signs, though the Prince's Course had some odd degrees beyond that time: But he was wholly suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Griffyns; for <hi>Grays-Inn</hi>-Gentlemen, and not the Treasure of the House, was charged. The Words, <hi>Sic virtus honorem,</hi> that his Vertue should defend his Honour, whilst he had run his whole Course of Dominion, without any either Eclipse or Retrogradation.</p>
            <p>After these things thus done, the Attorney stood up, and made a Speech of Gratulation to the Prince; and therein shewed what great Happiness was like to ensue, by the Election of so noble and vertuous a Prince, as then reigned over them; rightly extolling the Nobility, Vertue, Puissance, and the singular Perfections of his Sovereign; whereby he took occasion also to move the Subjects to be forward to perform all Obedience and Service to his Excellency; as also to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his Wants, if so be that it were requisite; and, in a word, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the People, that they were happy in having such a Prince to rule over them; and likewise, assured the Prince, that he also was most happy, in having Rule over so dutiful and loving Subjects, that would not think any thing, were it Lands, Goods, or Life, too dear to be at his Highness's Command and Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51650:8"/>The Prince's Highness made again this Answer,
<q>That he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himself to be deeply bound to their Merits; and in that regard did promise, that he would be a gracious and loving Prince to so well-deserving Subjects.</q>
And concluded with good liking and Commendations of their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Then the Sollicitor, having certain great old Books and Records lying before him, made this Speech to his Honour, as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Most Excellent Prince,</hi>

               <p>High Superiority and Dominion is illustrated and adorned by the humble Services of noble and mighty Personages: And therefore, amidst the Garland of your Royalties of your Crown, this is a principal Flower, That in your Provinces and Territories, divers mighty and puissant Potentates are your Homagers and Vassals; and, although infinite are your Feodaries, which by their Tenures do perform Royal Service to your Sacred Person, pay huge Sums into your Treasury and Exchequer, and maintain whole Legions for the Defence of your Country; yet some special Persons there are, charged by their Tenures, to do special Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at this your glorious Inthronization; whose Tenures, for their Strangeness, are admirable; for their Value, inestimable; and for their Worthiness, incomparable: The Particulars whereof do here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in your Excellency's Records, in the Book of <hi>Dooms-day,</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in your Exchequer, in the <hi>50</hi>th. and <hi>500</hi>th.

            <p>The Pardon being thus read by the Sollicitor, the Prince made a short Speech to his Subjects, wherein he gave them to understand, that although in Clemency he pardoned all Offences, to that present time; yet notwithstanding, his me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he now so graciously forgive all Errors and Misdemeanours as he would hereafter severely and strictly reform the same. His Will was, that Justice should be administred to every Subject, without any Partiality<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and that the Wronged should make their Causes known to himself, by P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tition to the Master of the Requests: And further excused the Causes of the great Taxes, and Sums of Money, that were levied, by reason that his Predecessors had not left his Coffers full of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51650:13"/>
Treasure, nor his Crown so furnished, as became the Dignity of so great a Prince.</p>
            <p>Then His Highness called for the Master of the Revels, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to pass the time in Dancing: So his Gentlemen-Pensioners and Attendants, very gallantly appointed, in thirty Couples, danced the Old Measures, and their Galliards, and other kind of Dances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling until it was very late; and so spent the rest of their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance in those Exercises, until it pleased His Honour to take his way to his Lodging, with Sound of Trumpets, and his Attendants in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as is above set down.</p>
            <p>There was the Conclusion of the first grand Night, the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof increased the Expectation of those things that were to ensue; insomuch that the common Report amongst all Strangers was so great, and the Expectation of our Proceedings so extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it urged us to take upon us a greater State than was at the first intended: And therefore, besides all the stately and sumptuous Service that was continually done the Prince, in very Princely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and besides the daily Revels, and such like Sports, which were usual, there was intended divers grand Nights, for the Entertainment of Strangers to our Pass-times and Sports.</p>
            <p>The next grand Night was intended to be upon <hi>Innocents-Day</hi> at Night; at which time there was a great Presence of Lords, Ladies, and worship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul Personages, that did expect some notable Performance at that time; which, indeed, had been effected, if the multitude of Beholders had not been so exceeding great, that thereby there was no convenient room for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hose that were Actors; by reason whereof, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Inventions and Conceipts could not have opportunity to be applauded, which otherwise would have been great Contentation to the Beholders. Against which time, our Friend, the <hi>Inner Temple,</hi> determined to send their Ambassador to our Prince of State, as sent from <hi>Frederick Templarius,</hi> their Emperor, who was then busied in his Wars against the Turk. The Ambassador came very gallantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and attended by a great number of brave Gentlemen, which arrived at our Court about Nine of the Clock at Night. Upon their coming thither, the King at Arms gave notice to the Prince, then sitting in his Chair of State in the Hall, that there was come to his Court an Ambassador from his ancient Friend the State of <hi>Templaria,</hi> which desired to have present Access unto His Highness; and shewed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51650:13"/>
his Honour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urther, that he seemed to be of very good sort, because he was so well attended; and therefore desired that it would please His Honour that some of his Nobles and Lords might condu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him to His Highness's Presence; which was done. So he was brought in very solemnly, with Sound of Trumpets, the King at Arms and Lords of <hi>Purpoole</hi> making to his Company, which marched before him in order. He was received very kindly of the Prince, and placed in a Chair besides His Highness, to the end that he might be Partaker of the Sports intended. But first, he made a Speech to the Prince, wherein he declared how his excellent Renown and Fame was known throughout all the whole World; and that the Report of his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was not contained within the Bounds of the Ocean, but had come to the Ears of his noble Sovereign, <hi>Frederick Templarius,</hi> where he is now warring against the <hi>Turks,</hi> the known Enemies to all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>; who having heard that His Excellency kept his Court at <hi>Graya</hi> this <hi>Christmas,</hi> thought it to stand with his ancient League of Amity and near Kindness, that so long hath been continued and increased by their noble Ancestors of famous Memory and Desert, to gratulate his Happiness, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lourishing Estate; and in that regard, had sent him his Ambassador, to be residing at His Excellency's Court, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Greatness, and token of his tender Love and Good Will he beareth to His Highness; the Confirmation whereof he especially requir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and by all means possible, would study to increase and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize: Which Function he was the more willing to accomplish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our State of <hi>Graya</hi> did grace <hi>Templaria</hi> with the Presence of an Ambassador about thirty Years since, upon like occasion.</p>
            <p>Our Prince made him this Answer, That he did acknowledge that the great Kindness of his Lord, whereby he doth invite to further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in firm and Loyal Friendship, did deserve all honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, and effectual Accomplishment, that by any means might be devised; and that he accounted himself happy, by having the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and sted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast Love of so gracious and renowned a Prince, as his Lord and Master deserved to be esteemed; and that nothing in the World should hinder the due Observation of so inviolable a Band as he esteemed his Favour and Good Will. Withal, he entred into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of his noble and cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ageous Enterprizes, in that he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out an Adversary fit for his Greatness to encounter with, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be illustrated by, and such an Enemy to all <hi>Christendom,</hi> as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51650:14"/>
that the Glory of his Actions tend to the Safety and Liberty of all Civility and Humanity; yet, notwithstanding that he was thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in this Action of honouring us, he shewed both his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mindfulness of our Love and Friendship, and also his own Puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, that can afford so great a number of brave Gentlemen, and so gallantly furnished and accomplished: And so concluded, with a Welcome both to the Ambassador himself, and his Favourites, for their Lord and Master's sake, and so for their own good Deserts and Condition.</p>
            <p>When the Ambassador was placed, as aforesaid, and that there was something to be performed for the Delight of the Beholders, there arose such a disordered Tumult and Crowd upon the Stage, that there was no Opportunity to effect that which was intended: There came so great a number of worshipful Personages upon the Stage, that might not be displaced; and Gentlewomen, whose Sex did privilege them from Violence, that when the Prince and his Officers had in vain, a good while, expected and endeavoured a Reformation, at length there was no hope of Redress for that present. The Lord Ambassador and his Train thought that they were not so kindly entertained, as was before expected, and thereupon would not stay any longer at that time, but, in a sort, discontended and displeased. After their Departure the Throngs and Tumults did somewhat cease, although so much of them continued, as was able to disorder and confound any good Inventions whatsoever. In regard whereof, as also for that the Sports intended were especially for the gracing of the <hi>Templarians,</hi> it was thought good not to offer any thing of Account, saving Dancing and Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors (like to <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>Menechmus</hi>) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, <hi>The Night of Errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This mischanceful Accident sorting so ill, to the great prejudice of the rest of our Proceedings, was a great Discouragement and Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to our whole State; yet it gave occasion to the Lawyers of the Prince's Council, the next Night, after Revels, to read a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> directed to certain Noble-men and Lords of His Highness's Council, and others, that they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, or cause Enquiry to be made of some great Disorders and Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51650:14"/>
lately done and committed within His Highness's Dominions of <hi>Purpoole,</hi> especially by Sorceries and Inchantments; and namely, of a great Witchcraft used the Night before, whereby there were great Disorders and Misdemeanours, by Hurly-burlies, Crowds, Errors, Confusions, vain Representations and Shews, to the utter Discred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of our State and Policy.</p>
            <p>The next Night upon this Occasion, we preferred Judgments thick and threefold, which were read publickly by the Clerk of the Crown, being all against a Sorcerer or Conjurer that was supposed to be the Cause of that confused Inconvenience. Therein was contained, How he had caused the Stage to be built, and Scaffolds to be reared to the top of the House, to increase Expectation. Also how he had caused divers Ladies and Gentlewomen, and others of good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be invited to our Sports; also our dearest Friend, the State of <hi>Templaria,</hi> to be disgraced, and disappointed of their kind Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, deserved and intended. Also that he caused Throngs and Tumults, Crowds and Outrages, to disturb our whole Proceedings. And Lastly, that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oisted a Company of base and common Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, to make up our Disorders with a Play of Errors and Confusions; and that that Night had gained to us Discredit, and it self a Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of Errors. All which were against the Crown and Dignity of our Sovereign Lord, the Prince of <hi>Purpoole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under Colour of these Proceedings, were laid open to the View, all the Causes of note that were committed by our chiefest States-men in the Government of our Principality; and every Officer in any great Place, that had not performed his Duty in that Service, was taxed hereby, from the highest to the lowest, not sparing the Guard and Porters, that suffered so many disordered Persons to enter in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Court-Gates: Upon whose aforesaid Indictments, the Prisoner was arra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prisoner appealed to the Prince his Excellency for Justice, and humbly desired, that it would please His Highness to understand the Truth of the Matter by his Supplication, which he had ready to be offered to the Master of the Requests. The Prince gave leave to the Master of the Requests, that he should read the Petition; wherein was a Disclosure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51650:15"/>
of all the Knavery and Juggling of the Attorney and Sollicitor, which had brought all this Law-stuff on purpose to blind the Eyes of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and all the honourable Court there, going about to make them think, that those things which they all saw and preceived sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly to be in very deed done, and actually performed, were nothing else but vain Illusions, Fancies, Dreams and Enchantments, and to be wrought and compass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by the Means of a poor harmless Wretch, that never had heard of such great Matters in all his Life: Whereas the very Fault was in the Negligence of the Prince's Council, Lords and Officers of his State, that had the Rule of the Roast, and by whose Advice the Commonwealth was so soundly mis-governed. To prove these things to be true, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rought divers Instances of great Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties committed by the greatest; and made such Allegations, as could not be denied. These were done by some that were touched by the Attorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y and Sollicitor, in their former Proceedings, and they used the Prisoners Names for means of Quittance with them in that behalf. But the Prince and States-men (being pinched on both sides, by both the Parties) were not a little offended at the great Liberty that they had taken, in censuring so far of His Highness's Government; and thereupon the Prisoner was freed and pardoned, the Attorney, Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor, Master of the Requests, and those that were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quainted with the Draught of the Petition, were all of them commanded to the Tower; so the Lieutenant took charge of them. And this was the End of our Law-sports, concerning the Night of Errors.</p>
            <p>When we were wearied with mocking thus at our own Follies, at length there was a great Consultation had for the Recovery of our lost Honour. It was then concluded, that first the Prince's Council should be reformed, and some graver Conceipts should have their places, to advise upon those things that were propounded to be done afterward. Therefore, upon better Consideration, there were divers Plots and Devices intended against the <hi>Friday</hi> after <hi>New-years-day,</hi> being the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Ianuary:</hi> And to prevent all unruly Tumults, and former Inconveniences, there was provided a Watch of Armed Men, to ward at the four Ports; and Whifflers, to make good Order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the four Barons; and the Lord Warden to over-see them all, that none but those that were of good Condition might be suffered to be let into the Court: And the like Officers were every where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51650:15"/>On the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> at Night, there was a most honourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Great and Noble Personages, that came as invited to our Prince; as namely, the Right Honourable the Lord Keeper, the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Cumberland, Northumberland, Southampton</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> the Lords <hi>Buckhurst, Windsor, Mountjoy, Sheffield, Compton, Rich, Burleygh, Mounteagle,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi>; Sir <hi>Thomas Henneage,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Cecill</hi>; with a great number of Knights, Ladies and very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipful Personages: All which had convenient Places, and very good Entertainment, to their good Liking and Contentment.</p>
            <p>When they were all thus placed and setled in very good Order, the Prince came into the Hall with his wonted State, and ascended his Throne at the high End of the Hall, under His Highness's Arms; and after him came the Ambassador of <hi>Templaria,</hi> with his Train like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and was placed by the Prince as he was before; his Train also had Places reserved for them, and were provided for them particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Then, after variety of Musick, they were presented with this Device.</p>
            <p>At the side of the Hall, behind a Curtain, was erected an Altar to the Goddess of Amity; her Arch-Flamen, ready to attend the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Incense that should, by her Servants, be offered unto her: Round about the same sate Nymphs and Fairies, with Instruments of Musick, and made very pleasant Melody with Viols and Voices, and sang Hymns and Praises to her Deity.</p>
            <p>Then issued forth of another Room the first pair of Friends, which were <hi>Theseus</hi> and <hi>Perithous</hi>; they came in Arm in Arm, and offered Incense upon the Altar to their Goddess, which shined and burned ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear, without Blemish; which being done, they departed.</p>
            <p>Then likewise came <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus</hi>; after them, <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>Orestes</hi>; then <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius:</hi> And all these did, in all things, as the former, and so departed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, were presented <hi>Graius</hi> and <hi>Templarius</hi>; and they two came lovingly, Arm in Arm, to the Altar, and offered their Incense as the rest, but the Goddess did not accept of their Service; which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the troubled Smoak, and dark Vapour, that choaked the Flame, and smothered the clear burning thereof. Hereat, the Arch-Flamen, willing to pacifie the angry Goddess, preferred certain mystical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Invocations, and commanded the Nymphs to sing some Hymns of Pacification to her Deity, and caused them to make proffer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51650:16"/>
of their Devotion again; which they did, and then the Flame burnt more clear than at any time before, and continued longer in bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and shining to them, than to any of those Pairs of Friends that had gone before them; and so they departed.</p>
            <p>Then the Arch-Flamen did pronounce <hi>Grayus</hi> and <hi>Templarius</hi> to be as true and perfect Friends, and so familiarly united and linked with the Bond and League of sincere Friendship and Amity, as ever were <hi>Theseus</hi> and <hi>Perithous, Achilles</hi> and <hi>Patroclus, Pilades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> or <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius</hi>; and therewithal did further divine, that this Love should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e perpetual. And Lastly, denounced an heavy Curse on them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hall any way go about to break or weaken the same; and an Happiness to them that study and labour to eternize it for ever. So with sweet and pleasant Melody, the Curtain was drawn, as it was at the first.</p>
            <p>Thus was this Shew ended, which was devised to that End, that those that were present might understand, that the Unkindness which was growing betwixt the <hi>Templarians</hi> and us, by reason of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Night of Errors, and the uncivil Behaviour wherewith they were entertained<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as before I have partly touched, was now clean rooted out and forgotten, and that we now were more firm Friends, and kind Lovers, than ever before we had been, contrary to the evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that some Enviers of our Happiness had sown abroad.</p>
            <p>The Prince then spake to the Ambassador, that the Shew had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented him exceedingly; the rather, that it appeared thereby, that their ancient Amity was so fresh and flourishing, that no Friendship in the World hath been compared to the Love and Good Will of the <hi>Grayans</hi> and <hi>Templarians.</hi> And to the end that he might shew that the Conceipt was pleasing unto him, His Highness offered the Lord Ambassador, and some of his Retinue, with the Knighthood of the Helmet, an Order of his own Institution.</p>
            <p>To that end His Excellency called to him his King at Arms, and willed him to place the Ambassador, and some of his Followers, and also some of his own Court, that they might receive the Dignity at his hands; which being done, and the Master of the Jewels attending with the Collar of the Order, the Prince came down from his Chair of State, and took a Collar, and put it about the Lord Ambassador's Neck, he kneeling down on his Left Knee, and said unto him, <hi>Sois Chivaler</hi>; and so was done to the rest, to the number of Twenty four.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:51650:16"/>So the Prince and the Lord Ambassador took their Places again in their Chairs, and the rest according to their Condition.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Helmet,</hi> His Highness's King at Arms, stood forth before the Prince, in his Surcoat of Arms, and caused the Trumpets to sound, and made his Speech, as doth follow.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The most mighty and puissant Prince, Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> my gracious Lord and Sovereign, Prince of <hi>Purpoole,</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Stapulia</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardia,</hi> Duke of High and Nether <hi>Holborn,</hi> Marquis of St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s and <hi>Tottenham,</hi> Count Palatine of <hi>Bloomsbury</hi> and <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> great Lord of the Cantons of <hi>Islington, Kentish-Town, Paddington</hi> and <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> hath heretofore, for the special gracing of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Realm, and honouring the Deserts of Strangers, his Favourites, instituted a most honourable Order of Knighthood of the <hi>Helmet,</hi> whereof His Honour is Sovereign, in Memory of the Arms he beareth, worthily given to one of his noble Ancestors, many Years past, for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Life of his then Sovereign; in regard that as the Helmet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth the chiefest part of the Body, the Head; so did he guard and defend the sacred Person of the Prince, the Head of the State.

general Library, wherein whatsoever the Wit of Man hath heretofore committed to Books of worth, be they ancient or modern, printed or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript, <hi>European</hi> or of the other Parts, of one or other Language, may be made contributary to your Wisdom. Next, a spacious, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Garden, wherein whatsoever Plant, the Sun of divers Climates, out of the Earth of divers Moulds, either wild, or by the Culture of Man, brought forth, may be, with that Care that appertaineth to the good prospering thereof, set and cherished. This Garden to be built about with Rooms, to stable in all rare Beasts, and to cage in all rare Birds; with two Lakes adjoining, the one of fresh Water, and the other of salt, for like variety of Fishes: And so you may have, in a small Compass, a Model of Vniversal Nature made private. The third, A goodly huge Cabinet, wherein whatsoever the Hand of Man, by exquisite Art or Engine, hath made rare in Stuff, Form, or Motion, whatsoever Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, Chance and the Shuffle of things hath produced, whatsoever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath wrought in things that want Life, and may be kept, shall be sorted and included. The fourth, Such a Still-house so furnished with Mills, Instruments, Furnaces and Vessels, as may be a Palace fit for a Philosopher's Stone. Thus when your Excellency shall have added depth of Knowledge to the fineness of Spirits, and greatness of your Power, then indeed shall you lay a <hi>Trismegistus</hi>; and then, when all other Miracles and Wonders shall cease, by reason that you shall have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their natural Causes, your self shall be left the only Miracle and Wonder of the World.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51650:21"/>
and Disappointments of such Conceipts and Curiosities: But, on the other side, in one Point my Lords have well agreed; That they both, according to their several Intentions, counselled your Excellency to win Fame, and to eternize your Name; though the one adviseth it in a Course of great Peril, and the other, of little Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Magnificence. But the plain and approved Way that is safe, and yet proportionable to the Greatness of a Monarch, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himself to Posterity, is not Rumour and Hear-say; but the usual Memory of himself, is the Magnificence of goodly and Royal Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and Foundations, and the new Institutions of Orders, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Societies; that is, that your Coin be stamped with your own Image; so in every part of your State there may be somewhat new; which, by Continuance, may make the Founder and Author remembred. It was perceived at the first, when Men sought to cure Mortality by Fame, that Buildings was the only way; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceeded the known holy Antiquity of building the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi>; which, as it was a Sin in the immoderate Appetite of Fame, so was it punished in the kind; for the Diversities of Languages have imprisoned Fame ever since. As for the Pyramids, the Colosses, the number of Temples, Colleges, Bridges, Aquaeducts, Castles, Theatres, Palaces, and the like, they may shew us, that Men ever mistrusted any other way to Fame than this only, of Works and Monuments. Yea, even they which had the best Choice of other Means. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> did not think his Fame so engraven in his Conquests, but that he thought it further shined in the Buildings of <hi>Alexandria. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Caesar</hi> thought no Man had done greater things in Military A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions than himself, yet that which, at his Death, ran most in his Mind, was his Building; when he said, not as some mistake it, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically, but literally, <hi>I found the City of Brick, but I leave it of Marble. Constantine</hi> the Great was wont to call with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy the Emperor <hi>Trajan, Wall-flower,</hi> because his Name was upon so many Buildings; which notwithstanding, he himself did embrace in the new founding of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and sundry other Buildings: And yet none greater Conquerors than these two. And surely they had reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>n; for the Fame of great Actions is like to a Land-flood, which hath no certain Head or Spring; but the Memory and Fame of Buildings and Foundations hath, as it were, a Fountain in an Hill, which continually seedeth and refresheth the other Waters.

                        <head>The Fourth Councellor, advising Absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of State and Treasure.</head>
                        <p>LET it not seem Pusillanimity for your Excellency, Mighty Prince, to descend a little from your high Thoughts to a necessary Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of your own Estate. Neither do you deny, Honourable Lords, to acknowledge Safety, Profit and Power to be of the Substance of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and Fame and Honour rather to be as Flowers of well ordered Actions, than as good Guides. Now if you examine the Courses propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to these Respects, it must be confessed, that the course of Wars may seem to encrease Power, and the course of Contemplations and Foundations not prejudice Safety; but if you look beyond the exterior, you shall find that the first breeds Weakness, and the latter note Peril; for certain it is during Wars, your Excellency will be enforced to your Souldiers, and generally to your People, and become less Absolute and Monarchical than if you reign'd in Peace; and then if your Success be good, that you make new Conquests, you shall be constrained to spend the strength of your ancient and setled Provinces, to assure your new and doubtful, and become like a strong man, that by taking a great Burden upon his Shoulders, maketh himself weaker than he was before. Again, if you think you may not end Contemplations with Security, your Excellency will be deceived; for such Studies will make you retired and disused with your Business; whence will follow admiration of your Authority; as for the other Point, of exercising in every part of your State something new, derived from your self, it will acquaint your Excellency with an humor of Innovation and Alteration; which will make your Reign very turbulent and unsetled, and many times your Change will be for worse; as in the Example last

touched, of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who by his new Translation of his Estate, rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. As for Profit, there appeareth a direct contrariety betwixt that and all the three Courses; for nothing causeth such dissipation of Treasure as Wars, Curiosities and Buildings; and for all this to be recompensed in a supposed Honour, a Matter apt to be much extolled in Words, but not greatly to be praised in Conceit, I do think it a Losers Bargain. Besides that, many politick Princes have received as much Commendation for their wise and well ordered Government, as others have done for their Conquests and glorious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And more worthy, because the Praise of Wisdom and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is less communicated with Fortune. Therefore, <hi>Excellent Prince,</hi> be not transported with Shews; follow the Order of Nature, first to make the most of that y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To put the Case by a private Man (for I cannot speak high) if a man were born to an hundred Pounds by the Year, and one shew him how with Charge to purchase an hundred Pounds more, and another should shew him how without Charge to raise that hundred Pounds unto five hundred Pounds, I should think the latter Advice should be followed. The Proverb is a Countrey-Proverb, but significative, <hi>Milk the Cow that standeth still; why follow you her that flieth away?</hi> Do not think, <hi>Excellent Prince,</hi> that all the Conquests you are to make be foreign; you are to conquer here at home the overgrowing of your Grandees in Factions, and too great Liberties of your People, the great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Formalities given to your Laws and Customs, in derogation of your absolute Prerogatives; these and such like be Conquests of State, though not of War. You want a <hi>Joseph,</hi> that should by Advice make you the only Proprietor of all the Lands and Wealth of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The Means how to strain up your Sovereignty, and how to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate Treasure and Revenue, they are the Secrets of your State: I will not enter into them at this place; I wish your Excellency as ready to them, as I know the means ready to perform them.</p>

                        <p>WE thank you for your good Opinions; which have been so well set forth, as We should think Our Selves not capable of good Counsel, if, in so great variety of perswading Reasons, we should sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly resolve. Mean while, it shall not be amiss to make choice of the last, and upon more Deliberation to determine of the rest; and what Time we spend in long Consulting, in the end we will gain by prompt and speedy Executing.</p>

            <p>The Prince having ended his Speech, arose from his Seat, and took that Occasion of Revelling: So he made choice of a Lady to dance withal; so likewise did the Lord Ambassador, the Pensioners and Courtiers attending the Prince. The rest of that Night was passed in those Pass-times. The Performance of which Nights work being very carefully and orderly handled, did so delight and please the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and the other Auditory, that thereby <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> did not only recover their lost Credit, and quite take away all the Disgrace that the former Night of Errors had incurred; but got instead thereof, so great Honour and Applause, as either the good Reports of our honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Friends that were present could yield, or we our selves desire.</p>
            <p>The next Day the Prince, accompanied with the Ambassador of <hi>Templaria,</hi> and attended by both Trains, took his Progress from his Court of <hi>Graya,</hi> to the Lord Mayor's House, called <hi>Cosby's Place,</hi> in <hi>Bishop's-gate-street</hi>; as being, before that time, invited to dine with him. This Shew was very stately and orderly performed; the Prince being mounted upon a rich Foot-cloth, the Ambassador likewise ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding near him; the Gentlemen attending, with the Prince's Officers, and the Ambassador's Favourites, before; and the other coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Prince; as he set it down in the general Marshalling, in the beginning. Every one had his Feather in his Cap, to distinguish of whether State he was; the <hi>Grayans</hi> using a white, and the <hi>Templarians</hi> using Ash-colour'd Feathers; to the number of fourscore in all, very
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51650:24"/>
well appointed, and provided of great Horses and Foot-cloths, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Places. Thus they rode very gallantly, from <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> through <hi>Chancery-lane, Fleet-street,</hi> so through <hi>Cheap-side, Corn-hill,</hi> and to <hi>Cosby's Place,</hi> in <hi>Bishop's-gate-street</hi>; where was a very sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous and costly Dinner for the Prince, and all his Attendants, with variety of Musick, and all good Entertainment. Dinner being ended, the Prince and his Company having revelled a while, returned again the same Way, and in the same Order as he went thither, the Streets being thronged and filled with People, to see the Gentlemen as they passed by; who thought there had been some great Prince, in very deed, passing through the City. So this popular Shew through the Streets pleased the Lord Mayor and his Commonalty so well, as the great Lords, and others of good Condition and Civility, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with our former Proceedings.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this Shew, there came Letters to our State from <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Templarius</hi>; wherein he desired, that his Ambassador might be dispatched with Answer to those Things which he came to treat of. So he was very honourably dismissed, and accompanied homeward with the Nobles of <hi>Purpoole:</hi> Which Departure was before the next grand Day. The next grand Night was upon <hi>Twelfth-day</hi> at Night; at which time the wonted honourable and worshipful Company of Lords, Ladies and Knights were, as at other times, assembled; and every one of them placed conveniently, according to their Condition. And when the Prince was ascended his Chair of State, and the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets sounded, there was presently a Shew which concerned His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's State and Government: The Invention was taken out of the Prince's Arms, as they are blazon'd in the beginning of his Reign, by the King at Arms.</p>
            <p>First, There came six Knights of the Helmet, with three that they led as Prisoners, and were attired like Monsters and Miscreants. The Knights gave the Prince to understand, that as they were returning from their Adventures out of <hi>Russia,</hi> wherein they aided the Emperor of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> who these suspected Persons were; and thereupon shewed,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51650:25"/>
that they were <hi>Envy, Male-content</hi> and <hi>Folly:</hi> Which three had much mis-liked His Highness's Proceedings, and had attempted many things against his State; and but for them two, <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vnited Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> all their Inventions had been disappointed. Then willed they the Knights to depart, and to carry away the Offenders; and that they themselves should come in more pleasing sort, and better befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the present. So the Knights departed, and <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Amity</hi> promised, that they two would support His Excellency against all his Foes whatsoever, and then departed with most pleasant Musick. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Departure, entred the six Knights in a very stately Mask, and danced a new devised Measure; and after that, they took to them Ladies and Gentlewomen, and danced with them their <hi>Galliards,</hi> and so departed with Musick. Which being done<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Trumpets were commanded to sound, and then the King at Arms came in before the Prince, and told His Honour, that there was arrived an Ambassador from the mighty Emperor of <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Moscovy,</hi> that had some Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Weight to make known to His Highness. So the Prince wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that he should be admitted into his Presence; who came in At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire of <hi>Russia,</hi> accompanied with two of his own Country, in like Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. When they were come in presence of the Prince, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor made his Obeysance, and took out Letters of Credence, and humbly delivered them to the Prince, who gave them to the King at Arms, to be read publickly, as followeth.</p>

                  <head>A Letter of Advertisement from <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> to the Honourable Council.</head>

                     <hi>I</hi> Beseech your Honours to advertise His Highness, that in His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's Canton of <hi>Knights-bridge,</hi> there do haunt certain Foreig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that sieze upon all Passengers, taking from them by force their Goods, under a pretence that being Merchants Strangers, and using Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick into His Highness's Territories of <hi>Clerken-well, Islington,</hi> and elsewhere, they have robbed of their Goods, spoiled of their Wares; whereby they were utterly undone: And that His Honour, of his good Will, hath been pleased to grant them Letters of Reprisal, to recover their Loss of them that come next to their Hands: By colour whereof, they lay hold of all that pass by, without respect. Some of their Names, as I understand, are <hi>Johannes Shagbag, Robertus Untruss, James Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pax,</hi> aliàs <hi>Capax.</hi> There do reign likewise thereabouts another sort of dangerous People, under the Name of poor Soldiers, that say they were mamed, and lost their Limbs in His Honour's Service and Wars against the <hi>Amazons</hi>; and they pretend to have Pass-ports from their Captains. Some of them say, they have served under Sir <hi>Robert Kemp,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Cooke</hi>; others, under <hi>William Knaplocks,</hi> Lord Marshal, Sir <hi>Francis Marham,</hi> Captain <hi>Crymes,</hi> Captain <hi>Conny, Yelverton, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Davison,</hi> and some other of good Place. Some say, that they were mamed with Fire-locks; others, in the Trenches; others, in going with their Captains, to discover Ambuscadoes of the Enemy, and to view the Forts; others, in standing Sentry, whilst the Captains were busied in entring the Breach; others, in the very Approach at the first. But the number of them is great, and the same inclined to do much Mischief. Another sort there is, that pretend that they have Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to beg, in regard of their Losses by Shipwreck upon certain Rocks of Hazard, Barred Quarter-trays, High-men and Low-men, Bom-Cards, the Sands of Bowle-Allies, the Shelf of New-Cut, the Gulf of Myne and Gill, and such other like places of Peril. Some of them are called by the Names of <hi>Harry Ordinary, Jack Moneyless, Will Cog-all,</hi> and <hi>Roger Spend-all.</hi> These aforesaid People do gather together in great numbers, and His Excellency's Subjects hereabouts stand in great fear
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51650:27"/>
of Outrages by them to be committed, except His Highness do prevent the same, and that speedily, by sending some of the Captains aforesaid to disperse them.</p>

                  <head>Another Letter from Sea, directed to the Lord Admiral.</head>
                  <p>
                     <q>BY my Letters given at <hi>Pont-Holborn,</hi> the Last of <hi>December,</hi> I gave your Honour to understand, that His Excellency's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Purpoole</hi> began to surcease their Traffick to <hi>Clerkenwell, Newington</hi> and <hi>Bank-side,</hi> and such like Roads of Charge and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, because they feared lest certain Rovers, which lay hovering about the Narrow Seas, should intercept them in their Voyages. Since which time, <hi>may it please your Honour,</hi> I have discovered an huge <hi>Armado</hi> of <hi>French Amazons,</hi> to the number of seven hundred Caracts, Galeasses, great Galeasses, and tall Ships; besides Pinnaces, Frigots, Carvels, Shallops, and such small Vessels innumerable; which being dispersed into sundry Creeks, work daily much damage to all sorts of People, and Adventurers hold in durance; not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one Man to escape, till he have turned <hi>French.</hi> Divers Ensigns, Standards, Pendants, Tilting-staves, short Trunchions for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers, and such like Provision for His Excellency's Triumphs, they have cast over-board; for no other Cause, save that his Subjects were bound inward from <hi>Gelderland,</hi> a Nation that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hated: Besides that, they exact so unreasonably of those that trade into <hi>Netherland,</hi> that they leave them neither Lands, Goods, nor good Wares. Also they sink all those that use any Dealings with the People of <hi>Cleive,</hi> without respect, whether he be Merchant, or Man of War. To conclude, they burn all those Vessels that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any dry Wares into the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> Moreover, I am to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise your Honour, that on the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the Straits of the Gulf of <hi>Clerkenwell,</hi> there was an hot Skirmish between a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51650:28"/>
of St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s, called <hi>Amarpso,</hi> and the Admiral of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> called the <hi>Rowse-flower</hi>; wherein the Merchant having gained the Wind, came up with her in such close manner, that he brake his Bolt-sprite in her hinder Quarter: Yet notwithstanding, the Fight conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fiercely, on either part, two long Hours, and more; in which time, our Gunner, being a very expert Soldier, shot her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>our or five times under Water: Then the Merchant perceiving his Powder to be spent, was inforced to grapple; and so, with great Resolution, laid her a-board on the Waste, which he found stoutly defended by the <hi>French</hi>; yet, at length, being driven from their close Fight, they were constrained to keep under Hatches, where one of the Soldiers entring, spied Fire in the Gun-room; notwithstanding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded very desperately. Then the Admiral, seeing no hope to escape, fired her Powder, and burnt her self. The Soldiers, and the Ship, which, as I after learned, was of an incomparable Burthen; insomuch that she had been known to have born nine hundred fighting Men in her Poup. Her chief Lading was Cochenella, Musk, Guaiacum, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baco and <hi>Le grand Vezolle.</hi> The chief of Account that were blown up, were <hi>Catharina Dardana, Pecta de Lee,</hi> and <hi>Maria de Rotulis.</hi> The rich Carrick of <hi>Newington</hi> coming to rescue their Admiral, were so close at fight when she was fired, that the Flame of the Wild-fire caught hold of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The whole number of them that perished in this hot Conflict, is five hundred fifty five; and Prisoners, ninety nine. Our Ship had no other hurt, save that she sprang her Main-Mast in such sort, as that she is not able to bear any high Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:51650:28"/>There were also read like Letters from <hi>Stapulia</hi> and <hi>Bernardia,</hi> of Intelligences, and also from <hi>Low-Holborn</hi>; wherein were set forth the Plots of Rebellion and Insurrection, that those, His Excellency's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, had devised against His Highness and State, and of some other Occurrences in those Parts of His Highness's Dominions. And when they were all read, the Prince made this Speech following.</p>
            <q>THese suddain Accidents (Lords) would make a Prince of little Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit suspect himself to be unfortunate. The <hi>Stapulian</hi> fallen away; the <hi>Bernardian</hi> holds out! News of Tumults, Treasons, Conspiracies, Commotions, Treacheries, Insurrections! Say our Lands were sacked, our Wealth spoiled, our Friends slain, our Self forsaken, vanquished, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and all the Evils that might be, were fallen upon Us; yet could there be nothing so adverse, but that our Fortitude and heighth of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage were able to over-work. These Events are not Matters of Moment, or of Substance of our Government: These are not Misfortunes, but <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>'s Iests, that gives them she loves not, shews of good Luck, that in the end she may do them greater Spight: But when she meaneth Good, she prepares Men with some little Bitterness, that her good Turns, when they come, may seem more pleasant and delightful. These Events proceed of Error in our former Government, who should not have put great Men, well loved, or popular, into so great places of Sovereignty; nor one Man should possess so great a Place, of so great Command; by too much Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Greatness, a right good Mind is oftentimes corrupted: In this late, We rather allow a severe Man, somewhat hated; for better were a little profitable Civil Dissention, than a League and Love that were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prove dangerous. <hi>Lords,</hi> you shall find it an harder matter to keep things once gotten, than at the first to obtain it. Hitherto no Prince in this World hath had better Success than our Self. Men say, that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty is uncertain, and an ill Security; subject to Cares, Troubles, Envy, Treacheries, Hate, Fear, Distrust: We have hitherto found none of those. That a Prince hath no sure Friend, no faithful Servant, no safe Place, no quiet Hour, no secure Pleasure: All these have We, and more, in great abundance; and these things, which to other Princes have been the occasions of Mis-hap, have been to Vs the very Instruments of Pleasure, and much Service. What Prince ever found in his Subjects, in Matters of Weight, more Love, more Loyalty, more Readiness, more Service? When We have been inclined to solace, what Liveliness, what
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51650:29"/>
Alacrity, what ingenious Devices, Sports, Iollities, what variety of Pleasure? How have We been honoured with the Presents of divers Princes, Lords, and Men of great Worth; who, confident in our Love, without Fear or Distrust, have come to visit Vs; by whose honourable Kindness, We are to them for ever devinct, and most firmly bounden? How hath the favourable Regard, and bright Eyes of brave Ladies shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon Our Endeavours, which to their Honours and Service have been ever intended? How have We been gratulated with divers Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors from divers Nations? What Concourse of all People hath been continually at Our Court, to behold Our Magnificence? Shall small Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters therefore daunt Vs? Shall a few tumultuary Disorders dismay Vs? Shall ill-guided Insurrections trouble Vs, that are, like Mushrooms, sprung up in a Night, and rotten before the Morning? We are loath to believe that there be such Sparks of Dissention and Mischief; but if there be, We will make haste to quench them, before they grow into vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Flames; for it is no longer Consulting, where a Man cannot commend the Counsel, before he hath seen the Effect. Nor shall it require the Presence of a Prince to settle these small Commotions: <hi>Lords,</hi> We send you to these Places where Need is; and as Occasion serveth, We will take Order that Garisons be planted, Citadels erected, and whatsoever else be performed, that shall be convenient to sub-act and bring under these unsetled Provinces. Our Self, with Our chosen Knights, with an Army Royal, will make towards our Brother of <hi>Russia,</hi> with my Lord here, his Ambassador, presently to join with him against his Enemies, the <hi>Negarian Tartars</hi>; more dreadful, the <hi>Barbarian Tartars:</hi> And if <hi>Fortune</hi> will not grace Our good Attempt, as I am rightful Prince, and true Sovereign of the honourable Order of the <hi>Helmet,</hi> and by all those Ladies whom, in Knightly Honour, I love and serve, I will make the Name of a <hi>Grayan</hi> Knight more dreadful to the <hi>Barbarian Tartars,</hi> than the <hi>Macedonian</hi> to the wearied <hi>Persians,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> to the dispersed <hi>Britains,</hi> or the <hi>Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the next Morning His Highness took his Journey towards <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> with the Ambassador, and there he remained until <hi>Candlemas</hi>; at which time, after his glorious Conquests abroad, His Excellency retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home again; in which the Purpose of the Gentlemen was much disappointed by the Readers and Ancients of the House, by reason of the Term: So that very good Inventions, which were to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in publick at his Entertainment into the House again, and two grand Nights which were intended at his Triumphal Return, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his Reign had been conceitedly determined, were by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Readers and Governors made frustrate, for the Want of Room in the Hall, the Scaffolds being taken away, and forbidden to be built up again (as would have been necessary for the good Discharge of such a Matter) thought convenient; but it shewed rather what was performed, than intended.

Being come so near his own Country, he left his Navy of Ships, as not fit for so short a Cut, and the matter not being very great or dangerous, and he and his Retinue took to them fifteen Barges, bravely furnished with Standards, Pendants, Flags and Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: There was also in every Barge, Musick and Trumpets; and in some, Ordnance and Shot. Being thus gallantly appointed, we came on our Way by the Stairs at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where the Ordnance was shot off, and the whole Navy made a Sail round about; and the second time, when the Admiral, in which the Prince was, came directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court-Stairs, His Highness dispatched two Gentlemen with Letters to the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Thomas Heneage</hi>; the Copy whereof followeth.</p>

               </l>
               <l>Had made an end of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> War,</l>
               <l>And quite dispers'd our vanquish'd Enemies</l>
               <l>Vnto their Hoards, and huge vast Wilderness;</l>
               <l>Our noble Prince, and his couragious Knights,</l>
               <l>Whose untry'd Valour, in the Battle fought,</l>
               <l>Was rather warm'd, than fully exercis'd,</l>
               <l>Finding no Enterprise that did deserve</l>
               <l>Th' Employment of their brave united Force,</l>
               <l>After Assignment of a Day and Place,</l>
               <l>Where both himself and all his Knights should meet,</l>
               <l>Dispers'd themselves into many sundry Quests,</l>
               <l>To seek Adventures as they should befal.</l>
               <l>The Prince himself, who only was attended</l>
               <l>By me his Squire, had many strange Exploits;</l>
               <l>Which since they shortly shall be put in Print,</l>
               <l>Ioin'd with Prince <hi>Arthur</hi>'s famous Chronicle,</l>

               <l>Amongst the rest, when as the time approach'd,</l>
               <l>That, as it was assign'd, we shou'd all meet,</l>
               <l>It thus fell out: The Prince, one Sun-shine Day,</l>
               <l>Resting himself within a goodly Tuft</l>
               <l>Of tall streight Firr-trees that adorn'd the Shoar,</l>

               <l>A Cave, whose frame seem'd more than natural;</l>

               <l>Viewing the gallant Shape, and budding Youth</l>
               <l>Of my brave Lord, the Form that first he took,</l>
               <l>Was of a goodly Lady, passing fair;</l>
               <l>Hoping, belike, that whilst he us'd Respect</l>
               <l>Due to her matchless Beauty, and her Sex,</l>
               <l>Himself being now unloos'd, might slide away:</l>
               <l>But finding him, that knew his wily Shifts,</l>
               <l>Embrace him straiter in that feigned shape;</l>
               <l>Next, unto a Serpent he transform'd himself,</l>
               <l>With fiery Eyes, and dreadful blackish Scales,</l>
               <l>And three-fork'd hissing Tongue, that might affright</l>

               <l>Made him betake him to another Form;</l>
               <l>Which was, a sumptuous Casket, richly wrought;</l>
               <l>Whereout, when it open'd, many Diadems,</l>

               <l>This working nought but Scorn, and high Disdain,</l>
               <l>He lastly shew'd him a sad Spectacle,</l>
               <l>Which was, the North-East of his valiant Knights,</l>
               <l>And best beloved of my Lord, the Prince,</l>
               <l>Mangl'd and prick'd with many a grisly Wound,</l>
               <l>Weltring their valiant Limbs in purple Goar,</l>
               <l>Gasping, and closing their faint dying Eyes.</l>
               <l>This with the Prince, now us'd to his Delusions,</l>
               <l>Prevail'd no more, than did the rest before.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Proteus</hi> then had chang'd his changing Weed,</l>
               <l>And fix'd himself in his own wonted Shape,</l>
               <l>Seeing no other Means could ought prevail,</l>
               <l>He Ransom profer'd for his Liberty.</l>
               <l>And first of all, he offer'd to aread</l>
               <l>To him, and unto all his Knights, Fortune's Spell.</l>
               <l>But when my Lord reply'd, that that was fit</l>
               <l>For unresolved Cowards to obtain;</l>
               <l>And how his Fortune's often changing Play,</l>
               <l>Would lose the Pleasure of his chief Delight,</l>
               <l>If the Catastrophe should be before known:</l>
               <l>Then offer'd he huge Treasures, Ladies Loves,</l>
               <l>Honour and Fame, and famous Victories.</l>
               <l>My Lord made Answer, that he never would</l>
               <l>Offer his Honour so great Wrong, to take,</l>
               <l>By Gift or Magick, without Sweat or Pain,</l>
               <l>Labour or Danger, Vertue's truest Prize,</l>
               <l>That, which by mortal Hand might be atchiev'd;</l>
               <l>And therefore willed him, as Demy-God,</l>
               <l>To offer somewhat that might be above</l>
               <l>The lowly Compass of an Humane Power.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Proteus</hi> saw the Prince could make his Match,</l>
               <l>He told him then, that under th' Artick Pole</l>
               <l>Th' Adamantine Rock, the Sea's true Star</l>
               <l>Was situate; which, by his Power Divine,</l>
               <l>He, for his Ransom, wou'd remove, and plant</l>
               <l>Whereas he should appoint: Assuring him,</l>

               <l>Should follow that, where e'er it should be set.</l>
               <l>But then again, he added this Condition,</l>
               <l>Which, as he thought, would no way be perform'd;</l>
               <l>That first the Prince should bring him to a Power,</l>
               <l>Which in attractive Vertue should surpass</l>
               <l>The wond'rous force of his Iron-drawing Rocks.</l>
               <l>My Lord, that knew himself as well assur'd,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Proteus</hi> thought his own Match surely made,</l>
               <l>Easily yielded to his Covenant;</l>
               <l>And promis'd further, on his Princely Word,</l>
               <l>That he himself, and seven of his Knights,</l>
               <l>Wou'd enter Hostages into the Rock,</l>

            <p>When these Speeches were thus delivered, <hi>Proteus,</hi> with his bident striking of Adamant, which was mentioned in the Speeches, made Utterance for the Prince, and his seven Knights, who had given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as Hostages for the performance of the Covenants between the Prince and <hi>Proteus,</hi> as is declared in the Speeches. Hereat <hi>Proteus, Amphitrite</hi> and <hi>Thamesis,</hi> with their Attendants, the Nymphs and Tritons, went unto the Rock, and then the Prince and the seven Knights issued forth of the Rock, in a very stately Mask, very richly attired, and gallantly provided of all things meet for the performance of so great an Enterprize. They come forth of the Rock in Couples, and before every Couple came two Pigmies with Torches. At their first coming on the Stage, they danced a new devised Measure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which, they took unto them Ladies; and with them they dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Galliards, Courants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they danced another new Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; after the end whereof, the Pigmies brought eight Escutcheons, with the Maskers Devices thereupon, and delivered them to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squire, who offered them to Her Majesty; which being done, they took their Order again, and with a new Strain, went all into the Rock; at which time there was sung another new Hymn within the Rock.</p>
