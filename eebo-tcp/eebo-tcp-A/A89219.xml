         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which how and when it was firſt invented and by whom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115208:5"/>
collected, neither <hi>Cardan,</hi> nor <hi>Scaliger,</hi> nor <hi>Virgil,</hi> nor <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> nor <hi>Bieſius,</hi> nor <hi>Jaſon Pratenſis,</hi> nor <hi>Pſellus,</hi> nor any <note place="margin">Lib. de priſc. med.</note>(in my judgement) have more truely declared, then <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> himſelf; avouching that Neceſſity was the mother, and Reaſon the father of Diet. For when ſickneſs crept into the world, and men gave the ſame meats to ſick folks which they did to the healthful, they perceived them to be ſo far from recovery, that they rather wax'd worſe and worſe. Hereupon being enforced to alter either the kind or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or the quantity, or the quality and order of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: they knew by diligent obſervation what was fitteſt for every diſeaſe, for every ſexe, age, and complexion, and accordingly committed them to memory, or ſet them down <note place="margin">Lib. de ſol. anim.</note>in writing. <hi>Plutarch</hi> thinks that we firſt learned this knowledg of brute Beaſts. For Pigeons and Cocks before they fight, will eate ſtore (if they can get it) of cummin ſeed to lengthen their breath: and Nightingales eate ſpiders to prevent ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings; and Lions having ſurfeited on fleſh, abſtaine from all meat til it be digeſted. So the Marlin taught tender perſons firſt to keep warm their feet, the Storkes to remedy coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of body by the uſe of gliſters, the Hedghog to avoid walking in windy ſeaſons, the little Birds to bathe in Summer, the Flies and Bees to keep home in Winter. For there is no doubt but the natures of men were in former ages ſo ſtrong, that they did eate and digeſt every thing as it grew. Neither were Mills, Boulters, Ovens, and artificial preparations from the beginning; but as ſickneſs of the body encreaſed, ſo the mind deviſed remedies, teaching men how to thraſh and grind corne, to make bread, to boil, roaſt, and bake meat, to give thinne and liquid meats to weak ſtomacks, and groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer cates to them that be ſtrong, after the example of every Bird; who firſt ſoftneth and boileth the meat in their mawes, before they give it to their young ones, neither ſhould we marvail hereat; For as ignorant Sailers (whoſe errours and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115208:5"/>
imperfections no man could perceive in a calm ſea) in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt do follow every mans adviſe: So the examples of Birds and Beaſts did teach ſick men wiſdome, when through ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ignorance they loſt the light of nature, and knew not what was good for themſelves. But leave we <hi>Plutarchs</hi> conceit, and let us fetch the invention of Diet from a more worthy teacher, yea from the worthieſt of all other, God himſelf. For can we imagine that he taught our forefathers (having ſinned) how to cloath their bodies, and not how, and when, <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note>and wherewith to feed them? He that taught <hi>Abel</hi> how to diet ſheep, would he leave him unskilful how to diet himſelf? or had <hi>Cain</hi> the art of tilling the ground, and not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how to uſe the grain thereof? Knew Phyſicians in <note place="margin">Gen. 50. v. 2.</note>
               <hi>Iacobs</hi> time how to conſerve dead bodies, and wanted they knowledge to preſerve the living? Wherefore how fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever ſome aſcribe the invention of Diet to <hi>Apollo, Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> and that many-eide <hi>Oſiris,</hi> or to <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> or <hi>Aſclepiades:</hi> yet let this reſt immoveable, that it ſpringeth from an elder time, then that any heatheniſh Chronicle is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to record the author thereof. For if the multitude of <note place="margin">Hippoc. de vet. med.</note>burials be an argument of ill diet, and contrariwiſe long life an argument of good; it muſt needs follow, that before the Univerſal Floud this noble knowledge of diet was not hid from the firſt Patriarcks, but as perfitly perceived as it was practiſed. For till after the Floud, men uſually lived to eight hundred years, ſome to nine, many to ſeven, and none (for <note place="margin">Gen. 5.</note>ought we have heard or read) dyed a natural death before five.</p>
            <p>Now if any man ſhall object, that the very name of Diet is not mentioned before the Floud, and that therefore the thing it ſelf was not in uſe: I can ſhape him no better anſwer <note place="margin">Lib. de arte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>then from the mouth of <hi>Hippocrates: Names are the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, but things the Sons of nature.</hi> So that aſſoon as men began to feed, no doubt they were inſpired with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115208:6"/>
how much, how often, and of what to feed. For we muſt not imagine, though they had as it were Oſtriches ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, and Giants ſtrength, (inſomuch that <hi>Lamech</hi> in his wound could cruſh into peices the mightieſt champion of our age) that therefore they neglected preparation or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the uſe of nouriſhments; nay reaſon it ſelf will conclude, that as one ſhooe did not fit every mans foot, nor children and young men fed alike in thoſe dayes, ſo every man knew or was taught his peculiar diet, moſt proper healthful and convenient for his owne eſtate. Wherefore as many diſſeaſes are recovered with our Phyſicians, but none without Phyſick: ſo albeit there lived no dietary Phyſitians before the Floud (if I ſhould grant ſo much) yet no man can deny, that through feeding or faſting, drinking or thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, taking this thing or refuſingthat, they preſerved their life-oile (as I may term it) for many ages, which in this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting and riotous age is commonly conſumed in leſs then one. But ſome men will further object againſt me. What Sir? may diet prolong a mans life? why then through diet we may prove immortal, or at the leaſt live as long as <hi>Adam</hi> did. Whereunto I anſwer, that albeit immortality is denied upon the earth to mortal men, yet ſo much life is prolonged by a good diet, by how much diſſeaſes thereby are eſchewed. For as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, to whom is pain of the belly, and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, <note place="margin">Prov. 27. Eccl. 28.</note>and redneſs of eyes, and want of health? even to thoſe <note place="margin">lib. de arte.</note>that keep no meaſure, but greedily hunt after wine, and riſe up earely to drink ſtrong drinke. Some in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> time, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Hippoc. de priſc. med.</note>preciſe obſervers of Phyſick to dye aſſoon as they which uſed no phyſick, conceived preſently no otherwiſe of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, them as of Kings in a ſtage play; carrying golden crownes, and ſcepters, and ſwords, commanding for the time whole Empires, but indeed void of in-borne Majeſty in them ſelves, and of outward abillity fit for ſo high a caling. So now in our daies the name of Diet ſeems but a ſcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow

thereupon. For if the ſpring-aire be cold and dry through abundance of Northeaſt winds, dry inflammations of the eys, hot urines, fluxes of bloud by noſe and bowels, and moſt dangerous catarrhs to old perſons, follow upon it. If Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer be cold and dry through the like winds, look for all kinds of agues, headaches, coughs, and conſumptions: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe if it be too hot and dry, ſuppreſſion of urine, and womens courſes, together with exceeding bleeding at the noſe is to be feared. If Autumn be full of Southern and warm blaſts, the next Winter attend all rheumatick and moiſt diſeaſes. If Winter on the contrary be cold and dry, which naturally ſhould be cold and moiſt, long agues, humoral aches, coughs and pluriſies are to be expected, unleſs the next Spring be of a moiſt diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Again, conſider alſo, how any houſe or City is ſituated, for the aire is qualified accordingly.

But Cities, Countries, or houſes ſituated clean contrary, towards the North-weſt, North, and North-Eaſt, and defended from all Southern guſts and blaſts, albeit the people there are commonly more ſtrong and dry, yet are they ſubject through ſuppreſſion of excrements, unto headaches, ſharp pluriſies, coughs, exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration of the lungs, phlegmatick collections, rupture of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward veins, and red eyes.

In which reſpect I am of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opinion, that ſweet ſmels were appointed to be in flowers, fruits, barks, roots, fields, and meddowes, not onely for delight, but alſo for medicin. Nevertheleſs as the taſtles water makes the beſt broath, ſo the ſmelling aire gives the pureſt (I will not ſay the ſtrongeſt) nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our ſpirits. In <hi>Plutarchs</hi> time men were grown to this wantoneſs, that every morning and night they perfumed not only their apparrel and gloves, but alſo their bodies with ſweet ointments, made of moſt coſtly ſpices: buying with great charges, what ſhall I ſay? an idle, a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, a womanly pleaſure? nay verily an unnatural and more then bruitiſh. For every beaſt loveth his own mate only for her own ſmel (whatſoever it be) but ſome men love not their meat, nor drink, nor the aire, nor their wifes, nor themſelves, unleſs they ſmel, or rather ſtinck of ſweet coſtly and forreine fumes: which being taken without cauſe, do the head more hurt then being taken upon cauſe they do it good. Wherefore if thy brain be temperate, and not too moiſt, cold, or dull, eſchew a ſtrong ſmelling aire (ſuch as comes from walflowers, ſtock-gillyflowers, pincks, roſes, Hiacynths, mead ſweet, hony ſuckles, jaſimin, Narciſſus, musk, amber civet, and ſuch like) contenting thy ſelf with the ſimpleſt aire, which for ſound complexions is ſimply beſt. Or if for recreation and pleaſureſake thou deſireſt it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115208:14"/>
ſome time, let it not be of a full or ſtrong ſent: but mingled with ſweet and ſoure (as violets with Time) and breathing rather a ſharpe then a fulſome ſweetneſs. And thus much of the choice of aires; now come we to the preparation and uſe of them.</p>

               <hi>SAtyrus</hi> (that Goat-bearded God) the firſt time that ever he ſaw fire, would needs kiſs it and embrace it in his armes, notwithſtanding that <hi>Prometheus</hi> forewarn'd him of coming too nigh: for he knew well enough the nature of fire to be ſuch, that as in certain diſtances, times, and quantities it may be well endured, ſo in others it is harmful and exceeding dangerous. The like may I ſay of heat, cold, moiſture, and drineſs of the aire: which in the firſt or ſecond ſtep towards them may and do preſerve life, but the nearer you come to their extremities, the nearer are you to death: So that either you will be burnt with <hi>Satyrus,</hi> or frozen to death with <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> or dryed up for lack of moiſture with <hi>Darius</hi> Souldiers when they could get no water, or dye as the inhabitants of the lakes in <hi>Egypt</hi> do with too much moiſture. Wherefore let every one conſider his owne ſtrength and conſtitution of body; for ſome like to new wax, are diſſolved with the leaſt heat, and frozen with the leaſt cold: others with

Which being ſo, I ſhall no doubt deſerve well of every man in teaching him ſo to prepare the aire, that ſometimes abroad, but alwayes at home it may be tempered (according as he moſt needeth) and purified from all infection. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tempering of aire in our houſes: is it too hot and dry? then coul it by ſprinkling of Vinegar and Roſe water, by ſtrewing the floure with green flags, ruſhes, newly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, reed leaves, water-lilly leaves, violet leaves and ſuch like; ſtick alſo freſh boughes of willow, ſallow, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar, and aſhe (for they are the beſt of all) in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

            <p>But foraſmuch as no aire is ſo dangerous as that which is infected with peſtilent influences, let us conſider how, and in what ſort that of all other is to be corrected. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> (for ought we read of) when his own Countrey, and the City of <hi>Athens</hi> were grievouſly ſurpriſed of the Plague, uſed no other remedies to cure or preſerve the reſt, then by making of great fires in each ſtreet, and in every houſe, eſpecially in the night time, to purifie the aire; whereby the Citizens or <hi>Athens</hi> being delivered from ſo dangerous an enemy, erected to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> an <note place="margin">Soranus in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Hipp.</note>Image of beaten Gold, and honoured him alive as if he had been a God. And verily, as running water, like a broome, cleanſeth the earth, ſo fire like a Lion, eateth up the pollutions of the aire, no leſs then it conſumeth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115208:16"/>
the droſſie mettals. So that cleanlineſs and good fires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot but either extinguiſh or leſſen any infection: whereunto if we alſo add the uſe of other outward corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and perfumers of the aire, no doubt it will be much, if not wholly amended. The Peſtilence (as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">How the aire is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The firſt ſort are to correct the air about them with good fires, and burning of Lignum Aloes, Ebony, Cinamon bark, Saſſaphras, and Juniper, which (as <hi>Matthiolus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth <note place="margin">Com. in Dioſc. ho. 1. cap. 88.</note>in his Herbal) retaineth his ſent and ſubſtance a hundred years. Burn alſo the pils of Oringes, Citrons, and Lemons, and Myrrh and Roſen; and the poorer ſort may perfume their chambers with Baies, Roſemary, and Broom it ſelf. Make alſo a vaporous perfume in this ſort; Take of Maſtick and Frankincenſe, of each an ounce, Citron pils, Calamint roots, Herb-graſs dried, and Cloves, of each three drams; make all into a groſs pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and boil it gently in a perfuming pot with ſpike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water and white wine. The ſecond ſort (I mean ſuch as are ſick of the Plague in Summer, or are the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a diſſolving heat) ſhould rather burn ſweet Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres, Lignum Rhodium, Sanders, ſprigs of Tamarisk, Gum tragacanth, Elemi, Cherri-tree gum, and a little Camphire. Likewiſe their vaporing perfumes ſhould be of red-roſe-leaves, Lignum Rhodium, and Sanders, with roſe-water and Vinegar boil'd together. So that according to the kind of taking, and the ſeaſon of the year, is the air to be corrected in the time of peſtilence, and not alike at all times with one perfume, which <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius</hi>

that maſticatory: ſome extolling the chewing of ſage as one goes abroad, others the chewing of Setwall roots, others of Elecampana, Cloves, Angelica, or Citron pils; which indeed are beſt in a cold ſeaſon; but in the hot time of the year and a hot Plague, the chewing of Coriander ſeeds prepared, grains, Sanders, and the pulpe of Oringes, Lemons, Citrons, or Pearmains, is far to be preferred before them.</p>
            <p>The like may be ſaid of ſweet Pomanders ſtrong of musk, civet, ambre, and ſtorax; which are no doubt good correctors of the peſtilent aire; but yet in hot ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and peſtilences, nothing ſo good as the ſmel of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtickt with lignum Rhodium inſtead of cloves, and inwardly ſtuffed with a ſponge throughly ſoaked in vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar of red-roſes and violets.</p>
            <p>But here a great queſtion ariſeth, whether ſweet ſmels correct the peſtilent aire, or rather be as a guide to bring it the ſooner into our hearts? To determin which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, I call all the dwellers in <hi>Bucklers</hi> berry in <hi>London</hi> to give their ſentence: which only ſtreet (by reaſon that it is wholly repleniſhed with Phyſick, Drugs, and Spice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and was daily perfumed in the time of the plague with pounding of Spices, melting of gums, and making perfumes for others) eſcaped that great plague brought from Newhaven, whereof there died ſo many, that ſcarce any houſe was left unviſited.</p>

               <p>Hitherto of the correcting and tempering of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and infected aire; which being clean and purified, may yet through ignorance of wilfulneſs be abuſed: For as <hi>Satyrus</hi> would needs kiſs the glowing cole, and children delight to put their fingers in the candle, ſo ſome know not how to uſe this general nouriſhment, which is not given (as all other nouriſments be) unto one particular

man or Country, but equally and univerſally unto all. Now there be two ſorts of aire, as every man knoweth; the one open and wide unto all men, the other private, ſhut within the compaſs of a houſe or chamber: that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any man which is in health; this proper to very many and ſickly perſons, who receiving but the leaſt blaſt of the outward aire upon a ſuddain, fall into great extremities, and make the recidival ſickneſs to be worſe then the former. Many, and amongſt them, my Lord <hi>Rich</hi> his brother, can juſtifie this, who almoſt recovered of the ſmall pox, looked but out of a caſement, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently was ſtriken with death. So likewiſe one <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> a rich Clothier, coming ſuddenly in an extream froſt from a very hot fire into the cold aire, his blood was preſently ſo corrupted, that he became a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; which is an ordinary cauſe of the ſame diſeaſe in high <hi>Germany,</hi> as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and many other writers <note place="margin">Lib. de lepra.</note>have truely noted. Again, ſome men tie themſelves ſo to one aire, that if they go but a mile from home (like to freſh-water ſoldiers) they are preſently ſick: others are ſo delighted with variety, that no one aire or Country can contain them: of which humor was <hi>Ageſilaus, Phocion, Diogenes, Cato,</hi> yea and <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf, who <note place="margin">Aelian. 7. de v r. hiſt.

Furthermore in long diſeaſes, it is not the worſt, but the beſt phyſick to change airs; which few can endure that are tied in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit or by cuſtom only to one, and therefore that (of both fantaſtical humors) is the moſt dangerous. Beſides this, the time of going abroad in the open aire is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; for ſome go out early before the dew be off, and the ſun up, which is very unwholſom; others alſo walk
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115208:18"/>
at night after the dew falling, which is as perilous: for the dew to mans body is as ruſt unto iron, in ſo much that it blaſteth the face and maketh it ſcabby (eſpecially in ſome months) if a man do waſh himſelf with it. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſome men delight to travel in tempeſts and winds, which the very hedghog reproveth, and the beaſts of the field eſchue by ſeeking coverture: for ſtrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent winds, be (as <hi>Cardan</hi> cals them) the whales of the <note place="margin">Lib. 10. de rer. var.</note>aire, rowling clouds and meteors where and whether they liſt, beating down trees, houſes, and caſtles, yea ſhaking otherwhiles the earths foundation. Now as ſome goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad too much, ſo others with over-fearfulneſs take the open aire too little, ſitting at home like cramb'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in a cloſe room, and not daring in a manner to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light; better it were by degrees to go abroad, then with ſuch certainty of danger to ſtay at home; yet ſo that a calm, mild, and temperate day be choſen, leſt we make more haſte outward then good ſpeed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the alteration of aire through decreaſe of health. For as contrariety of meats make tumults and rebellions in our ſtomacks, ſo contrary changes of aire upon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, maketh dangerous combats in our bodies: Yea though a fenny aire be thick and loathſome, yet ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to go dwel upon the high mountains in a clear aire, is a poſting to death rather then a courſe to life, and albeit a Southern Country be pregnant of corruption (for all trees loſe their leaves firſt on the Southſide, and on the Southſide houſes decay ſooneſt, and the Southſide of corn is ſooneſt blaſted, and malt lying in the Southſide of a Garner, is firſt tainted with weevels) yet ſuddenly <note place="margin">Cardan. lib: 10. de var: rer: c: 8.</note>to depart to a Northern ſoil, where the North wind chiefly bloweth, is to leave the Sea to be forzen in ice, and bringeth imminent peril, if not haſty death to the patient, yea to them that are otherwiſe ſound of body:

wherefore uſe the open aire in his due time, ſeaſon, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and order; elſe ſhalt thou be offended with that nouriſhment, which ſimply of all other is moſt neceſſary: for as this inviſible milk (for ſo <hi>Severinus</hi> cals the aire) in time, ſeaſon, and quantity, nouriſheth theſe lower, and <note place="margin">In Idaea med. phil.</note>perhaps the upper bodies: ſo being taken out of time, and longer, and leſſer then we ſhould, it is both the child, the mother, and the nurſe of infinite miſchiefs.</p>

But the chiefeſt thing which he aimed at in the permiſſion, was (in my judgement) the health and preſervation of our lives: for as before the floud men were of ſtronger conſtitution, and vegitable fruits grew void of ſuperfluous moiſture: ſo by the floud theſe were endued with weaker nouriſhment, and men made more ſubject to violent diſeaſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Whereupon it was requiſite or rather neceſſary, ſuch meat to be appointed for humane nouriſhment, as was in ſubſtance and eſſence moſt like our own, and might with leſt loſs and labour of natural heat be converted and tranſubſtantiated into our fleſh.

               </p>
               <p>But here a queſtion may be moved, Whether this pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up of birds, and want of exerciſe, and depriving them of light, and cramming them ſo often with ſtrange meat, makes not their fleſh as unwholſom to us as wel as fat? To which I anſwer, that to cramb Capons, or any bird, and to deprive them of all light, is ill for them and us too: for though their body be puffed up, yet their fleſh is not natural and wholſom; witneſs their ſmall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured and rotten livers; whereas Hens and Capons feeding themſelves in an open and clean place with good corn, have large, ruddy and firm livers. So great is the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie betwixt a cramm'd, I may ſay a ſtrangled, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Capon, and betwixt a gentleman Capon feeding himſelf fat without art. Wherefore the beſt fatning of all fowl, is firſt to feed them with good meat (for like
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115208:26"/>
food, like fleſh.) Secondly, to give it them not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually as crammers do, forcing one gobbet after another till they be fully gorg'd, but as often as they themſelves deſire it, that nature be not urged above her ſtrength; not in a coope or cloſe roome, for then the aire and themſelves will ſmell of their own dung, but in a cleane houſe ſpacious enough for their little exerciſe; not in a dark place, or ſtitching up their eyes, for that will cauſe them to be timerous, or ever ſleepy; both which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to their bodies, and conſequently to ours: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man knows that fear marreth concoction, and ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bereaving us of exerciſe, hindreth digeſtion. Yea young Pigeons whilſt they are in the neſt (be they never <note place="margin">Avic: fen: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The like may be ſaid of the fatting of beaſts, for they are not to be ſtied or ſtall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo cloſe that they cannot ſtirr, but to have ſufficient room for to walk in, as well as to feed in, that they may be wholſom as well as fat, and not corrupt our bodies with their own corruption. So likewiſe fiſh kept in great ponds where they may rove at pleaſure, are better then ſuch as be mewed in a narrow and ſhallow ditch; which not only we ſhall find by inward digeſtion, but alſo by outward taſting; yea look what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt tame and wild Conies, betwixt Deer fed by hand, and Deer fatning themſelves in the Chaſe and Copſes, the like ſhall you perceive betwixt forced fatneſs, and fatneſs gotten by natural and good diet.</p>
               <p>Another thing alſo is to be obſerved before the killing of any beaſt or bird; namely, how to make it tenderer if it be too old, and how to make it of the beſt relliſh: <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocles</hi> affirmed, that a Lion being ſhewed to a ſtrong Bull three or four hours before he be killed; cauſeth his fleſh to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115208:26"/>
be as tender as the fleſh of a Steer: fear diſſolving his hardeſt parts and making his very heart to become pulpy. Perhaps upon the like reaſon we uſe to bait our Bulls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we kill them: for their blood is otherwiſe ſo hard, that none can digeſt it in the fleſh, but afterwards it is ſo far from being poiſonable, that it becometh tender and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing food. Perhaps alſo for this cauſe old Cocks are courſed with little wands from one another, or elſe forced to fight with their betters before they are killed. Perhaps alſo for theſe cauſes, ſo much filthy dung is brought from common leſtals into great gardens; namely to cauſe roots and herbs to be fatter and tenderer then they would be: which intent I do not diſallow, onely I wiſh that no other ſoil were uſed, then what proceeded from the earth or from brute beaſts. Concerning the manner of killing, it is divers in divers Countries. The <hi>Grecians</hi> ſtrangled their Swine, and did eat them with their blood. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> thruſt them through the body with a ſpit red hot, whereby death enſuing without cooling and voiding of blood, the fleſh ſeemed far more ſweet and tender. But if <note place="margin">Plut. lib. de eſ. carn.</note>a ſow were ready to farrow, they trampled upon her bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bruiſing her pigs, and the kernells of her dugs with the milk and blood ot once, eating them for the moſt delicate meat, as ſome delight in the bruſe or pudding of the Deer. <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo avoucheth, that Sheep kill'd by Wolves, <note place="margin">Sim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Furthermore as there is a reaſon of cutting down wood
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115208:27"/>
for timber (namely in the prime of the Moon, or about the laſt quarter) and a ſpecial good ſeaſon of moulding <note place="margin">Plut. 3 Sim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nay further it's to be conſidered, whether a Deer be ſtricken ſtone dead at a blow, though he be in ſeaſon, or ſuffered to dye languiſhing upon his hurt; for his skin be it never ſo well dreſt, will ſoon ſhed his haire and wax worm-eaten if it languiſh, whereas as otherwiſe it will hardly corrupt at all in a long ſeaſon: wherefore no other reaſon can be given, then that by the one way natural heat is inwardly reſtrained, and by the other way of killing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly expired.

            </argument>
            <p>IT will ſeem ſtrange perhaps unto ſome, that they begin firſt to treat of fleſh, which was one of the laſt foods appointed unto mankind by the voice of God. For (as before I touched) till 2240 years after the floud, we read of no fleſh eaten or permitted to be eaten of any man. Neither indeed was it needful whilſt hearbs, fruits, and grain, were void of that putrifying moiſture, whereto ever ſince the floud they are ſubject, and whilſt mens ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks were ſo ſtrong and perfit, that in a manner no meat could overthrow them: aud verily were the Sun of ſuch power with us, as it is in Southern Countries towards the Aequator, to ripen our fruits throughly, and to take them as it were upon the Tree; no doubt being freed from their crudities and ſuperfluous moiſture, they would give as good nouriſhment unto us (and perhaps far better) then any fleſh. But now our complexions waxing weaker and weaker through abundance of ſin and riot, and our climate being unapt for wholeſome and much nouriſhing fruits, let us give God thangs for ſtoring us with fleſh above all other Nations, making our Shambles the wonder of Europe, yea verily rather of the whole world. Now all the fleſh we have is taken either from beaſts, or birds, or things creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ground.</p>

               <p>The Charter-Monks to the preferring of fiſh before fleſh, uſe eſpecially theſe arguments: Firſt, That Chriſt did feed moſt upon it; for we never read but once that he did eat fleſh; but that he did often eat fiſh it is proved <note place="margin">Bald. in poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam Carthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anorum.</note>by many places, namely, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. <hi>Luc.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>John</hi> 6.

Thus much ſaid <hi>Baldwin</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> of whom <hi>Rainul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phres</hi> writeth this ſtory. When <hi>Baldwin</hi> was choſen <note place="margin">

                     </gap>olychron.</note>Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he ſware that from the time of his enſtallment, to his dying day, he would never eat fleſh: whereby his body ſo decayed, that he fell into a conſumption: An old woman meeting him on the way as he was carried in an open Horſelitter, called him liar to his face: whereof being reproved by ſome of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, Why (ſaid ſhe) do you rebuke me? doth he not lie, for ſaying that he never ate fleſh ſince his enſtallment, when his face ſheweth that he ſurpaſſed the ſavages in eating his own fleſh? For indeed by ſuperſtitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of his vow, he became an anatomie, and lived as a cypher amongſt men.</p>
               <p>But to anſwer the Carthuſians arguments, I ſay this; That Chriſt in the places of Scripture cited before, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Diſciples what meat they had? and they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, None but a few loaves and a few fiſhes; wherewith he ſatisfied himſelf and his Diſciples, and above five thouſand perſons at one time: Neither is it to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if they had had fleſh, but he would have fed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115208:30"/>
with that: For it was his property (which every man ought to follow) to eat with thankſgiving of that which was ſet before him, were it fleſh or fiſh; as no doubt he did at the marriage in <hi>Canan,</hi> in <hi>Lazarus</hi> his houſe, and the houſe of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and at the feaſt of the paſſeover, which albeit (for ought we read) he did but once cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, yet reaſon and Religion teacheth us, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commandment of God, he did every year ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate it before, ſince the time of his childhood; elſe <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>the Jews would have accuſed him as a tranſgreſſer of the Law, and by juſtice have cut him off from amongſt the people: but as he ſubmitted himſelf to circumciſion (being then one of the Sacraments of the Church) ſo queſtionleſs after the years of diſcretion, he did yearly eat of the paſcal lamb (for he came not to break any Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but to fulfill it) which cannot be fewer then five or ſix and twenty times at the leaſt. As for the other argument taken from the reſtraining of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain beaſts and birds by name, and that no fiſh by name is there forbidden: Saving <hi>Baldwin</hi> his graces reverence, it is a very lie: For when God generally forbiddeth the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to eat of any fiſh, that wanteth either fins (as <note place="margin">Lev. 11. v. 9, 10.</note>the Poulpe, Periwinkles, Lobſters, and Crabs) or ſcales (as the Eele, Lamprey, Plaiſe, Turbot, and Conger, &amp;c.) doth he not expreſly forbid them to eat of Poulps, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwinkles, Lobſters, Crabs, Eeles, Lampres, Plaiſe, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, and Conger, and a hundred fiſh more wanting either ſcales or fins? Fiſh is therefore no purer meat then fleſh, neither can a Carthuſian eat a Sole (being a meat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the <hi>Iſraelites)</hi> with a ſounder conſcience then a piece of Bief or Swines fleſh.</p>
               <p>Finally, where he ſaith that the actions of Chriſt ſhould be our inſtruction, and his works our imitation: Why do not thoſe fiſhy Friars eat fleſh every Maundy Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115208:31"/>
ſith Chriſt himſelf did ſo, whom we ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate?

Secondly, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is there to uſe them, Nature having repleniſhed the earth with fruit, herbs, grain, beaſts alſo, and birds of all ſorts? Thirdly, Had fiſh been eaten firſt, no doubt it had been firſt eaten of the Iſlanders and Sea-border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; <note place="margin">Plut. &amp; Symp. queſt. 8.</note>but neither the inhabitants of <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> nor the Iſlanders of <hi>Phoeacum,</hi> nor the Wooers of <hi>Penelope</hi> (bringing all manner of dainties to their feaſts) are ever read in <hi>Homer</hi> to have brought or eaten fiſh.

               <p>Laſt of all, whereas <hi>Plutarch</hi> objecteth how loathſom a thing it is to ſee Butchers and Cooks ſprinkled with bloud in killing and dreſſing fleſh. I anſwer him, That the ſight is not ſo loathſom to nature, but to niceneſs and conceit. For what God permits to be eaten, nature permits to dreſs and kill; neither rebelleth ſhe more at the death of an Ox, then at the cutting down of hay or corn. Nay furthermore, ſith all was made for mans uſe, and man for God, ſhe giveth us liberty to kill all things that may make for the maintenance of our life, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and reſtoring of our health. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> moſt wittily having ſhewed, that ſome men are deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by nature, and that therefore nature taught them the art of making Dice (the inſtruments of deceit) he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth conſequently, that becauſe nature is provident for mens health, therefore ſhe hath likewiſe invented the arts of building, plaiſtering, weavin g and tillage: wherefore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115208:32"/>
(to imitate and urge <hi>Hippocrates</hi> argument) if nature have provided fleſh and fiſh (that a ſubſtantial, this a more light nouriſhment for our bodies) how ſquemiſh ſoever we are to ſee them killed, yet it is no unnatural thing to ſee it, no not to do it our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Concerning the laſt queſtion Whether fleſh or fiſh be the better nouriſhment; I cannot anſwer better then as <hi>Galen</hi> did, being asked the like queſtion of wine and water. For as wine is beſt for one man, and water for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſo likewiſe fleſh is moſt nouriſhing to ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and fiſh to others. <hi>Timothie</hi> was young, but yet ſickly and weak ſtomacked, his youth required wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but his ſickneſs wine; wherefore <hi>Paul,</hi> like a good Phyſician; adviſed him to drink no longer water, but a <note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tim. 5. v. 23.</note>little wine for his ſtomacks ſake, and his often infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So likewiſe <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperor being ſick at <hi>York,</hi> of a hot gout, his Phyſicians forbad him all fleſh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <note place="margin">Sextus Aurel.</note>of the ſtronger ſort; but he refuſing their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, nouriſhed his diſeaſe with forbidden meats, and ſoon died. Contrariwiſe <hi>Seneca</hi> was forbidden by <hi>Serenus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hieron in Ep.</note>the Phyſician to eat any more of fiſh, being too too wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſh a nouriſhment for his weak body; which whilſt he refuſed to do and forbare to eat fleſh, his bloud was all turned to a gellied water. So then in reſpect of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, neither fleſh nor fiſh be of better nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but both alike: yet generally fleſh engendreth the better, purer, and more perfect bloud (as the very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and face of men which uſe either of them apart, doth perfectly declare;) and conſequently for ſound men, it is and ought to be accounted the beſt ſuſtenance.</p>

For as in the new Teſtament, the Lords Supper materially conſiſteth of two ſuch things, as there cannot be any drink or meat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed

The beſt way to prepare Lambs fleſh is ſufficient roaſting; for boyling makes it too fleſhy and phlegmatick, and by over-roſting the ſweetneſs thereof is ſoon dried up. Yea all Mutton (contrary to the nature of Pork, Pig<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Veal) ſhould rather be too raw then too much roaſted; according as the French men find by experience, who ſlaſh and cut a giggot of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton upon the ſpit, and with the bloody juice thereof (tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered

After he is brawned for your turn, thruſt a knife into one of his flanks, and let him run with it till he dye: others gently bait him with muzled Doggs.

               <p>OF all Veniſon, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> moſt commendeth the fleſh of a <hi>Wild Sow,</hi> becauſe it is not only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note>nouriſhing and ſtrengthening meat, but alſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable to keep us from coſtiffneſs. Reaſon teacheth us that it is farr above tame Pork or Swines fleſh: Firſt, becauſe it feeds more purely; ſecondly, becauſe it hath not meat brought to hand, but gets it by travail, and hath choice of Diet to feed whereon it liſteth. Thirdly, it is not penn'd up (as commonly our Swine be) in a little Cloſe and ſtinking Stie, but enjoyeth the benefit of a clear aire, which clarifieth bloud, as much as any meat can augment it. It is a rare meat in <hi>England,</hi> and found only (as I have been enformed) in my Lord <hi>Latimers</hi> Woods, who took great pleaſure in hunting them, and made alſo wild Buls of tame ones, as our fore-Fathers (more wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) made tame of wild.</p>
               <p>If they be young, fat, fully grown, and taken in chaſo, in the Winter time (preſently after maſt is fallen) they are unfit for few mens ſtomacks, being thus prepared as I have ſeen them dreſt in High-<hi>Germany.</hi> Firſt, after the fleſh is throughly cold, parboil it in Rheniſh Wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ripe Juniper berries were ſodden: then having taken it out and ſliced it, ſeaſon every ſlice or cut thereof with Pepper, Salt, Cloves, Mace, Ginger, and Nutmegs, of each a ſufficient quantity, laſt of all make it in paſte,

with good ſtore of ſweet butter and it will prove a moſt excellent meat to be eaten cold.</p>

                  <hi>Bacon</hi> thinks it one of the beſt meats, if it be ſo young that we can digeſt it: For, ſaith he <hi>(Quod diu ſem tipſum, alios illud diu conſervare poteſt) that which long liveth by its own nature, maketh alſo others to live long.</hi> But by his leave, we may then feed better upon Ravens then Capons, for theſe never live above ſeaven yeares, and a Raven li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to nine hundred yeares, if <hi>Virgil</hi> be not deceived. <hi>Plutarch</hi> thinketh Deer an unwholſom meat, becauſe it is of a cold and melancholick conſtitution. And how <note place="margin">L. quaeſt. nat.</note>proveth he that? forſooth 1. becauſe he is fearful: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe if he were of a hot complexion (as the wilde Bore is) his teares would be ſweet, as his be; but the teares of a Deere (and eſpecially of a Stagg) are ſalt: <hi>ergo,</hi> he is of a cold and dry conſtitution. But <hi>Empedocles</hi> was of ſounder opinion, who aſcribeth all teares to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of heat: for as milke yieldeth whey by ſtirring, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and preſſing, ſo any violent paſſion (be it joy or greife, anger or pitty) churneth the blood, ſtirreth the humors,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115208:40"/>
and preſſeth the brain, wherupon teares (the wheyiſh part of them all) muſt needs enſue. Furthermore they are thought to be unwholſom, becauſe Bucks and Staggs feed <note place="margin">Plut. de ſol. anim.</note>much upon ſnakes: yea as an Aſs is to a Lions mouth, or hony to Bears, or Bees to Martlets, ſo are Serpents to them a moſt deſired meat; whereupon the <hi>Grecians</hi> call them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Serpent catchers. Might I be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Arbitrator between two ſo Learned men, I would determine the truth to be on either ſide: For indeed young Veniſon, whilſt it is ſucking, is very reſtorative; neither do I think old <hi>Iſaac</hi> in his declining age to have <note place="margin">Gen. 25.</note>delighted more in it in reſpect of taſte, then in reſpect of wholſomneſs and goodneſs. Alſo a gelded Deer is neither too dry, nor too cold, but of a temperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and ſo void of ſuperfluous or excrementitious humors, that his horns never grow again after he is gelt, which <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and all Philoſophers impute to ſuperfluity of heat and moiſture. Nay young Bucks and Does, Hinds and Staggs (whilſt they are in ſeaſon) are a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and delicate meat, breeding no bad juice of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet bearing often the faults of bad Cooks (which know not how to dreſs nor uſe them aright) but more often the deſerved reproaches of greedy Gourmands, that cannot moderately uſe the good creatures of God; either eating veniſon when they ſhould not, or more liberally and uſually then they ſhould. The <hi>Italians</hi> alſo <note place="margin">Piſanel. de eſc. &amp; potul.</note>have this opinion of Veniſon, that eaten in the morning, it prolongeth life, but eaten towards night, it haſteneth death. Contrariwiſe old Veniſon indeed is dry, and perhaps too cold likewiſe; full of groſs, clammy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible humors: So that the ſame meat may be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom at ſome age, in ſome times, and for ſome certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, which otherwiſe in contrary circumſtances is unwholſom: yet is it never ſo pretious as that a man

This one thing only I will add, That Keepers of Parks, or at the leaſt their ſervants and young children, have, upon my knowledge, fed all the year long of little meat elſe, and yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſtrong, healthfull, and active, as any perſons could be. Finally, admit Deer be dry; doth not butter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them? Suppoſe they be cold; doth not pepper and ſalt, and baking, give them ſufficient heat? Thus, howſoever it falleth out, they are either by preparation (which none can deny) or by nature (as I verily believe) a good nouriſhment, ſo that they be choſen in their due ſeaſon, juſt age, and moderately fed upon: Neither have we any reaſon from their unwholſomneſs to diſpark our Parks, or to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <head type="sub">Of the Fleſh of tame Birds.</head>
            <p>THat the Fleſh of tame foul nouriſheth more then wild foul, <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Phyſitian proveth by three <note place="margin">S. partic. Diaet.</note>arguments. Firſt, becauſe they are more uſually eaten of, and ſo by cuſtom (a ſecond nature) made more agreeable to our ſtomacks. Secondly, where al other Birds fly from us, and are not gotten without coſt and travel: nature hath cauſed tame Birds to converſe with us, and to offer themſelves (as it were) to be killed at our pleaſure: which verily ſhe would never have done, had they been of a ſmall or a bad nouriſhment. Thirdly, wild foul (for the moſt part) eſpecially ſuch as flye far for a little meat, and truſt more to their wings then their feet, though they are more light in digeſtion, becauſe they are of a more ſpirituous &amp; aiery ſubſtance; yet they are not of ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant nouriſhment as tame houſhold Birds, which feed not at randome of what they can get, but of good corne, ſuch as men themſelves eate, and therefore moſt fit to nouriſh man.</p>
            <p>Now of all kind of fowl, remember that the youngeſt is tendereſt and lighteſt; old Birds fleſh is heavieſt, but they which are proceeding to their full growth are moſt nouriſhing; for ungrown Birds (and much more neſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) give but a weak thin and gelly-like ſubſtance, old Birds are tough and dry; thoſe which are almoſt fully grown are of a more fleſhy and firm nature.</p>
            <p>Furthermore all Birds feeding themſelves abroad fat with wholeſome meat, are of better nouriſhment then ſuch as be cram'd in a coop or little houſe: for as priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

                  <hi>Capons</hi> of ſeven or eight months age, fatned in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen air, on a clean flour with pure meat, are preferred by all Phyſitians (old or modern, Greeks or Latins) before all meats. And to ſay the truth, what diſh can any Cooks-ſhop afford, that can be compared with a boild or roſted Capon? which helpeth appetite, openeth the breſt, cleareth the voice, fatneth lean men, nouriſheth all men, reſtoreth ſickmen, hurteth none but the idle, taſteth pleaſantly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth eaſily; which is alſo more ſolid then the fleſh of Pullets, more tender then Cocks, more familiar to our nature then Pheſants or Partridges; not ſo dry as a Cock to be ſlowly digeſted, not ſo moiſt as a chicken, to be ſoon corrupted; but equally affected and tempered in all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, engendring much blood and yet unoffenſive, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring much ſeed without unnatural ſharpneſs or heat: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the fleſh of Capons is ſo mild, temperate, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, that <hi>Faventinus</hi> fears not to make it the ground <note place="margin">cap. de phthiſ.

               <p>Concerning the preparation of them, I commend them roaſted for moiſt ſtomacks; but beeing boild with ſweet marrow in white broth, they are of ſpeedier, though not of ſtronger nouriſhment.

            <head type="sub">Of the fleſh of wild fowl, ahiding and feeding chiefly upon the Land.</head>
            <p>THere is no ſmall difference of Land fowl, according to the meat they feed on, and the place they live in; for the purer their meat, the better meat they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they that feed upon fleſh or garbage, are not ſo wholeſome as they that feed upon good corn, bents, or wholeſome ſeeds; leſs wholeſome are they which feed upon worms and fiſh on the Sea ſhore, or rivers banks; but worſt of all other, they that feed upon Serpents, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Venemous beaſts: which no doubt may prove very medicinable to cure diſeaſes, but they cannot prove nouriſhing (keeping their natural diet) to reſtore fleſh.</p>
            <p>Concerning the place wherein they live and feed, it is certain that high and dry Countries have the wholeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Birds: for they which ſit in low and moiſt places, are of no ſweet nor wholeſome complexion.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, their manner of taking alters their fleſh; for a Partridge taken in flight, or a Larke dared with a Hawke, is worth ten taken with nets, ſpringes, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels; the reaſon whereof is already ſet down in my Chapter of Preparation.</p>
            <p>Finally look what Bird is whiteſt fleſht, that Bird is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt to be digeſted: what Bird is reddeſt of fleſh, is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of nouriſhment: whatſoever is black of fleſh, is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to be digeſted and of ſlow nouriſhment; yea ſo much the heavier and ſlower, by how much his skin and fleſh appeareth blacker.

                  <hi>Monardus</hi> writeth thus of them; I allow not the fleſh of Quails neither in the Spring nor Winter, not becauſe the ancient Fathers of Phyſick do condemn them; but becauſe reaſon is againſt them.

to be of fine ſubſtance, good juice, and eaſie dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Nay, <hi>Kiranides</hi> ſaith that their broth clenſeth the kidneys, and their fleſh nouriſheth indifferently well. Were I here to give my cenſure, I would be of either ſide, and yet defend the truth likewiſe; for I nothing doubt but Quails fleſh is bad (as Ducks fleſh is) of its own nature, and heavy to be digeſted; nevertheleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken young before they have eaten of unwholſome weeds, and fatted with pure Wheat, Hemp-ſeed, Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſeed and Milk (or Chalk-water inſtead of Milk) I make no queſtion that their fleſh is laudable, and may be counted a good and dainty meat.</p>
               <p>And here by the way let us marvel at one thing, That Qualis are generally forbidden becauſe their fleſh engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth the falling evil, and yet <hi>Galen</hi> commendeth their <note place="margin">3: Euporiſt:</note>brains (the principal ſeat of that great evil) as an Antidote againſt the ſame.

            <p>FOraſmuch as childrens ſtomacks, and old mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and conſumed mens natures be ſo weak, that not onely all fleſh and fiſh, but alſo the fruits of the earth are burdenſome to their tender and weak bowels: God tendring the growing of the one, the preſervation of the other, and the reſtoring of the third, hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appointed Milk; which the youngeſt child, the wearieſt old man, and ſuch as ſickneſs hath conſumed may eaſily digeſt. If we would define or deſcribe what Milk is, it ſeemeth to be nothing but white blood, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rather the abundant part of blood, whited in the breaſts of ſuch creatures as are ordained by nature to give ſuck; appointed properly for children and ſucking little ones, but accidentally for all men, ſick either of conſuming diſeaſes or old age. That womens Milk is fitteſt for young children, it may eaſily be proved by the courſe of nature, which converteth the ſuperfluity of blood in a woman bearing her child within her to the breſts, for no other purpoſe, then that ſhe ſhould nouriſh her own babe. For truly nothing is ſo unperfect, defectuous, naked, deformed, and filthy as a man, when he is newly born into the world through a ſtraite and outſtreatched paſſage; defiled with blood, repleniſhed with corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more like to a ſlain then a living creature, whom no body would vouchſafe to take up and look on, much leſs to waſh, kiſs, and embrace it, had not nature inſpired an inward love in the mother towards her own, and in ſuch as be the mothers friends.</p>
            <p>

Hence it cometh that mothers yet hot &amp; ſweating with travail, trembling ſtill for their many and extream throws, forget not their new-born Babes, but ſmile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in their greateſt weakneſs, heaping labour upon labour, changing the nights trouble with the dayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs; ſuffering it to taſte no other milk, then that wherewith in their bellies it was maintained. This doth a kind and natural mother (if ſhe be of a ſound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſtrong conſtitution) for her child; and thus did <hi>Eve, Sara, Rebecca,</hi> and <hi>Rachel;</hi> yea all women which truely loved their children, and were both able and willing to feed their own. There be many reaſons why mothers ſhould be afraid to commit their children to ſtarnge women. Firſt becauſe no Milk can be ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural unto them as their own. Secondly becauſe it is to be feared, leſt their children may draw ill qualities from their Nurſes both of body and mind, as it fell out in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> whom whilſt his Mother committed to <hi>Aega</hi>

               <p>Firſt that they drink or eat the milk of no horned beaſt unſodden, for ſo will it not eaſily curdle nor engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wind: but Womens milk, Aſſes milk, and Mares milk, need no other fire to prepare it, for it will never curdle into any hard ſubſtance. Secondly to be ſure that milk ſhall not curdle, ſeaſon it with ſalt, ſuger, or hony, and neither drink any wine or ſoure thing upon it, nor mingle it with other meats, but eat it upon an empty ſtomack, and faſt an hour after it. Thirdly exerciſe not preſently upon it, neither ſleep upon any milk taken from beaſts chewing the cud, and when you have eaten it waſh your teeth clean, for there is no greater enemy unto them then milk it ſelf, which therefore nature hath chiefly ordained for them, who never had or have <note place="margin">Lib. de ſan. tu.</note>loſt their teeth. And truely (as <hi>Marcilius Ficinus</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) Milk is not to be uſed of young men, who have ſound teeth given them for ſtronger meat, but of ſuch as either have none at all, or very few and weak ones; or though they have ſtrong teeth, want ability and ſtrength to ſet them a grinding as it falleth out in them that are fallen into Fever Hecticks.

ſhe left it rather a monument of her pride, then a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of her wiſdome; for nature taught her a better meat, though Art could not appoint her a finer Bath.

But to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch frivolous reaſons, let us not doubt but an Egg is a lawfull and wholſom meat, tempered ſo excellently well by nature it ſelf, that it muſt needs be accounted one of the beſt nouriſhments, being eaten white and all; For they which eat only the yolk (as many do in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to nouriſh more plentifully) fall into many hot and dangerous diſeaſes, unleſs they have a very cold liver, and <note place="margin">Pl. l. 29 cap. 3.</note>watriſh bloud. Contrariwiſe the whites of Eggs are ſo cold, that ſpongy wood being thoroughly overlaid with them, will hardly, or not at all be burnt in a glowing fire. Both being taken together, do ſo qualifie one another, that generally they agree with all ſtomacks, or at the leaſt offend none, if we chuſe them that be beſt, and prepare them well after they be choſen. Now all Eggs being potential creatures, no doubt but they are of like ſubſtance and temper with that which in time they ſhall be made. Wherefore as the fleſh of Pheaſants, Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115208:72"/>
and Hens be of beſt juice, temper, quality, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and digeſtion, ſo likewiſe their Eggs are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt of all others. Contrariwiſe, as the Greek Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſaith, <hi>Like Crow, like Egg.</hi> Neither can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how any Egg ſhould be wholſom, proceeding from an unwholſom or diſtempered creature. Wherefore we condemn (in the way of compariſon) all Eggs of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, Peacocks, Geeſe, Ducks, and all water-fowl, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Hens Eggs before all other, becauſe they are a moſt uſual, familiar, and temperate meat.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, That they be new, white, and long: For ſuch Eggs nouriſh plentifully and quickly, clear the <note place="margin">Schol. Salem. &amp; Horat. Serm. lib. 2. Satyr. 4.</note>voice and breaſt, ſtrengthen the ſtomack, recover men out of conſumptions, and encreaſe nature ſo much, that in continuance of time they make us wantons. They nouriſh quickly, becauſe they are nothing but liquid fleſh: <note place="margin">Rha. 4 ad Alm.</note>They nouriſh much, becauſe their heat and moiſture is proportionable unto ours: They are wholſomeſt in the morning, becauſe they are then neweſt. They are beſt in winter, becauſe Hens are then fatteſt, ſtrongeſt, and beſt reliſhed; they are worſt in ſummer, becauſe Hens feed then upon flies, ſnails, cadlocks, and many ill weeds, which rather ſcoures then nouriſhes their bodies: They are beſt being eaten alone, becauſe being mingled with orher meat, they corrupt in the ſtomack, filling many mens faces full of pimples, morphues, and freckles. They are ill for young children (eſpecially being often eaten) for that their hot bodies turn them into over-hot
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115208:73"/>
nouriſhment, whence itch, ſcabs, inflammations, and corruptions do ariſe. They are alſo as bad for old men, becauſe they are hardly digeſted of a cold ſtomack; fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt they are for temperate young perſons, and ſuch as are conſumed without any notable fever.</p>
               <p>Concerning the nature of other Birds Eggs, beſides Hens. <hi>Epenaetus</hi> extolleth Peacocks Eggs before all <note place="margin">Athen. l. 3. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.</note>other, and then the Eggs of Berganders, and laſtly of Pheſants, Partridges, and Turkies, whoſe judgement I would have throughly confuted, had not daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and <hi>Antonius Gazius</hi> his arguments done it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And verily whoſoever will taſte other eggs then which daily we uſe, ſhall find none void of a ſtrong ſavour and bad reliſh, ſaving the eggs of Pheſants, Partridges, Berganders, Oſtriches, Turkies, Ducks and Geeſe, though the three laſt named be bad enough. Yet if Ducks eggs be hatched under a Hen, they eat more ſweetly, and Gooſe eggs alſo hatched under them, are <note place="margin">Avicenna &amp; Albertus.</note>thought by <hi>Simeon Sethi</hi> no unwholſom meat. Pigeons eggs are exceeding hot, and of ill taſte, hardly hardning by long ſeething. The eggs of Sparrows encreaſe luſt, ſtrengthen the heart, and nouriſh abundantly: As for the eggs of other birds, great and ſmall, howſoever they are eaten (as <hi>Rhaſis</hi> ſaith) in the way of medicine, <note place="margin">4. Ad Almans</note>yet they give either none or no good nouriſhment. But Hens eggs are ſo temperate and nouriſhing, that <hi>Galen</hi> himſelf in certain continual fevers, gave them uſually to <note place="margin">12 de meth. med.</note>his Patients to reſtore ſpirits,: and not without reaſon, being of ſo fine a ſubſtance, and freed in a manner from all hurtfulneſs; for they moiſten us in fever Hecticks, they nouriſh us in conſumptions, they ſtrengthen us in fluxes, they bridle ſharp humors when they gripe us, reſtore ſpirits in weakneſs of heart, they ſpeedily paſs from a clean ſtomack, neither are they forbidden in a

                  </note>eggs be the beſt of all other. Firſt, becauſe new eggs are ever full, but old eggs loſe every day ſomewhat of their ſubſtance, and in the end waxing addle ſtink like urine, whereupon they were called of the Latins <hi>Ova urinae.</hi> Secondly, the whiteſt eggs have the paleſt yolks, and moſt thin, fine, little bloody ſtrings ſwiming upon them. Thirdly, the longeſt eggs are commonly cock-eggs and therefore of better nouriſhment. Some eggs are almoſt all yolk and no white, yea ſome have two yolks in them, others have in a manner no yolk at all, or (at the moſt) nothing proportionable: the former ſort nouriſh moſt, the other are fitteſt for hot ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks.</p>

Furthermore all hard eggs, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hardened by frying, get from the fire a ſmoky and hot nature, and from the frying-pan and burnt butter a maligne quality, not onely as offenſſive to the ſtomack as rotten eggs, but alſo ſending up bad vapours to the brain and heart. Eggs potcht into water or verjuce are fitteſt for hot complexions, or men diſtempered with agues; ſodden rare in the ſhell they are ſooneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into blood; but being rare-roaſted in embers they make thickeſt and ſtrongeſt blood, and are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for weak, cold and watriſh ſtomachs.

               <p>Sodden fiſh or broild fiſh, is preſently to be eaten hot; for being kept cold after it but one day (unleſs it be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with wine pickle or vinegar) it is corrupted by the aire in ſuch ſort, that ſometimes (like to poiſon-full muſhroms) it ſtrangleth the eaters: alſo fiſh coming out of a pan is not to be covered with a platter, leſt the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour congeled in the platter drop down again upon the fiſh; whereby that fiſh which might elſe have nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed: will either cauſe vomiting or ſcouring, or elſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt within the veins.</p>
               <p>Finally, whoſoever intendeth to eat a fiſh dinner, let him not heat his body firſt with exerciſe, leaſt the juice of his meat (being too ſoon drawn by the liver) corrupt the whole maſs of blood; and let no fiſh be ſodden or eaten without ſalt, pepper, wine, onions, or hot ſpices; for all fiſh (compared with fleſh) is cold and moiſt, of little nouriſhment, engendring watriſh and thinn blood. And if any ſhall think that becauſe Crabs, Skate, Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and Oiſters procure luſt, therefore they are likewiſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115208:78"/>
of great nouriſhment. The argument is denied; for though they blow up the body with wine, and make good ſtore of ſharp nature, which tickleth and incit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to venery; yet that ſeed is unfruitful, and that luſt wanteth ſufficiency, becauſe it cometh not from plenty of natural ſeed, but from an itching quality of that which is unnatural.

And in <hi>Plinies</hi> time they marvelled at an Oiſter, which might be divided into three morſels, calling it therefore <hi>Tridacnon</hi> by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar name: but I dare and do truly affirm, that at my eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Brothers marriage, at <hi>Aldham</hi> hall in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> I did ſee a Pelden Oiſter divided into eight good morſels, whoſe ſhell was nothing leſs then that of <hi>Alexanders;</hi> but as the Greek Proverb ſaith, <hi>Goodneſs is not tied to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but greatneſs to goodneſs;</hi> wherefore ſith the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle round Oiſters be commonly beſt relliſhed, and leſs fulſome, let them be of the greateſt account, eſpecially to be eaten raw, which of all other is thought to be the beſt way. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith that they are ſomewhat heavy <note place="margin">De cib bon. &amp;. mal. ſucc.</note>of digeſtion, and engender fleagm; but as he knew not the goodneſs of Engliſh beefe (when he condemned the uſe of all Ox-fleſh) ſo had he tryed the goodneſs of our Oiſters, which <hi>Pliny</hi> maketh the ſecond beſt of the <note place="margin">Loco citato.</note>

world, no doubt he would have given Oiſters a better cenſure. That they are wholeſome and to be deſired of every man, this may be no ſmall reaſon, that (almoſt) every man loves them, Item whereas no fleſh or other fiſh is or can be dangerleſs being eaten raw, raw Oiſters are never offenſive to any indifferent ſtomack. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore they ſettle a wayward appetite and confirm a weak ſtomack, and give good nouriſhment to decayed members, either through their owne goodneſs, or that they are ſo much deſired.</p>
               <p>Finally if they were an ill and heavy meat, why were they appointed to be eaten firſt? which is no new cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome brought in by ſome late Phyſitian: for one ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Athen. l 4 c. 3. Mac 3. ſat. c. 13</note>

How dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is to drink ſmall drink upon Oiſters it appeareth <note place="margin">Gregr. hiſt. l. 9.</note>by <hi>Andronicus</hi> the elder, who having made a great Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Oiſters, drank cold water upon them, whereupon
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115208:86"/>
he died, being not able to overcome them. And truly as Oiſters do hardly corrupt of themſelves; ſo if cold drink follow them they concoct as hardly: wherefore (eſpecially having eaten many) drink either wine or ſome ſtrong and hot beer after them, for fear of a miſchiefe. Little Oiſters are beſt raw, great Oiſters ſhould be ſtued with wine, onions, pepper, and butter, or roaſted with vinegar, pepper, and butter, or bak't with onions, pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, andbutter, or pickled with white-wine-vinegar, their owne water, bayes, mints, and hot ſpices; for of all wayes they are worſt ſod, unleſs you ſeeth them in that ſea water from whence they were brought.</p>
               <p>All Oiſters are dangeours whilſt they be full of milk, which commonly is betwixt May and Auguſt. Raw Oi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are beſt in cold weather, when the ſtomach is hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, namely from September to April: albeit the <hi>Italians</hi> dare not venture on a raw Oiſter at any time, but broil them in the ſhell with their water, the juice of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge, pepper, and oil; which way I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it eates daintily. Pickled Oiſters may be eaten at all times, and to my taſte and judgement they are more commendable, chiefly to cold, weak, windy, diſtaſted <note place="margin">Lib. 32. cap. 6.</note>ſtomachs, then any way elſe prepared. I wonder whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or no which I have heard of, and <hi>Pliny</hi> ſeemeth alſo to affirm, That Oiſters may be kept all the year long covered in ſnow, and ſo be eaten in Sommer as cold as can be; which if it prove anſwerable to the likelihood I conceive of it, I will cry out with <hi>Pliny</hi> in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Quanti quanti es<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>luxuria, quae ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma montium &amp; maris ima commiſces?

time, let us onely write of their differences in taſte, which is chiefly to be regarded. All ſweet Pears be moſt nouriſhing, cleanſing the breſt of Phleagm, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the ſtomach, and leaſt binding. Soure and harſh Pears are exceeding hurtful to the ſtomach and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy parts; unſavory Pears breed ill juice, and bitter Pears nouriſh nothing at all. If a well relliſhed Pear be alſo endued with a fragrant ſmell (as the Katherin Pear, Violet, Poppering, Sugar-Pear, Musk-pear and ſuch like) they are to be preferred before all others. <note place="margin">Schol. ſal. c. 39.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the preparation of Pears, they are worſt raw, and their skinn is moſt unwholeſome; without wine they are counted poiſon, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing largely taken as a meat. They are beſt being eaten laſt, as contrariwiſe Apples for the moſt part are firſt to be eaten; becauſe they are rather of a looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then an aſtringent nature. They are beſt baked, <note place="margin">lib. de. la. maiſ. ruſt.</note>then roaſted; but dryed Pears (in <hi>Harry Stevens</hi> judgement) ſurpaſs all for ſtrong nouriſhment. They are temperate in heat and cold, but dry in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: which cauſeth them to ceaſe fluxes and vomits, to repel vapours, and ſtrengthen the ſtomach.</p>

               <p>The leaſt nouriſhing (though ſome of them taſte not unpleaſantly, eſpecially the Chriſtian-plum) are Bullices, Chriſtians, Prunellaes, Skegs and Horſeplums.</p>
               <p>All Plums baked, ſtued, or preſerved with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar do more plentifully nouriſh, becauſe much of their ſharpneſs, watriſhneſs, and rawneſs is thereby corrected.</p>

            <p>A <hi>Atichokes</hi> grew ſometimes onely in the Iſle of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;</hi> and ſince my remembrance they were ſo dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>England,</hi> that uſually they were ſold for crownes a peice: now induſtry and skill hath made them ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that the pooreſt man is poſſeſſed of Princes dainties. <hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> in the life of <hi>Pertinax,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the 19 book of his natural Hiſtory, reports Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichokes to have been of ſuch eſtimation in <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Corduba,</hi> that there were ſold as many Artichokes in one year, as came to ſix thouſand Seſterties, which maketh thirty thouſand pound Sterling.

part in the bottome, and with ſweet Marrow, Verjuice, Pepper, Sugar, and Gooſeberries, make moſt excellent and reſtorative Pies. The Italians broil them on a Grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iron, ſetting their bottoms downward, and pouring on a little ſweet oil upon every leaf aſſoon as they open with the heat, and as that ſoakes in, they put in a little more: for if much ſhould be poured in at once, they would ſmel of the ſmoak, by reaſon that the oil would drop into the fire. This way the Artichoke is leaſt windy, and (if it be eaten with Sugar, Butter, and the juice of an Orenge) moſt pleaſant like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. They are hot in two degrees, and dry in one; and therefore fitteſt for cold, aged perſons, and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Remember that raw Artichokes are to be eaten towards the end of meals, but the other at the beginning or in the midſt.</p>

The greateſt and tendereſt ſtalked are ever beſt, and few or no kind of herbs nouriſh more, being ſpoiled of their bitterneſs and eaten hot. <hi>Galen</hi> doubteth of their active quality, but yet experience ſheweth them to be temperately moiſt, and not to exceed in heat the firſt degree.</p>

The middle and thickeſt part of the leaf being boiled and preſerved in Syrup (as Endiff and Succory is done beyond-ſea) give a great nouriſhment to weak perſons newly recovered of hot Agues.

               <head>The dignity and neceſsity of Bread.</head>
               <p>BRead is a food ſo neceſſary to the life of man, that whereas many meats be loathed naturally, of ſome perſons, yet we never ſaw, read, nor heard of any man that naturally hated bread. The reaſons whereof I take to be theſe. Firſt becauſe it is the ſtaff of life, without which all other meats would either quickly putrifie in our ſtomachs, or ſooner paſs thorough them then they ſhould, whereupon crudities, belly-worms and fluxes do ariſe to ſuch children or perſons, as either eat none or too little Bread.</p>
               <p>Again, Neither fleſh, fruit nor fiſh are good at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for all complexions, for all times, for all conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ages of men; but Bread is never out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, diſagreeing with no ſickneſs, age, or complexion, and therefore truely called the companion of life. No child ſo young but he hath Bread, or the matter of Bread in his pap: no man ſo weak, but he eats it in his broth, or ſucks it out of his drink. It neither enflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cholerick, nor cooleth the phlegmatick, nor over-moiſtneth the ſanguin, nor drieth the melancholick.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. Symp. 7.</note> Furthermore it is to be admired (ſaith <hi>Plutarch)</hi> that Bread doth of all other things beſt nouriſh and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then both man and beaſt; inſomuch that with a little Bread they are enabled for a whole dayes journey, when with twiſe as much meat they would have fainted. Wherefore it was not a ſmall threatning, when God ſaid
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115208:125"/>
he would break the ſtaff of bread; without which our meat giveth no ſtrength (as I ſaid before) but either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth in the ſtomach, or is converted to ſlimy crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; we may alſo remember, that of all compound meats it is the firſt of all mentioned in the Scripture, namely in the third of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> where God threatneth <hi>Adam</hi> that in the ſweat of his browes he ſhould eat his bread. Again in the Lords Prayer we ask for all bodily nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the name of Bread, becauſe Bread may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the meat of meats, as without whom there is no good nor ſubſtantial nouriſhment. The Italians have a Proverb, <hi>That all troubles are eaſie with bread, and no pleaſure pleaſant without Bread.</hi> Signifying thereby, our lives to conſiſt more in Bread, then in any other meat whatſoever,</p>
               <p>To conclude, when Chriſt would deſcribe himſelf unto us whilſt he lived, and leave a memorial unto us of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after death: his wiſdome found no Hieroglyphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal character wherein better to expreſs himſelf (the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nouriſher and feeder of all mankind) then by the ſight, taking and eating of Bread: ſo that I may boldly prefer it above all nouriſhment, being duely and rightly uſed, as agreeing with all times, ages, and conſtitutions of men, either ſick or ſound; which cannot be verified of any one nouriſhment beſides.</p>
               <p>Upon which and ſome other things, aroſe theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſayings,</p>
               <p>Whether eating of cruſts of Bread, and ſinews of fleſh, make a man ſtrong?</p>
               <p>Whether Aſhes be Phyſick, and mouldy Bread clear the eyeſight?</p>
               <p>Mony and Bread never brought plague.</p>

               <head>The differences of Bread.</head>
               <p>Concerning the differences of Bread, ſome are taken from the meats we eat; for the Romans had <hi>panem Oſtrearium,</hi> which they onely did eat with Oiſters. They <note place="margin">Plin. l. 18. c. 11.</note>had alſo their dainty Bread, made with hony, ſpice and flour: they had alſo a haſty cake, called <hi>panis ſpeuticus</hi> learned firſt in Greece; likewiſe their bread differed in baking, ſome being baked upon the hearth, others broild it upon gridirons, others fried it like pancakes, others baked it in ovens, others ſod it in ſeam like fritters; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers boild it in water like cimnels, being called <hi>panes aquatici;</hi> which the <hi>Parthians</hi> taught them.</p>
               <p>But the chiefe differences are in the variety of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof they conſiſt; and the variety of goodneſs, which I will declare in order. Some Countries (where Corn was either never ſown at all, or being ſowed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proſper) make bread of ſuch things made into meal as their ſoil yeeldeth. The Oritae, Green landers and <note place="margin">Plin. i. 7. cap. 2. Diod. lib. 3. c. 3. Herodot. li. 2.</note>North-Icelanders make it of dried fiſh, which being thorough dried in the Sun, they beat it firſt with ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, then pound it with peſtils, and form cakes with

water, which they toſt at their fires, made onely of great fiſhes bones (for they have no wood) and eat it inſtead of Bread; yet live they well, and look well, and enjoy pleaſures (ſaith <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> in his Scottiſh Hiſtory) abounding in children, ſtrength and contentment, though not in wealth. The <hi>Braſilians</hi> make Bread of the root of a herb reſſembling Purcelane, and of the barks of <note place="margin">2. lib. de geſt.

               <head>Things to be obſerved in the well making of Bread.</head>
               <p>Concerning the well making whereof, we muſt have great choice and care. 1. Of the Wheate it ſelf. 2. Of the Meal. 3. Of the Water. 4. Of the Salt. 5. Of the Leven. 6. Of the Dough or Paſt. 7. Of the Moulding. 8. Of the Oven. 9. Of the baking. All which circumſtances I moſt willingly proſecute to the ful, becauſe as Bread is the beſt nouriſhment of all other,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115208:127"/>
being well made, ſo is it ſimply the worſt being marred in the ill handling.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Concerning the Wheate,</hi> it muſt be thorough ripe ere it is gathered, two months old ere it be thraſhed, and a month or two old after that (at the leaſt) ere it be grinded. Chuſe ever the yelloweſt without, and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, growing in a hot and fat ſoil, hard, white and full within, clean thraſht and winowed, then clean waſht and dryed, afterwards groſly grinded (for that makes the beſt flour) in a Mill wherein the grind-ſtones are of French Marble, or ſome other cloſe or hard ſtone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Meal</hi> muſt neither be ſo finely grinded (as I ſaid) leaſt the bran mingle with it, nor too groſly, leaſt you loſe much flour, but moderately groſs, that the Bran may be eaſily ſeparated, and the fine Flour not hardly boulted. You muſt not preſently mould up your meal after grinding, leſt it prove too hot; nor keep it too long leſt it prove fuſty and breed worms, or be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe tainted with long lying. Likewiſe though the beſt manchet (called <hi>panis Siligineus</hi> of <hi>Pliny)</hi> be made of the fineſt flour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſſed through a very fine boulter, yet that Bread which is made of courſer Meal (called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Grecians) is of lighter digeſtion and of ſtronger nouriſhment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Water</hi> muſt be pure, from a clear River or Spring: not too hot leaſt the Dough cling, nor too cold leaſt it crumble, but lukewarm.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Salt</hi> muſt be very white, finely beaten, not too much nor too little, but to give an indifferent ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Leaven</hi> muſt be made of pure Wheate, it muſt not be too old leaſt it prove too ſoure, nor too new leaſt it work to no purpoſe, nor too much in quantity, leaſt the Bread receive not a digeſting but a fretting qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115208:127"/>
Where by the way note, that loaves made of pure Wheaten-meal require both more leaven and more labouring, and more baking, then either courſe cheate, or then Bread mingled of meal and grudgins. In <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> our fineſt Manchet is made without Leaven, which maketh Cheate Bread to be the lighter of both, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the more wholeſome; for unleavened Bread is good for no man.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1. de. alim. fac. cap. 2.</note> 6. <hi>The Dough</hi> of white Bread muſt be throughly wrought, and <hi>the manner of moulding</hi> muſt be firſt with ſtrong kneading, then with rouling to and fro, and laſt of all with wheeling or turning it round about, that it may ſit the cloſer; afterwards cut it ſlightly in the midſt round about, and give it a ſlit or two thorough from the top to the bottome with a ſmall knife, to give a vent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way to the inward moiſture whilſt it is in baking.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The Loaves</hi> ſhould neither be too great nor too little: for as little Loaves nouriſh leaſt, ſo if the Loaves be too great, the Bread is ſcarce thoroughly baked in the midſt: wherefore the Francklins Bread of <hi>England</hi> is counted moſt nouriſhing, being of a middle ſiſe, between Gentlemens Roules or little Manchets, and the great Loaves uſed in Yeomens houſes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The Oven</hi> muſt be proportionable to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Bread, heated every where alike, and by degrees; not too hot at the firſt, leſt the outſide be burnt and the in-ſide clammy; nor too cold, leſt the Bread prove ſad and heavy in our ſtomachs.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Laſt of all <hi>Concerning the baking,</hi> it muſt not ſtay too long in the Oven, leaſt it prove cruſty, dry and cholerique; nor too little a while, for fear it be clammy and of ill nouriſhment, fitter to cram Capons and Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, then to be given to ſick or ſound men.</p>
               <p>Bread being thus made, ſtrengtheneth the ſtomach, and

They might eat no Leaven, becauſe Leaven is the Mother and Daughter of corruption, ſouring all if it be too much, and diſtaſting all if it be too little: but when a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is kept betwixt them both, Leaven corrects the Meals imperfection, and Meal reſiſteth Leavens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, making together a well relliſhed maſs (called Bread) which is juſtly termed the ſtaff of life.</p>

in the quality, quantity, and timely taking of it. The inmoſt crumbs of bread are moſt nouriſhing, and fitteſt for hot and cholerick perſons; contrariwiſe the crumbs next the cruſt are fitteſt for phlegmatick diſpoſitions, unto whom ſometimes we allow the cruſt it ſelf, or elſe the crumbs toſted at the fire. Leavened Bread is alſo moſt convenient for weak ſtomachs, becauſe it is ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt digeſted; but if it be too much Leavened, it anoieth them as much in gripings of the belly and ſpleen-ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               <p>It is queſtioned by ſome, Whether Children ſhould eat much Bread without Meat, <hi>aut contra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Bread (ſo it be not newer then one day) is moſt nourſhing, but old Bread (as I ſaid before) is moſt dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Concerning the quantity of Bread, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: that as Drink is neceſſary to haſten meat out of the ſtomach when it is concocted, ſo Bread is as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to hang it up, and ſtay it in the ſtomach till it be concocted. For if we eat fleſh, fiſh or fruit without Bread, it will either return upward (as it fareth in Dogs) or beget crudities and worms (as it hapneth to greedy Children) or turn to moſt cruel fluxes, as it falleth out in the Time of Vintage, and at the gathering of Fruit, when many Grapes, or Apples, or Plums be eaten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bread.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs over-much Bread is as hurtful, yea the ſurfeiting of it is more dangerous then of any meat. For fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fruit or fiſh, being immoderately taken, are quickly corrupted into a thin ſubſtance, which nature may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoid; but the ſurfet of Bread is incorrigible, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo dry, hard, and tough in the ſtomach, that it will neither be voided upward, nor downward without great difficulty, reſiſting the operation of any medicine, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

the veins, and dawbing as it were the bowels (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſenſible enough, and ready to be ſtirred with the leaſt Phyſick) with a ſlimy and viſcous morter. Eat therefore no more then to make a convenient mixture of meat and drink; for as there muſt be a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſand to combine lime and water together; not too little (leſt the morter be too liquid) nor too much (leſt it be tough) but a certain proportion to be aimed at by the Plaiſterer: ſo a due quantity of Bread maketh a perfect maſs of nouriſhment, which elſe being too liquid would turn to crudities by paſſing over-timely into the guts, or being too thick would either putrifie at length, or at the leaſt wax burdenſom to the ſtomach and choke the veins. Note alſo this, that the more liquid and moiſt your meats are, ſo much the more Bread is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but the more dry and ſolid they are, the more Drink is to be taken and the leſs Bread.</p>

Beſides this, the famous Warriours in old time, accuſtomed to hard and ſparing Diet, howſoever voluntarily they eſchewed fleſh and fiſh as meats too delicate for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſtomachs, living onely upon bread, onions, leeks, garlick, town-creſſes and roots, yet they did eat Salt with every thing, as without the which nothing was deemed wholeſome. And truly what is fleſh but a peece of carrion and an unſavory carcaſs, till Salt quickens graces and preſerves it, infuſing thorough out it (as it were) another ſoul? what is fiſh but an unrelliſhed froth of the water, before Salt correcteth the flaſhineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and addeth firmneſs? yea milke, cheeſe, butter, eggs, tree-fruit, garden fruit, field-fruit, finally all things ordained and given for nouriſhment, are either altogether unwholeſome without Salt, or at the leaſt not ſo wholeſome as otherwiſe they would be.</p>

It is enough for nature to give us meat, and elſewhere to give us wherewith to ſeaſon them. And truly ſith Salt may either be found or made in all Countries, what needed fruit, fleſh, or fiſh to have that taſte within them, which out wardly was to be had at mans pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:115208:130"/>
               <note place="margin">Herot. lib. 2.</note> Now if any ſhall object unto me the Egyptian Prieſts, abſtaining wholly from Salt (even in their bread &amp; eggs) becauſe it engendereth heat and ſtirreth up luſt: Or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius (Herophilus</hi> his Scholer) who by his Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">Plut. in qu. nat.</note>counſel abſtained wholly from any thing wherein Salt was, becauſe he was very lean, and grew to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fat by eating hony-ſops and ſugared Panadoes: I will anſwer them many wayes, and perhaps ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that long cuſtome is a ſecond nature, and that it had been dangerous for the Egyptian Prieſts to have eaten Salt, which even from their infancy they never taſted.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas it was ſaid, that they abſtained from it for fear of luſt, no doubt they did wiſely in it; for of all other things it is very effectual to ſtir up <hi>Venus,</hi> whom Poets fain therefore to have been breed in the Salt Sea. And experience teacheth, that Mice lying in Hoyes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from <hi>Rochel</hi> with Salt, breed thrice faſter there, then if they were laden with other Merchandize. Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men likewiſe and Shepherds ſeeing a ſlowneſs of luſt in their Dogs and Cattle, feed them with Salt meats to haſten coupling; and what maketh Doves and Goats ſo luſty and lacivious, but that they deſire to feed upon ſalt things? Finally remember, that lechery (in Latin) is not idlely, or at adventure termed <hi>Salaritas, Saltiſhneſs;</hi> for every man knows that the ſalter our humours be, the more prone and inclinable we are to lechery: As mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeareth in <hi>Lazars,</hi> whoſe blood being over ſalt, cauſeth a continual tickling and deſire of venery, though for want of good nouriſhment they perform little.</p>
            <p>Wherefore whoſoever coveteth to be freed of that deſire with the Egyptian Prieſts (which is an unnatural thing to covet) let them altogether abſtaine from Salt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115208:131"/>
in every thing; but look how much they gain in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency that way, ſo much they loſe of health another way. For as ſheep feeding in ſalt Marſhes never dye of the rot and be never barren, but contrariwiſe are rotted as well as fatted in freſh paſtures: ſo likewiſe whoſoever moderately uſeth Salt ſhall be freed of putrifaction and ſtoppings, and live long in health (no diſorder being elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where committed) when they which wholly abſtain from it both in bread and meat, ſhall fall into many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes and grievous accidents, as did <hi>Apollonius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for all his fatneſs; and as it hapned to Dr. <hi>Penny,</hi> who after he had abſtained certain years from Salt, fell into divers ſtoppings, cruel vomitings, intolerable head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache and ſtrange migrams, whereby his memory and all inward and outward ſenſes were much weakned.</p>
            <p>Remember here, That I ſaid <hi>whoſoever moderately uſeth Salt;</hi> for as wholly to refuſe it cauſeth many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, ſo to abuſe the ſame in exceſs is no leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, engendring choler, drying up natural moiſture, enflaming blood, ſtopping the veins, hardning the ſtone, gathering together viſcous and crude humours, making ſharpneſs of urine, conſuming the fleſh and fat of our bodies, breeding ſalacity and the colt evil, bringing finally upon us ſcabs, itch, skurfe, cankers, gangrena's and foul leprouſies. They which are cold, fat, watriſh and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, may feed more plentifully on ſalt and ſalt-meats then other perſons: but cholerick and melancholick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions muſt uſe it more ſparingly, and ſanguineans muſt take no more of it, then lightly to relliſh their unſavory meat.</p>
            <p>Our Wiches in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> afford ſo good Salt (through God's ſingular Providence and mercy towards us) that I am eaſed of a great labour in ſhewing the differences of ſalt. Onely thus much I leave to be noted, that Bay-ſalt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115208:131"/>
is beſt to make brine of, but our white ſalt is fitteſt to be eaten at table. Finally ſith not onely we in <hi>England,</hi> but alſo all other Nations, yea the old Romans and Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians (as <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> remember) placed Salt ever firſt at the Table, and took it laſt away (inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby the neceſſary uſe thereof with all kinds of meats) let us conclude with the Scholers of <hi>Salern,</hi> in good rhime and better reaſon.

            <p>Here I might ſpeak of <hi>Sal Sacerdotale Aetii,</hi> called the Prieſts Salt, mingled with many ſweet herbs and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to preſerve meats: as alſo of Chymical Salts drawn from wormwood, cinamon, cloves, guajacum and other infinite ſimples; but ſith they are rather medicinable then belonging to ordinary diet, I have reaſon to omit them.</p>
            <p>Now if any will mervail, why I ſhould write thus much in the commendation of Salt, when by general conſent of Writers it is not nouriſhing: I anſwer, That it is, and that not onely accidentally, in making our meat more gracious to the ſtomach, hindring putrefaction, and drying up ſuperfluous humours; but alſo eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it ſelf, being taken in his juſt and due proportion. For our bodies hath and ſhould have humours of all taſtes; yea the firmeſt element of our body is nothing but Salt it ſelf, and ſo termed by the beſt (though the neweſt) Philoſophers; which will hardly be preſerved without eating of Salt.</p>
            <p>Hence comes it that Souldiers, Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-labourers, accuſtomed to feed uſually upon hang'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beef, Salt-bacon, and ſalt fiſh, have a more firm fleſh
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115208:132"/>
and greater ſtrength then ordinary Citizens and dainty Gentlemen. And if Salt-meats (not over-ſalted) be generally held to give the beſt nouriſhment, why ſhould we deny that Salt nouriſheth?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sugar</hi> or <hi>Suchar</hi> is but a ſweet, or (as the Ancients term it) an Indian Salt. The beſt Sugar is made of the tears or liquor of Sugar canes, repleniſhed ſo with juice that they crack againe. Other ſorts are made of the Canes themſelves finely cut, and boiled ſo long in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till all their gummineſs gather together at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, as Salt doth in Cheſhire at Nantwich. The beſt Sugar is hard, ſolid, light, exceeding white and ſweet, gliſtring like ſnow, cloſe and not ſpungy, melting (as ſalt doth) very ſpeedily in any liquor. Such cometh from <hi>Madera</hi> in little loaves, of three or four pound weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece: from whence alſo we have a courſer ſort of Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loves, weighing ſeven, eight, nine or ten pounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece, not fully ſo good for candying fruits, but better for ſyrups and Kitchin uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barbary</hi> and <hi>Canary</hi> Sugar is next to that, containing twelve, ſixteen and ſeventeen <hi>l.</hi> weight in a loafe. But your common and courſe Sugar (called commonly St. <hi>Omers</hi> Sugar) is white without, and brown within, of a moſt gluiſh ſubſtance, altogether unfit for candying or preſerving, but ſerving well enough for common ſyrups and ſeaſoning of meat.</p>
               <p>Of the pouder of which Sugar our cunning Refiners
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115208:132"/>

               <p>Concerning the uſes of this worthy and ſweet Salt; they are many and good. For whereas hony is hurtful to cholerick complexions, Sugar is incommodious or hurtful unto none; yea it is ſo mild and temperate, that <note place="margin">lib. 8. cap. 4. meth. med.</note>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> doth not diſallow it to be given in agues. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it nouriſheth very plentifully, yea it maketh many things to become exceeding good meat (by conditing, preſerving and conſerving) as Citrons, Limons, Orenges, Nutmegs, Ginger &amp; ſuch like, which of their own nature do rather hinder nouriſhment and procure leanneſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, it delighteth the ſtomach, pleaſeth the blood and liver, cleanſeth the breſt, reſtoreth the lungs (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being candied) taketh away hoarſeneſs, and aſſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth drought in all agues, giving alſo no ſmall eaſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed kidneys, and to bladders moleſted with ſharpneſs of urine.</p>
               <p>Sugar keepeth Children from engendring of worms, but being engendred, maketh them ſtir.</p>

For when our firſt Parents might eat of all trees and fruits in Paradiſe, yet the ſhew, lure and deſire of variety made them touch and taſte the unbidden fruit. After the floud when fleſh, fiſh and fruit were permitted to be indifferently eaten, and blood and fat onely forbidden yet we gather up the blood and fat of beaſts to make us puddings, and abſtain not (for recovery of conſumptions) to ſuck the hot leaping and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blood out of one anothers veins. Neither are we contented to feed (as wiſe men ſhould do) upon whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meats, but we mingle with them veniſon of wild bears, the fleſh of ſcabby Cuckoes, the ſpawne of Whales, Sturgians and Tunnies, and other very loathſom things, onely for varieties ſake and delight of change. <hi>Licinius</hi> though he fed upon many diſhes, yet he muſt end his meals with a Lamprey-pye. <hi>Lucius</hi> never ſupt without Oiſters, nor <hi>Sergius</hi> without a Dorry: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were juſtly nicked by theſe names, <hi>Licinius Lamprey, Sergius Dorry,</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> Oiſterman.</p>
               <p>Thus im-borne impiety engraffed by propagation from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> hath made us to loſe the deſire of unity in all things; coveting variety of meats, drinks

and women, yea of Gods and religion; never contented with what is given for our good, but deſirous of that which we ſnatch for our own hurt.</p>

               <head>An apology for variety of meats, anſwering the former objections.</head>
               <p>Hitherto I have ſpoken much from <hi>Philinus</hi> owne mouth, and more from mine own in his behalf, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the variety of meats: now read I pray you with the like patience, How I ſhall defend <hi>Philo</hi> againſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> and prove apparently that variety of meats is both at board, and in our ſtomachs, moſt agreeable to nature, and conſequently beneficial to maintain us in health.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore <hi>Philinus</hi> abuſed our ears, in ſaying that all beaſts feed onely upon ſome one kind of meat: For <hi>Eupolides</hi> his goats, yea and ours to, feed upon time, mints, hyſope, heath, ivy, oken buds, beech, aſh, mullen, chervil and tamarisk, and many other herbs differing no leſs in taſte, ſmell, ſubſtance, and vertue one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What Shepheard is ignorant, that his flock feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon filipendula, daiſies, mouſeare, cowſlaps, lambs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, milk-wort, Saxifrage and little mullen? yet work they no worſe effect in their ſtomachs, then if they had onely been fed with graſs; what ſhould I ſpeak of the Oſtrich, which devoureth iron and pap toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and refuſeth no meat, unleſs men had alſo an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriches ſtomach? Onely let him ſerve to diſprove <hi>Philinus</hi> avouching all beaſts and birds to tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as it were to one meat, and not to eat at once of divers nouriſhments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> where it was affirmed, that brute beaſts and birds out live men, becauſe they are of a ſimpler diet; I muſt pardon <hi>Philinus</hi> being a heathen, and ignorant of the Scriptures: wherein <hi>Methuſalem</hi> and divers Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes are regiſtred to have lived longer, then any beaſt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115208:139"/>
or bird whatſoever, called fitly of <hi>Homer</hi> by the name of <hi>Mortals,</hi> as upon whom more rots, murrens, aches, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes <note place="margin">Iliad. 1.</note>and plagues do light, then uſually happen unto men. Nay go to your Raven and Stag, thoſe longeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers of all the unreaſonable breathers; feeds not the Raven upon all fleſh, eats not the Stag of all herbs, boughs and maſt that comes in his way? ye feedeth he not ſome times upon Snakes and Adders?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Phyſitians giving of ſimple meats to aguiſh perſons, proveth no more that variety is not good for moſt men, then that becauſe <hi>Therſites</hi> can hardly carry his ſingle ſpeare, therefore <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſhall not put on his compleat armour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſedition and tumults fooliſhly feared, and raſhly preſuppoſed to be in meats of divers kinds, afflicting the ſtomach either at the time of concoction or digeſtion, that reaſon of all other is moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For who would or can imagine, that Man the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome or Abſtract of the whole world, in whom ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of every thing (to ſpeak Platonically and yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) is placed and inſerted, could live ever, or long in health without variety of meats? <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeeing ſuch variety of ſimples rooted, ſprouted and quickned upon the earth, gathereth thereupon very truly and learnedly, that there lye hidden in the earth all kinds of taſtes, ſmells, liquors, and heats, and that it is not (as ſome imagine) a dry and cold duſt, void of all taſt, heat and moiſture.</p>
               <p>Much more then may I juſtly avouch, that many meats may and do beſt agree with moſt mens ſtomachs, in whoſe bodies not onely firm fleſh, but alſo thin blood, ſweet phlegm, bitter gall, and ſouriſh melancholy is neceſſary to be preſerved: wherefore let hot meats, cold meats, moiſt meats, dry meats, bitter, meats, ſalt
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115208:140"/>
meats, light meats and heavy meats be mingled together in an indifferent ſtomach (ſo that they be well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, orderly taken, and no error committed in time, meaſure and quantity) no ſedition or tumult will ariſe, no not ſo much as if the ſtomach had taken but one meat; for (according to that Oeconomical diſtribution of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles)</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Sweet ſtraitwaies will it ſelf to ſweet apply,</l>
                  <l>Sharp runs to ſharpe, with gall doth bitter lye,</l>

                  <l>Whilſt cold and moiſt to watry members tend.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>An no marvel, conſidering that natural heat (like a good Stuard) diſſolveth the maſs into a creamy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, running thorough all himſelf, that he may give unto all their due nouriſhment. Wherefore ſith this little world of ours was created full of variety, why ſhould we tye our ſtomachs onely to fruit, fiſh, or fleſh, when God in his goodneſs hath given us all of them?</p>
               <p>Nay furthermore, ſith man can digeſt more ſorts of meats, ſtones and mettles (being rightly prepared) then either the Goat, Raven, or Oſtrich, why ſhould his power be bridled by any unnatural Edict, proceeding rather from the brain of a ſenſleſs head, then from the deep and mature judgment of any Phyſitian? for ſence teacheth us, that moſt compound bodies muſt feed upon divers meats, and that not variety but ſatiety, not quality but quantity, not ſimple taking, but unorderly taking of them, (out of time, out of ſeaſon, and out of their due place and proportion) cauſeth that diſſention and tumult in our bellies, whence all manner of diſlikings or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments <note place="margin">Lib. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As for that <hi>Simile</hi> of Diars, and the other of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oil, and the third of Muſick; they are all more childiſh, then worthy of an anſwer.</p>
               <p>For ſimple colours (as white and black) are not the pureſt, for then the skies ſhould bear them; yea the pureſt jewels give moſt variety of colours and lights in their own kind. And whereas cloth died with ſome one ſimple keepeth longeſt his colour in <hi>Philinus</hi> opinion, it is little material if it were true; conſidering meat is not given to dye our bodies, but to be transformed into our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Again, though a ſweet oil keepeth beſt his ſcent and perfection whilſt it is unmingled, yet that diſproveth not the neceſſity of mixtures, for whoſe ſake ſimples were no leſs created, then Conſonants and Vowels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bring forth ſyllables: wherefore I laugh whilſt others praiſe and extol, <hi>Guevarraes</hi> folly, who like another <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> (whom he Apiſhly followeth in <note place="margin">Guevarra in his Epiſtles.</note>many points) complaineth of compound medicins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all kind of agues to be cured with a plain <hi>Ptiſan,</hi> a thin Cucumber milke, and a little water and oil ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together. Fooliſh Biſhop I deride thy ignorance, becauſe thou deſerveſt not to be pitied deriding others. Go to the little Bee, thou great Idiote; and tell me if thou canſt number, out of how many flowers hony is made. Hony I ſay, the ſweeteſt meat, and beſt medicin <note place="margin">Iſaac.

Can that imperfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perfectly convert ſo many divers juices into one ſoveraign meat, and may not man (the perfecteſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all others) do the like in his ſtomach, when he feedeth of many good and wholeſome diſhes? As for
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115208:141"/>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> his compariſon (whom <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelf term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prince of Sages) I anſwer thus,</p>
               <p>What though variety be to the ſtomach, as choiſe of fair women in a Weak mans eye, cauſing more ſtrong an appetite then reaſon or nature would? By the ſame argument we might as well reprove cleanlineſs in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, skill in ſeaſoning, and handſomneſs or neatneſs in ſerving in our meats; becauſe when theſe concur we feed more largely; which if it be a fault, let <hi>Philinus</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after eat bread made of meal which was never boult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and parſneps and raddiſh never waſht nor ſcraped; let him eat of boil'd meat that was never ſcum'd, and of <note place="margin">Cael. lib. 6. ant. lect.</note>dry, lean birds (ſuch as Q. <hi>Curtius</hi> threw out at the window) never baſted, and of bitter Feldefares never drawn.</p>
               <p>But I (and all wiſe men with me) will conſider, that as honeſty and delight may be matcht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo cleanlineſs and variety is no hindrance to a good ſtomach or good digeſtion, but rather an help and friend to both. Nay it fareth with our ſtomachs as it doth with Sailers; who can eaſily pull in the ſheet when they have too much wind, but cannot enlarge it when they have too little: for ſo likewiſe it is a ſmall labour or cunning to kill appetite by onely ſeeing and feeding upon one diſh, but to revive it being extinguiſhed, or to ſharpen it being dulled, requireth no little art, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth chiefly in variety and well dreſſing of meats.</p>
               <p>Item to anſwer in a word, the law <hi>contra Alloenias;</hi> I grant the thing, but I deny the equity: for what greater reaſon have we to mingle wine and water (which was never forbidden but at drunken feaſts) then to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle a tart wine with a pleaſant, a temperate wine with a hot Sack, and a ſcowrer (when occaſion perſwadeth) with Alegant or a harſh binder? therefore to return
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115208:141"/>
                  <hi>Philinus</hi> his owne Sword into his own boſome: as it is not unlawfull (by the law of reaſon and nature) nay as it is neceſſary and expedient to mingle wines for ſome perſons: ſo variety of meats taken orderly at one meal, are lawful, neceſſary and expedient.</p>
               <p>Moreover (to beat him again with his own <hi>Similes)</hi> I confeſs all inſtruments of muſick to be tuned to one Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: but being ſo tuned, if the Muſicians play ever (like the Cuckoe) but one Song, will not the ear and head be wearied and offended? nay will they not in time be both ſick? Can the eye ſee at once many objects, the ears hear many inſtruments playing together, &amp; <hi>(Philinus)</hi> ſhal not the ſtomach as well concoct, keep and digeſt for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy many meats? but when reaſon faileth, thou haſt almoſt daunted <hi>Philo</hi> with inartificial arguments, drawn from antiquity, examples, cuſtomes, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Senators.</p>
               <p>Now if by the like arguments I confirm Variety, I doubt not but like a Scholler I may cry quittance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if furthermore I confute thy Authorities, as being either falſified or unaptly applied, thou ſhalt live in my debt till the next <hi>Audit.</hi>

               <p>Wherefore to begin with <hi>Rogatianus,</hi> albeit for many years he was delivered of the gout, yet <hi>Caelius</hi> avoucheth not that he was perfectly cured. And <hi>Epicurus</hi> though he fed but upon one diſh at a meal, yet perhaps at every meal he fed on a ſeveral diſh. <hi>Pontanus</hi> alſo was a weak and ſickly man, to whom I confeſs many diſhes (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being of contrary kinds or qualities) are not to be permitted. Neither doth the Gentlemans anſwer in <hi>Lacon</hi> prove more the uſe then of one diſh at a meal, then his Cooks demand inferreth the uſe and mingling of many meats. But if by the few diſhes upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of heathen Gods, thou thinkeſt to prove that men
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115208:142"/>
at home feed onely upon one meat, thou art much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for hereafter I will plainly demonſtrate that they fed on many. As for the old Scotiſh cuſtome, ſuppoſe it were true; yet ſure I am, that ſince King <hi>Arthurs</hi> dayes who lived years before Chriſt, their owne <note place="margin">Hect. Boeth. l. 9. Scot. hiſt.</note>Chronicler recordeth them to have uſed great variety of <note place="margin">Alex. l. 3. c. 11.</note>diſhes. That <hi>Moſchus Antimolus</hi> lived onely with figs, it is no great marvel when he hated from his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del <note place="margin">Athen. l. 10. c. 4</note>all other meat. <hi>Stilpo</hi> alſo fed onely on garlick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his poverty was ſuch that he could buy nothing elſe. As for <hi>Genovefue</hi> the holy made of <hi>Paris;</hi> albeit <note place="margin">Marul. lib. 1. decad. 1.</note>I ſuſpect <hi>Marulus</hi> for a common lier, yet he ſaith, that her feeding ſo long upon one diſh conſumed her body, and that upon the Biſhops licence ſhe was enforced to <note place="margin">Plin. l. 11. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 42<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>eat milk in Lent. <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> was no doubt a moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Philoſopher, who if he lived twenty years in the Wilderneſs onely with one Cheeſe, no doubt it was ſome great Cheeſe like to <hi>Parmiſan,</hi> full of variety, and not made of one but many milks. As for the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous riot of the <hi>Ionians, Lituanians,</hi> and latter Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, drawn from the example and imitation of thoſe wicked Princes and Emperours: I deteſt and abhor it as much as <hi>Philinus,</hi> aſcribing unto exceſſive variety as many miſchiefs of body and mind; as temperate varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty brings profit, health, refreſhings and pleaſures to them <note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note>both. The <hi>Jewes</hi> murmuring doth as little pleaſe me, for though nature told them that one meat could not conveniently nouriſh every man, eſpecially ſuch as were accuſtomed fourty years together in <hi>Egypt</hi> to feed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſty; yet when every man felt that one meat ſent by God, did miraculouſly preſerve man, woman and child, agreeing with all ages, times, perſons and complexions, they ought to have been contented; being as perfitly
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115208:142"/>
nouriſhed with one diſh, as any of us can be with many.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, that example of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> is moſt violently wreſted againſt variety, whereas rather it is an argument againſt unity: for ſuppoſe they had at once taſted of all fruits in the garden, could they have been ſick upon it? no verily, but the taſting of one alone (I mean the forbidden one) was the parent and author of all diſeaſes: wherefore the variety of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meats ſet down by Phyſitians are not offenſive, when one diſh forbidden may prove dangerous: as I could prove by many reaſons, did not experience clear it with her ſun-ſhine.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwer examples alſo with examples; though the Kings of Egypt had no great variety of diſhes, yet that they ever fed on two at the leaſt, <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 6.</note>reports. And if the old Romans fed not diverſly, why <note place="margin">Alex l. 5. c. 21.</note>had they uſually three diſhes at their table? The <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> though they had but few meats, yet they abounded in Salades and Junckets. The old Grecians contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, uſed much meat and few Junckets: yea I read that <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf when <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Menippus</hi> ſupped <note place="margin">Gell. l. 13. c. 11</note>with him, had ſix ſeveral diſhes at his table (figs, peaſon, beans, whortleberries, roaſted beech-nuts, and wafers in the end to cloſe up their ſtomachs) whereof they all fed, ſaving that <hi>Menippus</hi> ſet aſide the wafercakes with his hand, ſaying; that a ſweet aftercourſe makes a ſtinking breath: Another time I read, that <hi>Plato</hi> ſet before his loving friends and fellow Citizens olives, herb-ſalades, divers kinds of fleſh and fiſh, and laſt of all new Cheeſe; whereby any wiſeman may gather, that the ancients fed upon many diſhes of oppoſite kindes, and gratified their ſtomachs (which every mans ſtomach coveteth) with variety of meats. As for our owne Nation (for whom chiefly I write this Treatiſe) <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth, <note place="margin">l. 9 Scot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that Engliſh men from before King <hi>Arthurs</hi> dayes, were accuſtomed to feed much and very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly. <note place="margin">lib. 2. hiſtor.</note>And <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> writeth thus. <hi>The whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Engliſh men delight ſtill (as ever they did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in feaſting and making of good chear, eating much meat and of many ſorts, prolonging their ſittings with muſick and merryments, and afterwards ſporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſet dances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore ſith we are naturally deſirous of many meats, and have ſtomachs above all other Nations, able to digeſt them; and cuſtome alſo hath confirmed our variety of diſhes (which cannot even in bad things be ſuddenly altered without a miſchiefe) I perſwade ſtrong and indifferent ſtomachs to continue their uſed Diet, feeding orderly and ſoberly of divers meats. Divers I ſay, but not too many; for I like not <hi>(Dubias Coenas)</hi> the doubtful feaſts of Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> nor the Abbot of <hi>Glaſtenburies</hi> Diet (who were ſerved with ſo many ſorts of dainties that one might ſtagger and doubt where firſt to begin his dinner) nor the ancient tables of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> where (as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid of <hi>Maronia)</hi> every Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens houſe (in a manner) was a cooks ſhop, till plenty of mouths made penury of proviſion, and dearth of Corne and Victuals lately taught them ſobriety.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all where the Proverb ſaith, <hi>That many diſhes make many diſeaſes;</hi> it hurteth not our poſition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of variety: for not diverſity but multitude offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our ſtomachs, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> more diverſity of meats then they can well abide: accordingly as much meat hurteth not concoction, but that which is overmuch taken in too great a quantity, whereof we are now to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>As for variety of meats in the time of ſickneſs, let us hear what <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith. Diverſity of meats are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115208:143"/>
in ſicknes (if it be a compound ſickneſs) as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of medicins. For a hot liver requireth a cooling meat, and a cold ſtomach that which is hot; and if a mixt diſeaſe have made a mixed diſtemperature in any part, there divers and compounds meats be of neceſſity required. Otherwiſe many meats (eſpecially of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind, ſubſtance and quality) are moſt hurtful and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous.

There be two vices equally oppoſite to this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; Surfeiting, when a man eateth more then either his ſtomach can hold or his ſtrength digeſt; and Self-pining, when we eate leſs then our nature craveth and is able to overcome.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them (namely ſurfeiting and exceſs) though it be a vice of all other moſt hurtful to the body and conſequently noiſome to the mind, yet we read that whole nations, and Emperors, and Potentates have both eſteemed, and honoured and rewarded it for a vertue. <note place="margin">Athen. l. 1. c. 1.

               <head>How often a man ſhould feed in a day.</head>
               <p>Furthermore I would not in like manner have any man think, that I preſcribe two or three meals, and neither more nor leſs to all perſons: for Children may feed much and often; old men little and often: where <note place="margin">Plut. in Gryll.</note>by the way note this out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that old age is not ever to be ſtinted by years, but by decay and loſs of natural ſtrength.</p>
               <p>For in ſome Nothern Countries (and he nameth ours) few men are old at half a hundred years, when the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> and Southern people are old at thirty. They are long young and luſty, becauſe much feeding reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth decay of moiſture, and outward coldneſs preventeth the loſs of in-borne heat. Theſe contrariwiſe are ſoon old, becauſe outward heat draweth out their inward moiſture, which ſhould be the maintainer and food of their heat natural.</p>
               <p>Alſo I permit unto true labourers and workmen to feed often (yea four or five times a day if their work be ground-work or very toilſome) becauſe continual ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of humours and ſpirits, challenge an often reſtoring of the like by meat and drink.</p>

or elſe upon any ſickneſs, is enforced to eat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; it were againſt art, reaſon and nature to number and ſtint his meals. <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi> had ſo gnawing a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that he could eat at all hours, And <hi>Aulus Vitellius,</hi>

Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe ſome either by nature or cuſtome eat but once a day, others onely twice, and ſome thrice: as you may read in <hi>Benevenius, Ferdinandus Mena</hi> and <hi>Bartholomae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

                  <hi>Concerning the manner of eating,</hi> it is not alike in all Countries. The Jews, Grecians and old Romans did eat lying and declining to their right ſight.

For mine own part, I preſcribe no other manner of eating, then we have recieved and kept by long tradition. Nevertheleſs, that declining towards the right ſide was the beſt manner of poſition in feeding, <note place="margin">Ioa. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. v. 23.</note>the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles do ſufficiently prove, who (when they had choice of rites and manners) obſerved ever that which was moſt wholeſome, ſeemly and natural.</p>
               <p>Now how long we ſhould ſit at Dinner and Supper, though it be not ſet down preciſely by Phyſitians, yet generally we may forbid too long or too ſhort a time. <hi>Switrigalus</hi> Duke of <hi>Lituania</hi> never ſat fewer then ſix hours at Dinner, and as many at Supper: from whom I think the cuſtome of long ſitting was derived to Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; for there I remember I ſat with <hi>Frederic</hi> King of Denmark, and that moſt honorable <hi>Peregine</hi> Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Eresby</hi> (when he carried the Order of the Garter) 7. or 8. hours together at one meal. Others feed quickly and riſe ſpeedily; but neither of thoſe courſes be allowable: for as too long ſitting cauſeth dulneſs of ſpirits, and hindereth the full deſcent of meat to the depth of our ſtomachs; ſo too ſpeedy riſing cauſeth an overhaſty ſetling, and maketh it alſo to paſs out before it be well concocted.</p>
               <p>To conclude, mince or chaw your meat finely, eat leiſurely, ſwallow adviſedly, and ſit upright with your body for an hours ſpace or leſs; for longer ſitting is not requiſite for the body (howſoever ſome affect it) nay it is rather hurtful unleſs it be confirmed by long cuſtome, or made more tollerable by reaſon of ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,

               <p>Laſt of all, <hi>Concerning the order of taking of Meats,</hi> The firſt courſe in old times was called <hi>frigida menſa,</hi> the cold ſervice; becauſe nothing but Oiſters, Lettice, Spinache, cold ſalades, cold water and cold ſawces were then ſet on the table; which order was clean altered in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> time, for they began their meals with wine, <note place="margin">Plut. 8. ſymp.</note>hot pottage, black or peppered broth, and hot meat, ending them with Lettice and Purcelane (as <hi>Galen</hi> did) to ſuppreſs vapours and procure ſleep; which example is diligently to be followed of cold ſtomachs, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be imitated of them which are over hot.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe that the moſt nouriſhing meat is firſt to be eaten, that ancient Proverb ratifieth <hi>Ab ovo ad mala;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cael liq<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. cap. 17. A. L.</note>from the eg to the Apples; wherefore I utterly miſlike our Engliſh cuſtome, where Pheaſant, Partridge and Plover are laſt ſerved, and meats of hard concoction and leſs good nouriſhment ſent before them. As for fruit (if it be not aſtringent, as tart apples, pears, ſoure-plums, quinces, medlers, cerviſes, cornels, wardens, ſour pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granates, and all meats made of them) it ſhould be eaten laſt.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe all ſweet and moiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fruit (as ripe melons, gourds, cucumbers, pompions, old and ſweet apples, ſweet pomgranates, ſweet orenges) and all things either fatty, light, liquid and thin of ſubſtance, and eaſie of concoction, ſhould be firſt eaten, unleſs we be ſubject to great fluxes of the belly, or cholerick diſpoſitions of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115208:155"/>
and then the contrary courſe is moſt warrantable. For if ſlippery and light meats went formoſt into hot ſtomachs, they would either be burnt before the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer were concocted, or at the leaſt, cauſe all to ſlip down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards over-ſoon, by making the lower mouth of the ſtomach too too ſlippery. And verily I think that this is the beſt reaſon, wherewithall to maintain our Engliſh cuſtome, in eating biefe and mutton formoſt before foul and fiſh; unleſs the reaſon drawn from uſe and cuſtome may ſeem more forcible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Finally let me add one thing more, and then an end of this treatiſe; namely that if our breakfaſt be of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid and ſupping meats, our dinner moiſt and of boiled meats, and our ſupper chiefly of roaſted meats, a very good order is obſerved therein, agreeable both to art and the natures of moſt men.</p>
