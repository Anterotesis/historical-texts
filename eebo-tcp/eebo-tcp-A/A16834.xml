            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the last assembly of the high Court of Parlament was dissolued (right honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sir) being earnestly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to preach at Pauls crosse the Whitson monday folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according as it pleased God to giue me at that time his spirite of vtteraunce (and doth to al other that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

iudgement and deny their request in that behalfe. I was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged that I should answer for this with him that buried hys talent in the napkin, but I forced not of that chalenge, nor of twentie reasons moe, in so much that of some, mée thought, I had more mystiking for so stiffely denying, than I had liking before for preaching, but this I put vp also and rode my ways. Neuerthelesse when this petition ceased not so, but stil I was more and more sollicited with letters, and credibly enformed how that of some it was called in question, whether al things were true alleaged agaynst the aduersaries, and howe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it was defended, and that diuers noters of it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of their notes thereon, and that an extraction of their notes and sentences was collected, and so they would rawely set it out: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se things, although I did not altogether credite them, but counted them as further driftes to make mée the willinger, yet was I thereby (I must néedes confesse) cleane ouercome, and had rather of the twain set it out my selfe, than it shoulde haue come in any huxsters handling. I knowe not what mooued them to driue me herevnto, for God wote and al the world may sée, there was nothing in it but that was euen <hi>Commune Sanctorum</hi> (as they say) such matter as euery one of them did knowe alreadie, as well and better than I could tell them. What of that? since they will néedes haue it, it is come forth as it is, and if they like the playne truth, they will beare with the homely vtterance. Glory I sought none but Gods, God he knoweth, and they may easily sée by the stile so roughly hewen. Yet some will thinke it more than to smac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of glory to set it out, and I my selfe was of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but that I sawe some men sought glorie by not setting out their doings, retaining better the estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of things they haue done, by suppressing them, than those that lay them forth to euery mans descant on them. And therfore seing that is an argument <hi>Pro &amp; Contra,</hi> not reckening what men wil iudge theron (for I knowe before hand if one will say wel, another will say ill) I haue yelded to mine importunate suters. The
<pb facs="tcp:10222:3"/>
causes that mooued mée, was their too too earnest pressing: but I am euen with them, whome if I made eagre before to haue it, I doubt me I shal wéery them now to reade it. For where I had nothing then but certayne imperfect notes to directe my memorie, nor coulde so well remember (many things pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng betwéene) to followe the tracke of my selfe woorde for woorde as I spake it: I was contente to record it as I coulde, and so to furnish my former notes with further prouision, that I haue made nowe, I dare not say for shame a Sermon, but euen a volume thereon. Neuerthelesse I was the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to wink at mine owne ouer shooting my selfe, bicause now it should not be I any more that shoulde speake it vnto them, but themselues to them selues that should reade me, shoulde speake it for me, &amp; when they are wearie, lay me aside a gods name, and make foure Sermons (if they please) of one: so may I perhaps not be irksome to them, where had I so spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the pulpitas I haue written in the paper, I shold haue ben a great deale more than tedious. But sithe that is allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wable in a Booke, that is not sufferable in a Sermon, it made me the bolder somwhat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more to amplifie. Thinking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that neyther <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> nor <hi>Tullie,</hi> spake altogether, as they wrote, at least not so largely, for so they myghte haue tyred theyr hearers, notwithstanding all theyr eloquence. As for eloquence, here is none: neither I haue it, nor my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desires it. Whiche though it be not set foorth <hi>in sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus<note place="margin">1. Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> humanae sapientiae verbis,</hi> yet haue it truthe ioyned with simplicite, it is inough. Albeit I craue pardon, to atempte to dedicate so meane a treatise to your Lordship, but the reason that moued me herevnto was this: Where once before the Quéenes Maiesties Court (her highnesse béeing then in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse at Titchefield in Hampshire) an acquaintance of myne did preache somewhat aboute this argument of Iustification, your honour then being present, it pleased you so to accept the same, that ye desired eftsoones to heare at Southe Hampton somwhat more theron, which he to his abilitie (as the streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:10222:4"/>
of the time permitted) did performe. Howe your Lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship then liked thereof I will not say, but, good Lord, what an inwarde ioy and comforte he conceyued at that your honours acceptation, and many a thousande syth, hath he priuily tolde me since, howe he more estemed your iudgement, than if all Cambridge hadde giuen that verdicte on him: not that hée thought to open away to set forth him selfe thereby, for that had bene to abuse your honours goodnesse: nor that he was I dare say for him, one whitte prouder thereof, for he felt his owne infirmities: but that he greatly reioyced to sée the eur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie of so noble a hart, so zealously affectioned to the preachers of Gods worde. And as he stil commended this to me, so with this zeale of your L. (whose censure I alwayes drad before) I was nowe so emboldened that I durste presume to clayme patronage of your honour to this my Pamphlet, for Sermon will I not call it, since it hath excéeded a Sermons boundes. Neyther is the handling worthie of any name, although the matter can not be named worthily inough. For the matters sake therfore, not for the manner of it, I shoued it out, when I could not holde it in, and among others chéefely commend it to your good Lordship, whome as God hath made not onely a singular succourer and especiall setter forth of his truth and al good letters, but also a publike patrone therevnto, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a father to our moother and nourice of learning, the renounted vuiuersitie of Cambridge, that now (God be praysed for it) flourisheth vnder your protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to his glory, your ioy, and our comfort, long to blesse and prosper your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour therin.</p>

The thirde part shall be, to consyder the meanes that God (being thus purposed and moued) wrought this benefite by, that is to say, <hi>Vt daret filium suum vnigenitum,</hi> He gaue his only begotten sonne to worke it. The fourth and the last part, shall be to consider, wyth what effertuall instrument we receyue and apply those causes of our saluation to our benefite, that is to wit, <hi>Qui credunt in eum,</hi> By a stedfast Faith in hym. Wherein are comprehended these foure causes: The originall cause and fountain of mans saluation, Gods eternall purpose: the motiue cause inducyng hym therevnto, Gods loue: the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiente and formall cause thereof, the Sonne of GOD: the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>You haue hearde (deare Christians) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I purpose to proceede, euen on this sentence, <hi>Sic Deus. &amp;c.</hi> Yee haue hearde what notable matter it conteynethe, what is the summe and argument thereof, and howe I haue distributed the same.</p>
               <p>Wherof the fyrst part hath to behold the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purpose of Almightie God in these endes, that the world should not perishe, but haue euerlasting lyfe. This parte hath two things principally to consider. Whereof the syrste is these two endes, perdition, and lyfe eternall: The seconde is these two parties, God, and the worlde. God that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth from perdition, and giueth eternall life: the world that is deliuered from perdition, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth eternall lyfe. The former is comprehended in these woordes, <hi>Vt non pereat, sed habeat aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam vitam,</hi> that it should not perishe, but haue E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall lyfe. Whiche wordes are placed last, and are the ende of the sentence, and lyke wise are the last end that wee shall come vnto. But bicause the drifte whereto the sentence tendeth, and we also directe the leuell of all oure life, is to escape perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to obteyne life eternall, not vnorderlye it commeth to bee fyrst consydered. For although the ende is laste in practise, yet in mynde the ende is fyrste of all. Hee that is aboute to buylde an house, fyrste hath his generall ende and purpose wherefore he wold build, and or euer he set on the building, he deuiseth his platforme, &amp; how he shal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10222:7"/>
be able to compasse the same. <hi>Quis ex vobis. &amp;c. Which of you</hi> (sayeth Christ) <hi>disposed to buylde a Toure, sitteth not downe before, and counteth the cost, whether he haue sufficient to perfourme it, least<note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> after he hath layde the foundation, and is not able to perfourme it, all that beholde hym, begynne to mocke him, saying: This man began to buylde, and was not able to make an ende? Or what Kyng, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make battaile againste an other Kyng, sitteth not downe fyrst, and casteth in his mynde, whether he be able with tenne thousande to meere him, that commeth against him with twentie thousande. &amp;c.</hi> What man hauing a iourney to goe, first conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the place whether, the entent wherefore, and the manner howe he wil trauaile thether, and then he setteth on his Iorney, and last of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth there? This is the differnce of the foole and wise (as our Prouerbe sayth) to looke or we leape. As <hi>Esope</hi> telleth of the two Froggs, that in a dry Sommer sought for water, and when they came to a deepe pit: Here sister (sayth the one) is a good place for vs to abide in, here is water inough: nay softe (quod the other Frog) let vs viewe a litle ere we leape in, if water shoulde faile here also, howe should we get out again? The wise therfore geue this councell, <hi>Quicquid agas, prudenter agas, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spice finem, Whatsoeuer thou doest, doe it warily, and forecast the ende therof.</hi> Beholde, howe Christ commendeth the steward (whiche otherwise was a wicked man) for this his industrie in prouidyng for the ende. O that the children of life were halfe so wise, so prouident, and forecastyng, as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

Here is not <hi>Pythagoras Y</hi> to looke vpon, but a far more excellent matter than euer <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was able to discerne. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> described the lyfe of Man, by this letter <hi>Y,</hi> that as the <hi>Y</hi> endeth in two strakes, so the lyfe of man hath two ways leading to two endes.

To conclude, the kingdome of God is not of this worlde, the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this worlde is follie to God.

So that betwene these twain God, and the worlde, is a great contrarietie. Now then proue ye this your fyrst part, will ye say, that God would the world should not perish, but haue eternall lyfe?

               <p>Those Monks that said, they died to the world, and they were out of the worlde, bicause they had caste off theyr former coates, and tooke a coule, bycause they forsooke towne houses, and dwelte by themselues besyde the townes, dyd but mock bothe with God and the worlde, and so were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the worlde, that they lyued in the chiefest pleasures of the worlde: they were gone so cleane out of the worlde, that they hadde gotten the best landes and wealthe of the worlde in their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions. But as those worldelyngs deluded the worlde, so is there none, no not the Electe of GOD, that come in this worlde to suche perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that they may be called euen the worlde, bycause they were of the world, and yet are in the worlde.

them what yet they were, and in part what they be, and in what place and state they stande, euen the electe of God are called the world. The second reason whie the electe of God may be called the world is, bicause they be dispersed through out the world and are of al sorts and kynds of the world. For as the worlde is not this or that place, nor one or two Realmes, but all places in euery cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the worlde: so the Churche of Christe is not tyed to Sainct Peters chaire at Rome, nor to the Latin church, as the Papists would bound it, nor to the Affricanes, as the <hi>Donatistes</hi> contended, <hi>Sed in omnem terram exiuitsonus eorum. Ite in vni<note place="margin">Rom. 10 Marc. 16.</note> uersum mundum,</hi> but is dispersed throughout all the face of the earth, God hath his electe euen thoroughe all the Worlde, and that of euerye kynde and sorte: for as the world is not one state, all are not princes, all are not subiects, all are not men, al are not women. &amp;c. But the worlde is all Nations, kynredes, conditions, states, orders, personages, sexes, ages, and all degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones: soo the Electe are of all sortes, ryche and poore, hyghe and lowe, weake and stronge, wyse and symple, olde and young what so euer: God accepteth none for hys person more than other. There is neyther Iewe nor Gentyle, manne, nor Woman, nor anye respecte of difference in<note place="margin">Rom. 10. Gala. 3.</note> Gods election: and therefore the electe may well bee called the Worlde. The thyrde reason is, for the dignitie of the Electe, not onely for the analogie of the name which in Greke and Latin,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10222:15"/>
signifieth cleane and pure, so well as the worlde where as in deede the worlde is corrupt, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to vanitie for mannes fault: and onely the elect are pure and cleane, whose filthe is clensed with the bloud of the vnspotted Lambe of God, and so by good proportion, may be called the worlde: but also for that the worlde was euen made for them, although they be the least part of the worlde, yet they be the best part of the world, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the choyce of god: whom though the world dispise, &amp; be vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of them, yet are they before God, &amp; in dede, the very heires and lordes of the world. So saith S.<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> Paul, of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the father of the faithful: <hi>Quod sit futurus haeres mundi,</hi> that he shold be the heire of the world: and so sayth he also of al Gods people:<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>Omnia vestra sunt, All thyngs are youres, whether it be Paul, Apollo, or Cephas, or the worlde, or lyfe, or death, or things present, or things to come, al are youres, and you are Christes, and Christe is Gods. For as Christe is the heire of all the worlde,</hi> so are the Elect coinheritours with him: In considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whiche dignitie Saint Paule rebuked the Corinthians, for going to lawe before Heathen<note place="margin">1.

If the worlde then shall bee iudged by you, are yee vnworthye to iudge the smallest matters? Knowe yee not that wee shall iudge the Angels, how much more than matters worldely? The spirituall manne<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> iudgeth all thyngs, and is iudged of none.</hi> For in dede he only hath the true iudgement of al things,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10222:15"/>
and knoweth howe to rule and order them, howe to take them, howe to forsake them, howe to loue them, how to hate them, how to esteme them, how to despise them, howe to vse them, howe to refuse them: He vseth that that should be but vsed, and enioyeth that shold be enioyed.

This doo not the wicked, they vse that they should enioye, they enioy that they shold but vse: &amp; therfore whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the wicked vse, enioy or haue, they ar but thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and robbers, it is none of theirs: but proprely and duely belongeth to the sonnes of God. And therfore for this cause also may the elect be called the world. Then soloweth it, that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie in these propositions, God by his eternal wil and purpose would, that the world should not perishe, but haue Eternall lyfe, and yet that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther al creatures, nor al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor the wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings shoulde escape perishing, nor haue eternall lyfe, sith the elect of God may for these iust causes be called the world that only shall not perish, but haue eternall lyfe. This restraint of this word the world (for the elect of God out of this worlde) not considered, diuers haue staggred at this and suche other sentences, and fallen into greuous errours. <hi>Origen</hi> stombling at this blocke fell fowly in the myre, affirming, that all men shoulde be saued at the lengthe, yea the dyuels in Hell and all, but that was too grosse an errour. The scripture (as I haue noted already against the Papists) is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfest to the contrarye. After him came <hi>Pelagius,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:10222:16"/>
wyth a fyner inuention, who hearyng here, that the world shoulde be saued, and considering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all how farre this terme the World doth firetch, euen to the wycked, destitute of all grace, and to euery man in general: imagineth that God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all election or choyce of one more than an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wold simply haue al men alyke to be saued, &amp; that al men haue alike free will, election, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, to choose whether they will be saued or no. This doctrine being a very plausible doctrine to the itchyng eares of manne, tickled wyth the pride and loue of his owne freedome and abilitie, was by and by so snatched vp for a iewel, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most there was no part of Christendome that had it not, yea that was not so infected with sutche a spice of it, as neuer could be puld out since: Nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most any doctoure, except Saincte Augustine, but hadde some smacke thereof, hauing bin the moste of them in theyr youth Philosophers, and of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos and Aristotles</hi> principles sucked oute theyr er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

euery mothers childe. If he had but said the word and wolde, it had benne so vndoubtedly, and then wo worth vs that euer we were borne, as Christ<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> sayd on the lost childe Iudas. What then? though we had bin vtterly vndone, yet god had done but Iustice to vs all, he had done vs no wrong, wee had deserued it, and he had gotten glorye on his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, as he did on the diuels and <hi>Pharao,</hi> but the Lords name be blessed immortally, he woulde not the world shold perishe, he wold the glorie of his mercie should shine aboue the glorie of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. <hi>Misericordia eius super omnia opera eius,</hi> His mercie is aboue all his works. And therfore of his infinite mercie he chose his choise out of the world whom here for the foresaide causes, he calleth the worlde, and in other places are called the electe of god. And thus as he wolde not that euery one shoulde be damned, so he wolde not that euery one sholde be saued. For if he would, not only he could, but al vndoubtedly should haue bin saued. It is an ill argument to reason from the power of god by it selfe to the will of god, or to the work and doing of god, as the Papists do in their article of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanciation, saying: Can not God make bread his body? can not God make his body go through a dore, the dore remayning whole and shutte? can not god make his body be in many places at once? <hi>Ergo</hi> he wyl, <hi>Ergo</hi> he dothe it: This is an insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient consequence. But to reason from the will of God, to the power of God, is a good argumente. To reson from the power &amp; the wil of God, to the effect and worke of God, is a necessary sequele, as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10222:17"/>
appeareth by this argument: Whatsoeuer God can do, and wil doo, that shalbe done: but God can and will saue all men, <hi>ergo</hi> all men shall be saued. This is a right argument, but this is a manyfest false conclusion, for then none shoulde be damned: But the Scripture sayth, many shall be damned, as before is proued: Then the conclusion is not true. but the falshod of the conclusion in a formall argument, commeth of some falshod in the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>Ex veris p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Here the whole resteth on these two wordes, can and will, that God can do it if he would, is out of controuersie, then must the lot light on this word will: To say therfore it is Gods wil that al men should be saued, is a false principle. But thus say the Papistes, and wrest the woordes of God, to denie his eternall purpose of election and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the Papists therfore make an euident lye of God. For if god wold, <hi>Voluntati eius quis resis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet?</hi> who could resist the will of God? could all the power in the world? could all the Diuels in hell? could man, could we our selues? can any creature in heauen and earth, defeate the will of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Heauen and earth and all things in it? Can the pot alter the potters will? and shall we saye then, man can frustrate Gods wil? Let vs see for example an instance hereof. <hi>Saule</hi> that afterward was called Paule, was a naughtie persecuter, a blynde Pharisey, and an enimie of Christ and his

If then workes are thus by S. Paul in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iustification thrust clean out of the dores by the heade and shoulders, shall wee suffer the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists to bring them in, and shoulder out grace, and the fauour of God in the cause of his election and of our saluation? But needes wyll the Papistes ioyne these two that can not be ioyned, the merits of man and the fauour or loue of God. Now syth they will needes ioyne them together, whether wer it fitter to haue the better ende of the staffe, to be the greater cause of the twain, the cause proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from god, or the cause proceeding from man? a reasonable man would think &amp; say without any studie for the matter, surely the greater cause is in God. Were he not then vnresonable, and too too wicked, that durst affirm the greater cause of our saluation to be in man? Well, what say the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists to this question? Man shal be saued, why so? Bicause God loues him, as ye haue alredy proued, yea, but answere me precisely to this point, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinkest thou God loues him? Forsoth bicause that eyther he is a good man, a iust man, a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, a man that loueth and feareth God, or bicause he foreseeth he shuld so be, and therfore he loueth him.

I laye mee downe to slepe, why so? to rest my bodye, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh my spirites: then the rest of my body, and the refreshing of my spirits, is a greater matter than is my lying downe to sleepe. I buylde an house, what moueth me to doo suche cost? to shelter and shrowde me from wynde and weather, from heat and colde, from danger and enimie, and to defend and keepe me and myne: then this my defence, is a greater cause than my house buylding is. And eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so, God loueth a man, why loueth he him? bicause he is a good man: then the goodnesse of the man is a greater cause than the loue of God. And thus in conclusion, not onely the greater cause of mans saluation is in man, and the lesser cause in God, but also that little cause in God, is referred to mannes goodnesse also. And so the cause in God is cleane swalowed vp lyke a drop in the sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a beane in a Monks hoode, a mouse in a cheese, nay rather a ciphre in Algorisme, the loue of God in the cause of mans saluation. And yet for fashions sake, the name of Gods loue, of Gods grace, of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, of Christs merits must be pretended: but when all is done, the woorke of man, is the efficient, is the formall, is the finall and principall cause of mans saluation. As <hi>Bonauenture</hi> sayeth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the death and resurrection of Christe, take away our sinnes and iustifie vs, <hi>attamen neutri at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribui</hi>

And so mans loue is the formall cause of mannes saluation, but it muste bee called forsoothe the grace of God.</p>
               <p>Heere is agayne the Passion and Resurrection of Iesus Christe sayde, to take away synnes, and to Iustifie vs. What can be a godlyer saying and truer than this? Who could find fault with this? Who woulde require more, yf they meane as they say? Why, haue thei then another meaning? What is that? Forsoth the death and Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth it, but not proprely as any cause therof. Lo here is the cause cleane take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away. nay not so, but it is not a cause properly. how is it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? it hath yet some propertie of a cause. This is a contrarie tale to it selfe, at lest it hath som propertie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie.

sinnes and to iustifie man? Forsoothe in this consideration, by the meanes of mans desert and good works co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming betwene, and being a stickler in the matter. But how commeth it betwene, as a small cause? Nay, as the material cause also of his saluation. And so ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s charity is the formal cause, mans merits are the material cause, Grace is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, The deathe and resurrection of Christe is named, but it is no cause properlie: and if it haue anye propretie of a cause, it is onely by reason of mannes merites goyng betweene. Is not thys a proper doctrine? Whether will not this doctrine presume to goe? Why maye not the Papist say as well that manne is the cause of God, as to say that mannes merites are the cause of Gods loue?

               <p>We reade of greate loue that Princes haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their subiects withal, and subiects again haue loued their Princes. This is a goodly and Godly loue also, &amp; wold to God it were so faithful in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry countrey, as it ought to be. Then should we not haue harde of suche oppressions and ciuile warres in foreine realmes, nor of suche conspiracies and rebellions as hathe bene in oure owne. A Prince oughte to be a father and mother to their people, and to make reckning of so many children as they haue subiectes. The subiect again ought to be as a chylde vnto his Prince, and to make reckenyng of his soueraigne, as of his own father or mother, yea to make a greater accompt of him or her, than of his father that begate him, or his mother that bare him, not only for that the state is greater, and euen immediate next to God, and representing god him selfe: but also for the greater commoditie, that both he, his parents, his kin, and all his countrey, receyue by the peasable and vertuous gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prince, not only of infinite benefits of bodye aud goodes, but that passeth all bodily and temporall matters, the free passage of the Gospel of Iesus Christ, the mayntenance of his true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the faithfull feding on his word and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that refreshe and nourishe his soule to lyfe euerlasting. Therfore next vnder God, there is no loue ought to be greater than this, that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall subiecte doth owe his naturall Prince: nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing is a surer defence to the Prince next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods protection, (whose anoynted the Prince

No horse nor harnesse, no garde, nor gunne, nor garrison, no forte nor castle, no armie, no treasure, nor anye thing that a Prince canne deuise in yearthe, to defende hym selfe, and saue his honoure by, is of more value than this one thyng, the Subiectes faythful loue.

For if the prince bare sutche loue to those malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, no great loue in any creature could com with out greate causes on their partes, either that they had don for the prince, or might doe for him, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10222:60"/>
moued him to beare them this exceding loue. But in God the creatour, there was no cause at all (as is alreadie declared) on the worlds behalfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shold loue the world, neither benefite nor personage nor any thing, besides the loue it selfe of God. The Prince in this case might not fauoure his sonne, or loue those offenders more than he did his sonne, but the sonne of God is his best beloued, neither did he this to his sonne as not louing his sonne, or lesse louing his sonne than vs, but only he did it for the loue of vs, &amp; yet his loue of vs is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in and for his sonne: The Prince might seeke glorie and renowne by this strange fact, as the Philosophers did in al their sufferings, but Christ sought ignominie due to vs, to bring vs to raigne in glorie with him. In the ende the Prince must nedes die and his sonne also, and how soone either of them, God knowes. And whether by not so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouse a deathe or no, God knowes. And how they shold haue liued, with what troubles, feares, and changes, God knows. These things might moue them to be the willinger to suffer death that once they must nedes suffer and this they know: But the sonne of God was not subiecte vnto deathe, he neded neuer to haue died, for death had no power ouer him, as he truly sayd, <hi>Habeo potestate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> animam meam, &amp; iterum sumendi eam,</hi> I haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to geue ouer my life, and to take it againe.

see what conclusion will ryse theron. Original sin is no sinne in dede, but onely a bare name of sinne.

I would it were so for his owne sake, and that I lied on him herein. But what? shall I trust his false faithe? there is little holde in it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had sworne it, and written it, and sealed it. Example their faithe to Iohn Husse, and their generall rule, <hi>Nulla fides haereticis est habenda,</hi> No faith must be kepte with heretikes. And he before hand iudging me an heretike, and protesting to be false vnto me, how shall I beleue him? neither wil he beleue mee, and both he and I are parties. Let then an indifferent iudge be vmper to see whether they beleue in any other creatures besydes Iesus Christ or no.

is a general rule in al belefes. For ensample, how shall I know a Gentiles belefe.

the singular numbre, to be slightly passed ouer: for euen with the lyke obseruation S.

excepte they forsake their inuocation with their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther errours, only beleue in him.

But this is not that the Papist hath such liking of loue and charitie, except it be as is aforesayd S.

This is euen as the theefe, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing robbed a poore man, asked him if he had any more, the poore man denyed it, but when the thefe serching him further, founde somwhat more than the poore man thoughte had ben aboute him: Ha good Lord (quod the theefe) what a hard world is this, whom shall a man trust nowe a dayes? And euen so the Papists spoyle &amp; murder, with all kind of moste barbarous crueltie, the poore professers of the Gospell and faith of Christe, and yet they crie out, Ha good God, wher is charitie, where is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? What a harde and vncharitable worlde is this? It is not charitie therefore that the Papiste reckeneth on, though he vse the name of charitie to bleare the simple people withal: for rather than he wold lese one iote of his aduantage, or the pope one title or inche of his honour, he careth not and all the worlde were together by the eares, yea he will clap them on the backe, and set them to it, as at this day he doth. This then is not charitie, but vnder the name of charitie, hee meaneth mannes workes, bicause charitie is the bonde wherewith they are all tied, and so are all comprehended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of charitie: and therefore sayeth he, charitie is the principall, by the preparatiue wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes whereof wee receyue euen faithe it selfe.

of any works, but whatsoeuer worke sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not out of faith, the same work how glorious soeuer it seeme, is nothing els but sinne. <hi>Quicquid non est exfide peccatum est,</hi> Whatsoeuer is not of<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> faith, is sinne: marke this word <hi>ex,</hi> of, if it be not of it, if it come not out of it, it is sinne. then faith goth before all other things in this matter of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so faith is the principal thing and root of all: Yea not only the principall, but in this matter, faith only, and that without workes doth it. And here againe, the Papist is more offended than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that faith is made the only meanes of recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this benefite. What (saithe he) and nothing but faith? No (say I) Christ mencioneth here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but faith. <hi>Qui credit in eum, He that beleueth<note place="margin">Mar 9. Matth. 8.

Why then (say they) ye turne faith out of her cloathes, if ye take works from her, ye leaue her naked, and doth a naked and bare faithe iustifie vs? In deede woorkes are the cloathes of faith, and serue as clothes doo decke and set this lady out, but as the body was before the clothes, and without the clothes, and is of an other substance than the clothes, so was faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore workes, and is borne of God as naked as my nayle, in respect of any merite of woorkes, eyther preceding or concurring.

Here was belefe &amp; profession of it, &amp; the thing that they professed to beleue, is true: What wil they gather hereon? that saying of the Apostle, <hi>If we confesse<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> with our mouth the lord Iesus Christ, and beleue in our hart that God raised him from death we shallbe safe?</hi> Do they thinke the diuell beleueth on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion?

For if they did, they woulde at least haue that the dyuels haue with all, a feare and trembling at him, they wold feare so shamfully to abuse him as they doe: For saynt Iames ioyneth these two things together in the diuels, <hi>Daemones credunt &amp; contremis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This therefore shewethe they haue no more faith tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diuel hath. Yea they know not what faith doth meane. For as already is sayde, beleefe is not only a knowledge, nor an acknowledging of Christ, wherby we verely thinke him to be the sonne of God and sauior of the world, and approue this our thought with assent thervnto, alowing it so to be: But also it is a stedfast confidence and trust in him, apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding him, and applying him to vs. And this thing, which is the principall thing in belefe, the diuels haue not, nor can not haue. They haue the first part, of knowledge: and a shew they made here of the seconde, that is acknowledging: But the third and especiall thing in belefe, a trusty confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in him, they had not: Which if they had had, they wold haue fled vnto hym, &amp; haue caught holde on hym, but they feared and hated him, and therefore with trembing fled from him: Now this third thing in faith, whiche is principally to be reckened vppon, the Papist considereth not: And this is the cause whie hee so staggereth in a continuall doubte, whether he shall be saued with Christe, or he shall bee damned with the diuell, and feling thys continuall trembling in himselfe, (for who wolde not tremble standing in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie)
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10222:84"/>
And hearing that the diuels tremble al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in their belefe, he concludeth, that belefe is no more but a fyrme opinion of a thing so to be, and at the most a trembling assent therunto. And therfore saithe the Papist the diuell hathe faithe. But se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall, the diuells apparant condemnation, that he is not nor can be iustified, he concludethe hereon, that only faithe iustifieth not, for if it dyd the diuel were iustified. Then reasoneth he, if faith be not able to iustifie, we must seeke helpe of good woorkes to iustifie vs, whiche good workes the diuell hathe not. Now, seeking to be iustified by works, he is entred into sutche a laborsom mase and infinite labyrinthe, that he is neuer able to winde him selfe out, to sit downe and rest him in a quiet conscience, and persuade him self that he is alredy iustified. For how can he thus quiet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, seeking iustification by woorkes, when hee heareth Chryste saye, <hi>When yee haue doone all<note place="margin">Luc. 17.</note> that yee can do, ye are vnprofitable seruantes,</hi> and he feelethe styll in hym selfe manye doubtes and mutche imperfection: And therefore hee maketh a generall resolution, that wee can neuer attayne to any certaintie, whether wee bee iustified or no, and so ought continually to hang in a doubt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that it suffyseth vs in the meane space, to recomforte oure selues wyth a generall beleefe, that some shall bee saued, but whether wee shall be saued or no, that we still stande in doubt of, say the Papistes. Thus blyndely, myserablye, and infinitely they runne from one errour to an other,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10222:85"/>
for <hi>Ex quolibet se quitur quodlibet,</hi> Grannte one falshoode, and a number will followe: and all commeth of this, that boasting of faith, theyknow not what faith meanes. And so, contending with vs about faith, they bewray them selues that they haue no faith, but in stede of faith, mayntein plain infidelitie. That whiche Christe flatly reproueth, <hi>O ye of litle faith,</hi> in respect that they douted, that<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> do they allowe for good &amp; necessarie.

Paule most pithyly expresseth the nature of true faith, most contrary to the Papistes wauering doubt, and their generall houeryng in the aire of an opinion knowing &amp; acknowledging suche a thing to be: but true faith is a stedfast and confident application therof to our selues, wherby we may be able to say vnto Christ with Thomas, <hi>Dominus meus &amp; Deus meus, My</hi> Lorde and my<note place="margin">Iohn. 20.

But thus deale the Papistes wyth thys pardon of Iesus Christe, naye, they deale farre woorse in this matter with GOD and Christe his sonne, than any man is able to deale wyth manne.
