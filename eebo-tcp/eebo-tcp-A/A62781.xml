         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="3">3.

               <p>I <hi>A.

               <p>And that he is entruſted by God, and by the Laws of his ſaid Kingdoms and Dominions, with the Supreme external Regiment of both State and Church, People and Clergy in them.</p>
               <p>And that although he be not impowred with any Spiritual or Supernatural Church-Power of the Keyes, yet he is with a Royal Politique Temporal and Natural Power Supreme to direct by ſuitable Laws and Precepts all the aforeſaid perſons, and to Coerce by ſuitable means and puniſhments all Tranſgreſſors amongſt them, and all Tranſgreſſions of every perſon of them, (without exemption of any) in whatever cauſe or thing Civil and Temporal, or Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual.</p>

               <p>And that all the aforeſaid perſons, his Majeſties Subjects, are obliged under pain of ſin to obey his Majeſty in all Civil and Temporal Affairs, as much as or wherein the ſaid Laws require obedience from them, and in all Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual things and Cauſes not only to obey the direction of the ſaid Laws, where ſuch direction appears not to be againſt the will of God, but alſo where it doth appear to them againſt ſuch will, then and in every ſuch caſe to abide and ſuffer patiently without rebellious reluctance, or any forceable reſiſtance by Arms, or by unlawfull and contumacious Riots or Tumults, the coercion and penalties of the ſame Laws.</p>
               <p>And that the aforeſaid power Supream-Royal of his Majeſtie, is not hitherto, nor can hereafter be forfeited or loſt by any abuſe either true or pretended of it, nor is any way ſeparable from his Majeſties Crown Imperial.</p>
