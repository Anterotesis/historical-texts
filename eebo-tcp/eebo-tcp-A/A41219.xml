            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all Miſſe-led People in this Land.</head>
            <p>HE that in theſe times will ſpeak any thing to the People in behalf of the King, is likely to doe it upon diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and be heard with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: but they that would be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed by what they heare, muſt lend an equall Eare to what is ſpoken; which I hope you will do, being ſuch, for the moſt part, as profeſſe to make a conſcience of your wayes, I deſire therefore of you (into whoſe hands this Treatiſe ſhall come) that you would receive it with mind and affection, anſwerable to that wherewith it is offered to you, free from partiality and private reſpects; that you would conſider Caſes of Conſcience are written out of Conſcience: And were a diſtreſſed Prince a fit object for flattery, or this kind of inſtruction capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch language, yet is this a time for every man to informe and ſpeak his Conſcience; and as many of you as ſhall reade me in this book, will, I hope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I had no other purpoſe in the publiſhing of it, then to give teſtimony to the truth for the directing of your Conſciences and the diſcharge of mine own. I have therefore written it plainly without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of curioſity, having a reſpect onely to your
<pb facs="tcp:42062:3"/>
profit; the Learned through the Land are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſawded, and I may aſure you all Ages have aſſerted this truth, out of which I could have drawn a cloud of witneſſes and preſented them to your ſight, but thought it more expedient for your dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſhew you the cleare light of Divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and rectified Reaſon, the onely rules of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and if by theſe you ſhall be brought to ſee the crookedneſſe of the New Doctrine of theſe times, and the uneven dangerous windings of this way of reſiſtance, I have gained the end of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and you have not loſt by it.</p>
            <p>One thing I muſt note as ſtrange, that to diſcourſe upon this argument ſhouldbe thought (as it is by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) a worke altogether beyond the profeſſion of the Divine. Indeed popular States-men have alwayes held it very impolitick and unreaſonable, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould not in dangers imminent have means to ſave themſelves by a Power of reſiſtance, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly framed their principles and grounds of State as unqueſtionable. We examine not the power or wiſdome of Law-makers, but when we receive their Law, Declaration, or Command, and know it <hi>in terminis,</hi> underſtand it in the ſenſe it be its, certainly it belongs to the Divine to conſider whether it be againſt Gods Law, and accordingly to inſtruct his people. If it be agreed upon as a thing known in this State, that the King is <hi>the higher Power</hi> according to St. Paul, <hi>the Supreme</hi> according to St. Peter, <hi>the Father of the Commonwealth</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fifth Commandement, ſurely it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Divine to urge obedience, honour, and ſubjection according to thoſe place, and reprove re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb facs="tcp:42062:3"/>
forbidden there: Which obedience we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be limited and circumſcribed by the eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land, and accordingly to be yeilded or denyed to the higher Power, if thoſe Laws be not repugnant to the Law of God: And for Reſiſtance, as we have not yet heard of any Law of the Land that commands or warrants it, ſo we know that were there any Law or Ordinance made to enjoyn it, ſuch would not bind, being againſt the Apoſtles expreſſe prohibition, back'd with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the very reaſon of Goverment, as ſhall be ſhewen in this following Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Be they who they will that preſent you with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent dangers, and work upon your fears, that tell you of Fundamentall Lawes, and give you rules of policy to captivate your reaſon; when all that's done, it is the Divine that muſt ſettle the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which will not be quiet, if in yeilding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any Law or Ordinance, it comes to a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that ſuch an Ordinance of man entrencheth upon the word of God.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you (for I ſuppoſe you follow this way <hi>in the ſimplicity of your hearts)</hi> how you are wrought upon by them that miſ-leade you. You are dealt with according to your generall deſire of the continuance of true Religion and the Subjects Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, not according to the particular grounds of ſafety, which conſcience doth require: You are told, the Goſpel and your Liberties, and all you have, are in moſt imminent danger, and without taking Arms for the defence, irrecoverably loſt; and that this is lawfull by the Fundamentals of this Kingdom: You muſt take all this upon truſt, without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb facs="tcp:42062:4"/>
and particular warrant, to rule and ſecure your Conſcience againſt the expreſſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle forbidding reſiſtance, Rom. 13.</p>
            <p>You profeſſe your ſelves enemies to Popery, and good reaſon for it, but why ſhould you therfore be enemies to your King that declares againſt it too. I would you could obſerve how, under pretence of keeping out Popery, you are led in this way of r<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance by the like ſteps that brought Popery in. For examine your hearts and try if the name of <hi>Parliament</hi> (which is of honourable eſteem with all) be not raiſed to the like exceſſe of credit with you, as the name of the <hi>Church</hi> is with the Papiſts; if you have not within you a ſilent thought of infallibility in that great Councel, and ſo with an implicit faith are ready to receive and maintaine what ever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded there; if you be not drawn to believe your Prince is minded to overthrow Religion, and upon ſuch a ſuppoſall or beleif (according to the very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Jeſuitical practiſes) to take up Arms againſt him.</p>
            <p>If you do not reſt ſatisfied with your generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a good end, that is, the defence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not examining the meanes, you now uſe, to compaſſe that end; like thoſe that for the advancing of the Catholick cauſe, as they call it, attempt any thing however unjuſt, even to the deſtruction of Kings, that are ſet over them; this blindneſſe is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, and practice Jeſuiticall. Laſtly, examine your hearts, if you be not confirmed in your way by the number of your Profeſſour, like as they are by the Univerſality of their Church, reſting upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of men, not trying the Cauſe it ſelfe by the
<pb facs="tcp:42062:4"/>
touchſtone of divine Scripture and rectified Reaſon. I know it prevails with many thouſands of you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſee, as you thinke, and uſe to ſay, All good people that have ſenſe of Religion, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their wayes, do go along with you, and you cannot beleive that God would ſuffer them to be ſo generally deluded; let me tell you, you do hereby very uncharitably conclude upon all thoſe that run not with you to the like exceſſe, and I may ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of Charitie, they that appear with you in the Cauſe, would not all be found ſuch, as you conceive them to be, if they were examined by the true marks of Chriſtian profeſſion, that is, by the true doctrine of faith, by their charitie, honeſtie, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, meekneſſe of Spirit, and the like; without which your Religion is vain, whatever your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, or performances of duties be; the Phariſees righteouſneſſe will exceed yours, and his frequency and length of prayer will be as ſure a mark as yours; nay the Anabaptiſt, at this day will out-do you in any of your forms of godlineſſe. I do not ſpeake this againſt the frequent and ſincere performance of holy duties: God forbid I ſhould. Nor do I ſpeak it of you all: I know there are many good and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious men that go your way in the ſimplicitie of their hearts, as thoſe did that followed Abſolom; whom the juſt God ſuffers hitherto to be deceived, that even by their example this power of Reſiſtance may gather ſtrength to the juſt puniſhment of this ſinfull land, and that they themſelves when their eyes ſhall be opened (which, I hope, will be ere long) may ſee their own weakneſſe, and be ſo much more humbled for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42062:5"/>
In the meane time you are according to the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a Popiſh way in all the former reſpects, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on againſt all rule of Conſcience; for you have neither certain knowledge of your Princes heart, to reſolve for reſiſtance upon a ſuppoſall of ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in him; nor have you any certain rule to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the lawfulneſſe of reſiſting upon ſuch ſuppoſall, and to ſecure you againſt the Apoſtles prohibition, and damnation laid upon it; nor have you any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity, in concluding ſuch intentions in your Prince againſt His deepeſt Proteſtations made in ſuch times of His diſtreſſe, and without that, all is nothing, though you lay down, as you think, your life for Religion. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> How much ſafer would it be for  you to be guided by the ſure Rules of Conſcience, and (if it ſhould pleaſe God to bring upon you what you fear) to ſuffer unjuſtly, then in the unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prevention of it to do unjuſtly.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe ſhall you have this Treatiſe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you for the direction of your Conſciences. If you think it ſtrikes too boldly upon any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Parliament, I deſire yours and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable interpretation, fain would I ſilence every thought and word that may ſeem to reflect upon that high Court; but what is neceſſary, I muſt ſpeak for truth and conſcience ſake, from which neither King nor Parliament ſhould make us ſwerve. We are taught that Kings muſt not be flattered; and the people ought to learn, that Parliamens muſt not be Idolized: that has been often charged as a fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Clergy, and This I fear is that ſinne of the People, which, together with the licentiouſneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged back again to them, ha's moved God to blow
<pb facs="tcp:42062:5"/>
upon that wiſh'd for fruit we might have reaped by this ſo deſired a Parliament. For when I ſee Man is more ſenſible of every breach of his own rights and priviledges, then of thoſe unparallel'd breaches ſo frequently made upon Gods publike Worſhip, I cannot but think the Lord will require it of this Land; and when I ſee right and juſt ſubverted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and liberty expoſed to the will and power of every one that is pleaſed to conceive his Neighbour a Malignant, and able to make him ſo by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his. Goods and Perſon, I cannot but complain with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The foundations of the Earth are out of courſe;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 82,</note> and appeal to Heaven, <hi>Ariſe O God, judge thou the Earth.</hi> And I truſt, that albeit this Spirit of ſeduction may prevaile a while, and this way of reſiſtance proſper, for the great, but juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of this ſinfull Land, the Lord will look downe from Heaven, and make Truth and Peace again to flouriſh out of the Earth, will look upon the Face of His Anointed, and by this Affliction, as by <hi>a loving correction make him great.</hi>

That all are forbidden to reſiſt, even the Senate, which by the fundamentalls of that State might challenge as much as our great Councell can. That prohibition concerns all times; and was good, not onely in that State, becauſe they were abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches, but in all States becauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Order which ſhould be in all, and was good not onely againſt the Chriſtians, becauſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was enected againſt by Law, but alſo againſt the Senate and People, though they were enſlaved.</item>

Of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls, their ground-work according to the pleaders for reſiſtance, is the originall of Power from the People, and their re-aſſuming it, when the Prince will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his truſt. The Power it ſelfe, (diſtinguiſhed from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning of the Perſon, and the Qualification of it in

Where ſhewen, that it is not ſo much as they themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, who plead for it; either for the generall and unanimous conſent of the Kingdome; for it was not ſo agreed upon: or for the defenſive way of it; becauſe the King is upon the defenſive, For He was not firſt in Arms, and the Contentiom muſt needs appeare to be for ſomething the King hath right to hold, or is bound by oath to maintain. Alſo becauſe to any Mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it will appeare to he an oppugnation, rather then a reſiſtance or meere defence.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Sect. VII.</hi> The caſe is not in being. No Conſcience can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the King to be, what they would have him ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: becauſe the jealouſies are groundleſſe. The King
<pb facs="tcp:42062:7"/>
                  <hi>hath done ſufficient to clear them, by Promiſes, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, acts of Grace. And Conſcience if it hold the rule of Charity, will not againſt all thoſe conclude contrary intentions in him, upon them to ground reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but will, if it will not not be partiall, judge the King hath offered ſuch reaſonable meanes of ſecuritie to this State as ought to have been apprehended, rather then this Kingdom embroyled in a Civil war, and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land neglected. Laſtly, a Conſcience that concludes for reſiſtance, wants the perſwaſion of faith, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity in an high meaſure, and cannot appeare ſafely at Gods tribunall.</hi>

            <p>LAmentable are the diſtractions of this Kingdome, and the more, becauſe they gather ſtrength from the name and authority of (that, which as it is of high eſteeme with all, ſo ſhould it be a remedy to all theſe our diſtempers) a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and from the pretended defence of thoſe things that are moſt dear unto us, Religion, Liberties, Laws. Whereupon ſo many good people, that have come to a ſenſe of Religion and godlineſſe, are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably carried away by a ſtrange implicit faith to beleive, that whatſoever is ſaid or done in the name of a Parliament, and in the pretended defence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Liberties, Laws, to be infallibly true, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together juſt.</p>

               <p>COnſcience in reſolving upon a queſtion, firſt layes down the Propoſition or Principle or Ground, on which it goes; then it aſſumes or applyes to the preſent caſe; then it concludes and reſolves: as in this queſtion, affirmatively for Reſiſtance, thus, Subjects in ſuch a caſe may arm and reſiſt: But that caſe is now come: Therefore now they may and doe juſtly reſiſt.</p>
               <p>Or negatively againſt Reſiſtance, either by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principle: Subjects may not in ſuch a Caſe arm and reſiſt, therfore now they do not juſtly reſiſt. Or by admitting the Principle and denying the Caſe, Subjects in ſuch a caſe may arm and reſiſt. But that caſe is not now. Therefore now they do not juſtly arm and reſiſt.</p>
               <p>What it is that Conſcience is here to admit or deny, and how it ought to conclude and reſolve, this enſuing Treatiſe will diſcover: which that it may more clearly appeare, we will premiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That in the Propoſition or Principle by the word <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> is meant, not a denying of obedience to the Princes command, but a riſing in arms, a forcible reſiſtance; this though clear enough in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42062:8"/>
queſtion, yet I thought fit to inſinuate, to take off that falſe imputation laid upon the Divines of this Kingdome, and, upon all thoſe that appeare for the King in this cauſe, that they endeavor to defend an abſolute power in him, and to raiſe him to an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way of government; This we are as much againſt on his part, as againſt Reſiſtance on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects part. For we may and ought to deny obedience to ſuch commands of the Prince, as are unlawfull by the Law of God, yea, by the eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land: For in theſe we have his will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent given upon good advice, and to obey him againſt the Laws were to obey him againſt himſelfe, his ſudden will againſt his deliberate will; but a far other matter it is to reſiſt by power of arms, as is in the queſtion implyed, and as we ſee at this day to our aſtoniſhment, firſt the power of arms taken from the Prince by ſetting up the <hi>Militia,</hi> then that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er uſed againſt him by an army in the field.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt conſider, that they which pleade for Reſiſtance in ſuch a caſe as is ſuppoſed, do grant it muſt be concluded upon, <hi>Omnibus ordinibus regni conſentientibus,</hi> that is, with the generall and unanimous conſent of the Members of the two Houſes, the repreſentative body of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: alſo they yeild it muſt be onely <hi>Legitima de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſio,</hi> a meer defenſive reſiſtance; and this alſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt take notice of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is conſiderable, that in the ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or caſe it is likewiſe granted by them, that the Prince muſt firſt be ſo and ſo diſpoſed, and bent to overthrow Religion, Liberties, Laws, and will not diſcharge his truſt for the maintaining of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42062:9"/>
ſuch a Reſiſtance can be pretented to. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the queſtion is, and muſt be ſo put now, as that it ſeems to ſtraiten the Caſe, and make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſuppoſall of the people; yet it ſo much the more enlarges the falſhod of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for it plainly ſpeaks thus; If ſubjects beleive or verily ſuppoſe their Prince will change Religion they may riſe in arms; whereas all that have pleaded for Reſiſtance in caſe of Religion, did ſuppoſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion enjoyned upon the ſubject firſt. We will therefore endeavour to cleare all for the reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Conſcience in theſe three generalls.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That no Conſcience upon ſuch a caſe as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed can find clear ground to reſt upon for ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance as is pretended to, but according to the rules of Conſcience <hi>What is not of faith is ſinne:</hi> and, <hi>In doubtfull things the ſafer way is to be choſen;</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it will find cauſe to forbeare and to ſuffer, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then reſiſt; <hi>doubtfull,</hi> I ſay, not that a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence truly informed will not clearly ſee the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of this Reſiſtance, but becauſe no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can be truly perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of it, and ſo that Conſcience that reſolves for it, muſt needs run doubtingly or blindly upon the work.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the reſiſtance now uſed and made againſt the Prince is not ſuch as they pretend to, either for that generall and unanimous conſent that ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede it, or that defenſive way that ſhould accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, according to their own grants that plead for it, and therefore Conſcience cannot admit ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance as is made now adayes.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If Conſcience could be perſwaded, that it is lawfull in ſuch a caſe to reſiſt, and that this riſing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42062:9"/>
in arms is ſuch a reſiſtance as they ſay may in ſuch a caſe be pretended to, yet can it never (if it be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know any thing) be truly perſwaded that ſuch a caſe is now come, that i<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, That the King refuſe to diſcharge his truſt, is bent to overthrow Religion, &amp;c, and therefore Conſcience cannot but reſolve this oppoſition and Reſiſtance to be unlawful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, and (according to the Apoſtle) damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that people, running into arm without ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warrant, commit murder if they ſhed blood in the purſuit of this Reſiſtance, and periſh in their own ſinne, if die in the cauſe.</p>

               <p>FIrſt then, that the Principle is untrue upon which they go that reſiſt, and that Conſcience cannot find clear ground to reſt upon for making reſiſtance: for it heares the Apoſtle expreſſely ſay, <hi>Whoſoever reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 2.</note> and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not  find any limitation in Scripture that will excuſe the Reſiſtance of theſe dayes.</p>
               <p>The exception or limitation that is made, is taken from the Perſons reſiſting, and the Cauſes of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, thus, They that are Private perſons and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon any cauſe receive damnation, but the States or repreſentative body of the whole people may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon ſuch or ſuch cauſes.</p>
               <p>But how will this ſatisfie Conſcience, when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinction or limitation made upon any place of Sripture, muſt have its ground in Scrpture; this has onely ſome examples in Scripture that come not home to the cauſe, and ſome appearances of Reaſon; which are eaſily refuted by clearer Scripture and Reaſon.</p>

The examples alledged are, I. The peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuing of Jonathan out of the hands of Saul. <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here the people drew not into arms of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,  but being their at Sauls command, did by a loving violence and importunitie hinder the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a particular and paſſionate unlawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>II. Davids reſiſting of Saul. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Davids guard that he had about him was onely to ſecure his perſon againſt the cut-throats of Saul, if ſent to take away his life. 2. It was a meere defence without all violence offered to Saul; therefore he ſtill gave place as Saul purſued, and did no act of hoſtility to him or any of his Army when they were in his power, 1. Sam. 26. But thirdly, becauſe they gather out of the 1. Sam. 23. 12. that David would have defended Keilah againſt Saul, if the inhabitants would have been faithfull to him, We ſay that's onely an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuppoſition, not fit to ground Conſcience in this great point of reſiſtance; alſo to this and all other Davids demeanours, in his ſtanding out againſt Saul, we ſay his example was extraordinary; for he was anointed and deſigned by the Lord to ſucceed Saul, and therefore he might uſe an extraordinary way of ſafeguarding his Perſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the cheif examples. They make uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the high Preiſts reſiſting the King in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">2. Chron. 26.</note> and Eliſha's ſhutting the doore againſt the Kings Meſſenger that came to take away his head; and the like; which ſpeake not ſo much as the two former, having no appearance of ſuch reſiſtance as is implyed in the queſtion.</p>

                  </gap> we anſwer. 1. That of the high Preiſt is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42062:10"/>
more pertinently applyed to the Popes power of excommunicating and depoſing Kings, then to this power of reſiſting now uſed; but truly to neither. For he did no more then what every Miniſter may and ought to do if a King ſhould attempt the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacrament; that is, to reprove him, to keepe the Elements from him. Ambroſe Biſhop of Milan withſtood the Emperour at the entrance of Gods houſe, not by Excommunication, much leſſe by force of Arms, but by letting him underſtand he was not fit for that place, there to be made partaker of the holy things, till he had repented of that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and bloudſhed at Theſſalonica. Upon which the Emperour withdrew.</p>
               <p>The Preiſts here are ſaid to thruſt him out of the Temple, but we muſt note Gods hand was firſt upon him ſmiting him with leproſie, and by that diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him of the Kingdome alſo. It is added in the Text, <hi>yea himſelfe alſo haſted to go out.</hi> But enough of this</p>
               <p>2. Eliſha's example ſpeakes very little. But let us thence take occaſion to ſay, That Perſonall defence is lawfull againſt the ſudden and illegall aſſaults of ſuch Meſſengers; yea of the Prince himſelfe thus far, towards his blow, to hold his hands, and the like: nor to endanger his perſon, not to return blows, no; for though it be naturall to defend a mans ſelfe, yet the whole Commonwealth is concerned in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as wee ſee in the Commonwealth of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, one particular nature will defend it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, but yeild to the univerſall.</p>
               <p>If this be drawn from Perſonall defence to the Publick <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">
                     <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42062:11"/>
the Argument thus; If the body naturall then the body politick may defend it ſelfe, if a private perſon much more the whole State may; and they do but ſhut the way up againſt the King that comes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Parliament, and take away their heads.</p>
               <p>We anſw: As the naturall body defends it ſelf againſt an outward force, but ſtrives not by a ſchiſme or contention within it ſelfe; ſo may the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick againſt an outward power, but not as now by one part of it ſet againſt the Head and another part of the ſame body; for that tends to the diſſolution of the whole. Again: Perſonall defence may be without all offence, and does not ſtrike at the order and power that is over us, as generall reſiſtance by Arms doth, which cannot be without many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt violences, and does immediately ſtrike at that order which is the life of a Commonwealth. And this makes a large difference twixt Eliſha's ſhutting the doore againſt this Meſſenger, and their ſhutting up the way againſt the King by armed men; nor can they conclude upon ſuch an intention in the Kings heart without the ſpirit of Eliſha. He profeſſeth he intends no violence to his Parliament nor has be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the head of any of theirs that have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his power, nor does deſire any other puniſhment inflicted upon any that do oppoſe him, then what a Legall triall ſhall adjudge them to, which no good Subject ought to decline.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee how Scripture excludes this, and all other exceptions, giving no allowance to reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in regard of Perſons or Cauſes, or other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes, and this not onely by Examples, but by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Concluſions, Reſolutions, which are more ſafe.</p>

Firſt, we have the two hundred and fifty Princes of the Congregation, gathering the people againſt Moſes and Aaron, Numb. 16. 3. and periſhing in their ſinne. If it be replyed, the Perſons indeed were publicke, but there was no cauſe for it; Moſes and Aaron did not deſerve it. I anſwer, but the other ſuppoſed, they did, and that is now enough, it ſeems, to make people not onely ſay to their Prince, <hi>You take too much upon you,</hi> but therfore to riſe in arms alſo, which I hope will appeare to be without cauſe too in the end of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſee for the cauſe of Reſiſtance, 1. Sam. 8. 11. there the people are let to underſtand how they ſhould be oppreſſed under Kings, yet all that violence and injuſtice that ſhould be done unto them is no juſt cauſe of reſiſtance, for they have no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy left them but crying to the Lord, v. 18.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we have not onely Example, but Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Concluſion our of Scripture, The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not be gathered together either for Civill aſſemblies, or for war, but by his command that had the power of the Trumpet, that is, the ſupreme as Moſes was, Numb. 10.</p>
               <p>Alſo when David had Saul and his army in his power, he reſolves the matter thus, <hi>Who can ſtretch out his hand againſt the Lords annointed and be guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> 1. Sam. 26, 9. If replyed, now they intend not hurt to the Kings perſon; yet might nor they as well have hurt his perſon in the day of battell, as any of them that were ſwept away from about him by the furie of the Ordinance, which puts no difference 'twixt Kings and common ſouldiers?</p>
               <p>This alſo I muſt obſerve concerning this point of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42062:12"/>
Reſiſtance, out of the Old Teſtament (for from thence have they all their ſeeming inſtances) That it is a marvellous thing, that among ſo many Prophets reprehending the Kings of Iſrael and Judah for Idolatrie, cruelty, oppreſſion, none ſhould call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Elders of the people for this duty of Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, that place of the Apoſtle, Rom. 13. at firſt mentioned, does above all give us a cleare reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution upon the point, which now I ſhall free from all exceptions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I may ſuppoſe, that the King is the <hi>Supreme,</hi> as S. Peter calls him; or <hi>the higher power,</hi> as S. Paul here, though it be by ſome now put to the queſtion, as one abſurdity commonly begets another to defend it; but I prove it. S. Peters diſtinction comprehends all that are in authoritie, <hi>The King as ſupreme, and thoſe that are ſent by him,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 12, in which latter rank are the two Houſes of Parliament, being ſent by him, or ſent for by him, and by his Writ ſitting there. Alſo by the Oath of Supremacy it is acknowledged, That there is no power above him without or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Realm; and that he is in all Cauſes and over all Perſons Supreme. Alſo acknowledged by the Petitions of the two Houſes addreſſed unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, wherein they ſtile themſelves <hi>His loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> But enough of this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the text of the Apoſtle, All perſons under the higher Power are expreſſely forbidden to reſiſt. For <hi>whoſoever,</hi> in the ſecond verſe, muſt be as large as the <hi>every ſoul</hi> in the firſt, and the reſiſtance forbidden here concerns all, upon whom the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is injoyned there, or elſe we could not m<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

theſe Univerſals good againſt the Papiſts, exempting the Pope and Clergy from the ſubjection.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in thoſe dayes there was a ſtanding and continuall great Senate, which not long before had the ſupreme power in the Romane State, and might challenge more by the Fundamentalls of that State, then our great Counſell (I think) will, or can. But now the Emperour being <hi>Supreme,</hi> as S. Peter calls him; or the <hi>higher power,</hi> as S. Paul here, there is no power of reſiſtance left to any that are under him, by the Apoſtle. This for the perſons that ſhould reſiſt, all are forbidden. Now conſider the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, was there ever more cauſe of reſiſtence then in thoſe dayes? were not the Kings then not onely conceived to be inclined ſo and ſo, but even actually were enemies to Religion, had overthrown Laws and Liberties? and therefore if any ſhould from the Apoſtles reaſons that he gives againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in the 3, 4, 5, verſes, <hi>(For rulers are not a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to good works but evil, and he is the miniſter of God to thee for good)</hi> reply, That Rulers ſo long as they are not a terrour to the good, but miniſter for our good, are not to be reſiſted: the conſideration of thoſe times leaves no place for ſuch exception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Powers then (which the Apoſtle forbids to reſiſt) were nothing ſo, but ſubverters of that which was good and juſt.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, that prohibition was tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and fit for thoſe times, as it is ſaid by ſome. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. This is a new exception never heard of (I think) but in theſe times. 2. It is groundleſſe, and againſt the Text, for the reaſons of the prohibition in the 3, 4, 5, 6, verſes, are perpetuall, from that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

that good, for which the Powers are ordained of God, which will be of force as long as there is government, and will alwayes be reaſons againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; becauſe reſiſtence (though it be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt abuſed Powers as then they were) doth tend to the diſſolution of that order, for which the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it ſelfe is ſet up of God By which alſo that other diſtinction of theirs is made void, when as they reply, as they think, acutely, That they reſiſt not the power, but the abuſe of the power</p>
               <p>It is alſo anſwered by ſome, that the Emperours then were abſolute Monarchs, and therefore not to be reſiſted. I anſwer: They did indeed rule abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and arbitrarily, which ſhould have according to the principles of theſe dayes been a ſtronger mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to reſiſt. But how did they make themſelves of Subjects ſuch abſolute Monarchs; was it not by force and change of the government, and was not the right of the people and Senate (according to the Principles of theſe dayes) good againſt them with as much or more reaſon, then the right of the people of this Land is againſt the ſucceſſion of this Crown deſcending by three Conqueſts? And this I ſpeak not to win an Arbitrary power or ſuch as Conquerours uſe, unto this Crown, but onely to ſhew that reſiſtence can be no more made againſt the Kings of England, then it could againſt thoſe Emperours. Nay, with leſſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt them, then theſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is replyed, That Chriſtian Religion was then enacted againſt by Law; but the Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for is eſtabliſhed by Law. I anſwer: But is the Religion eſtabliſhed denied to any that now fight for it? Shall the Apoſtles prohibition be good
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42062:13"/>
againſt Chriſtians in the behalfe of actuall Tyrants perſecuting that Religion, and not againſt Subjects freely enjoying the Religion eſtabliſhed? Or may Proteſtants upon a jealouſie reſiſt a Proteſtant King profeſſing the ſame Religion, and promiſing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it entire to them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The prohibition does not onely concern Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but all the people under thoſe Emperours, and not onely Religion was perſecuted, but Liberties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo loſt, the people and Senate were enſlaved by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, and Laws then inforced upon them, and they (according to the principles of theſe dayes) might reſiſt, notwithſtanding the Apoſtles prohibition, and the Laws then forced upon them; or elſe the State, as they uſually ſay, had not meanes to provide for its ſafetie. Thus one phanſie of theirs thwarts another, becauſe both are groundleſſe. But more anon of thoſe meanes of ſafety they ſuppoſe to be in every State, by the power of Reſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of Scripture, which is moſt powerfull againſt Reſiſtence, in the prohibition and the reaſons of it, by which Conſcience will clearly ſee, it can have no warrant from Scripture for Reſiſtence. Now let us try what Reaſon can enforce.</p>

               <p>For proving this power of reſiſtence, there is much ſpeech uſed about the Fundamentalls of this government, which becauſe they lie low and unſeen by vulgar eyes, being not written Laws, the people are eaſily made to beleeve they are ſuch as they (that have power to build new Laws) upon them) ſay they are.

               <p>Well then, they that plead for Power of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the people, lay the firſt ground-work of their Fundamentalls thus: Power is originally in and from the people, and if when by election they have intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Prince with the Power, he will not diſcharge his truſt, then it falls to the people; or, as in this Kingdome to the two Houſes of Parliament (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative body of the people) to ſee to it; they may reaſſume the power.</p>
               <p>This is the bottom of their Fundamentalls as they are now diſcovered to the people. But here we may take notice by the way, that however the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls of this Government are much talked of, this is according to them the Fundamentall in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Governments; for they ſay power was every where from the people at firſt, and ſo this will ſerve no more for the power of reſiſtance in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, then in France, or Turkey: but if this muſt be a Fundamentall, it is ſuch an one as upon it this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment cannot be built, but Confuſion and Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy may readily be raiſed; as ſhall appeare by the clearing of theſe two particulars, Whether the Power be ſo originally and chiefly from the people as they would have it; then Whether they may upon ſuch cauſe, reaſſume that power.</p>

offices in them, which are from the invention of man; it does not make the power it ſelf the creation of man, which is the conſtitution and ordinance of God; and men are not onely naturally bent to ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo are bound as they are reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſet up and live under government as under an order of that providence by which the World is governed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He is called the <hi>Miniſter of God,</hi> v. 4. but if ſo from the People and no otherwiſe from God then they would have him, he ſhould be <hi>Miniſter Populi</hi> rather; he is indeed their Miniſter for their good, which makes the People to be the end of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning power, not the fountain and originall of it: therfore the neceſſity of ſubjection urged in the fifth verſe, ha's a double ground, <hi>The ordinance of God,</hi> whoſe miniſters Rulers are, ther's the fountain and originall of Power to govern; then <hi>the Peoples good,</hi> upon which Rulers ought to attend, that's an end of the Governing Power.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To the ſame purpoſe ſpeak thoſe other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>By me Kings reigne:</hi> and <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82. in relation to which our Saviour ſaith, Joh. 10. <hi>They are called Gods to whom the word of God came,</hi> that <hi>dixi,</hi> that <hi>word</hi> is the command, the iſſuing out as it were the commiſſion for the ſetting up of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning power among the people.</p>
               <p>Theſe places cannot be ſatisfied with that poore part, they on the other ſide leave to God in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of power for the governing of men, that is, to approve it when the People ha's created or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it. Indeed if we conſider the qualification of this governing power, and the manner of executing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42062:16"/>
it according to the ſeverall forms of government, we granted it before to be the invention of man, and when ſuch a qualification or form is orderly agreed upon, we ſay it ha's Gods permiſſive approbation</p>
               <p>And therefore the imputation is cauſeleſſe which the Pleaders on the other ſide do heedeleſſely and ignorantly lay upon us Divines; as if we cryed up Monarchy, and that onely government to be <hi>jure divino.</hi> For although Monarchy ha's this excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that the Government God ſet up over his people in the perſon of Moſes, the Judges, and the Kings, was Monarchicall, yet we confeſſe that neither that, nor Ariſtocracy, or any other form is <hi>jure divino;</hi> but we ſay the power it ſelf, or that ſufficiency of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to govern, which is in Monarchy or Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, abſtractly conſidered from the qualifications of either form, is an efflux or conſtitution ſubordinate to that providence, an ordinance of that <hi>Dixi,</hi> that ſilent <hi>Word</hi> by which the world was at firſt made, and is ſtill governed under God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as this appeares by the former places of Scripture, ſo it is alſo ſuitable to Reaſon: Becauſe God doth govern all creatures, Reaſonable as well as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, the inferiour or lower world he governs by the heavens or ſuperiour bodies, according to thoſe influences and powers he ha's put into them; and the reaſonable creatures, Men, he governs too by others ſet up in his ſtead over them; for which they are called <hi>Gods,</hi> becauſe in his ſtead over the people: and the powers are ſaid to pe <hi>'apo theou tetagmenai</hi> Rom. 13. 1. not only <hi>'apo theou,</hi> from God; but alſo as orders ranked under him too, ſubordinate to that providence by which all creatures are governed.</p>

Theſe his Miniſters he ſometimes deſigned imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by himſelfe, as Moſes, the Judges, Saul, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, &amp;c. Now he deſignes his Vicegerents on earth mediately, as by election of the people, by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or inheritance, by conqueſt, &amp;c.

               <p>NOw we come to the Forfeiture, as I may call it, of this Power. If the Prince, ſay they, will not diſcharge his truſt, then it falls to the people or the two Houſes (the repreſentative body of the people) to ſee to it, and reaſſume that Power, and thereby to reſiſt. This they conceive to follow upon the <hi>deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Power</hi> from the people by vertue of election and upon the <hi>ſtipulation or covenant</hi> of the Prince with the people, as alſo to be neceſſary in regard of thoſe <hi>meanes of ſafety,</hi> which every State ſhould have within it ſelfe. We will examine them in order, and ſhall find the Arguments inconſequent.</p>
               <p>Concerning the derivation of Power we anſwer? Firſt, if it be not from the people, as they will have it, and as before it was cleared, then can there be no reaſſuming of this Power by the People; that's plain by their own argument.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the people ſhould give the power ſo abſolutely as they would have it, leaving nothing to God in it but approbation, yet could they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42062:17"/>
have right to take that power away. For many things which are altogether in our diſpoſing before we part with them, are not afterward in our power to recall; eſpecially ſuch in which their redounds to God an intereſt by the donation, as in things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, though afterward they come to be abuſed. So although it were, as they would have it, that they give the power and God approves; yet becauſe the Lords hand alſo &amp; his oyl is upon the perſon elected to the Crown, and then he is the Lords anointed and the Miniſter of God, thoſe hands of the people which were uſed in lifting him up to the Crown, may not again be lifted up againſt him, either to take the Crown from his head, or the ſword out of his hand. This will not a true-informed Conſcience date to doe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, How ſhall the Conſcience be ſatisfied that this their argument, grounded upon election and the derivation of power from the people can have place in this Kingdome, when as the Crown not onely deſcends by inheritance, but alſo ha's ſo often been ſetled by Conqueſt in the lines of Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Danes, and Normans? In anſwer to this they looke beyond all theſe, and ſay, the right is ſtill good to the people by reaſon of their firſt election. I anſwer: So then that firſt election muſt be ſuppoſed here, and ſuppoſed good againſt all other titles, or elſe this power of reſiſtence falls to the ground. It is probable indeed that Kings at firſt were by choyce here as elſewhere; but can Conſcience reſt upon ſuch remote probabilities for reſiſtence, or think that firſt election will give it power againſt Princes that do not claime by it. We tell them the Romane
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42062:18"/>
Emperours were not to be reſiſted, Rom. 13. 2. They reply, as we had it above, that they were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchs. But how came they of Subjects to be abſolute Monarchs? was it any otherwiſe then by force and arms? the way that the Saxons, Danes, and Normans made themſelves Maſters of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was not the right of the people as good againſt them for the power of reſiſtence, by vertue of the firſt election, as well as of the people of this Land, againſt their Kings after ſo many Conqueſts? This I ſpeak not, as if the Kings of this Land might rule as Conquerors: God forbid. But to ſhew this ſlender plea of the firſt election can no more take place againſt the Kings of this Land, then it could againſt the Romane Monarchs, eſpecially according to their argument, that hold all power originally from the people, and that (as we obſerved above) to be the Fundamentall of all government. Therefore whether Kings were in this Land at firſt by election or no; we acknowledge what belongs to the duty of a Prince in doing juſtice and equitie: what Grants alſo, Laws, Priviledges have ſince thoſe Conqueſts been procured, or reſtored to the people: unto all thoſe the King is bound. But yet not bound under forfeiture of his power to the people: which now comes to be examined in that capitulation or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he is ſaid to enter with the people.</p>
               <p>In the next place therefore: That Capitulation or Covenant, and the Oath which the Prince takes to confirme what he promiſeth, are ſo alledged, as if the breach or non-performance on the Princes part were a forfeiture of his power. But we anſwer, The words <hi>capitulation</hi> or <hi>covenant</hi> are now much uſed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42062:18"/>
to make Men believe the Kings admittance to the Crown is altogether conditionall, as in the meerly elective Kingdomes of Polonia, Swedeland, &amp;c. whereas our King is King before he comes to the Coronation, which is ſooner or later at his pleaſure, but alwaies to be in due time, in regard of that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity His People receive by his taking the oath, and he again mutually from them, in which performance there is ſomething like a covenant, all but the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The King there promiſes and binds himſelf by oath to performance. Could they in this covenant ſhew us ſuch an agreement between the King and his People, that in caſe he will not diſcharge His truſt, then it ſhall be lawfull for the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Arms to reſiſt, and provide for the ſafety thereof, it were ſomething.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that ſo much is imployed in the firſt election. We anſwer: We examined that ſlender plea of the firſt election above, as it was thought to be a derivation of power. Now as it is thought to have a covenant in it: we ſay, That uſually in all Empires the higher we ariſe, the freer we find the Kings, and ſtill downwards the People have gained upon them: for at firſt when the People choſe their Rulers, they did as <hi>Juſtine</hi> in the beginning of his Hiſtory obſerves, reſigne themſelves to be governed by ſuch, of whoſe prudence and moderation they had experience; and then, <hi>Arbitria Principum pro le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus erant,</hi> the will and diſcretion of the Prince was Law unto the People; but Men were Men though in Gods place, and therefore for the reſtraint of that Power, with conſent of the Prince, ſuch Laws have been ſtill procured by the People as might make for their ſecurity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42062:19"/>
Now from a promiſe the King makes for doing Juſtice (the duty of every Prince) for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Priviledges, immunities, that have been granted or reſtored to the People, and for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of thoſe Laws that have been eſtabliſhed with the Princes conſent, and from that oath (by which for the greater ſecurity of the People he binds himſelf to the performance of the premiſes) to infer a great obligation lyeth upon him, is right: but to gather thence a forfeiture of his power upon the not performance, is a plain but dangerous incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Argument.</p>
               <p>And though ſuch Argument may ſeem to have ſome force in States meerly elective and pactionall, yet can it never be made to appear to any indifferent underſtanding, that the like muſt obtain in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And to this purpoſe Phil. Pareus excuſeth what his Father had written more harſhly upon the 13. to the Romans, in the point of Reſiſtence, that it was to be underſtood of elective and pactionall government, not to the prejudice of England, or ſuch Monarchies. For where the King, as it is ſaid, never dyes, where he is King before oath or corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where he is not admitted upon any ſuch capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation as gives any power to the People, or their repreſentative body, as is pretended to: Nay, where that body cannot meet but by the will of the Prince, and is diſſoluble at his pleaſure; that there, in ſuch a State, ſuch a power ſhould be pretended to, and uſed againſt the Prince as at this day, and that according to the fundamentalls of ſuch a State, can never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear reaſonable to any indifferent judgement, much leſſe ſatisfie Conſcience in the reſiſtence that is now made by ſuch a pretended power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42062:19"/>
What then ſhall we ſay? Is the King not bound to perform? Yes, by all means. Or ha's he not a limited power according to the Lawes? Yes. What then if he will take to himſelf more power, or not perform what he is bound to? Suppoſe that; (though thanks be to God we are not come to that.) Then may the Subjects uſe all fair means as are fit to uſe, cryes to God, petitions to the Prince, denials of obedience to his unlawfull commands, denials of ſubſidie, ayd, &amp;c. But are they left without all means to compell by force and reſiſtence? This however it may at firſt ſight ſeem unreaſonable to the people and very impolitick to the Stateſman, yet ha's Scripture forbidden it, as before was plainly ſhewed, and ſo doth Reaſon too, as will apeare in the examination of their laſt proofe they make for re-aſſuming this power and reſiſting, from that neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of means of ſafety, which every State is to have within it ſelf: Of which now.</p>
            </div>

               <p>IN the laſt place it is thus reaſoned, Were it not ſo that the two Houſes might take and uſe this power, the State ſhould not have means to provide for its own ſafety, when the King ſhall pleaſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert His Parliament, deny His conſent to their Bills, abuſe His power, &amp;c. So they.</p>
               <p>When right and Juſt will not defend a thing, then Neceſſity is uſually pleaded; as if, becauſe <hi>Salus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli</hi> in a good ſenſe is <hi>Suprema Lex,</hi> every thing muſt be honeſt which is <hi>Spartae <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile,</hi> imagined to conduce to the propoſed end.

               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:42062:20"/>
Firſt, They have many weapons ſharpened for this reſiſtence at the Philiſtins forge, arguments borrowed from the Romane ſchools, among them this is one, the very reaſon that is made for the Popes power of curbing or depoſing Kings in caſe of Hereſie. For if there be not that power in the Church, ſay they, then in caſe the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate will not diſcharge his truſt, the Church ha's not means for the maintenance of the Catholick faith and its own ſafety. Well, as we reply to them, the Church has means of preſerving the faith, ſuch as God ha's appointed, though not that of one Viſible head, which though at firſt ſeems plauſible, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Unity of faith, yet ha's experience ſhown it to be indeed the meanes to bring much miſchief upon the Church: So to the other we ſay, The State ha's meanes of preſervation ſuch as the Law ha's preſcibed, though not ſuch as are here pretented to in this power of reſiſtence; which though ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly plauſible, yet true Reaſon will conclude them dangerous, and at this day, God knows, we ſee it. Of this in the fourth anſwer more particularly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If every State ha's ſuch means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for its ſafety, What means of ſafety had the Chriſtian Religion under the Romane Emperours in and after the Apoſtles times? or the people then enſlaved, what means had they for their Liberties? had they this of reſiſtence? Tertullian, in his Apol. ſayes, the Chriſtians had number and force ſufficient to withſtand, but they had no warrant; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſſely forbids them and all other under the higher power, to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, as it was above touched, That
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42062:20"/>
things being ſo enacted by Law, it was not lawfull for them to reſiſt. I anſwer: But it is known that not onely thoſe Edicts which concerned Chriſtian Religion, but alſo all other that proceeded from thoſe Emperours and enſlaved the people, were meerly arbitrary and enforced upon the Senate, and that the Senate did not diſcharge their truſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to them, and therefore according to the former poſition the people might reſiſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Apoſtles prohibition, or elſe no means of ſafety left in that State.</p>
               <p>So would it be in this State, if at any time a King that would rule arbitrarily, as thoſe Emperours did, ſhould by ſome meanes or other work out of the two Houſes the better affected, and by the Conſent of the Major part of them that remaine, compaſſe his deſires; might the people then reſiſt? The Apoſtle forbids it to them as well as to the Romans in ſuch a caſe: if ſo, where are theſe means of ſafety by this power of reſiſtance? Or are theſe means of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty extinct in the Conſent of the Senate or the two Houſes? No, the people will tell them they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge not their truſt, they choſe them not to betray them, enſlave them; but according to the principles now taught them, they might lay hold upon this power of reſiſtence; for their repreſentative body claims it by them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we anſwer, We cannot expect abſolute means of ſafety and ſecuritie in a State, but ſuch as are reaſonable; and ſuch are provided, eſpecially in the fundamentalls of this Government, by that excellent temper of the three eſtates in Parliament there being a power of denying in each of them, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42062:21"/>
no power of enacting in one or two of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the third; which as it is for the ſecuritie of the Commonwealth (for what might follow if the King and Lords without the Commons, or theſe and the Lords without the King, might determine, the evills of theſe dayes do ſhew) ſo is this power of denying, for the ſecurity of each State againſt other, of the Commons againſt the King and Lords, of the Lords againſt them: and muſt the King truſt onely, and not be truſted? Muſt not he alſo have his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie againſt the other, which he cannot have but by Power of denying? This is that Temper of the three Eſtates in Parliament, the due obſerving whereof, in the moderate uſe of this power of denying, is the reaſonable means of this States ſafety: but now not onely the name of Parliament, which implyes the three Eſtates, is reſtrained uſually to the two Houſes, but alſo that Temper is diſſolved. I need not ſpeak it, the diſtractions and convulſions of the whole Commonwealth, as the diſtempers in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, do ſufficiently ſhew ſuch a diſſolution, and what's the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>If it be replyed, as it is, for the reaſonableneſſe of theſe meanes of ſafety through that Power of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and the final truſt repoſed in the repreſentative body of the people, That many ſee more then one and more ſafety in the judgement of many then of one. <hi>Anſw.</hi> True. But 1. Conſcience might here demand for its ſatisfaction, Why ſhovld an hundred in the Houſe of Commons ſee more then three hundred; or twenty in the Lords Houſe, more then ſixty that are of indiffereent judgement and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:42062:21"/>
2. Reaſon doth ſuppoſe, That the Prince, though one, ſees with the eyes of many, yea with their eyes who are of different judgement from him, for which his. Houſes of Parliament are his great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to preſent to his eyes the differences of things with the reaſons of them; and albeit he ſometimes diſſents from the Major or Prevailing part, becauſe he is convinced in his own judgement they ſeek themſelves nor his or the Publike good, or for other reaſons that may perſwade him againſt their Vote, yet have all times thought good to have Kings, and to reduce the judgement of many unto one. The Government which God made choice of to ſet up among his people was Monarchicall ſtill; firſt in Moſes, then in the Judges, then in the Kings; yea generally all Authors yeild, and experience ha's taught it, That Monarchy is a better government then Ariſtocracy, becauſe the Tyranny and Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of one, ſometime happening in a Monarchy is nothing ſo dangerous as Oligarchy, Faction, and Diviſion uſually incident to Ariſtocracy or the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by many equalls. Again, as all times have thought it reaſonable to have Monarchy, which ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles the chief power and finall judgement in One; ſo will there be alwayes ſufficient reaſon to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the King from a wilfull deniall of his Conſent to the free and unanimous Vote of his Houſes: he cannot but ſee there will alwayes be ſome neceſſary good accrewing to him by his Parliament, that will keep him in all reaſon from doing ſo: and no caſes can be put or inconveniences feared upon his Power of denying, but greater and more eminent will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare upon his not having it, as ha's been inſinuated, and now do follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42062:22"/>
Fourthly therefore and laſtly we anſwer. Such power of reſiſtence would be no fit means of ſafety to a State, but prove a remedy worſe then the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. This is very plain by the drift of the Apoſtles reaſon which he gave againſt reſiſtence, in the 3, 4, 5, 6. v. of the 13. to the Rom. in which we may conſider, that, although the Powers then were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unjuſt, tyrannicall, ſubverters of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing anſwerable to the end for which the Governing Power is ordained, yet doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle draw his reaſons againſt the reſiſting of them, from that good, that juſtice, that order for which God hath ſet up the higher Powers; to inſinuate, that the reſiſting of the higher Powers, even when they are ſo, does tend to the overthrow of that order which is the life of a Commonwealth; and this not onely becauſe there is ſtill order under tyranny, but chiefly becauſe, if it were good and lawfull to reſiſt the power, when abuſed, it would open a way to the people upon the like pretences to reſiſt and overthrow even Powers duely adminiſtred for the executing of wrath upon them that do evill.</p>
               <p>I enter this dicourſe, not to caſt the leaſt blemiſh upon Parliaments (which are an onely remedy for diſtempers of the Kingdome) not to reflect upon the intentions of thoſe that are yet reſident in that high Court, (unto God the judge of all, they ſtand or fall) not to raiſe jealouſies, but to ſettle Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and in the way of reaſoning to ſhew according to the Apoſtles reaſons what dangers and evills may enſue upon this power of reſiſtence.</p>
               <p>For firſt of all, This power of reſiſtence, if admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and purſued may proceed to a change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42062:22"/>
the Principles that now are gone upon, and have carried it ſo farre as we ſee at this day, may alſo lead it on to that greateſt of evils: And I have heard and ſeen it defended by the example of the Low-countreys; how they excuſe it throughly, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine not, but this I am ſure they can ſay, That their Prince, ſucceeding in the right of the Duke of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie was admitted upon other conditions then the Kings of England are: alſo that a contrary religion was enforced upon them by a terrible Inquiſition, whereas they that do reſiſt the higher. Powers here, do freely enjoy their religion, and have the Princes promiſe and proteſtation for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Power of reſiſtence when uſed, and purſued, is accompanied with the evils of Civil warre: Former times ſhew it, and how little was gained by it beſide the expence of bloud; as when all was referred to the rule and diſpoſing of the 12 Peeres, how long laſted it? what ſecurity had the State by it? and at this day we feel and groan under the evils brought upon us through this power of reſiſtence, the Law ſilenced, the Property and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the ſubject every where invaded; and the Lord knows when or how we ſhall be reſtored to them, or better ſecured in them by this way</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We ſee the danger, (if as it is now ſaid, for the juſtifying of this power of reſiſtence, The King will not diſcharge his truſt, and therefore it fals to the repreſentative body of the people to ſee to it, ſo) the People being diſcontented, and having gotten power ſhall ſay, The Members of the two Houſes do not diſcharge the truſt committed to them, they do not that for which they were choſen
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42062:23"/>
and ſent for, then may the multitude by this rule and principle now taught them, take the Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it being claimed by them, and ſay to them as Numb. 16. <hi>Ye take too much upon you,</hi> or as Cade, and Tylar, boaſt themſelves Reformers of the Common-wealth, overthrow King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fill all with rapine and confuſion, draw all to a Folkmoot, and make every Shire a ſeverall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Theſe are Dangers and Evils not conceived in the phanſie, but ſuch as reaſon tells us may follow, and experience hath often, and this day doth ſhew us, do ariſe upon this Power of reſiſtence, and for the preventing of which, the Apoſtle gave his reaſons againſt reſiſting even of abuſed powers, as we heard above.</p>
               <p>Laſtly therefore, Seeing ſome muſt be truſted in every State, 'tis reaſon the higheſt and finall truſt ſhould be in the higher or ſupreme Power, with whom next to himſelf God hath intruſted the whole Kingdom, all other that have power and truſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it under him as ſent by him; Good reaſon I ſay that the ſupreme Power (which is worth 10000 of the Subjects) ſhould have the beſt ſecurity on its ſide, for as much as Order, the life of a Commonwealth, is ſo beſt preſerved, and not ſo endangered by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny as by factions, diviſion, tumults, power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence on the Subjects part, and this is according to the drift of the Apoſtles reaſons againſt reſiſtence, as before they were laid down.</p>
               <p>Well, now unto all that hath hitherto been ſaid from Scripture and Reaſon, let Conſcience adde the oath of Supremacy and Allegiance, alſo the late
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42062:23"/>
Proteſtation, and conſider what duty lyes upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject by the former to defend the Kings perſon and Right againſt what Power ſoever, and how by the latter he hath proteſted and undertaken before Almighty God in the firſt place to defend the ſame; and then what can Conſcience conclude from the Premiſes? that the Prince hath his Power for the good of his people? true, but that Power cannot be prevalent for the good and protection of his people unleſſe it be preferved to him intire, unleſſe he hath the Power of Deniall, and the chief command of Arms; or that the Prince hath a limited Power, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws eſtabliſhed? true, but if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be perſwaded he does not hold himſelfe within thoſe bounds ſo fixed, can it be perſwaded alſo that the people may reaſſume that Power they never had? or take that ſword out of his hand that God hath put into it? No, Conſcience will look at that Power as the Ordinance of God, and the abuſe of that Power as a judgement and ſcourge of God upon the people, and will uſe not Arms to reſiſt the Ordinance under pretence of reſiſting the abuſe, but cryes and prayers to God, petitions to the Prince, denialls of obedience to his unjuſt commands, denialls of ſubſides, aids, and all faire means that are fit for Subjects to uſe, and when done all, if not ſucceed, will rather ſuffer then reſiſt: ſo would a truly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience reſolve, were the Prince indeed what he is ſuppoſed to be, and did he do indeed as the people are made to fear and believe he will do.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have been in the examination of the Principle upon which they go that plead for reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, and we have found both Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42062:24"/>
ſpeak plainly againſt the reſiſting even of abuſed Powers, profeſſed enemies to Religion, actuall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of the Peoples Liberties, how much more againſt the reſiſting of a Prince that profeſſeth the ſame Religion which we freely enjoy, promiſeth the maintaining of that and our Liberties, onely upon a ſuppoſall He will not ſtand to His word, will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all.</p>
               <p>This however it may ſeem leſſe reaſonable to the Statiſt in the way of Policie, permitting as little as he can to the goodneſſe of the Prince, or the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God for the ſafety of the State; yet ought it to ſatisfie a Chriſtian in the way of Conſcience, which when it comes to a deſire of being ſafe, will not reſt till it have a ſure ground, which here it hath againſt reſiſtence laid downe by Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons even the Apoſtles reaſons ſo powerfull againſt reſiſtence.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of all is this; Conſcience hears the Apoſtle expreſſely forbid all under the higher Power to reſiſt, finds no other clear Scripture to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, finds that the limitations given will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with it, for the reaſons of them (that are drawn from the election of the People, and the Covenant ſuppoſed therein, from the neceſſity of means of ſafety in every State to provide for it ſelf) were as ſtrong in the Romane State as any; nay, are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe that urge them, to be the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of every State; and ſo reſiſtence is forbidden as well here, as there in the Romane State, which is alſo cleared by the Apoſtles reaſons, ſhewing the Power of reſiſtence cannot be the meane of ſafety, but ſtrikes at Order and Power it ſelf, though made
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42062:24"/>
againſt tyrannicall and abuſed Powers, as before often inſinuated. Therefore Conſcience will not dare to go againſt the Apoſtles expreſſe prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leſt it fall into the judgement denounced by him.</p>
               <p>But if there ſhall be any Conſcience as ſtrongly carried away with the name of a Parliament, as the Papiſts are with the name of the Church, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion may be defended any way, &amp; that upon ſuppoſall that their Prince is minded to change it, (which is another humour of Popery) will not be perſwaded that the reſiſtence made upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuppoſall is unlawfull, againſt Gods Word, and reaſon; I am ſure ſuch a Conſcience cannot be truly perſwaded it is lawfull, but muſt want that clear ground it ought to have, eſpecially in a matter ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt the Apoſtle, and of ſuch high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment as damnation; muſt needs runne blindly, and headlong by a ſtrange implicit Faith upon ſo great a hazard.</p>

               <p>NOw we come to the Application of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to the preſent, where we muſt enquire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſecond and third Generalls, whether the reſiſtence now made be ſuch as is pretended to by them in ſuch a caſe as they ſuppoſed, and then whether Conſcience can be truely perſwaded the King is ſuch and ſo minded as in the caſe He is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be.</p>
               <p>The chief conſiderations of theſe two Generalls, are matters of fact; The principle was examined by Scripture and Reaſon, theſe admit the Judgement of ſenſe, and are cleared by what we heare and ſee;

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:42062:26"/>
which Judgement of ſenſe is not ſo eaſily captivated by an implicit Faith as that of Reaſon is; inſomuch as Conſcience here cannot be ſo blinded but it may ſee, that (were the principall good on which they reſt, yet) this reſiſtence which they make, is not ſuch as they pretend to, and that this King, whom they reſiſt; is not ſuch as in the caſe they ſuppoſed him to be, not ſuch as ought to be reſiſted according to their own grants.</p>
               <p>The ſecond generall was, That the Reſiſtence now made is not ſuch as is pretended to by them that plead for it, and therefore Conſcience cannot be truly perſwaded it may lawfully bear part in it, or aſſiſt them that in the purſuit of it pretend one thing and do another.</p>
               <p>It was premiſed at the beginning that ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence ſhould be <hi>omnibus ordinibus regni conſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entibus;</hi> agreed upon and undertaken by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and unanimous conſent of the whole State, and that it ſhould be onely <hi>Legitima defenſio,</hi> a meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive reſiſtence; and theſe laid down, not that I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit reſiſtence however conditioned (for all that I have ſaid before doth altogether condemn it) but according to their own grants that plead for it: To this purpoſe it is that they ſay the King is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſis minor,</hi> leſſe then the whole State, and every body naturally defends it ſelf. Therefore if a contention be between the Plead and the Body, it muſt in all reaſon be the whole Body that is ſet againſt it; and if there be ſuch an appearing againſt the ſupreme Power, as tends to reſiſtence, the conſent and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Kingdom muſt be againſt him, or elſe every prevailing faction might indanger the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42062:26"/>
State by cauſing ſuch changes and evils as now it's threatned with: This is the reaſon of this unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power of reſiſtence in the people.</p>
               <p>Well then how ſhall Conſcience he perſwaded that this reſiſtence was agreed upon by an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and free conſent of the States aſſembled in the two Houſes, ſuch as in this caſe may be called the judgement of the whole kingdome?</p>
               <p>He that knows how the <hi>Militia</hi> (in which this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence chiefly began) was brought in, with what oppoſition, eſpecially in the Lords houſe, and by what number there at length was voted; alſo how the like proceedings of reſiſtence, that have been vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſince, are declared againſt; by a greater number of each Houſe then do remain in either, ſuch as have been caſt out or withdrawn themſelves upon diſlike of theſe proceedings: can he, I ſay, that knows this (and who knows it not, that hath eyes and eares?) be in Conſcience perſwaded, that this is ſuch an unanimous, free, and generall conſent, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole kingdome?</p>
               <p>For though a Vote paſſed by a few upon the place ha's the power and condition of a Vote for the formality of Law, yet, if the queſtion be, Was this paſſed in full aſſemblies; Was it freely and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried; Did they all unanimouſly <hi>as one man</hi> conſent unto it? Conſcience cannot be convinced there is ſuch efficacy in the place, as to make a few, the whole; or their agreement to be that judgement: of the whole kingdome, that unanimous conſent, which muſt be in the caſe of reſiſtence, by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement that plead for it. For were it in this caſe to be held for the judgement of the whole,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42062:27"/>
which is paſſed by a few, then would the State be unreaſonably expoſed to that danger (above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) which every prevailing faction might bring upon it under the pretence of the judgement of the whole kingdome.</p>
               <p>Again, is Conſcience cannot be truely perſwaded that this reſiſtence is agreed upon with ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and unanimous conſent, as they themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, which pleade for this reſiſtence, ſo can it not be truely perſwaded that this reſiſtence is ſuch for the meer defenſive way of it, as it ought to be according to their grants and pretences that appear for it.</p>
               <p>Conſcience here will ſee how to reſolve, upon the triall of theſe two particulars, Whether the King or they be upon the defenſive part? then, Whether the managing of this warre or reſiſtence on their parts, be ſo void of hoſtile acts, as the defenſive way, which they pretend to, ought to be?</p>
               <p>Conſcience will diſcern whether part is upon the defenſive, by inquiring, Firſt, Who were firſt in Arms? He that can number the ſucceſſion of weeks and moneths in his Almanack may decide this. He ſhall find that armed men were thruſt into Hull, the Kings Arms ſeized againſt his will, the <hi>Militia</hi> ſet up, and by that the Kings Subjects drawn into Arms before the King had any thing to oppoſe but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations: that ſubſcriptions for Plate, Money, Horſe; that liſting of ſouldiers for the field, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of Officer of the Army were begun upon their part, before His Majeſty did the like. Now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence doth in the word it ſelf and in their pretence preſuppoſe a power and force firſt made againſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42062:27"/>
them, where as it is plain, they were ſtill upon the preventing and forehand with the Kin<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ſtill ſhewed him example for what he has done ſince in the way of Warre: yet muſt the people believe he raiſes the Warre, and they are upon defence; But Conſcience will not be ſo forced.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by inquiring what is the c<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſe of theſe Arms? What do they contend for? And though it be clear, that if Subjects be firſt in A<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be upon the defenſive, yet the conſideration of the cauſe will more apparantly convince it, when Conſcience ſhall ſee it is not for what is pretended, but for ſomething the King ha's right to deny, that this reſiſtence is made. The preſervation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberties is pretended, but can it be for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The King denyes them not: Their Religon they freely enjoy; and was it ever known that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould riſe in Arms againſt their Prince for a Religion which he promiſeth to maintain? Or does Religion ſtand in need of a defenſe, which it ſelf condemnes, a defence which would be a perpetuall ſcandall to it? If therefore Religion be the pretence, but no cauſe of Warre, then is the Warre raiſed on their part, the King is upon the defenſive. Or can it be for antient Rights and undoubted Priviledges that they contend? The King denyes them not, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth all ſecurity ſo he may enjoy his own, and God ſorbid that either He or they ſhould ſuffer in their juſt Rights. But would any man ever have defended the revolt of the ten Tribes, if Rehoboam had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to conſerve their Liberties? What ſhall we then think of this geneall Revolt from Allegiance that ha's poſſeſſed well-near ten Tribes of twelve?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42062:28"/>
They ſuppoſe he will not make good his promiſes, and therefore they will make all ſure, ſeize his Arms and Forts, ſtrip him of all, and if begin to ſtirre for his own Right and Dignity, then the people muſt be made to believe he makes warre againſt his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, intends to deſtroy their Liberties. But can any man in Conſcience think his Majeſty ſince the beginning of this breach was ever in ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrength as might threaten the Libertie of the Subject, or deſtroy Parliaments, when as it was long ere he could with much ado attain to any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means of ſubſiſtence, or to ſuch a ſtrength whereby he might ſeem to be able to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               <p>To ſpeak the truth, Religion and Liberties can be no other then the pretences of this Warre, the King ha's fortified them ſo with many Acts of Grace paſſed this Parliament, that they cannot be in that danger which is pretended for the raiſing of this Warr. It muſt be ſomething that his Majeſty does indeed deny for which the contention is raiſed: That we ſhall find to be His Power of Arms, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdome, His Power of denying in Parliament, His diſpoſing of the offices of State, and ſuch like; Alſo the Government of the Church and the Revenue of it. In the three former he challenges his right, as his Predeceſſours had; the other he is bound by Oath to maintaine as by Law they are eſtabliſhed. Well, if theſe be attempted, and his Majeſty will not be forced from them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yeild them up, but it comes to Arms, then will Conſcience eaſily be convinced the King is upon the defenſive, for the maintaining of what he juſtly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42062:28"/>
holds his right, or is bound by Oath to defend.</p>
               <p>And if we hearken to the peoples voice, for that commonly ſpeaks the mind of their leaders, we ſhall hear them uſually call this Warre as they did that with the Scots, The Biſhops Warre. His Majeſty has indeed alwayes declared againſt the altering of the Government of the Church by Biſhops, being ſuch as it alwayes had ſince the firſt receiving of the Chriſtian Faith in this land, and of all other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments ſimply the beſt, if reformed from abuſes and corruptions that have grown upon it, to the purging out of which His Majeſty is alwayes ready to agree. But be it the Biſhops Warre (though the aboliſhing of that Government be but one of the many inconveniences which this Power of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth threaten this Land with, and which the King has reaſon by Power of Arms to divert) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ſo juſt in Subjects by Arms to force a change of Government which was alwayes in the Church, and by Law eſtabliſhed, as it is in the King to defend the ſame as he is bound by Oath? it is clear which of the two are upon the defenſive.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular by which the defenſive way of this reſiſtance is to be examined, was the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of this Warre on their parts, whether ſo void of acts of Hoſtility as that defenſive way ſhould be which they pretend to. Davids reſiſtence made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Saul is frequently alledged by them, which example, though it will not countenance their cauſe (as was ſhewed before) yet might it tell them their demeanor ſhould be anſwerable. He offered no act of violence to Saul, but ſtill gave place and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from him: the Spear indeed and the Cruſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42062:29"/>
David tooke away from the Kings head, but it was onely to ſhew Abners neglect, who had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sauls Militia, and to teſtifie his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, therefore he reſtored them before they were demanded, 1 Sam 26.</p>
               <p>But now the Kings Spear and his Cruſe, his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and His neceſſary Proviſions are taken away, intercepted, not reſtored, though often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, uſed againſt Him with all advantage; nay he is ſtript of the very Power and Command of Arms, His Officers and Miniſters thruſt out, and other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and by them His People drawn into Arms againſt Him.</p>
               <p>Alſo by theſe that are in reſiſtence againſt the King, His Loyall and Peaceable Subjects are aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, deſpoiled of their Arms, Goods, Eſtates; their Perſons Impriſoned, becauſe they would according to their Allegiance aſſiſt Him in this extremity, or would not, contrary to their Conſcience, joyn with them againſt Him. What Conſcience that will not follow this way with a ſtupid implicit faith can be perſwaded that this Warre is the defence of the Subjects Liberties, and not rather an oppugnation of them? or that it is a meer reſiſtence or withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a force firſt made againſt them, and not rather a violent illation or bringing in of force upon thoſe that were diſpoſed to Peace. Therefore no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that ha's a ſenſe of Religion, or of that which is juſt and right between Man and Man, can beare a part in this reſiſtence, for fear of that ſentence of damnation which the Apoſtle ha's laid upon it.</p>

               <p>BUt in the laſt place, if Conſcience could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it is lawfull upon ſuch a caſe, as they make, to take Arms and reſiſt, and that this riſing in Arms is ſuch a defenſive reſiſtence, as in ſuch a caſe they ſeem to pretend to, yet how will it be perſwaded that the Caſe is now, that is, That the King is ſuch as the people muſt be made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is, unles it will as deſperately offend againſt the rule of Charitie, in ſo concluding upon the King, as it does againſt the rule of Faith and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, in admitting ſo uugrounded a principle as is now reſted on for reſiſtence: ſo that ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall have in its perſwaſion neither certainty of Rule; for the principle it goes on is falſe; nor cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Caſe, for it knows not the heart of the King, to conclude for reſiſtence upon ſuppoſals of his intentions, and in its judgement it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together void of Charitie.</p>
               <p>Indeed it concerns all ſuch as will reſiſt upon the principles now taught to render their Prince odious to his people under the hatefull notions of Tyrant, Subverter of Religion, and Laws, a Perſon not to be truſted, or at leaſt as one ſeduced to ſuch evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, by wicked Counſel. But what? Hath this King forbid the exerciſe of the Religion eſtabliſhed or left off to profeſſe it himſelfe? hath he diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his truſt, or not upon all occaſions promiſed juſtice and libertie to his Subjects?</p>
               <p>Yea! but they have cauſe to fear Popery will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and that he will not ſtand to his promiſes. It ſeems thy are men that would be loath to ſuffer for their Religion, they are ſo ready to fly to Arms
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42062:30"/>
to ſecure themſelves; But ſhall ſubjects riſe in Arms againſt their Prince upon ſuch remote fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies as theſe will appear to be? When can ſuch be wanting in turbulent minds? When ſhall the Prince be aſſured of ſafety? This was the way that David himſelf was ſhaken out of his Throne, and driven from Jeruſalem by Abſolom: This cunning Rebell ſteals away their hearts by rayſing jealouſies in them, and an evill opinion of Davids government, 2. Sam. 15. 3. Some ground it ſeems, he had for his treacherous plea, through the negligence of thoſe that were under David; but it was his villanie to make uſe of it to the alienating of the People from their King. Accordingly let us now conſider what ſlender grounds our People have for their fears and jealouſies, then what ſecurity they have and mightt have againſt them, that it may appear how cauſeleſſe thoſe jealouſies are in themſelves, how unjuſt cauſes of this reſiſtence.</p>
               <p>If we examine the fears and jealouſies that have poſſeſſed the People, we ſhall find them to be raiſed upon theſe or the like grounds. Reports of Forraign Power to be brought in, The Queens Religion, The reſort of Papiſts to His Majeſty, His intercepting of means ſent for the reliefe of Ireland, from whence the People by their good teachers are made to believe, that He means to enſlave this People, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh Popery, and does comply with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to all, which I needed not to ſay more then what Michael the Arch-Angell to the Devill that arch-accuſer; <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,</hi> Jude 9. but in particular; For ſuch reports of invaſion from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42062:30"/>
abroad, as were, before the ſetting up of the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> given out to keep the people amuſed, the eaſier to draw them into a Poſture of Defence as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, all ſuch are diſcovered by time to have been vain; if there be now any forraign ayd, towards the King (as all Chriſtian Kings cannot but think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned in the cauſe) it will be as juſt for him to uſe them againſt ſubjects now in Arms, as it was unjuſt in the Barons to call in the French againſt their naturall King. <note place="margin">K. Iohn.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For the Queens Majeſty; Her Religion is no new cauſe, if it be a ſufficient cauſe of Jealouſie to them, they have had it from her firſt entrance; I would to God it were otherwiſe with her, that it would pleaſe the Lord to open her eyes that ſhe may ſee the truth and light of the Proteſtant Religion: onely this I muſt ſay, this is not the way to draw her to it, if ſhe look at it in the doctrines and practiſes of theſe times ſhe is not like to fall in love with it.</p>
               <p>For the reſort of Papiſts, and the Kings enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them; He hath often declared what caution he deſired to uſe therein, till neceſſitie hath driven him to admit of ſome few into his Army, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he anſwered lately. Let me adde this concerning the juſtneſſe of it, If he hath entertained any into this ſervice, he may juſtly make uſe of them. We ſee what manner of men were gathered to David in his diſtreſſe, 1. Sam. 22. 2. and how falſe Ziba bringing proviſion to the King when he fled from Abſolom, was entertained and rewarded, inſomuch that the King (when afterward he knew how Ziba had abuſed him to gain his own ends) would not reverſe the ſentence pronounced in his favour; If
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42062:31"/>
therefore in this diſtreſſe after much forbearance our King hath admitted the help of ſome Recuſants, it cannot be alledged as a cauſe of the reſiſtence now made againſt him, but that reſiſtence was a cauſe of it; and if the Papiſt will ſhew himſelf a good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is juſt and reaſonable that the King when he is put to it, may admit of his help, and the more ſhame it is for them that profeſſe the Proteſtant Religion to force him to it; a ſcandall that would not eaſily be wiped off from our Religion, were it to ſtand or fall, by the doctrines of this giddie Age.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, His Majeſtie hath written enough for the clearing himſelfe from thoſe falſe and odious impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations laid upon him in relation to the Iriſh buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I have onely thus much to ſay, concerning any thing intended for the relief of Ireland; It was great pittie they ſhould want it there, but it is more pittifull, the King ſhould be forced to make uſe of it here.</p>
               <p>It is not long ſince our neighbour Nation brought an Army into the Northern parts of this kingdome to the great detriment of the inhabitants there, and it was excuſed by invincible neceſſitie, which drove them hither. The neceſſitie his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie was driven to is ſufficiently known, and might excuſe him, in taking his own where he meets with it, and drawing it from his ſervice abroad to that which more nearly concerned him at home. And when his Arms, Moneys, and Proviſions are ſeiſed on wherever they be found intended for him, and imployed againſt him in a Warre, the Lord knows how unneceſſary; ſhall it not be lawfull for him to take ſome part of them where he finds it for his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary defence?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42062:31"/>
Indeed the diſtreſſe of Ireland by the help of wicked Pamphlets hath been uſed as a great engine to weaken the Kings reputation with his people; but upon whoſe account the heavie reckoning of that neglected Cauſe will be laid, together with the diſturbance of this kingdome, any man in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may eaſily diſcern, that ſees what ſufficient and reaſonable means might have been had for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Religion and Liberties, and for the redreſſe of all juſt greivances before this time. Which is the next thing conſiderable: What his Majeſty hath done and profered to exempt theſe ſcruples of fears and jealouſies out of his peoples minds</p>
               <p>For Religion, if it be a new Frame they contend for, I muſt acknowledge he declares againſt all ſuch; but if they deſire the continuance of that true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, which hath been profeſſed without interruption from the beginning of the Queens dayes, and eſtabliſhed by the Laws of this Land, that he undertakes to maintain, that he hath proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the head of his Army to defend. For matter of Church-government and diſcipline he hath offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any juſt reformation, even with a reſpect to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſciences in point of Ceremony, hath often called his two Houſes to the work in drawing up the grievances to ſome head. For priviledges of Parliaments and libertie of Subjects he hath given them the like promiſes with the deepeſt Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and by an excellent moderation, amidſt the preſſures and neceſſities of Warre, hath ſhown what reſpect he hath to the property and libertie of the Subject. Laſtly, For his choyſe of Officers of State, he hath promiſed to admit any juſt exception, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42062:32"/>
thereupon to relinquiſh the perſon; and as an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of all this, hath ſo farre condeſcended as to take away Starre-chamber, High-commiſſion, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops votes, &amp;c. and to grant the Continuance of this Parliament, and the conſtant return of a Trie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; And now after all theſe promiſes and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, and ſo many reall expreſſions of Grace, can any man in conſcience think there was yet place left for Propoſitions of ſuch neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that except they be granted this Kingdome muſt be imbroyled in a Civill warre, and the releif of Ireland neglected? I ſpeak not this to caſt any blemiſh upon the wiſdome of the great Councel, or upon their deſires and endeavors to gain a greater ſecurity to the Publick: but I would to God, the King were once thought worthy to be truſted a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and that the Conſciences of his Subjects were more reſpected, which cannot ſo eaſily be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded into a reſiſtence, being very tender in the points of damnation, and taught out of Gods Word not to raiſe ſo much as an evil thought againſt the King, much leſſe to lift up an armed hand. <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Every mans Conſcience now is ſolicited to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here either to the King in this great cauſe, or to joyn with Subjects in making reſiſtence: To draw it from Allegiance, tongues are ſet on fire of hell, which blaſt his Majeſties Actions and Declarations; and books written by helliſh ſpirits, enemies to peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, are ſuffered to iſſue forth into every corner of the land to poſſeſſe the people, That his promiſes are but words, his acts of Grace were forced, he will not ſtand to them: It ſeems then he muſt by force of Arms be compelled to be willing. But let us ſee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42062:32"/>
whether a Conſcience that deſtres to be ſafe can be ſo perſwaded in judging the actions and intentions of him (to whom it owes the higheſt duty under God) as firſt to conclude He intends not as He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and thereupon to reſolve for reſiſtence? No, it will direct it ſelf by the rule of Charity, which is, not raſhly to conclude upon the Heart which it knoweth not, or to think any evill; and if the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be betwixt two, as in this cauſe, it will hold the rule of indifferency, impartially to conſider the actions of both.</p>
               <p>Conſcience therefore that it may be informed of His Majeſties intentions, will it look upon him at ſuch a diſtance as London, and reade him onely in thoſe horrid relations that iſſue thence, and conceive of Him as they report Him to the People? or will it conſider ſome failings that neceſſity ha's inforced, or other accidentall occurrences have occaſioned, and from theſe conclude intentions in Him, contrary to all His Promiſes and Proteſtations? This would be too partiall, too uncharitable: Conſcience ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be tender in judging upon other Mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, eſpecially thoſe of the Prince, and thoſe to be concluded as evill, and to be made a ground for reſiſtence, which runs the hazard of Damnation.</p>
               <p>In the 2. Chron. c. 21. 10. Libnah is ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from the King of Judah becauſe he had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Lord; a Text that is objected to us, and ſhould have been anſwered in the firſt part: but it is impertinent as all the reſt are, for it neither proves the principle, That it is lawfull for the People to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt when the King forſakes Religion, but ſhews that ſuch revolt is a puniſhment from God upon ſuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42062:33"/>
a King, though a ſinne in the people: Nor doth it come home to the Caſe: for there the King had forſaken: here is onely ſuppoſall that he will, and that groundleſſe and unconſcionable too.</p>
               <p>For as there was enough in David to clear thoſe jealouſies upon which that rebellion of the People following Abſolom was grounded, ſo is there on the Kings part, to direct Conſcience againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate uncharitable judgement, if it look at thoſe many Acts of Grace as new additions to that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by which this State ha'<hi>s</hi> ſo long ſtood, and from them conclude, He would not in a faire way deny any thing reaſonable: If it conſider thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes ſtrengthened with the deepeſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, enforced with deſires of ſucceſſe from God according to His juſt intentions; and all theſe, as proceeding from a King, under ſuch affliction, in ſuch danger, after ſuch ſucceſſe and experience of Gods protection, approving thereby the reality and ſincerity of his heart: What Conſcience can here conclude contrary intentions in him, and not think it blaſphemeth God and the King?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as Conſcience will not be unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table when it judgeth upon the intentions of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans heart, ſo neither will it be partiall when it judgeth between two, unto which of them it ſhould incline: and therefore he that is abuſed to believe amiſſe of his King, and ſolicited to enter this way of reſiſtence, is highly concerned firſt to conſider, Whether they alſo that are the main directors of it, and to whom he would adhere, to diſcharge their truſt they are called to, I ſay ſuch an one, unleſſe he will reſigne up his faith to men, and receive their,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42062:33"/>
dictates as the immediate rule of his Conſcience, muſt conſider whether all be juſt and honeſt that is done in that way? Whether to diveſt the King of the Power of Arms and to uſe them againſt him, be to defend his Perſon, Rights, and Dignity? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the forcing of the Subjects property, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of this reſiſtence, and the impriſoning of their perſons for deniall, be the maintaining of the Right and Liberty of the Subject? Whether the ſuffering of ſo many Sects to vent their Doctrines with ſuch liberty, and to commit unſufferable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages upon the publike worſhip of God, with ſuch licentiouſneſſe, be a defending of Religion and the eſtabliſhed worſhip of this Church? All theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties every Subject reſpectively is bound to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, and the neglect of them his Majeſty has chiefly charged upon thoſe that he conceives the chief Directors and Actours in this reſiſtance made againſt him, and every man in Conſcience ought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to conſider it</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of the Commonwealth is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defend the not-defending of the premiſes; when as no neceſſity may excuſe any failings on the Kings part, as if his promiſes, by which he ſtands obliged to his Subjects, did not ſuppoſe they for their parts alſo ſhould perform: I know not how ſome particular men may be engaged and contract a neceſſity of reſiſting, or ſeeking ſafety by Arms; but I am perſwaded, no man in Conſcience can think it a neceſſity of the Commonwealth to have all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, or of a Chriſtian to run the hazard of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by reſiſting. My Conſcience tells me, and Qwill theirs one day tell them, how much they have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42062:34"/>
to anſwer for not improving that grace and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they had experience of in His Majeſty, and might ſtill have found in him, to the ſpeedy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reformation of this Church and State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I pray God to give them Conſciences truly inlightned, and bowels truely compaſſionate, that they may ſpeedily and feelingly be ſenſible of the miſeries this Land groanes under, and faithfully examine how far they are anſwerable for them, by rejecting ſuch reaſonable means of ſecurity, as they might have <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for the ſafety of this State. Amen.</p>
               <p>And now if there be any one that will run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of this reſistence, I deſire he would firſt ſet his Conſcience before the Tribunall of God, where it muſt appear, and conſider whether it will excuſe him there, when he ha's ſhed the blood of others, and expended his own, to ſay, I verily ſuppoſed and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my Prince would change Religion, overthrow our Liberties. I muſt tell him it will not be ſafe for him to preſent ſuch a Conſcience at that Barre, a Conſcience that wanted the rule of Faith to warrant and perſwade the lawfulneſſe of reſiſtence upon ſuch a ſuppoſall, a Conſcience that wanted the certainty of perſwaſion that the Princes Heart (which God onely knows) was ſo inclined, a Conſcience that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Judgement of Charity, in concluding ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in the King, notwithſtanding all His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and deepeſt Proteſtations made in the time of His trouble, without which Charity all is nothing though he layes down (as he thinks) his Life for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Such a Conſcience I muſt needs conclude ſinfull, and liable to that which the Apoſtle threatens vnto Reſiſtence, Damnation.</p>
