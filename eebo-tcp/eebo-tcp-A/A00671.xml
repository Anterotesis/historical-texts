            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For euery mans Quaere is, not as of old, in the daies of <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 3. 10</note>

we doe?</hi> but what ſhall we thinke? As if the Goſpell were not <hi>Chriſtiana lex,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num dogma.</hi> Whereas caſes of conſcience, doe ſleepe with conſcience, which of all queſtions are moſt profitable, and leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: ſo loth are men to reſtraine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and limit their actions. Yet of all ſuch caſes this of Vſurie hath moſt need to be reuiued. For in this, the cuſtome of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth not onely take away the ſenſe, but the acknowledgement of ſinne: ſo as the meere practiſe of it, hath made an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for it; without either ſound reaſon, or good authoritie.</p>
            <p>This very inducement which perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth others that vſurie is lawfull, hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to write againſt it, fearing the loſſe, not onely of ſo much truth (which I would willingly helpe to redeeme:) but of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoules amongſt whom I liue. So farre therefore I doe preſume in this buſineſſe to <hi>trouble Iſrael,</hi> as to tell the people what <note place="margin">1. King. 18 18.</note> is the truth in this point, and the perill of their practiſe. Wherin they haue ſo intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelues, that they know not well
<pb facs="tcp:2101:3"/>
how to leaue it. If wee then cannot deuiſe to make that good, which they haue made neceſſarie, they will be angrie. Seeing them then thus ſecurely to lull their conſciences, I am bold a little to diſquiet them.</p>
            <p>A buſineſſe ſo thankleſſe, and diſtaſtfull as this muſt needes be, (right Honorable and my ſingular good Lord) doth require a worthie Patron. And of whom may I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the patronage of my labours, but of your Honour? whoſe I am, and to whom I owe all dutie and ſeruice. Of whom ſhould I deſire the patronage of theſe labours, but of your Honour? who are in place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this ſinne, more by the very counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Authoritie, then wee can with all our endeuours. From whom can I receiue more encouragement in theſe labours, then from your Honour? whoſe integritie hath manifeſted it ſelfe with zeale againſt this ſinne: whoſe iudgement will not bee blinded with thoſe forged diſtinctions of <hi>poore</hi> and <hi>rich borrowers:</hi> of <hi>toothleſſe</hi> and <hi>biting vſurie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let theſe poore endeuours then finde

fauour in your eyes; not for their owne ſake, being vnworthie: but for the cauſe which I haue in hand.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader; thy gentleneſſe and patience is much exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe times, with the multitude of bookes; which men ſay they bee commonly forced to put vpon thee by the importunity of their friends. This to mee is no reaſon at all, for the publiſhing of this Treatiſe: and indeed they whom it moſt concerneth doe leaſt deſire it. Yet three motiues I haue which may make ſufficient apologie for me.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, ſeeing the harueſt of Vſurers in theſe parts to be great; at S. <hi>Stephens</hi> in Walbrooke, the heart of this Citie, I began to labour in this point. By their flocking to thoſe Sermons, they ſeemed to be ripe, and euen <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 35</note> 
               <hi>white vnto the harueſt.</hi> But when men aſſemble after the <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 17. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Athenian</hi> faſhion, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proueth a ſolemne hearing, and a ſolemne forgetting. Notwithſtanding, perceiuing afterwards thoſe poore labours to haue made ſome little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the minds of the better ſort; I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:2101:5"/>
to make this impreſſion. Wherein after my plaine maner, I haue ſomewhat, not as I would, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined that which then was more rudely deliuered: caſt it into a new mold and method, that thou maiſt carrie the whole frame in thy view, and paſſe more eaſily from point to point: and added much more, then in the throng of other buſines I could, at that time, thinke vpon.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A ſecond motiue hath been the miſtakings of ſome which haue occaſioned miſreports; as if in the end I concluded nothing, or defended ſome kind of Vſurie. Which cenſures I may impute vnto two cauſes. The firſt is ordinarie vpon theſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where the moſt attentiue may ſay, as wiſe and learned <hi>Eliphas</hi> ſaid of himſelfe: <note n="*" place="margin">Iob 4 12.</note> 
               <hi>Mine eare hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a little of it:</hi> for part of that which is only ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, muſt needs vaniſh in the aire, before it can bee fully faſtned in the mind, and fitted to the whole frame and current of ſpeech. 2 Another cauſe is, the narrowneſſe of the point in queſtion. For euery queſtion, as the learned know, hath a point which is ſcarce diuiſible. Comming therefore preciſely to cut an vſurious act from ſuch lawfull couenants as doe next adioyne vpon it, the paſſage is ſo narrow, that we might eaſily miſtake, or bee miſtaken. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thus farre I muſt appeale to the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie which then was; that when I came to thoſe ſtraites at the concluſion and determination, of the queſtion, purpoſely to auoid theſe miſconceites; I did often iterate and beate vpon the maine conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that, <hi>all Vſurie properly ſo called, is ſimply vnlawful.</hi> But howſoeuer it was either not ſo exactly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="tcp:2101:5"/>
or diſtinctly taken, as it ſhould: the onely reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which now remaineth, is to exhibit the effect of that in writing which then was ſaid; that ſuch as make ſcruple, may at their pleaſure, and beſt leiſure, pauſe vpon it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Laſt of all, after that by the handling of this point in publike, I had troubled the waters, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the minds of men to giue cenſures according to their ſeuerall apprehenſions; I haue taken time to obſerue what yet could further be vrged for Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; or obiected againſt that which then was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: whereby being better furniſhed by reaſon of matter newly miniſtred, then at the firſt I could; I thought it part of my dutie to giue better ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this kind, and to meet with ſuch probabilities as are, or may with any colour bee ſuggeſted. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which, if I could find any ground of reaſon, for the defence of any Vſurie at all, I would moſt willingly either acknowledge it, or be ſilent. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I haue found none; but diſcharged my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience according to my ſimple knowledge. My reward ſhal be manifold cenſures no doubt: for what other can be expected in ſo vnpleaſing a matter, and amidſt ſo many aduerſaries? Aduerſaries, I ſay, not in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or argument, but in action. So as being thought ouer buſie in this buſineſſe, I feare I ſhall be occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take vp that text of Scripture, though I hope in a farre other cauſe: <hi>Thus was I wounded in the houſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Zac. 13. 6.</note> 
               <hi>of my friends.</hi> Bee they friends, or bee they ſtrangers, who are any waies touched in this point; let them ſtrike with the tongue, and wound at their pleaſure; I ſhall thinke my ſelfe well apaid, if I can cauſe their
<pb facs="tcp:2101:6"/>
but to feele thoſe wounds which they haue made in their owne conſciences, by this ſinne.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe (Chriſtian Reader) is not ſo large as to require a table, though it be tedious. Howbeit to giue thee ſome direction (beſides the order of the generall heads before the booke) the laſt chapter being a briefe of the premiſſes, with reference in the margine to the ſeuerall places, where the points bee more fully handled; may ſerue in ſtead thereof.</p>
            <p>So wiſhing that thou maieſt reade with a ſingle eye; iudge of what thou readeſt without affection; and conforme thy affection to right iudgement: I commend thee to the ſpirit of grace, whom I beſeech, according to the right, to guide and ſanctifie the actions of thy life.</p>

Yet notwithſtanding they may hold the candle, and giue ſome light vnto that whereof wee are to entreate: which in our Engliſh tongue is moſt properly termed by the name of Vſurie. But whatſoeuer the matter is, the more that men haue been in loue with the thing it ſelfe, the more haue they purpoſely declined and auoided this name. They will not call it Vſurie, leſt the word ſhould be offenſiue, or make the thing odious. But it ſhall be termed Vſe or V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance in exchange, which are ſmooth words as oyle, neuer abiting letter in them. Or it ſhall be called Intereſt, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which are ciuill and mannerly termes, though by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they meane indeed nothing elſe but plaine Vſurie.</p>

euen of vſurie was deteſtable. The French therefore haue deuiſed a new trick, as if they could beguile God himſelfe. For becauſe no man could endure the name of vſurie, they haue put in place thereof, intereſt. Now what doth intereſt with them ſignifie? All kinde of vſurie. Men be neuer good who vſe to change and ſhift their names; but are euer held for ſuſpected perſons and ſhifters themſelues. For hee who is aſhamed of his name, his name commonly may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him. So is it proportionably in profeſſions. He that is an Vſurer, if you aske what he is, or of what profeſſion; he would not be ſo termed: what ſhall we call him then?</p>
                     <p>Some call him <hi>a man that putteth out his money.</hi> That is ambiguous. He may put it out, as the Lion putteth out his claw; and then well is hee that commeth not neere his grate. But moſt commonly he is termed, <hi>one that liueth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his money;</hi> which is without all exception. For as the Gentleman liueth vpon his rents; the poore labourer vpon the ſweate of his browes; the Merchant and Tradeſman vpon their aduentures, skill, and induſtrie; the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Graſier vpon the increaſe of the earth, and breed of cattell; ſo doth the Vſurer liue vpon his moneis: which doe yeane, and foale, and calue vnto him once in ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths at the furtheſt.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the name of Vſurie doth trouble mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences much more then the thing it ſelfe; ſome haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed a new trick of learning, as if there were ſome reall and materiall difference betweene the gaine of vſurie, and of the vſe of money; imagining that <hi>vſura</hi> in Latine is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>ab vſu rapiendo,</hi> and that the Latin condemneth ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, as the Hebrue doth biting: inſinuating thereby that ſuch vſurie only is forbidden, which is a greedie catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſnatching of gaine by hooke or crooke. Whereas <hi>vſura</hi> in truth is nothing but <hi>vſus rei,</hi> primitiuely taken for the vſe of <note n="h" place="margin">

                        <p>This biting or gnawing, becauſe it is not alwaies ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, much leſſe mortall, (for there bee moates as well as beames in all ſinnes which cannot ſo well be diſcerned) therefore ſome ſubtill wits haue deuiſed a new diſtinction to pleaſe the world. As if there were ſome toothleſſe and harmleſſe vſurie without the compaſſe of the word <hi>Neſhec,</hi> and without the meaning of the law of God: as if God had neuer meant to condemne Vſurers, but onely to muzzle them for biting.

                        <p>One point then in queſtion (when we come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) will be, whether it be not the nature of all vſurie to

bite? though with great difference; ſome like the Engliſh maſtiue, ſome like the dogge-flye; ſome ſcarſe ſenſiblie, and therefore not perceiued to be a ſinne.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, becauſe many are content to moderate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in this gaine, and then, if it be a ſinne, it is but a little one. As <hi>Lot</hi> ſaid of Zoar, <note n="p" place="margin">Gen 19. 20.</note>

He that once or twice hath taken extreme vſurie to the ſenſible and apparent oppreſſion of his brother, hath runne his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vpon a rock. But he who to auoid that Scylla, will take but a reaſonable moderate conſcionable vſurie, (like an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt kind robber, who alloweth a man part of his owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney back againe to beare his charges) and thus reſolueth to liue vpon this practiſe; he by heaping vp moderate ſinnes, wreaketh his conſcience vpon a ſand; and ſo ſinking into this ſin by little and little, his ſoule is at length eaſily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp, without ſenſe or feeling at all.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.

Yea many borrowers concurring in this practiſe, by their very multitudes, are able to ſway and inhaunce the market, in ſuch manner, that they may liue themſelues and pay the Vſurer beſides. So that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion thoſe doe all ſet vpon the Common-wealth: which being a great bodie, is able to beare many dogges, before ſhe need to complaine; and feeling the wound (as in time ſhe muſt) ſhe knoweth not well of whom to complaine.

And of them to take vſurie was a more ſenſible biting and oppreſſion: in that they borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to lay out for commodities, but to ſpend for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> in his troubleſome daies vſeth the word <hi>Neſhec</hi> onely, for vſurie, as beſt fitting thoſe times; where the pooreſt were moſt bitten by this ſinne. But in King <hi>Salomons</hi> daies, being daies of peace and plentie, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of money and merchandizing, both by ſea and land, for all manner of commodities; thoſe men who were then rich in moneys, might ſit ſtill at home and lend foorth their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſuch as by their skill and paines in trauelling and trading abroad, might returne them vſurie for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and bee many times gainers themſelues. In which caſe becauſe there is no ſuch apparant perſonall biting of the borrower, as when money is lent to the poore to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie preſent wants; therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> to preuent theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils at words might adde to the word <hi>Neſhec,</hi> that word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo which ſignifieth <hi>Increaſe,</hi> or <hi>ouerplus.</hi> Thereby teaching men that it was the direct meaning of Almightie God ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to forbid all manner of increaſe whatſoeuer.</p>

Thoſe delicate wits then, who haue from hence extracted concluſions, as if God, by ſuch parables and alluſions, did ſomewhat fauour vſurie; they muſt by the ſame reaſon iuſtifie vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, becauſe the example of the vniuſt Steward is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs; and withall conclude that euen theft it ſelfe is therefore ſanctified, becauſe Chriſt hath compared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto a theefe in the night.

                     <p>Of which there be two kinds; <hi>mentall</hi> and <hi>actuall</hi> vſurie. The firſt conſiſteth only in the intention of the heart. For he that lendeth ſo freely to his brother, that he doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent either by word or deed, for any vſurious gaine: yet if any hope or expectation of gaine was to him a motiue of lending, that man in the Court of Conſcience ſtandeth guiltie of this ſinne before God. Howbeit the other partie may be innocent in borrowing. <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 5. 28</note> As he that looketh on a woman, to luſt after her, hath committed adulterie with her alreadie in his heart; though the woman be neuer ſo cleere from that ſinne. But in actuall vſurie there muſt be a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſent of two parties at the leaſt.</p>

                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:2101:15"/>
It is my purpoſe to write of this ſecond, as being more ſenſible then the former; yet including the former. For euery intention of the heart is determinable by the act it ſelfe, to be good or bad. If actuall vſurie therefore proue vnlawfull, thereby ſhall the very thought and intention of the minde be condemned. And if we looke vpon the vſuall practiſe of the world in this kinde; mentall vſurie is but a little moate, but wee are now haling at the beame it ſelfe. <hi>Hoc opus, hic labor eſt:</hi> It is no time to pick moates.</p>
                     <p>Actuall vſurie is of diuers deſcribed diuerſly (a varietie tedious to relate) but the pith of all is briefly contracted in three words, to be, <hi>pactum ex mutuo lucrum.</hi>

                     <lg>

                        <l>Lending vpon Couenant for lucre.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>So that theſe three words, <hi>mutuum, pactum, lucrum,</hi> that is, <hi>loane, couenant, lucre,</hi> doe define and circumſcribe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire nature of that vſurie whereof the maine queſtion is made, whether it be lawful or not.</p>
                     <p>Therefore whatſoeuer is without the compaſſe of any of theſe three termes, though it carrie the name of vſurie, yet it is none indeed. And of whatſoeuer all theſe three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ioyntly may be affirmed; howſoeuer it may paſſe diſguiſed vnder any other lawfull act, yet is it that actuall vſurie whereof this queſtion is moued.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2101:16"/>
vnderſtand a ſpeciall kind of lending, which for the penurie of words and narrowneſſe of our Engliſh tongue, wanteth a proper terme. In Latine it is called <hi>mutuum,</hi> in which, two words are briefly contracted into one, <hi>meum, tuum,</hi> into <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum.</hi> If I lend thee my money, of <hi>mine</hi> I make it <hi>thine</hi> for a time. <hi>Thine</hi> to doe withall what thou wilt: <hi>Thine</hi> in vſe and propertie both: So <hi>thine,</hi> as during that time, I will not owne it, nor call thee to account what thou doſt with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is thine. But if I lend thee a horſe, or a houſe, I will ſo paſſe it ouer, as it ſhall be mine ſtill and not thine. I will be the owner ſtil, euen for the time that I haue lent it. And if thou vſe it not well, I will haue an action againſt thee; for this is not, <hi>mutuum,</hi> but <hi>commodatum,</hi> lent to vſe, but not to ſpend or beſtow.</p>
                     <p>That lending therefore which is meant in vſurie is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be, <hi>The free paſſing ouer both of vſe and propertie for a time, at the time ended to receiue the like againe.</hi> By which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription it is plainely diſtinguiſhed from all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts. From <hi>giuing, letting, ſelling, exchanging, commoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> or <hi>lending to vſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 From <hi>giuing</hi> it is diſtinguiſhed, becauſe a gift is for euer: loane is only for a time. Both are <hi>a free paſſing ouer of vſe and propertie:</hi> but that the one is temporall, the other perpetuall. So that this lending or mutuation differeth from a gift onely in time. It is a free gift for a time: for which time it is not the lenders, but the borrowers, to doe withall what he liſt; only at the time appointed that he returne the like againe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It differeth alſo from <hi>letting:</hi> becauſe in letting wee paſſe ouer the vſe onely, and that for hire: in lending wee paſſe ouer both vſe and propertie, and that freely. Theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer therefore in two things. Firſt, lending in it owne proper nature is free; letting is for hire. And therefore whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Scripture mentioneth lending, it ſpeaketh of it as a worke of mercy and free liberalitie. <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>The iust is mercifull and lendeth.</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Lend looking for nothing againe, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, lending paſſeth ouer the propertie with the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2101:16"/>
vſe, for the time it is lent: letting paſſeth onely the vſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing the propertie, euen for that time it is let.</p>
                     <p>Hence it ariſeth, that in a thing freely lent, the borrower ſtandeth to the hazard for that time in equitie, (though there be no ſuch couenant made:) becauſe the borrower is the right owner for the time; and in common right euery thing periſheth to the right owner. But in an hired thing it is otherwiſe: if it periſh, the owner ſtandeth to the hazard, vnleſſe it periſh by the default of him that hired it.</p>
                     <p>It periſheth, I ſay, to the owner. Firſt, becauſe he is the owner: and ſecondly, becauſe it went for the hire. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the equitie of Gods law, Exod. 22. 15. <hi>If the owner thereof ſtand by,</hi> (to wit, that it may appeare not to be the borrowers default) <hi>the borrower ſhall not make it good. For if it be an hired thing, it came for the hire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 From <hi>ſelling</hi> doth this <hi>lending</hi> alſo differ, becauſe <hi>ſale</hi> is <hi>a perpetuall alienation of the propertie for a price. Lending</hi> is <hi>a free alienation for a time.</hi> So that though <hi>lending</hi> and <hi>ſelling</hi> doe agree in this, that both doe alienate the propertie with the vſe; yet in theſe two things they differ, that the one is liberall, the other for a price; the one temporal, the other for euer.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It differeth from <hi>exchange.</hi> Not only in time, as <hi>giuing</hi> and <hi>ſelling</hi> doth; but in the obiect; becauſe <hi>exchange</hi> is <hi>the giuing and taking of one certaine thing for another.</hi> But in this kind of loane, only the like in the ſame kind is required at the time appointed to be reſtored. Beſides, in things exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there is ſome difference reſpected, either of kind, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or vſe; which mooueth vs to make an exchange. But in ſimple lending or mutuation, both the ſame in kind, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for money, oyle for oyle, corne for corne; the ſame in quantitie, and the like in qualitie, ſo much and ſo good, without reſpect of difference, is required.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Laſt of all, this <hi>lending</hi> or <hi>mutuation,</hi> in the definition of vſury, differeth from that which is called <hi>commodation,</hi> or <hi>free lending to vſe.</hi> Becauſe mutuation is only of ſuch things whereof vſe and propertie cannot be ſeuered: but they are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2101:17"/>
euermore ſpent or beſtowed in the firſt vſe. As he that len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his neighbour a loafe of bread, he lendeth it him to vſe and ſpend both; becauſe the vſe of bread is in ſpending of it. But he that lendeth his ſeruant, to worke for a day with his neighbour, or his horſe to trauell; hee lendeth the vſe, but reſerueth the propertie to himſelfe: Therefore if they doe hurt or abuſe that ſeruant or horſe, the owner or lender hath iuſt cauſe to complaine.</p>
                     <p>From the ſame ground alſo doth it ariſe, that in this loane of money, of victuals, of Corne, or the like, we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame thing in particular, the ſame graines of corne, but onely the like in kind: becauſe the ſame particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars be ſpent or done away. But in <hi>commodation,</hi> or <hi>lending to vſe</hi> the ſame thing in particular is required: the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, the ſame horſe, the ſame veſſell which was lent only to vſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence therefore it proceedeth, that ſuch things only bee thus lent, which doe paſſe betwixt man and man by weight, number, or meaſure. For ſeeing he cannot poſſibly receiue the particular things againe (which if they be vſed, cannot be reſtored) therefore he muſt in equitie haue ſo many in number, ſo much in weight or meaſure, as was lent.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the deſcription of the firſt terme in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of vſurie, <hi>mutuum,</hi> that is, <hi>loane;</hi> from which there are three concluſions for this our preſent purpoſe to bee deriued.</p>

To which the very words of the <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 23. 29.</note> text doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <hi>Vſurie of money, vſurie of meat, vſurie of any thing that is put to vſurie.</hi> If a woman ſhould lend her neighbor two egges, to receiue three againe; were it not damnable vſury? becauſe there is an increaſe or gaine aboue the principall,

                        <p>A poore man wanteth money to ſtocke his ground.

And ſo making good the whole flock of ſheepe, he ſhall take lamb and wool, both for their keeping, and for that twentie ſhillings which goeth for the loane. So that thoſe ſheepe which rot or miſcarie are none of the rich mans, he will not owne them; they be the borrowers, hee ſtandeth to the hazard, and maketh vp ſtill the number of twentie ſheepe. Here then is <hi>mutuum</hi> the vſe and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie both are paſſed ouer to this poore man: to the end that with the propertie, the hazard alſo may paſſe vpon him. Now theſe immortall ſheepe which neuer die, do bring an annuall increaſe or gaine to the rich man; for the meere loane of them: which is plaine vſury, howbeit not of money.</p>

If the lender had been damnified by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of his money during that time which he lent it, he could in ſtrict iuſtice haue exacted no ſatisfaction, becauſe it was his owne voluntary act: <hi>Volenti non fit iniuria.</hi> But the time being come out, to receiue ouerplus for his loſſe ſuſtained, is no vſurie, but a iuſt recompence, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie termed <hi>intereſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A great man by his authoritie, doth wring from an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour perſon the loane of ſuch a ſum, which he cannot ſpare without ſenſible detriment; and yet perhaps, in regard of the mans greatnes, he had better loſe the principall then denie the loane. To receiue intereſt, that is to ſay, recompence for the forbearance of this money, is no vſurie, becauſe it was not voluntarily lent by him, but by ſome violence extorted from him. As if a man ſhould command a poore mans tooles, without which he cannot earne his liuing, if he giue him not ſatisfaction, he committeth extortion. The monies of a tradeſman, be his tooles, by which he getteth his liuing. If therefore they be either retained, or forced from him to his ſenſible detriment, ſatisfaction is due in iuſtice and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, without touch of vſurie.</p>
                        <p>To ſell wares for time, and in reſpect of time to ſell dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, may be free from vſurie: Either in reſpect of the riſing of the commoditie ſo ſold, if by the ordinarie courſe of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it will be worth more at the day of paiment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, then it was at the time of ſale and deliuerie. Or in caſe a man can neither vent his commoditie for preſent money;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2101:18"/>
nor keep it longer without corruption or detriment to the ware; nor forbeare the money without ſenſible preiudice to himſelfe: theſe may ſeeme valuable conſiderations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compaſſe of this terme. But admit a man will ſell dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of purpoſe for the forbearance; and forbeare of purpoſe, onely that he may ſell dearer, without pregnant likelihood of the market riſing at the time of paiment; or of damnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelfe, by keeping his word, or ſuch like valuable conſiderations; that is vſurie. For it is allone as if he lent ſo much money for lucre vpon couenant.</p>

                           <hi>IF it be a gaine couenanted meerely in reſpect of loane, it is condemned as vſurious.</hi> For then is it <hi>Vimutui,</hi> for the loane before deſcribed, though it come neuer ſo diſguiſed vnder the colour of a lawfull contract, as many times it doth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Somtimes vnder the colour of buying. If I ſhould lend one hundred pound; the principall to be repaied by tenne pound a yeere in ten yeeres, and ten pound a yeere ouerplus for the vſe of that money: this were extreme vſurie within the ſtatute. If therefore purpoſely to auoid the ſtatute, I do agree with the borrower to alter the nature of the contract, thus: With the ſame hundreth pound I will purchaſe an annuitie of twentie pound for ten yeers of the ſame partie. This is bargaine and ſale; yet is it the very ſame thing in truth; differing only in the parchment and manner of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting; ſubiect to the ſame iniquitie and inequalitie; poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with their ioynt purpoſe of auoiding the penaltie of vſurie by other conueiances. For if their purpoſe could by ſome pregnant circumſtances be diſcouered, the ſame Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute would condemne them of vſurie.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Sometime it paſſeth vnder the colour of ſelling. A merchant lendeth his chapman one hundred pound freely, but with condition that he will in lieu of his courteſie take a commoditie that lieth vpon his hand at ſuch a price, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2101:19"/>
for the purpoſe eight or ten pound deerer then he might haue bought elſewhere; had he not as good haue paid ten pound for the loane of his money? Or more cunningly thus: A countrey Gentleman would borrow one hundred pound of his deare friend a Tradeſman. Anſwere is returned, That he hath no money, but rather then faile, for old loue and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, he ſhall haue 100. pounds worth of ware euen out of his ſhop preſently to make money of. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cannot make it: therefore he doth him yet a further kindneſſe, in ſending to a friend that ſhal ſell it for him (note by the way, that friend is his broker:) who after long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe what a preiudice it is to proffer ware, and after much ſeeking, he hitteth vpon a friend who will giue the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man foureſcore and eight pound, preſent money, for his ware (and that friend is the brokers owne maſter, who lent the ware.) The poore Gentleman glad of preſent money giueth the broker for his paines. Now this tradeſman that hath twelue in the hundreth, is in expectation beſides of as great kindneſſe as the free loane of one hundred pound is worth, (whereof this Gentleman will not faile him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee would keepe ſuch a friend in a corner for a pinch:) and he hath beſide pleaſured his broker for doing nothing, for the ware was neuer ſtirred out of his place. This vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of ſelling is direct vſurie, and ſomewhat elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Sometime it is committed vnder the colour of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. A man lendeth his neighbour ſuch a ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, conditionally, that he will take ſuch a houſe at ſuch a rent: prouided alwaies, that the rent of the houſe ſhall pay for the vſe of the money. More cunningly, thus: A coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Farmer commeth to an Vſurer, and telleth him of ſuch a leaſe for yeeres to be ſold, for three hundred pound. If it pleaſe you (quoth the Farmer) to deliuer mee ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I will buy that leaſe in your name with your money; you ſhall ſit ſtill, neuer trouble your ſelfe to looke after it; let me be your tenant for thirtie pound a yeere, and I will put you in good ſecuritie for the paiment of three hundred
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2101:19"/>
pound, when the leaſe ſhall expire. This is vſury vnder the colour of letting.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Sometime it paſſeth vnder the colour of free loane or mutuation. A poore man deſireth a Goldſmith to lend him ſuch a ſumme, but he is not able to pay him Intereſt. If ſuch as I can ſpare (ſaith the Goldſmith) will pleaſure you, you ſhall haue it for three or foure moneths. Now, hee hath a number of light, clipt, crackt peeces (for ſuch hee vſeth to take in change with conſideration for their defects:) this ſumme of money is repaid by the poore man at the time appointed in good and lawfull money. This is vſurie, that is, gaine for loane, vnder colour of free loane. Or thus: A yong Gallant would borrow an hundred pound for a yeere; the Vſurer in kindneſſe will lend him ſo much freelie for three moneths. The Gentleman glad to finger the money, accepteth his kinde offer. The Vſurer takes ſure bonds, knowing that he who is ſo hungrie for a yeere, will not be in caſe to pay at three moneths; then ſhall the forfeiture of the bond pay the Intereſt of the money with aduantage; only, forſooth, becauſe the Creditour is exceedingly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in being diſappointed at the time. This were vſurie, if the craftie purpoſe of the Vſurer were diſcouered. Or thus: One lendeth tenne pound vpon a pawne of bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or linnen, and hee lendeth it freely: but as the other vſeth his money, ſo hee likewiſe vſeth his pawne. This is vſurie; for the bedding or linnen is ſenſibly worſe for the wearing, ſo is not the money.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Sometime vnder the colour of <hi>Merchants exchange,</hi> deliuering money vpon bils at home, to be paid in other countries: A practiſe which ſome would vtterly condemne; but conſidering the great vſe of it, I would not raſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it: but will imagine rather how it may haue his grounds in equitie and iuſtice.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Either becauſe the office of tranſportation is therein implied. For hee who deliuereth money here to be repaid beyond the Sea, performeth the ſame office, and doth the borrower no leſſe benefit, then if he conueyed his money
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2101:20"/>
for him out of another countrey home; and ſomwhat more, becauſe this is done inſtantly, that could not be done but in longer time.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Or elſe, becauſe money preſent is more worth then abſent, not in any vſurious reſpect, but in a lawfull eſtimate; for there is no preſent vſe of that which is abſent. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that which is in another countrey, cannot be made preſent without ſome coſt, labour, or perill.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Or in reſpect of the value of money in the place where it is paid vpon bill: for though the value of coynes remaine one and the ſame, yet ſummes of money may riſe and fall in exchange (woe be to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who conſpire to raiſe them) yet ſcarſitie of money at ſome times may make great ſummes more pretious, and harder to come by; and then euery man drawing as much as he can home, it maketh the tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from forraine places to be of greater difficultie.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Reall Exchange</hi> though it may ſtand iuſtifiable vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne grounds, yet, vnder it, is cloaked a myſterie of iniquitie, that is, of vſurie; either by that vſance and double vſance, vſed only to an vſurious intent: or ſpecially by that counterfeit Exchange, termed by the name of <hi>Cambium ſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> or, <hi>drie Exchange;</hi> becauſe it hath no more iuyce or ſap then a painted tree, either in charitie or equitie: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a griping vſurie vnder the title of Exchange, it drieth vp the fountaine of both.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 Sometime it masketh vnder the habit of hazard and aduenture. For becauſe in that which is <hi>mutuum,</hi> hee that lendeth paſſeth away together with the propertie, all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and aduenture of the principall. A man therefore to preuent this, will deliuer thirtie pound the ſixt of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to receiue 33. pound for it the ſecond of Iune next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, if the ſonne of the ſaid lender be then aliue. If hee die before the day, that then the debtor ſhould pay but 27. pound of the principall. This was <note n="h" place="margin">L. <hi>Cooke</hi> in 5. part of Reports.</note> 
                           <hi>Claytons</hi> caſe, adiudged to be vſurie. For that this hazard or vncertaintie of life is not to be accounted of: becauſe by the ſame reaſon that he may adde one life, hee may adde many. If it be not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2101:20"/>
and proportionable, it is but a mockerie.</p>
                        <p>But put the caſe of a mans owne life, and make the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture more ſenſible and proportionable. As thus: A man hauing no charge to leaue behinde him, or little care of them, vſeth to lend out his money for ten in the hundred, <hi>if he ſhall liue vntill the daies of paiment;</hi> prouided alwaies, that if he the ſaid Creditor die, then his executors ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue but foure ſcore pound for the hundred pound. His caſe then ſtandeth thus: Firſt, he hopeth to liue many yeers, and when he dieth he is ſure to die but once: then ſhall his executors (who thoſe ſhall be God knowes, and not he): his executors, I ſay, ſhall pay twentie in the hundred, of ſuch ſummes only as then ſhall be abroad at vſe. Vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of this aduenture (which ſelfeloue in many maketh no aduenture) hee would lend his money, and liue vpon the loane, while he liueth. But tell me, in good ſooth, wilt thou take ten in the hundred if thou liue? then by this couenant thou wilt be an Vſurer if thou liue. No condition ſhall barre thee from it, but only death. Then, verely of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, thou muſt die an Vſurer by vertue of the ſame coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And tell me in thy conſcience, doeſt thou thinke thy Executors after thy death can redeeme thy ſoule from that ſinne wherein thou diedſt; by paying ſo much in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of thy wealth, which then ſhall be none of thine? <hi>Filij huius ſeculi;</hi> how wittie and ſubtill are the children of this world in twiſting ſnares to intangle their owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the houre of death? <hi>Qui volunt eſſe diuites:</hi> They that will be rich (ſaith the <note n="i" place="margin">1.

                        </gap>. Now there can be no exaction or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition vpon a free perſon but by way of couenant. A co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant is <hi>a mutuall agreement vpon a certaintie.</hi> Firſt it muſt be an agreement, that is, a voluntary conſent, preſuppoſing both libertie of will to giue aſſent, and abilitie of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to know the thing agreed vpon. Secondly, it muſt be mutuall. For though one partie agree vnto it, yet it is no couenant vnleſſe both giue conſent mutually. Thirdly, that mutuall agreement muſt be reduced vnto a certaintie, elſe it is void. If both parties doe not vnderſtand one certaine thing, it is no couenant: and therefore we ſee, that a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall couenant, becauſe it dependeth vpon ſome future vncertaintie, is no couenant at all; but vpon this condition, that, that vncertaine thing doe proue certaine.</p>
                     <p>If a mans money freely lent for a time, be by force retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned paſt that time, to the ſenſible detriment of the lender; we haue before concluded that a recompence is due. But in caſe a couenant bee made of free loane for ſuch a time, and if it be not repaied at ſuch a time, then ſo much to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for Intereſt: this couenant maketh vſurie, which before was none.</p>
                     <p>A man lendeth his neighbour a ſumme of money to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2101:21"/>
trade withall, and that freely. This borrower becommeth a gainer: out of his thankfull minde he doth gratifie the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with ſome part of his gaine. This is no vſurie, but a thankfull gratuitie, termed by the name of <hi>foenus liberale;</hi> and it is lawfull to giue and take, where it is not lawfull to couenant or contract before. For as to gratifie a Patrone for preferment, a Iudge for iuſtice, vpon any precedent ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, promiſe, or demaund, is <hi>Simonie</hi> in the Church, Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the Common-wealth: ſo is it vſurie in any faſhion to contract before the time of the loane. The reaſon of all this is, becauſe neither iuſtice, which God and nature haue made free for all; nor ſacred things ſanctified and ſet apart for the ſeruice of God; nor workes of mercie, bountie or fauour, as giuing and lending; are in their owne natures any waies capable of bargaine and ſale. Couenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that which poyſoneth the nature of them, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them into ſinne; the ſinne of Simonie, Briberie, Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: let them goe together.</p>
                     <p>But that men deceiue not themſelues in miſtaking this terme of <hi>Couenant,</hi> vnderſtand briefly the latitude of it: It is either reall, by pawne laid in both for principall and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: Or literall, by writing without pawne, as by bill, booke, or bond: Or perſonall, without writing, in taking another man for ſuretie befides the borrower: Or verball; either by promiſe without ſuretie before witneſſe, or by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſtipulation, betweene themſelues without witneſſe: Or ſilent, without word, witneſſe, writing, or pawne: and this ſilence either of one partie, or both. Of one thus:</p>
                     <p>An Vſurer ſaith, <hi>I will lend you thus much money, but ſo much Intereſt you ſhall pay me.</hi> The borrower takes it in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: this ſilence is a promiſe, and that promiſe a couenant. Nay, where there is ſilence on both ſides, there may be an vſurious couenant. A common borrower commeth to a common Vſurer to take vp an hundred pound for three moneths; there is neither bill, bond, promiſe, nor demaund for any Intereſt: only this; the borrower knoweth how that Vſurer neuer lendeth his money but for tenne in the

hundred. Likewiſe the Vſurer knoweth how that borrower neuer taketh vp, but vpon Intereſt. The very act of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lending in theſe two parties by common intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a couenant for Vſurie: and euery couenant what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, whether it be ſilent or expreſſe; whether it be bare and naked in promiſe, or inueſted by further ſecuritie, if it be a couenant for loane, it is Vſurie.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y that which briefly hath been deliuered, it may in ſome ſort appeare, how vſurie hath been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and what it is. The Gentiles, both Romanes and Grecians, led by the light of nature, termed it the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall brood or generation of that which by nature is barren. The ſpirit of God in Scripture hath branded all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ouerplus, whatſoeuer aboue the principall, by the name of a biter or gnawer; as appeareth by the exegeticall ioyning of <hi>Tarbith</hi> with <hi>Neſhec,</hi> in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Which increaſe and ouerplus comming for the loane, either of money, or any thing which paſſeth by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, weight or meaſure, if it come meerely for loane, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other valuable conſideration: and meerely for that loane which paſſeth ouer the propertie, and with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie the perill and aduenture of the principall: and if it come for this loane, not by way of gratuitie afterward freely giuen; nor in the name of ſatisfaction for damage ſuffered by the lender without his owne act and conſent; but by former couenant and voluntarie contract betwixt the borrower and the lender: and if this couenant be for lucre and gaine, cleere gaine, valuable gaine, ratable at a certaine price, either in money or money worth; then is it that vſurie whereof the queſtion moued is now to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed: <hi>Whether it be a thing indifferent in it owne nature, in any kinde allowable;</hi> or, <hi>whether it be ſimplie to be condemned as a ſinne before God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this defining of Vſurie, and diſtinguiſhing of it from all ſuch practiſes as be only like vnto it, and doe border vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; we ought ſo neere as wee can, to cut it by a threed; and in the examining of the ſeuerall branches we ſhall meet with much finer and ſubtiller threeds, then hitherto wee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2101:23"/>
haue: (ouer fine, I confeſſe, for ſo blunt an inſtrument.) Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this caueat I would gladly commend vnto you before hand; that if this vſurie thus deſcribed, do proue to be a ſinne of that nature and degree, as I am afraid it will; men would not inure themſelues in their commerce to coaſt ouer neere vpon it, leſt by little and little they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by ſo ſweete and pleaſant a baite, as this kinde of lucre is: for the ſweeter bait the diuell vſeth, the more dangerous is the hooke. It was the wiſedome of God in the training vp of his Church at the firſt, to make Ceremoniall lawes, as a pale to hedge in and compaſſe his Morall law, like the railes about Mount Sinay; to the end that by the obſeruing of the Ceremoniall, men might be kept aloofe from the tranſgreſſion of that which is Morall; as the abſtaining from the blood of beaſts taught them how farre they ſhould bee from blood-thirſtines and crueltie towards man. A point ſo eaſie that it is obſerued in matters moſt triuiall. A man will not ride ſo neere the brink of a pit or ditch as he can, for feare of falling, but keepe a certaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance off, that he may be the more ſecure. It is wiſedome in iourneying, I would to God it were ſo in liuing. For as in nature, oppoſites meete not without a middle nature, ſo in moralitie, Vertue and Vice touch not without ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing. There be certaine brackiſh qualities which ſauour of vice, yet cannot abſolutely be condemned; euen ſo for vſurie: there be ſome contracts neere vpon it, which notwithſtanding being filed and refined with many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions and cautions, may happelie proue indifferent and lawfull: yet ſure it is, thoſe men who will not abſtaine from ſome things which are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſhall of neceſſity commit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things which are vnlawfull.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. Wherein are propounded places of proofe from authoritie.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL proofe is reduced generally to two heads: Authoritie, and Reaſon. In the former wee ſee with other mens eyes: In the ſecond with our owne. And though it bee a wiſe mans part to ſee with his owne eyes; yet muſt wee bee fooles firſt, that wee may be wiſe; Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes, before we be Conduits: for hee that will not ſuffer himſelfe to be led firſt and guided by others, ſhall neuer be able to finde the right way himſelfe: and certes, good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, neuer had aduerſarie but pride and ſingularitie: I meane the authoritie of the moſt and the wiſeſt.</p>
                     <p>Let vs conſider then in the firſt part of this booke, what they haue thought in former ages of this point, who haue been much wiſer then our ſelues, and haue had as iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to looke into it: for Vſurie is no new deuice, but an ancient ſinne, which hath been continually practiſed in all ages, and in the moſt famous and flouriſhing nations of the world. The authoritie therefore of the wiſe and learned in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2101:24"/>
former times ought to be a great motiue to ſway our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this point; and if there be any goodneſſe or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full moderation in vſury, doubtleſſe ſome of them haue found it out.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 But before we come vnto them, we will firſt lay that diuine authoritie for a foundation to the reſt, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception. For the teſtimonie of authoritie, which of all arguments in Logicke is the weakeſt, is the ſtrongeſt in Diuinitie.</p>
                     <p>Let vs ſee therefore in the firſt place, what the Scripture ſaith of vſurie, for it, or againſt it. For where that Oracle vouchſafeth to ſpeake, there is not any need of further au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie for confirmation. They are therefore ouer ſimple, who doe imagine that humane authoritie is alleaged to adde authoritie vnto Scripture; as if that were defectiue: <hi>Sola ſufficit ad omnia ſatis ſuperque:</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis.</note> It is alone alſufficient for authoritie, if it be not miſtaken. The Church therefore doth comment vpon the Scripture, only for explication of the text. The text is abſolute in it ſelfe, but obſcure vnto vs, in regard of the weakenes of our vnderſtandings, and variety of apprehenſions. We muſt therefore of neceſſitie borrow light from others, eſpecially in theſe difficult caſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which ſubtill wits haue ſpun into ſo many fine threads, and which depend vpon ſo many circumſtances.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And becauſe conſent of Churches doth adde great validitie vnto authoritie, it will not be amiſſe firſt to ſee what the Fathers of the Eaſt Church thought among the Grecians; and how the Weſterne Church hath ſeconded the ſame among the Romanes in her puritie, before ſuch time as corruption had ouergrowne her.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Afterward when corruption both in doctrine and manners had ſpread ouer, and blemiſhed the face of the Church, it wil be obſeruable, how this doctrine concerning vſurie did preſerue her ancient integritie.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But becauſe all theſe are but the teſtimonies of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall learned men in their writings, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which may be added as the voice of the Church ioyntly aſſembled in Councels,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2101:25"/>
will carrie more weight with it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Moreouer, becauſe a dwarſe ſet vpon a Giants ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hauing the vantage of his whole body, may happily ſee further then the Giant himſelfe; we will ſee what our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne writers haue added vnto the authoritie aforeſaid; and whether our reformed Churches haue reformed any thing concerning this point. All theſe put together (if they had a good Collector) would make ſo ſufficient a comment vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the law of God concerning vſurie, as a man of learning and modeſtie would not eaſily gaineſay.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But we haue yet a larger field to walke in: for this is a queſtion of that nature, as is not onely determinable by the law of God in Scripture; but alſo by the law of Nature, thoſe maximes and principles of common equitie, which are written in the hearts of men by the finger of God. Thoſe ſtudents of Nature therfore, the Philoſophers, may of right challenge a voice in this buſineſſe.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the experience and practife of States and Common-wealthes doth adde much to the twilight of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially in theſe matters of negotiation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce betweene man and man; it will not be much out of the way, to obſerue by the way, what ſuch writers haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in their Politikes, for the publik good; which in this point is eſpecially to bee obſerued, euen for conſcience ſake.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Laſt of all, becauſe we haue not a better rule to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by, in the ſearching of what is good and lawfull in a well gouerned eſtate, then thoſe wholeſome lawes which haue been eſtabliſhed vpon ſage aduice and deliberation, out of long experience, and the receiued grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equitie: it will be behooffull and materiall to liſten a little to the Canon and Ciuill lawes, which haue gouerned ſo many Nations, both Chriſtian and Heathen: and finally, to returne home and note (though briefly, as becommeth Diuines) what the Municipal, or Common law of this land, vnto which wee are ſubiect, hath decreed concerning this matter.</p>

Now if theſe authorities ſhall ioyne in one againſt vſury, they who ſhall oppoſe themſelues in defence thereof, had need to come well appointed with ſtrong arguments and ſound reaſons, or elſe me thinkes we ſhould hardly beleeue them.</p>

                        <p>The firſt is verball (which wee touched in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt booke) in laying hold vpon the biting
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2101:26"/>
word <hi>Neſhec,</hi> auoiding the other word <hi>Tarbith;</hi> as if that would bite the cauſe. This verily is hard dealing, when the holy Ghoſt ioyneth two words of purpoſe together, both in the law and Prophets, to make his meaning full; that we ſhould preſſe the one, and leaue the other. When God is not content to forbid biting vſurie onely in <hi>Neſhec,</hi> but all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in <hi>Tarbith</hi> and <hi>Marbith,</hi> doubling the ſecond fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame roote, as if he would ſet the Emphaſis purpoſely vpon increaſe; theſe will haue it ſet vpon <hi>Neſhec,</hi> biting vſurie. What is it then which they would ſo gladly wring out of <hi>Neſhec?</hi> Forſooth that no vſurie is forbidden in Gods law, but onely biting vſury. And that there is no biting vſury, but when it is felt and knowne to bite (for wee muſt giue them that in, beſides, or elſe they be neuer a whit the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.) Alas good ſimple widowes, who are taught to liue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in the feare of God vpon vſurie; can they tell when, or whom, or how many their vſurie doth bite? Nay can the wiſeſt vſurers of them all tell? For if the borrower be bitten, he had beſt to keepe his owne counſell, and to ſet his beſt face vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: otherwiſe if the Vſurers do once ſmel him to be downe the wind, he ſhall ſeldome find them within. Can they tell when the Common-weale is bitten? Can they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne how many poore people ſhall pay a pennie in the pound the dearer for them and their fellowes? No, no, vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie walketh in the darke, it biteth, few know, when, where, or how. Onely thus much in general we muſt needs know, that the borrowers vpon vſurie cannot afford their ware ſo good cheape by nine or tenne in the hundreth, as if their ſtocks were free; and yet muſt they needs ſell as the market goeth. Therefore if there be not a ſufficient number to raiſe the market to their price, and ſo to caſt the burthen vpon the people, they themſelues ſhall feele the weight of it. To make this more plaine by the moſt accuſtomed and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate vſurie of theſe times. If money be lent to ſpend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſaries, there is no manner of queſtion made, but the borrower is ſore bitten in paying vſury, when he hath ſpent the principall. If it be lent to lay out for gaine, then muſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2101:26"/>
the borrower firſt be ſure of ſo much cleare gaine, as will pay the vſe, which is a reaſonable gaine of it ſelfe. For the Vſurers of nine or tenne in the hundreth doe liue well of their trade and grow rich by it. Yea many honeſt tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will confeſſe, that if they could with their owne free ſtocke raiſe the like gaine one time with another, that the Vſurer doth with his moneies; and with the like ſecuritie of the principall; they would thinke they had made a very good market, notwithſtanding all their care and trauell.</p>
                        <p>This reaſonable gain then muſt firſt be raiſed by the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, to pay the Vſurer; and ouer and aboue he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this reaſonable gaine, to maintaine himſelfe and his ſeruants, becauſe this gaine is none of his. If he doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed then, and that in ſome proportion, he hath loſt his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſhall feele himſelfe ſore bitten. If the borrower doe exceed the Vſurers gaine to maintaine himſelfe; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand then who paieth this exceſſiue gaine ouer and aboue that reaſonable gaine of tenne in the hundred? Who but the Common-weale? Not ſo (ſaith the Vſurer;) for the borrower muſt ſell as the market goeth. It is very true. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſay I) if hee and his fellowes be not able to raiſe the market to their owne price, they ſhall bee loſers: If they can inhaunce it (as they may the more eaſilie, becauſe the number of ſuch borrowers is great, and becauſe the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſell as deere as they can, will moſt willingly ioyne with them) then the Common-weale muſt needs beare the burthen, and eſpecially the poorer ſort, who buying all by piece-meale at the laſt hand, muſt be ſore bitten, though they know not by whom. One of the biting dogs which pincheth them ſore, is vſurie. Yet gladly would they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs, that vſurie in ſome other reſpect by way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, doth licke them whole againe. Becauſe by this meanes (forſooth) money is more ſtirring, and ſo by a quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker turne and returne, euery commoditie is more plentifull: for charitie and friendſhip in theſe daies bee not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that men would lend out their money ſo freely, if they had not gaine for the vſe. This is very true, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2101:27"/>
And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of vſurie hath taught men to ſet a price vpon charitie and friendſhip; as if he, who lent his friend or a yong begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner one hundred pound for a yeere, did in effect giue him tenne pound cleere out of his purſe. But admit this dogge were tied vp; would rich men preiudice the Common-weale in theſe daies, by impriſoning their moneies in their coffers, thinke you? Verily if vſurie were not, men would tenter their wits, either in trading themſelues, or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others; rather then ſo current and neceſſarie a thing as money is, ſhould take ruſt in theſe peaceable and getting daies. But who would racke his braine, and moile himſelfe in the world, if he may ſit idle at home, and receiue ſo ſweet a gaine without labour, coſt, or aduenture? So that if bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers eſcape, the Common-weale muſt beare it. If the Common-weale goe free (as ſeldome it doth) the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are bitten. Sometime the burthen is diuided betwixt them; and ſtill the Vſurer is the gainer.</p>
                        <p>Vſury then biteth one or other, little or much, according to the degree of the intereſt: from the biting of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wolfe to the flea-biting: from that <hi>Centeſima,</hi> the <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 3.</note> hundreth part monethly, which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> complaineth of, which is twelue in the hundred (the moſt that we find tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <note place="margin">Nehe. 5. 11.</note> euer amongſt the Heathen) vnto that <hi>ſemiuncianum foenus,</hi> tenne ſhillings in a hundred pounds, ſcarce ſenſible: So that in euery <hi>Tarbith,</hi> there is a <hi>Neſhec,</hi> a tooth in euery vſurie: which becauſe it cannot be alwaies felt, or percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it hath pleaſed God to adde that other terme, which is more ſenſible, <hi>vſurie</hi> or <hi>increaſe.</hi> The deuiſers therefore of this diſtinction, of biting and toothleſſe vſury, forced out of the word <hi>Neſhec,</hi> haue diſcouered two errors, whereupon they ſeeme to build as vpon a ſure foundation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, they preſuppoſe, that if vſurie doe not bite the borrower, it biteth none at all; as if the publike good were not to be regarded, but euery man were for himſelfe, and his priuat commoditie. Which if it might be granted, then a man of credit might take vp money enough at intereſt to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2101:27"/>
buy vp a whole commoditie, to ſell it after his owne price and pleaſure. The Vſurer &amp; borrower here be ſafe enough; for the poore people ſhall pay double, and make both gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This is too plaine.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Next they doe imagine, that except the biting of vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie be ſenſible and apparant, there is no iniquitie at all. But there be <hi>myſteries of iniquitie,</hi> which are not diſcernable to a vulgar eye at the firſt ſight. There may be iniurie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out damage, and damage without ſenſe. Therefore as the holy Ghoſt hath expreſſed the ſenſible biting of vſurie in <hi>Neſhec:</hi> ſo hath he forbidden that which is more ſecret and couered in the word <hi>Tarbith;</hi> elſe wherefore ſhould <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith</hi> be added vnto <hi>Neſhec,</hi> both in the letter of the Law and the Prophets? either it muſt be added by way of an <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>It is the manner of holy Scripture after that a law is giuen and a ſinne forbidden in a ſenſible terme; by the addition of a more generall terme, to expreſſe Gods meaning more fully; leſt men ſhould ſeeke libertie in reſtraining the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer terme more narrowly.</p>
                        <p>The Commandement againſt theft is ſet downe in the ſenſible terme of <hi>ſtealing:</hi> the iniquitie whereof is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſenſible, diſcerned at the firſt ſight to be iniurious.

which hath no colour of equitie, God hath therefore added a more generall terme, forbidding all increaſe: adding that terme euer in the ſecond place, as an explication of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

                        <p>The ſecond exception is perſonal. We are forbidden (ſay they) to take vſurie of the poore, but not of the rich; for ſo <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 15.</note> runneth the text: <hi>If thou lend money to my people, that is, to the poore, thou ſhalt not be as an Vſurer vnto him, thou ſhalt not oppreſſe him.</hi> Againe, <hi>If thy brother be impoueriſhed or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into decay, thou ſhalt take no vſurie of him.</hi> Whereupon they would inferre, therefore of the rich thou maiſt take.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two anſwers be current in euery ones mouth. Firſt, <hi>that God for bad onely biting vſurie.</hi> Next, <hi>that wee muſt not lend vpon vſurie to the poore.</hi> Are we forbidden then to bite the poore only? and is it lawfull to bite the rich? <hi>If thou lend money to my people, that is, to the poore, thou ſhalt not be a Noſhec vnto him;</hi> that is, <hi>a biting Vſurer.</hi> Maiſt thou then be <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 15.</note> a <hi>Noſhec,</hi> a biting Vſurer to the rich?</p>
                        <p>See then how vnſutable theſe conceits are, that one ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth another. Is it onely biting and oppreſſing vſurie which Gods law forbiddeth? then ſurely there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, we muſt not bite or wrong any, be he rich or poore.</p>
                        <p>But what is their reaſon, why wee may lend vpon vſurie
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2101:28"/>
to the rich? becauſe there is mention of the poore only in the text, therefore it is likely the rich are not meant. It is true the poore are mentioned, and for that God ſaw great reaſon, becauſe they be moſt likely to borrow, and readieſt to be oppreſſed. And in the wilderneſſe where this law was giuen, there was none borrowed but only for need: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the poore only mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Immediatly before this law of vſurie in Exod. 22. 22. is there a law for widowes and fatherleſſe children: <hi>Thou ſhalt not trouble any widow, or fatherleſſe child.</hi> Doth it therefore follow that thou maiſt trouble a maried woman, or a childe that hath a father?

                        <p>Obſerue further in the very text, as if God of purpoſe would preuent this cauill. In Deuteronomie there is no mention of the poore at all, but the Law is deliuered in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall termes, <note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 23. 19.</note>

                        <p>Adde moreouer, that as when the Law was giuen, there was none that borrowed but only the poore vpon neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: ſo afterwards in the <note n="i" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 13. 17.

If the law of God ſhould extend no further then to the perſons mentioned at the firſt giuing of it, wee ſhould make it very defectiue. For being giuen in the wilderneſſe

                        <p>Laſt of all, it ſhall appeare that there may be as vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and as biting vſurie in lending to the rich, becauſe he is rich; as to the poore, becauſe he is poore.

                        <p>Becauſe thou wilt not oppreſſe the poore, thou wilt lend thy moneys to a rich Merchant, who ſhall take no hurt, but gaine largely both for himſelfe and thee. I demaund then to what end doth he borrow, being of ſo ſufficient wealth? Forſooth that hee may compaſſe greater matters then his owne ſtock will reach vnto. I aske then, what warrant there is in equitie and conſcience, either for him to borrow, or thee to lend?</p>
                        <p>If God hath bleſſed him with a ſtocke of his owne, by which he may liue in good faſhion, ſhall hee out of a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and vaine humour to become a Royall Merchant, reach beyond his reach? <hi>Let him plough with his owne heifer,</hi> and <note n="m" place="margin">Pro. 5. 15</note>

Gods law did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that none ſhould borrow but for need. A rich man, I confeſſe, may need vpon occaſion, and thou maiſt lend him freely to receiue the like courteſie from him another time:

but to lend him that hee may get double or trebble gaine for thee and himſelfe, with thy wealth (who perhaps is of Maſter <note n="o" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> fol. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>Gromelgainer</hi> his opinion, who thought in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that a Merchants gaine is not to be ſtinted;) to lend to ſuch a one, I ſay, is to feed a greedie and ambitious mind in another, for which thou ſtandeſt anſwerable; becauſe thy money if it come to thee on Gods name, is Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and God hath made thee a ſteward of his bleſſings; thou muſt therefore giue an account, when thou giueſt vp thy ſtewardſhip, how thy money hath been imployed.</p>
                        <p>Lend not then to the rich, becauſe he is rich. For as to lend him freely is no charitie, becauſe he needs it not; ſo to lend him vpon vſury is no equitie, becauſe thou doſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enable, yea and incourage him the more to fat himſelfe by feeding vpon the Common-wealth: who will bee ſure with thy money to pay thy vſurie; to bee a ſweete gainer himſelfe, and to ſupply all by-loſſes beſides, or he will want of his will.</p>
                        <p>It was not therefore the meaning of God in his law to make any ſuch perſonall limitation of lending to the poore only, ſeeing that by this kind of loane euen to the rich alſo, there may be biting and oppreſſion in great meaſure: which caſes though they be not eſſentiall to the act of vſurie, yet are they ſufficient to demonſtrate that the perſonall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of poore and rich, doth make no reall diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt lawfull and vnlawfull vſurie; which is to the purpoſe of this ſecond exception.</p>
                        <p>Let vs ſee further if there bee any other ſhift which the wit of man hath deuiſed to auoid this law of God.

                        <p>So that whoſoeuer tranſgreſſeth the law, tranſgreſſeth iuſtice or charitie; though not all alike, nor in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of euidence to be diſcerned; but ſome more obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then other: which thing begetteth ſo many difficult ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of iuſtice in lawes, and of conſcience in Diuinitie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which this caſe of vſurie is not the leaſt, becauſe the iniquitie of it cannot ſo eaſily be diſcerned, as of theft and bare faced robberie, whoſe malice and iniuſtice doth open it ſelfe to the firſt ſight. And that vſurie is a thing in it ſelfe inordinate, and ſo conſequently oppoſite to iuſtice and charitie both, ſhall be more fully expreſſed when we come to the arguments drawne from thoſe places. But our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſſe in this Chapter is to deale with the very text of Scripture, the written law of God.</p>
                        <p>Their meaning then who would patronize vſurie is this: that Gods expreſſe law againſt it is not morall binding Chriſtians; but iudiciall or politike only, framed peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that Common-wealth of the Iewes. Which conceit likewiſe ouerthroweth that former diſtinction of biting vſurie: for if God in that law doe forbid biting and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vſurie only, then is that law morall binding Chriſtians as well as Iewes: except they would muzzle the Iewes, and giue Chriſtians libertie to bite and oppreſſe their brethren. Theſe groundleſſe conceits are built likewiſe with vntem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered morter, they ouerthrow one another and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>

                        <p>Of which peculiar permiſſion there was ſpeciall cauſe: whether we take it for all ſtrangers in generall, or for the Cananites and thoſe who dwelt among them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>

                        <p>Beſides, ſuch was the hardnes of Iewiſh hearts, that if they might not haue taken vſurie of ſtrangers, they alſo would haue made a pray euen of their owne brethren.

                        <p>Laſt of all, let that permiſſion of lending to a ſtranger paſſe as nothing concerning Chriſtians, becauſe the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wall being taken away, we are all brethren: and then the queſtion for the interpretation of the law dependeth chiefly vpon this point, how farre that law of <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt vſurie did binde the Iewes among themſelues?</p>

doe warrant vs. But for matter of equitie and charitie among brethren, God did vſe more toleration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuencie towards them, then he doth toward Chriſtians, of right looking for more fruite at our hands then theirs, in regard of that Goſpell of grace which we doe enioy.</p>

                     <p>When after in proceſſe of time the practiſe of it grew more common among Chriſtians; yet the learned amongſt them would giue moſt hard cenſure vpon Vſurers in their writings &amp; preachings. <note n="c" place="margin">Petrus Bleſenſ. Epiſt. 131.</note>

the barrennes of money, and the vnnaturall brood of vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, being mingled with metaphors, if it be not rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, is obſcure and doubtfull.

                           <hi>Chemnitius</hi> therefore in his treatiſe againſt vſurie, doth aduiſe vs not to lay ſo much weight vpon theſe arguments as vpon thoſe reaſons, which are deriued from Scripture: and albeit theſe alſo haue ſome force in them being vrged to the right purpoſe (as hereafter we ſhall haue occaſion to examine;) yet I doe verely perſwade my ſelfe, that the very conceit of the weakenes of theſe grounds, hath moued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to thinke more fauourably of vſurie it ſelfe then there is iuſt cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Another motiue which cauſed theſe Diuines ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to decline the beaten way in this point; was, becauſe in deteſtation of vſurie ſome lawfull contracts alſo haue been condemned by ſome for vſurie, which doe but coaſt vpon it: ſo that the very point of difference betweene vs for the matter it ſelfe, doth onely concerne ſome caſes of greater difficultie, whoſe equitie or iniquitie can hardly bee diſcerned. Caſes of a mixt and midling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betweene vſurie and partnerſhip, or ſome like law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contract; in which caſes, if vpon examination there

                     <p>Thus much for that inartificiall argument which is taken from the teſtimonie of authoritie. An argument, I confeſſe, very inartificiall, as I haue made it: yet is the authoritie ſo ſufficient as I would deſire. Authoritie of all ſorts diuine

If any ſhall be ſo ſingularly conceited of himſelfe, as to make no queſtion after all theſe, but that vſurie is lawful; I will leaue him in the number of thoſe wiſe men (whereof <note n="a" place="margin">Prou. 26. 16.</note>

Secondly, ſome are not reſolued at all, but hang in ſuſpence, and to them it is a ſinne, if it were in no other reſpect, yet onely becauſe they doubt of it: for that which <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of eating, is likewiſe appliable to all other actions: <hi>He that doubteth is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if he eate, becauſe he eateth not of faith.</hi> So he that doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of any morall action whatſoeuer, if hee doe it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, becauſe hee doth it not of faith: for <hi>what ſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne.</hi> If thou doubt therefore, keepe <note n="e" place="margin">In Rom. 14.</note> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> his rule: <hi>Tene certum, dimitte incertum:</hi> thou art moſt ſure it is no ſinne to abſtaine from vſurie: then keepe that reſolution firme, and thou ſhalt be ſafe: though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou thinke, if thou abſtaine thou ſhalt haue the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter purſe, yet withall thou ſhalt haue the lighter heart, when the ſorrowes of death ſhall make thee heauie. Though in myſteries of Diuinitie, the narroweſt ſenſe is the ſafeſt: yet in matters of moralitie the largeſt ſenſe is the beſt for ſecuritie; in that it keepeth vs fartheſt off from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting vnto ſinne.</p>

If there be a third ſort who be cleerely reſolued that vſurie may bee practiſed with a ſafe conſcience, ſuch are condemned of other ſinnes beſides vſurie; but eſpecially of pride and ſingularitie. Of ſuch a one therefore I demand: Firſt, doeſt thou ſee with thine owne eyes, or with other mens? If thou be not able thy ſelfe to examine and reſolue, then maiſt thou reſolue for this point as the Church of Chriſt hath taught thee. Neither doe I herein coaſt vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny controuerſie of <hi>beleeuing as the Church beleeueth:</hi> for this that we haue in hand is no principle of faith; no myſterie of ſaluation to be apprehended in the ſimplicitie of beliefe;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2101:46"/>
but a point of moralitie belonging to the ſecond table, and ſo determinable in reaſon by the rules of equitie and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if the Scripture herein had been ſilent. If thou be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnlearned, or not ſo learned as to define ſuch a matter by the rules of reaſon; then reaſon and religion both will teach thee to ſubmit thy iudgement to that Church and Common-wealth, whereof by Gods prouidence thou art made a member. But theſe reſolute ſpirits will be eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to take the matter into their owne hands without dependance vpon others. I demand then in the next place, haſt thou ſtudied the point, examined the branches of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly? art thou reſolued that though the letter of the text be againſt thee, yet the ſenſe is with thee? haſt thou taken a view of all arguments and reaſons brought againſt Vſurie? art thou ſo Eagle-ſighted as to looke through ſuch a cloud of witneſſes; and art thou able to diſpell them, and to ſettle thine owne aſſertion vpon infallible grounds? art thou ſure of all this, or doſt thou but thinke ſo? If thou but think ſo; then thinke thou maieſt bee deceiued. If thou bee ſure that thou haſt waighed all thoſe things in the balance of iudgement; then next waigh thy ſelfe and thy iudgement: lay that vpon one ſcoale by it ſelfe, and if thou haſt any conſorts and fellowes in this thy reſolution (as for mine owne part I know none) if thou haſt any, hang them all vpon the ſame ſcoale with thee. Put ouer againſt thee in the other ſcoale al the authorities of men, fathers and brethren; who haue not touched onely, but taken in hand and ſifted this point. Adde vnto theſe the decrees of Councels, the edicts of Princes, the lawes and ſtatutes of Common-weales: lay on, if you liſt, the cenſure of Philoſophers in their morals and politickes, the obſeruations of Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, the ſayes of wiſe and ſage Senators; and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experiments of many kingdomes and nations in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. All which if they ſhould be collected and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the full, I ſuppoſe a volume would not containe that which might iuſtly be written againſt Vſurie. Now if thou ſhalt thinke thy iudgement to bee of ſuch waight, that all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2101:46"/>
theſe together bee not able to caſt the ſcoale againſt thee, yet I hope they will ſo much moue thee, as to bring the balance to a ſuſpence, that thou wilt thinke Vſurie very queſtionable at the leaſt; and if it bee queſtionable, then is it vnlawfull to bee done. But if all theſe will not ſo moue thy vnderſtanding as to make it queſtionable; then I will ſay no more, and I can ſay no leſſe, but ſuch a one thinketh that he knoweth ſomwhat.

                     <p>To him therefore who knoweth Vſurie to be a ſin, it is a ſin, becauſe he knoweth it. To him that doubteth, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a ſin, becauſe he doubteth.

I demand then in the next place, if we bee not bound in conſcienceto obey this law? I ſay not in court of Iuſtice only before man, but in conſcience before God.</p>
                     <p>The <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> Apoſtle maketh a direct anſwere for me: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt be ſubiect, not becauſe of wrath onely, but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake.</hi> A conſcience ſo bound, as nothing can ſet it at liberty in this caſe except only the law it ſelfe be vnlawfull; and then <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 5. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>we muſt obey God rather then men.</hi> Therfore when this kind of argument is vrged for obedience, men haue vſed to quarrell with the law; as if that were not agreeable to Gods law: But heere is no place for any ſuch cauill; for it is the ſame law which God himſelfe made for his owne
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2101:48"/>
people, witneſſe euen thoſe who haue moſt defended vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <note place="margin">Mclinaeus.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I haue heard many, and ſome of no meane vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, who doe earneſtly endeuour to let looſe their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and teach vs ſo to doe, by making a diſiunctiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of a penall ſtatute. As if the meaning of the law were but this; <hi>Either abſtaine, or pay thus much, if thou be conuicted.</hi> Making the penaltie a branch of the law: as if either of the branches being obſerued, the law were fullie kept, and no offence made either to God or man. Which becauſe it is a point much ſtood vpon, and as yet (for ought that I know) vnhandled, giue me leaue, by your patience, a little to looke into it. In the examining whereof I ſhall not much ſtep out of my way. For albeit the interpretation of a ſtatute doth belong vnto another profeſſion; yet this particular point coaſteth vpon Diuinitie, and pitcheth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly vpon the common grounds of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>In euery penall ſtatute there be two things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; the <hi>law</hi> and the <hi>penaltie.</hi> Which two, howſoeuer they be combined in the ſtatute, yet there muſt be a diſtinct conſideration of each.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, euery good and iuſt law in his owne nature, as it is a law, hath a binding power; by which it is not directiue only, as by way of aduertiſement, but compulſiue, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from authoritie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, this binding power of the law doth not onely proceed from the nature of the thing therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or forbidden, but from the powerfull will of the Commander or lawgiuer. For if a common perſon ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh me, as a brother, of ſome thing which is hurtfull or preiudiciall, I am bound to follow his aduice, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelfe, becauſe it is hurtfull; elſe I ſhould offend. But if the authoritie of parents, Magiſtrates, or law, ſhall moreouer forbid the ſame, I haue a ſecond bond thereby laid vpon me; which if I ſhall breake, then vnto my former offence I ſhall adde the ſinne of diſobedience. Which as it is a diſtinct ſinne from the former, ſo be theſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2101:49"/>
two diſtinct obligations; the one deriued from the nature of the thing prohibited; the other from the law or perſons in authoritie.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Admit then in the third place that the thing prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the premiſed authoritie, haue no binding power in it own nature, without a law publiſhed againſt it; but be a thing arbitrarie, and in my power to doe or leaue vndone; then am I freed indeed from the former bond in reſpect of the thing it ſelfe: notwithſtanding I ſtand obliged to the authoritie of the law for the faithful obſeruing of the ſame; except only in caſe the thing thereby forbidden be of ſuch a nature, as doth diſſolue this bond, by ſome oppoſition to a ſuperiour law. For thoſe matters therefore which bee not determined by any law of God, there is giuen to the wiſe ſages and gouernours of Common-weales, a iudiciall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, not onely to diſcerne what is for the common good, but alſo to enact, impoſe, and eſtabliſh lawes and ſtatutes, vnto which we are bound both to ſubſcribe in iudgement, and in practiſe to obey. Albeit ſuch a law cannot by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſequence bee neceſſarily deriued from any law of God or reaſon, yet if it doe not croſſe or oppoſe the ſame, it is ſufficient. As lawes which are apparantly friuolous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining matter of little moment, need not much to trouble our conſciences, becauſe there appeareth ſome oppoſition betweene them and the law of reaſon, which teacheth vs that a law is a matter of maieſtie, and ſerious command; and therefore the ſubiect of it ought to be anſwerably a matter of waight and moment, as the matter of vſurie is. Be it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propoſed that thoſe wholeſome lawes and ſtatutes which carrie no ſhew of oppoſition to a ſuperiour law, though they command or forbid ſuch things as before were held indifferent, yet euen as they are lawes doe they binde the conſcience by vertue of Gods law.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Which lawes thus enacted, by humane authoritie, be in force, not onely before the Iudge to the vndergoing of temporall puniſhment; but alſo to binde the conſcience before God: not by any power in themſelues, for they be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2101:49"/>
but humane; but, as ſecondarie cauſes doe worke in the vertue of the firſt cauſe, ſo doe theſe lawes worke vpon the conſcience, by vertue of his law who alone hath the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authoritie ouer the inward man. He hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to obey, <hi>not becauſe of wrath only;</hi> not for penalties, diſpleaſure, or outward reſpect only, <hi>but for conſcience ſake.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> Thus much, I hope, we ſhall be able to proue. Whereupon it muſt of neceſſitie follow, that admit euery act of vſurie were not ſimply in it ſelfe vnlawfull; yet if it be ſimply for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by a law publiſhed, as a thing perilous among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or preiudiciall to the common good; then are wee bound in conſcience to auoid euery vſurious act as <hi>malum prohibitum,</hi> forbidden by a good and wholſome law. Which law if we ſhall tranſgreſſe, we doe ſinne againſt God.</p>
                     <p>Let this therefore in the firſt place be propounded, that ſuch humane lawes as be not oppoſite vnto the law of God or nature, haue a binding power: howbeit not alwaies from the nature of the thing it ſelfe thereby commanded, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; but euen as they be lawes proceeding from that authoritie which is the ordinance of God.</p>
                     <p>Which that it may the better appeare, it is obſeruable, that almightie God did firſt aſſume vnto himſelfe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and power of binding mens conſciences meerely by his commanding authoritie, as hee was a law-giuer. Next that hee did impart the ſame (though not in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) to his vicegerents vpon earth.</p>
                     <p>It was his diuine pleaſure to manifeſt this power euen in the <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> firſt law that euer was giuen: for what hurt could there haue been in eating of the forbidden fruit, if it had not bin forbidden? why might not that tree haue been touched and taſted as well as the reſt, if there had not been an edict againſt it? <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 22. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> likewiſe after the fall was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to offer his ſonne <hi>Iſaac:</hi> which commandement, if it had not bin giuen, <hi>Abraham</hi> could neuer haue found any motiue for ſuch a ſacrifice: but much might he haue found againſt it, in that law of nature which was written in his heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:2101:50"/>
This degree of power God as the ſupreme lawgiuer hath reſerued wholly vnto himſelfe, ſo as it ſhall not bee lawfull for any created power whatſoeuer, to enact a law againſt the law of nature; or to diſpenſe with a diuine ſtatute. Yet notwithſtanding in caſe it carrie no oppoſition to a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour law, God hath giuen a binding power euen to the commandement of man, though not againſt, yet without any obligatorie vertue in the thing commanded: he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging in his diuine wiſedome that this was the beſt for the eſtabliſhing of authoritie amongſt men, for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of men in obedience, and euery way for the publique good. For if men ſhould not obey the lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their ſuperiours, before ſuch time as they ſaw ſomething in the thing commanded, which ſhould exact the ſame at their hands, verely the <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 8. 9.</note> Centurion did not well in approuing his ſouldiers for <hi>comming, going, and doing this,</hi> at a word: yea maſters had better a great deale goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their buſineſſe themſelues, then ſend many ſeruants: and if this were our caſe, all gouernment and, humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires would be ſoone at a ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore God doth not only allow thoſe lawes which doe enact that which is alr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4+ letters">

                        </gap> by neceſſarie conſequence, as a concluſion out of the premiſſes: but all thoſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and particular conſtitutions which doe not croſſe the law of God or nature, are in his eſtimate accounted iuſt, and to bee obeyed. For as Chriſt in the Goſpell ſaid of thoſe who did caſt out diuels in his name, <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 9. 50</note> 
                        <hi>He that is not againſt vs is with vs;</hi> ſo may God rightly be conceiued to eſteeme of all humane lawes, made for the reformation of manners; <hi>thoſe which are not againſt him are with him:</hi> and therefore by his law confirmed and made of force to binde the conſcience.</p>

                        <hi>Ionadab</hi> was dead three hundred yeeres before; but only they thought themſelues bound in conſcience to obey their fathers commandement.

                     </p>
                     <p>If a father then haue ſuch command ouer his ſonnes, for ſo many generations as were betweene the daies of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> and the raigne of <hi>Iehoiakim:</hi> how much more ſhall the lawes and ſtatutes inacted by the gouernours of Common-weales, and the bodie repreſentatiue aſſembled for the publike good, binde euery ſubiect to the obedience of the ſame?</p>
                     <p>But wee ſhall not neede to goe farre for an inſtance of this point. Our law at home is a pregnant proofe, that a law doth binde euen as it is a law, though the thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by impoſed be of it ſelfe moſt free and indifferent. I ſpeake of that <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>municipall</hi> law of our Countrie, whoſe <hi>maxims</hi> are not meerely grounded vpon the axioms and principles of reaſon and common equitie, but vpon the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar cuſtomes of this Countrie. I demaund then whence this law hath a binding power? Is it from the nature of the thing impoſed? doth it command or forbid nothing but that which out of the principles of nature and reaſon may by demonſtration be proued to be good or bad in it ſelfe? Verely then were it of as great power beyond Douer, as it is on this ſide: for the law of nature and reaſon is euerie where alike.</p>
                     <p>But it is the cuſtome of place and people which addeth power: for euen a cuſtome doth bind taking vpon it the nature of a law. <hi>Ligat conſuetudo quatenus interpretatiue lex est.</hi> Be it cuſtome then, or be it a perfect law, it muſt haue a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2101:51"/>
greater power of binding, euen as it is a cuſtom or a law, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can alwaies be raiſed out of the nature of the thing accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed or impoſed: For circumſtances may ſo alter the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that which is impoſed may be ſometimes not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, as in common intendment a good law doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. Yet hath it been euer though more conuenient, that ſome particular inconuenience ſhould bee borne, then an ancient cuſtome or law ſhould bee broken. And if the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power of a law ſhould worke no further then the thing it ſelfe, of it ſelfe, doth moue the conſcience without a law; then were it no power at all; but euery mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conſcience ſhould haue power to abrogate and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null, as faſt as authority doth inact. A priuate power then muſt not abrogate that which is publicke: <hi>Nihilagit vltra ſuam ſpeciem:</hi> but euery priuate man doth ſtand bound to a humane law, vntill the ſame authoritie which bound him doe abſolue him. All things therfore conſidered, it is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conceit to imagine, that the power of humane lawes doth extend no further then the qualitie of the thing it ſelfe doth carie the conſcience: and ſo dangerous, as if it ſhould take palce, it would violate that authority which is the ordinance of God; and ſhake the very pillers of the earth.</p>

                        <p n="2">2 Then for the penaltie (which maketh it a penall law) I demand what power that hath to alter the premiſſes? Is the vndergoing of ſuch a penaltie an expiation of the ſinne committed in tranſgreſſing the law? God forbid. The leaſt ſin deſerueth a greater puniſhment then man can inflict. Or hath it a power to diſſolue that bond which by vertue of Gods law lieth vpon my conſcience? Or is it ſo incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into the law, that it leaueth a free choice vnto men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently either to obſerue ſuch an act, or to vndergoe ſuch a penaltie?</p>
                        <p>Verily this is auerred; but the contrarie ſeemeth vnto me very pregnant, vpon theſe reaſons following.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Firſt (to make ſome way to that which followeth) it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2101:51"/>
is much to the preiudice and weakning of good lawes; to giue ſuch interpretations, as doe diſpence with the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſet that at libertie. For if men be taught to make no conſcience of this kind of obedience (as God knowes they make but little) ſuch lawes ſhall lie as contemptible in the eſtimate both of good and bad; as well of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient as of lawleſſe and vnruly people; euery man keeping or breaking the ſame, as ſhall ſeeme beſt for his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate aduantage. But I would rather thinke and teach, that as God Almightie is not an idle beholder of mens affaires, but hath a powerfull working in euery action; either to effect it or diſpoſe it vnto good: ſo ſitting, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, in the <hi>parliament</hi> or <hi>aſſemblie of gods,</hi> hee giueth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into euery good law enacted, and by his owne law bindeth the conſcience to the obedience of the fame.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The end of a law is to withold men from vnlawfull acts, ſuch as bee thought vnfit to bee done or ſuffered in a well eſtabliſhed gouernment. For if men would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues refraine, there ſhould be no vſe of lawes, as the <note n="a" place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 9.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith; <hi>The law is not giuen to the iuſt man, but to the laxleſſe and diſobedient.</hi> They be ſnaffles and bridles to curbe thoſe <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 32. 9.</note> horſes and mules which wil not otherwiſe be ruled. And conſequently the end of a penall law is by ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to withhold the diſobedient, that ſuch people might ſeele the ſmart of puniſhment who haue no ſenſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Firſt therefore, if men would bee good of themſelues, there ſhould need no lawes. Next, if men would make a conſcience to obey that law which is made, there ſhould need no penaltie to be annexed. As the law therefore is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for good manners; ſo the penaltie is a thing ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the law. Now it is premiſed, that euery good law without the penaltie by vertue of Gods law doth bind the conſcience: ſhall the penaltie then bee added to diſanull that bond? ſhall law and penaltie bee ſo incorporate and tempered together, that the one ſhall diſable the other? this is no good morter. Wee did rather thinke that penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were annexed to corroborate and ſtrengthen the law,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2101:52"/>
that by puniſhing tranſgreſſors according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and degree of the offence, men might bee the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to offend.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 But (to ſpeake in their language who doe vrge this interpretation) if a penall law be diſiunctiuely to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: that is, either to be obeyed, or elſe to vndergoe ſuch a forfeiture; I demand whether of theſe two is principally intended by the law? Doth the ſtatute firſt intend the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or doth it lie indifferent vnto both alike? If either of theſe, then is it an vniuſt law. For a good lawgiuer had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue his law kept then broken: the reaſon is, becauſe the obſeruation or keeping of it is ſimply good: but the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a tranſgreſſor hath in it the nature of euill, tearmed <hi>malum poenae;</hi> therefore a good intention is firſt moued vnto that which is good; <hi>that the law may beekept.</hi> And in the ſecond place, a puniſhment is intended, as it is a remedie againſt a greater euill then it ſelfe. I ſtand bound then euen in conſcience vnto a good law, according to the ſimple intent of it: that is to ſay, not becauſe of the penalty only, or, to ſpeak in the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt: <hi>not becauſe of wrath onely,</hi> (which is all one:) but chiefly that I may <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> performe that good thing which the law doth chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: which if I ſhall trangreſſe, the penaltie is indeed a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to that law, but no expiation of my ſinne of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Laſt of all, that we may cleere this ſtatute of all ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, (a ſtatute which hitherto hath had no blemiſh caſt <note place="margin">13. Elizab.</note> vpon it, being without the compaſſe and reach of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie exceptions, <hi>the oppoſition to Gods law,</hi> the <hi>abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtian libertie, ſcandall,</hi> and ſuch like ſtones which they vſe to fling at lawes:) If the Statute had any ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make a diſiunctiue law, how ſhall that appeare? For if it be not expreſſed, then is it by common intendment to be vnderſtood according to the premiſed rules: and to put it out of quarrell, that the contrary is intended, ſhall appeare by three points within the ſtatute.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Firſt, there is a ſpeciall clauſe in this ſtatute of Vſurie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2101:52"/>
that <hi>it ſhall bee moſt largely and ſtrongly conſtrued for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Vſurie againſt all perſons who ſhall offend.</hi> But this conſtruction doth contrariwiſe giue a liberty to commit Vſurie: ſo a man will venture the forfeiture in caſe he bee conuicted: Like the Phariſies Corban, who if the offrings be brought, will diſpence with obedience and honour due <note place="margin">Mark. 7. Hoſ. 7. 11.</note> to parents. This is * <hi>to eate the ſinnes of the people,</hi> which is not iuſtifiable in any law.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The nature and extent of the penaltie doth import no leſſe. For it doth not only puniſh exceſſiue Vſurie aboue ten in the hundred; but all vnder ten, vnder nine, vnder eight, be it neuer ſo little; it is puniſhable by the ſtatute; and therefore ſimplie forbidden by the intent of the ſame. For the Vſurie or ouerplus which is taken aboue the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall is not reſtored to the borrower; for then were it no puniſhment: becauſe euery partie were in <hi>ſtatu quo prius,</hi> as he was before the couenant: But it is all forfeited by the law to the king, and the informer, in the name of a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>ſhall be puniſhed in forme following:</hi> which if it be a iuft puniſhment muſt preſuppoſe a breach of iuſtice in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties puniſhed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The third is, the motiue which moued the Parliament to make this act. <hi>For aſ much as all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie being forbidden by the law of God is ſin, and deteſtable; be it enacted, &amp;c.</hi> It was therefore enacted againſt vſurie, becauſe it is a ſinne and deteſtable, forbidden by the law of God: Is there any doubt then but it was the meaning of the ſtatute ſimply to forbid it? It is true indeed, that the preamble is no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall part of the act: yet is it as a key to open the intention and true meaning of the law, nothing better.</p>
                        <p>But the reſtleſſe wit of man, if it bee once ſet vpon contradiction, will neuer giue ouer. I haue heard it obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that whereas it is ſaid in the ſtatute, <hi>For aſ much as all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie being forbidden by the law of God is ſinne and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> thoſe words <hi>(being forbidden by the law of God)</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, not as a reaſon of the aſſertion; but as a part of the ſubiect of the propoſition: <hi>all vſurie being forbidden:</hi> that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2101:53"/>
is to ſay; <hi>all Vſurie which is forbidden by the law of God is ſin, and deteſtable.</hi> As if ſome Vſurie were not forbidden. Wit whither wilt thou? The ſequel runneth thus: <hi>For as much as all Vſurie being forbidden by the law of God is ſinne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable; he it enacted, that all Vſurie, loane, &amp;c. ſhall be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in forme following.</hi> Doth not the conſequence plainely ſhew that the law meant honeſtly in the antecedent? that for as much as all Vſurie is forbidden by the law of God; be it therefore enacted that all Vſurie ſhall bee puniſhed?</p>
                        <p>Whether it be a cleere caſe or queſtionable, <hi>that all Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is forbidden by Gods law,</hi> is not materiall for this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; lay that by for another place. This notwithſtanding is cleere, that the iudgement of the lawmakers in that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was, that Vſurie is ſimply euill in it ſelfe; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meaning of that law is ſimplie to forbid it. For as they conceiued it to bee forbidden by Gods law; ſo did they alſo by their iudiciall power and authoritie adiudge and determine it to be not onely ſcandalous, but perilous and preiudicious to a Chriſtian common-wealth: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enacted a law, and preſcribed a puniſhment againſt all Vſurie whatſoeuer. What hindreth then why we ſhould not ſubmit our ſelues to this act, euen for conſcience ſake? Admit the lawmakers did erre in thinking euery vſurious act to be forbidden by the law of God: ſhall euery ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed error diſanull ſuch a ſolemne act? God forbid. A man for the purpoſe is moued to chuſe ſuch a wife, ſuppoſing her to be of ſo great wealth, and of ſo good qualities: hee is ſomewhat deceiued in both his motiues. What then? Shall his error make his mariage void? nothing leſſe: ſo long as the errour is not eſſentiall to the act it ſelfe, the act ſhall thereby receiue no preiudice or hurt at all.</p>
                        <p>It appeareth then, that theſe concluſions following doe neceſſarily ariſe out of the premiſſes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, in this ſtatute of Vſurie there is nothing inacted contrary to the law of God; and therefore in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is a iuſt law. 2. If it be a iuſt law, then doe we ſtand bound in conſcience to obey it according to the ſimple
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2101:53"/>
meaning of the ſame. In conſcience, I ſay, not by any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vertue in the ſtatute; but by vertue of his command who bids vs obey, <hi>for conſcience ſake.</hi> 3. It is the ſimple meaning of this ſtatute, ſimply and abſolutely to forbid all Vſurie whatſoeuer; and therefore albeit in <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Geneua</hi> their conſciences may be free from this obligation of a poſitiue law, becauſe their lawes againſt Vſurie be not ſo preciſe: yet in England we are cleerely condemned for any increaſe or ouerplus whatſoeuer: condemned in the court of conſcience, by vertue of the law of God, for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of this ſtatute: condemned euen by the rule of maſter <hi>Caluin</hi> himſelfe: <hi>Ne excedatur modus conſtitutus in</hi>

                     <p n="1">1 Firſt, it is euident that the primitiue life was moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and therefore the moſt innocent, when men liued vpon that increaſe which God gaue by the yeeld of the earth and liuing creatures. For the firſt trade that euer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught, was to till the ground; by which man might be fed: wherein <hi>Adam</hi> his eldeſt ſonne was trained. The <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 2.</note> next was the keeping of ſheepe, which <hi>Abel</hi> learned, to

clothe their nakedneſſe. And as from theſe two all other trades and profeſſions, for worldly commoditie, were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; ſo muſt they be content as from the originall to take ſome direction. <hi>The firſt in each kinde is a rule.</hi> The inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and integritie whereof God approoued in that he would be worſhipped himſelfe in the firſt fruits, and haue his prieſts maintained by the tithes and oblations of ſuch increaſe.

But how well the Leuits maſter came by thoſe ſhickles, is more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Leuite wel knowes.

                     <p>But after that the world was repleniſhed with people of all ſorts and qualitie, neceſſitie brought in the change and tranſportation of ſuch commodities as the condition of men did require.

                     <p>And for the more eaſie and commodious tranſportation, buying and ſelling with money, and merchandizing in all kinds was practiſed of all people: yea of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi>

Which gaine, though it be greater and more royall, yet it cannot be denied, but, as it is more remote from primitiue increaſe, ſo is it more to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of iniquitie. <hi>Salomon</hi> made a prouerbe of it: <hi>It is naught, it is naught, ſaith the buyer: but when he is gone apart</hi>

                     <p n="3">3 If theſe profeſſions bee ſo ſuſpiciouſly thought and written of, which be ſo neceſſarie and commodious for all eſtates; which by skill and induſtrie inrich kingdomes and Common-weales, with ſuch varietie of Gods bleſſings; which miniſter to the neceſſities of all ſorts and degrees, by transferring and diſtributing ſuch commodities as nature her ſelfe hath brought foorth for the vſe of men: what ſhall we deeme of ſuch as meddle not with natures increaſe, ſaue onely in conſuming and deuouring it; but liue and inrich themſelues by a thing meerely artificiall; the inſtrument of tranſportation, money? which is indeed the price of all, and ſo in eſtimate anſwereth all, and commands al amongſt men: yet a thing of it ſelfe meerely artificiall. The mettall of gold and ſiluer, I confeſſe, is the increaſe of nature: but money carrying the ſtampe of authoritie, to be the price of things, is meerely artificiall. Vpon this artificiall thing, yet not vpon this, but the vſe of this; as it is vſed, not by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but altogether by others, doe theſe whom wee call Vſurers liue, maintaine themſelues &amp; increaſe their wealth. And now me thinkes I am come to a profeſſion ſo remote from the firſt originall, that ſhe hath ſhaken hands with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is become a meere ſtranger vnto her. Let vs ſee if there be any reſemblance betweene them.</p>
                     <p>When they write that money is barren and vnfruitfull; it is to be vnderſtood chiefly in two reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, whereas ſeed caſt into the ground, doth by mans induſtrie bring foorth more into the world then there was before, <hi>ſome thirtie, ſome ſixtie, and ſome an hundred fold:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 8.</note> whereas cattell doe increaſe and multiplie, that the world
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2101:55"/>
is the fatter for them: whereas the labour and trauell of men doth enrich and repleniſh the earth, money is only an inſtrument to ſhuffle wealth out of one mans hand into an other, and to tranſport from place to place: but the ſumme of one hundred pounds, turne it and returne it as often as you can, is ſtill the ſame ſumme without increaſe, the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where euer they be, remaine ſtill the ſame without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, there is not one whit more <hi>in rerum natura.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is brought into the world more then when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was firſt disburſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, whereas there is nothing in nature, or art, that is worth any thing, but hath ſome vſe in it ſelfe, if it be well vſed: nothing whatſoeuer it be, naturall or artificiall, but it ſerueth either to feed, or to cloath, or to ſhelter, or to heale, or to refreſh, or to adorne, or to worke withall, or to play withall: yet for money, as it is current money, there is no manner of vſe to be made of it, but only in parting from it; no more then of a counter; no more then of durt in the ſtreete, nor ſo much, for that will dung the ground. Adde vnto this, that there is nothing in the world which doth yeeld increaſe, or hath vſe in it ſelfe, but it is the weaker for giuing increaſe, and the worſe for the vſing; <hi>euen milſtones will weare.</hi> So that in things which paſſe betweene man and man for hire, the equitie is apparant, both for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor to pay hire, becauſe he may haue vſe of it while he doth enioy it; and for the owner alſo to take hire, becauſe it weareth in the vſing and is worſe for the wearing: only money neither bringeth increaſe to the world in generall, neither is it of any vſe to the poſſeſſor, but only in diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe of it. Yet this money, for this vſe, ſhall be to the Vſurer fruitfull, and profitable, and neuer the weaker or worſe for the vſing: for his hundred pound ſhall bee made good vnto him, as ſound and good as euer it was. It ſhall conceiue, breed, and bring foorth vnto him without trauell, coſt, or perill, tenne yong angels once in ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths at the furtheſt. This increaſe vnto naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did ſeeme vnnaturall.</p>

Moreouer, nature hath eſtabliſhed in all things vnder the Sunne, a certaine terme and pitch when they ſhall make ſtay of increaſe and multiplying. The land if it want a <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bele,</hi> will in time grow hartleſſe: houſes if they be not ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified will decay: trees will leaue bearing, and cattell bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when they grow old: mans labours and skill wil faile with yeeres: only the Vſurers money doth multiplie infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the longer the luſtier: if he can but liue, hee may ſee his moneys moneys money, euen a hundred generations.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S nature teacheth men to doe that which is ſeemly, kind, and naturall; ſo religion and pietie teacheth Chriſtian men, in all their affaires, to depend vpon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and ſtill to expect a bleſſing from heauen. So it ought to be, and ſo it is in all profeſſions, except vſurie: <hi>Nullum de Deo hominum genus peius ſentiunt quam danistarum: ſudum ſit an tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas, perinde illi eſt:</hi> Of all men the Vſurers thinke worſt of God, and will leaſt truſt him: be it faire or ſoule, all is one; they will haue their money. The husbandman lookes vp to the cloudes, and prayeth for ſeaſonable weather: The Merchant obſerues the winde, and prayeth God to deliuer him from tempeſt and wrack: The tradeſman wiſheth the people may haue money, that he may vent his wares at a reaſonable rate, and liue in ſome good faſhion: The labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man prayeth for worke and health, that he may get a

poore liuing with the ſweate of his browes; only the Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of all others hath leaſt need to ſay his prayers: be it wet or drie; be it tempeſt or calme; blow the wind Eaſt, Weſt. North or South; be he well, or be he ſicke; bee hee goutie and lame, or be he ſound of body; let him be what he will, or doe what his liſt; he will be ſure of his money. for time onely worketh for him; all the daies in the Calender be ſet a worke to worke out his gaine; yea Sabbaths and all; the red letter is as fit as the blacke for his buſineſſe, to make vp the number of daies, of weekes, of moneths; ſo the time go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out and the money commeth in.</p>
                     <p>I will not denie it may fall out ſometime that the Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer may loſe a ſumme of money, as <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were looſed out of priſon, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iailors thought they had laid on bonds enow. So I grant there may come ſuch an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and ſometime doth, that the Vſurers bonds and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations will be of little effect: but ordinarily, if he bee his trades-maſter, hee ſhall not ſtand in ſo great need of Gods bleſſing as other honeſt men doe. Can wee thinke in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that God is pleaſed with ſuch a life?</p>
                     <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth a charge to <hi>Timothie, To charge the rich of this world that they trust not in vncertaine riches, but</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>in the liuing God, who giueth all things abundantly to enioy.</hi> God hath therefore made riches vncertaine, becauſe wee ſhould not truſt in them, but in him who giueth them. That contract therefore, which for lucre and gaine maketh the vſurers money, both principall and increaſe, certaine vnto him, which God hath made vncertaine in it ſelfe; doth croſſe his diuine ordinance; and is ſo far forth an vngodly contract. Beſide, the more certaine he maketh wealth vnto himſelfe, the more he doth withdraw himſelfe <hi>out of Gods bleſſing into the warme ſunne:</hi> to ſit quietly at home without care, and to be ſure of his money: This is vngodly.</p>
                     <p>But it will be ſaid: if God haue made riches vncertaine, it is not the Vſurer can make them certaine True, yet vnto himſelfe hee maketh them certaine by transferring their vncertainty vpon others. He takes the bond of a man to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2101:56"/>
him againſt God, both for his gaine and principall; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all caſualtie whatſoeuer, againſt the act of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: This is vngodly.</p>
                     <p>I meddle not with aſſurances in this place; they bee no part of my queſtion: In them there is a more equall aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the gainer beareth the perill, and where Gods hand in the loſſe lighteth vpon both parties. But light it where it will, vpon the Vſurer, by his owne will, it ſhall neuer light. Yea but will hee, nil he, hee muſt truſt God, whoſe prouidence is ouer all. True, but if he do it perforce againſt his will, it is nothing. Art thou willing according to the rules of piety, to truſt God with thine owne goods? then tempt him not, and thou maieſt truſt him ſafely. That is to ſay, arme thy ſelfe with all conuenient ſecurity againſt the fraud and deceit of men; for the world is naught: bee as prouident as thou canſt againſt all caſualties that may befall: ſo God would haue thee; elſe thou ſhalt tempt him. Then if thou ſend out thy goods for thine owne aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſend them out as thine owne, deſire a bleſſing vpon them; if they periſh by the default of another in whoſe hands they be, good reaſon that he ſhould pay for his own fault; but if the hand of God be vpon them, remember they be thy goods, ſent out for thy gaine, as well as for the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers: they be Gods bleſſings, it is <hi>the Lord that gaue them, and the Lord hath taken them;</hi> bleſſe his name: this is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Chriſtian reſolution: elſe thou doeſt build the tower of Babel to defend thy ſelfe againſt heauen; thou takeſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of a wretched man, both for thine owne goods and <note place="margin">Gen. 11. 4.</note> gaine; for Gods bleſſing againſt the hand of God himſelfe. <hi>Montes impietatis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This which I ſay vnto all in generall, I ſay vnto old men in particular, who be <hi>attentiores ad rem:</hi> who haue giuen ouer trading, and begin now to repoſe themſelues vpon V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie. Will not ſuch a man truſt God in his old daies, who hath bleſſed and preſerued him thus farre? Remember the time is not long, vntill thou muſt truſt him with a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter. Not the principall of thy money; but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall

of all, euen thy ſoule muſt bee committed into his hands, who is able and may iuſtly caſt it into hell fire. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit God ſhall by his owne act take away ſome part of thy wealth; thinke with thy ſelfe, it may bee I haue gotten ſome part vniuſtly, and God will pare it away, that he may withall cut off my ſinne for my ſoules ſake.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond table is deriued from the firſt; therefore if vſurie be vngodly, how can it be iuſt? It offendeth againſt heauen and againſt earth: vniuſt it is, whether we conſider the nature of the thing it ſelfe, as it is before defined; or whether wee reſpect the perſons themſelues whom it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne.</p>
                     <p>Looke vpon the definition, and in it vpon three things. 1. the Loane. 2. the Couenant for the loane. and 3. the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre vpon couenant: and euery one of theſe will proue the iniquitie of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Firſt, it is the nature of loane to be free: for as a thing is not giuen but ſold, vnleſſe it be freely giuen: ſo is not any thing lent, but rather let, if it goe for hire. We haue defined Vſurie by <hi>lending</hi> or <hi>mutuation:</hi> and ſo hath the Scripture <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 25. Deut. 23. 19.</note> likewiſe. Vnto which our <note n="b" place="margin">Molinaeus</note> aduerſarie in this point doth accord, that the obiect of Vſurie is a thing lent, called <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum.</hi> But lending is a worke of mercy, of kindneſſe, of bountie, of liberality; it was euer ſo taken both in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and common conceite. <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 23 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſhut vp thy compaſſion, but ſhalt lend.</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Plalm. 112. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>A good man is mercifull and len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</hi>

                        <hi>Do good and lend.</hi> Lending, I ſay, is a worke of mercy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2101:57"/>
to the poore, of kindneſſe to thy friend; thou muſt not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet a price vpon it.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe are much deceiued then, who thinke that Vſurie is iuſt, becauſe the vſe of money for a time is worth money; and therefore if no more bee taken then the vſe is worth, there is no iniquitie. This rule holdeth in buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but not in acts of charity; therein it is no good rule. Thou bidſt, for the purpoſe, thy poore neighbours to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: this is money worth; for it coſt thee money, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them money at home: yet thou wilt not ſet a price vpon it. Why? becauſe it is a worke of charity. Thou bidſt thy rich neighbour ſometimes; that which hee eateth is worth money: yet thou wilt take none; but thinke foule ſcorne it ſhould bee offered. Why? becauſe it is an act of kindneſſe, of neighbourhood, of friendſhip: theſe things may not bee bought and ſold, the nature of them is to bee free. Lending is a worke of mercy to the poore, of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thy neighbour; and therefore is euer free. It is as vniuſt a thing to ſell charity, or friendſhip, as it is to ſell iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: both are naught; this is <hi>briberie,</hi> and that is <hi>Vſurie;</hi> let them goe together.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If thou looke vpon the <hi>Couenant for this loane,</hi> it is vnequall: wherein thou doſt bind the borrower to make good the principall, and to pay thee increaſe for the vſe of the ſame principall, for the time it is lent.</p>
                     <p>I demand then, during the time of loane whoſe is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall? thine or the borrowers? It was thine before thou lent it, and it ſhall be thine at the day of payment; but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of loane, it is the borrowers: for thou haſt by couenant paſſed ouer both vſe and propertie to the borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: ſo that during that time thou wilt not owne it; if it periſh, it periſheth to the borrower, as to the right owner for that time. If it bee none of thine then, but the borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers for that time; I aske, by what right canſt thou coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to receiue hire for the vſe of that which is none of thine, during the time it is not thine?</p>
                     <p>If thou let a horſe, houſe, or land, thou maieſt couenant
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2101:58"/>
to receiue hire becauſe thou haſt paſſed ouer their vſe only, reſeruing the propertie of them to thy ſelfe; ſo that thou art owner of horſe, houſe and land ſtill, during the time they be in an other mans poſſeſſion. Therefore if the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor ſhall abuſe thy horſe, or make waſte vpon thy land, thou doeſt iuſtly complaine, becauſe the property of them is thine: ſo is it not in money. Why doeſt thou then couenant for hire, for the vſe of that wherein thou haſt no right or property? Thou wilt happily imagine, this is but a quiditie or ſchoole tricke put vpon thee. Thou thinkeſt in very deed the money is thine being ſo lent, hee hath but the vſe onely for a time. Be it ſo then: Let the principall bee thine in couenant, as it is in very deed. Bee thou the owner of it, during the time the borrower vſeth it: ſo that if it miſcarie, thy money miſcarieth, and not his; for euery thing peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth to the right owner. Nay (quoth the Vſurer) there I leaue you. Though the principall indeed bee mine, yet if it miſcarie it ſhall be his, he ſhall beare the perill: I will make that in my bargaine. Therefore, ſay I, it is an vnequall and vniuſt bargaine. The borrower hath the vſe onely of thy principall, and payeth for the vſe, which alone is his: why ſhould he then beare the perill of thy principall, which is none of his? The vſe only he hath, and hee payeth for that which hee hath: why ſhouldeſt thou burthen him then with that he hath not? This is no quiditie: It is the equitie of Gods law. <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 22. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>The borrower ſhall not make it good, for if it be an hired thing, it came for the hire.</hi> It is added, <hi>if the owner thereof ſtand by:</hi> (to wit) that it appeare to periſh or be hurt, not by any fault of the borrower. So admit money could by Vſurers bee made an hired thing; yet the equitie of Gods law bindeth, that if it appeare to miſcarie without the fault of the owner; the borrower ſhall not make it good, becauſe it came for hire.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 If we conſider the quantitie and qualitie of this lucre or intereſt, (as they commonly tearme it) it appeareth ſtill worſe and worſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Firſt, there is great gaine, which is ſeldome iuſt: <note n="b" place="margin">Prou. 28. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Hee

that maketh haſt to be rich ſhall not be innocent.</hi> What a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple foole was <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to call money barren, which yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a double harueſt at the leaſt euery yeere? ſixe moneths is the moſt; nay three moneths returne is ordinarie, and yet ſtill the former crop maketh ſeed corne for the next. Let me ſee: Admit one thouſand might bee ſet by free, to run at intereſt, and not faile, 70. yeeres (which is but the age of a man) it would increaſe to a million, a thouſand ſold; a pretie proportion, to ſit ſtill and doe nothing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In all honeſt trades, the greater gaine, the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſtill. Soft gaine is ſure: the more vncertaine the gaine is, the greater it may be, and good reaſon it ſhould be ſo. When the great gaine of Merchants in former time hath been obiected vnto them, they could ſay of their goods as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth of himſelfe: <hi>In perils of water, in perils of robbers, in perils of mine owne nation, in perils among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>in perils in the wilderneſſe, in perils in the ſea, in perils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong falſe brethren:</hi> and it was thought a reaſonable apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; but Vſurers haue the gaine, great gaine, and others beare the perill, great perill.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Great and certaine gaine out of vncertainties; the great and certaine gaine of the lender, out of the vncertaine gaine of the borrower. Vncertaine, whether it ſhall be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or great: vncertaine, whether it ſhall be any at all: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, whether hee ſaue the principall: But win hee or loſe he, the couenant is for a certainty: <hi>Certum lucrum ex incerta negotiatione.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 Adde vnto this, that ſuch great and certaine gaine out of theſe vncertainties commeth in without labour or coſt, or trouble to ſpeake of. Heere is a cleanly Alchymiſt, who can extract ſo much ſiluer, &amp; waſt nothing in ſmoake.</p>
                     <p>Summe all together; ſo haue you; great gaine and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the vſurer: ſometimes out of little gaine; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of no gaine; ſometimes out of loſſe; alwaies out of vncertainties; alwaies out of labour and paines, out of care and coſt, out of hazard and perill to the borrower. Commeth all this on Gods name?</p>

                        <p>Take a view of the parties whom vſurie doth concerne, they be three in number: The Vſurer, the Borrower, the Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, let the Vſurer be his owne Iudge. Aske him if he be an Vſurer? No, there is none free of that companie. And yet it is not for want of companie, there be enow of the trade. Beſides, it is an ancient trade, it is a cunning trade, <hi>(a myſterie</hi> if you will) it is a gainfull trade, a ſure trade. There be men rich, wiſe, and very ſufficient euery way of the trade; for Maſters, for Wardens, for what you will. Why then haue we not the Companie of Vſurers? I know no reaſon but only this, ſuch men are aſhamed of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. We may ſay of them as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of an heretike, that <hi>he is peruerted and ſinneth, being condemned of his owne ſelfe.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Tac. 3. 11.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>If vſurie bee an honeſt trade, which men neede not be aſhamed of, our Citie is much to blame in this: for there is no trade in it ſo poore and meane, if it be an honeſt trade, but hath a Companie. The <hi>labouring man,</hi> the <hi>Maſon,</hi> the <hi>Tiler,</hi> the <hi>Water man,</hi> nay the <hi>tribe of Iſaker,</hi> who carrieth burdens amongſt vs, hath a marke to know, who belongeth to that ſold: onely they haue excluded the <hi>Vſurer</hi> and the <hi>Broker.</hi> I ſaid their owne hearts condemned them: me thinks the Citie condemnes them too. Is there no place for them? <hi>Nuſquans eſt qui vbi<expan>

                              </expan>.</hi> I pray God they be not of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Companie. Yet if we be asked what the Vſurer is, we muſt anſwere as our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeakes in the parable, that he is <hi>a certaine rich man,</hi> of no calling or profeſſion; a certaine rich man, and that is all. <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 19</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. That we may take a view of the borrowers, we doe ſort them into foure rankes: Firſt, if they be poore indeed, then is it miſerable and palpable biting, the emphaſis of Gods law ſtands vpon that. Such lending is to them like cold water powred vpon a ſeacoale fire, or as a ſhower of raine vpon a load of lime; though it may ſeeme to quench and coole, yet it kindleth and inflameth more and more.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:2101:59"/>
If they be young gallants and prodigall perſons, the Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers <note place="margin">2</note> lend, and they ſpend. Let them looke to their lands; let them beware of <hi>Dauids</hi> curſe; <hi>Let the Noſhec,</hi> that is, <note place="margin">Pſal. 109.</note> 
                           <hi>the Vſurer catch all that he hath. Illaqueat foenerator omnia quae ei ſunt.</hi> The ſpider lets them buzze and ſtruggle till they be faſt intangled, lands and all; and then hee ſucketh them. One vſe that God maketh of ſuch Vſurers in this world, is to be a curſe and a plague vnto riotous perſons. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe two ſorts of borrowers that ſchoole argument is demonſtratiue, that the vſe and propertie of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall be inſeparable; that the principall is ſpent in the firſt vſe: for theſe perſons make but one vſe of money. It is ſpent to them in the firſt vſe; the poore for neceſſitie; the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall for wantonnes, doe ſend it packing, neuer to returne either in kinde or any equiualent.</p>
                        <p>A third ſort of borrowers bee rich and well grounded men. A rich borrower? how doe theſe two agree? <hi>Doth the</hi>

This in ſuch a caſe, is conſideration enough for a Chriſtian, becauſe the Heathen deſired no more, but <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 34.</note> the like kindnes another time vpon the like occaſion. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſocietie cannot ſtand without lending and borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as S <hi>Baſil</hi> notes. Wherefore hath God made men ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable creatures, but to helpe one another vpon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? But to lend rich men to inrich themſelues more, is to powre water into the ſea; thou art therein no good ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Gods bleſſings, which hee hath giuen thee to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of. It is not good to feede a rich mans humour too much: thou maiſt giue him weapons to doe hurt withall: for he will gaine double or trebie at the leaſt, and ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die muſt pay for that, who cannot ſo well ſpare it.</p>

Now are we come to the proper obiect of the ſecond worke of charitie. For as free gift and almes belongeth to ſuch poore people, as be not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay any thing backe againe; ſo free lending belongeth to ſuch as theſe. Heere is place for <hi>bankes of Charitie,</hi> that tradeſmen may haue free vſe of money; only paying the officers fees, which is no vſurie. If thou canſt ſpare it, thou maiſt doe well to pleaſure ſuch with a ſumme for a time freely, that God may bleſſe thee. Or if thou thinke ſo well of any of them to venture ſome ſtocke, by way of partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; that way alſo thou maiſt profit thy ſelfe and them with a good conſcience. Is there no way but plaine vſurie? If ſuch young beginners cannot by ſuch lawfull meanes be relieued, they muſt take it for their croſſe, and be content to take paines in ſeruice vntill they can be maſters of their trade: It may be God would not haue them to come vp ſo haſtily as they deſire. Good and lawfull meanes offered vnto vs, are as a ſermon from heauen to declare what the good will and pleaſure of God is.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here we finde no iuſtice, what hope can there be of charitie? For firſt there is ſuch a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall antipathie betwixt vſurie and charitie, that they cannot poſſibly dwell together in one breaſt. Which is inſinuated not obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Salomon</hi> in the place before mentioned: <hi>He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth</hi>

                        <hi>his riches by vſurie and intereſt, gathereth them for him that will be mercifull to the poore.</hi> God by his vnſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prouidence, will ſo diſpoſe and order things, that the Vſurers wealth ſhall come into the hands of him who will be as <hi>mercifull</hi> as he was <hi>mercileſſe.</hi> The antitheſis of which <note place="margin">Pro. 13. 22.</note> place ſheweth that the Vſurer wanteth the bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which good men haue. For as in the ſame booke he ſaith, <hi>the riches of ſinners are laid vp for the iuſt:</hi> ſo the riches of the Vſurer are gathered for the mercifull. Where <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſetteth <hi>mercie</hi> in oppoſition vnto <hi>vſurie.</hi> Wherefore vſurie may well be termed a biting: for as without, it biteth others; ſo in the heart of the Vſurer, it ateth out the very bowels of compaſſion. It is a principall branch of that roote of all euill, which rooteth vp the roote of charitie, ſtrugling with it in the very conception of the heart, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did with <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 And as euen mentall vſurie doth naturally oppoſe it ſelfe to the affection of mercie and compaſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hardneth the heart of the Vſurer; ſo doth actuall vſurie likewiſe peruert the act of charitie, turning it into an act of ſelfeloue. That renowned act of <hi>lending,</hi> which bringeth <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 26.</note> an heauenly reward, and a bleſſing vpon poſteritie, is by vſarie expoſed to a moſt illiberall bargaine and ſale: that which was ordained of God, by the Canon of that <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which ſeeketh not her owne,</hi> to reſpect the good of others; <note place="margin">1.

3 Laſt of all, experience telleth vs that this practiſe of vſurie, by ſetting a price vpon <hi>lending,</hi> as vpon ware in a market, hath almoſt diſplaced free loane amongſt men.

                     <p>Thus haue I ſhewed briefly as I could, that vſurie is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all doubtfull at the leaſt, and therefore vnlawfull.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is in the bodily eye, ſo is it proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in the minde: except the apple or ſight of the eye be void of all colour in it ſelfe, it cannot poſſiblie receiue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours or iudge of them: but looketh as through a painted glaſſe, colouring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery obiect like it ſelfe. In like manner, though I were able to fill my booke, as <hi>Iob</hi> did his mouth, with arguments; and to make each argument a demonſtration againſt vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: yet ſo long as ſuch cloudie conceites doe hang in the braines of men, which caſt a dye and tincture vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; all that can be ſaid will not any way worke vpon them. Which imaginarie colours that they may the better be diſcerned, how they doe ariſe in mens mindes, and after may be more eaſily diſpelled, I will place them in fiue ſeuerall rankes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The firſt thing which offereth it ſelfe in theſe vſurious daies, is cuſtome and example: which though it would not be admitted in Schoole for an Argument; yet it worketh admirablie vpon vulgar vnderſtandings. For people being
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2101:62"/>
as <hi>Labans</hi> ſheepe, lead by the eye, doe conceiue as they ſee. Seeing Vſurie therefore ſo much practiſed of all ſorts; men are euen thereby without further examination much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to thinke it lawfull. And the rather conſidering the qualitie of thoſe men who doe vſe it: who bee not onely carth-wormes and meere worldlings; but men of very good reſpect amongſt men, for their honeſt and vpright dealing; ſeeming very religious men, &amp; zealous profeſſors of the Goſpell of Chriſt; whoſe tender conſciences will ſometimes riſe at a very ſmall offence. Now theſe lookers on do thinke themſelues bound in charitie to beleeue, that ſuch men as theſe would neuer venture their ſoules vpon this practiſe, had they not been well informed before, and fully reſolued by good Diuines. Let them who doe vſe it then be examined for their ground and warrant; you ſhall find that ſome of them haue reſolued themſelues out of their owne wit and iudgement. For albeit they dare not truſt themſelues with their owne bodies for phyſicke, (though happily they may haue ſome ſmackering of skill that way) neither dare they informe themſelues without their learned counſell at law, for their goods and eſtate: yet the eſtate of their owne ſoules they dare vndertake themſelues moſt confidently in matters of the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie and danger.</p>
                     <p>Others who be not ſo conceited of their owne diuinity, yet very willing to be perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe of that which is ſo profitable, doe take the very ſilence of ſome Miniſters for a reſolution; thinking as charitablie of vs for our ſilence, as others doe of them for their practiſe. For ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing how friendly wee conuerſe with them whom wee know to liue in that kind; how we receiue daily kindneſſes from them; how zealous ſome of vs ſeeme to be for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſuch things as concerne them &amp; their ſoules, either nothing at all, or nothing ſo much as this: hereupon they preſently reſolue; verily if Vſury were ſo damnable as ſome ſuppoſe; theſe good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our ſpecial friends, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuffer our ſoules to ſleepe ſo ſecurely in ſuch danger.</p>

                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:2101:63"/>
Sometimes it may be they will moue the queſtion by the way amongſt other matters; and then ſhall you haue ſome pregnant wit, after a little ſtudie vpon his trencher, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne a preſent reſolution to their mind: <hi>That if it bee not Neſhec, he can ſee no reaſon why it may not bee allowed.</hi> This Diuinity paſſeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> table to table very currently, amongſt thoſe who very hartily wiſh it true. All this put together maketh one ſtrong motiue in the minds of the people, for the lawfulneſſe of Vſurie. Firſt, the cuſtome of it amongſt vs (which taketh away the ſenſe of ſinne;) and the generall practiſe of it, euen amongſt them of good note and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, our ſluggiſh modeſty in being ouer ſilent, and the conniuencie of ſuch as are loth to diſturbe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe their friends. Laſt of all, thoſe <hi>Echoes</hi> and <hi>quailpipes</hi> amongſt vs, who catch friends by imitating their voice; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning anſweres anſwerable to their deſires. Theſe things (I ſay) will eaſily driue men forward into a good opinion and practiſe of Vſurie, who are ready to runne of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 A ſecond motiue ariſeth out of pitie and humane commiſeration towards ſome perſons, who haue ſtockes of money, but want skill or power to imploy the ſame. This affection was the firſt hatcher of an Vſurers apologie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong exiles in time of perſecution: which now is alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto <hi>Orphans</hi> and <hi>Widowes</hi> in time of peace. For were it not pitie that theſe ſhould ſpend their ſtockes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them? Or that their ſtocks ſhould be expoſed by truſt to the prey of ſtrangers in theſe hungrie daies? Since God therefore hath giuen in charge ſo often in Scripture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the fatherleſſe and widowes; is it not a ſafe way by this meanes to allot them a certainty for the vſe of their moneyes, their principall being ſtill preſerued; they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the intereſt; and the Common-weale to enioy both the moneyes of them who want skill, and the skill of them who want money?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 As by theſe motiues they would perſwade; ſo in the third place they would bind vs by impoſing a neceſſitie of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2101:63"/>
Vſurie vpon towne and city; as if traffique and trading could not poſſiblie be maintained without it. It is not poa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon a booke that can determine this queſtion. Alas (ſay they) can ſchollers, who bee hudwinckt, and brought vp within the walles of a Colledge, iudge of the ſtate of a Citie? Let theſe bookiſh Clerks ſcribble what they liſt, we Citizens doe know that vſurie is neceſſarie: and if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, ſure it was neuer Gods meaning to forbid it ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie. <note n="*" place="margin">.1.

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. After that theſe fantaſies bee once ſetled in mens braines: firſt, that cuſtome and the practiſe of good men muſt beget an apologie out of the charitable conceit of the vulgar: next, that that apologie muſt bee applied in pitie vnto certaine perſons, who haue moſt need to be relieued by it: and then, that which is permitted to ſome, is in time apprehended of all ſorts, as neceſſarie to whole incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo that Vſurie now muſt bee lawfull, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. Then in the fourth place, the wit of man muſt bee ſet on worke to ſpin out fine and ſubtill caſes of Vſurie, wherein there ſhall appeare nothing but iuſtice and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: no wrong or iniurie vnto any. And heere they wil put vs to it indeed: It is an eaſie matter to caſt a ſtone into a poole, which ſeuen wiſe men will hardly get out. How intricate caſes both in law and equitie are multiplied daily, it is too euident: and if they can find out but one caſe of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie wherein enormity can hardly bee diſcerned; that one caſe will beget many caſes like vnto it ſelfe. For the wit of man will worke like a moale to get into the earth. If it bee lawfull in one caſe, it ſhall be lawfull in many: elſe that one caſe ſhall be euery mans caſe to ſerue for a cloake.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Laſt of all, when they haue wrought thus farre; ſome, becauſe they would excel, pretend proofe out of the ſacred text of Scripture it ſelfe. I ſpeake not of thoſe reuerend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines before mentioned; who, defending Vſurie, no Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; doe onely mitigate and qualifie the rigour of the texts with ſome deuiſed diſtinctions. But there is a fellow of late time, who poſitiuely would proue Vſurie to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2101:64"/>
euen by the Scripture: wringing and wreſting the text as if it would looke ſomthing that way; but very ſtrangely. This paſſeth from hand to hand in writing only; for I hope he is aſhamed to print it, becauſe he is aſhamed of his name: whereby it ſeemeth if he be not able to bee an Vſurer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; yet hee would faine bee like vnto them in ſomwhat. Vnto theſe fiue heads we may eaſily referre what euer hath been ſaid with any colour, or may bee imagined in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this ſinne. Our laſt endeauour then muſt be, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer theſe in order; which to a ſingle eye will eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt themſelues to be meere apparitions.</p>

                        <hi>Neſciunt quid faciunt:</hi> They know not what they doe. For <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 34</note> I verily perſwade my ſelfe in my ſoule, had ſome of them knowne how vnlawfull and dangerous a practiſe vſurie is, they would neuer haue ventured their ſoules vpon it. But as others are by their example, ſo were they by the example of others led into this common error. Vnto them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſpecially let me addreſſe my ſpeech; beſeeching them euen as they tender their owne ſoules, to take notice how this kinde of ignorance will not excuſe, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, who haue ſo good meanes of better reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if God would moue their hearts to ſeeke after it. Be well reſolued then, before you practiſe; leſt all turne vnto the greater ſinne. Truſt not your owne reſolution in this caſe; <hi>Mamon</hi> is ſubtill to beguile you. Therefore be as diligent to take counſell for your ſoules in religion, as you are for your bodies in phyſicke, and for your goods in law.

My greater care is, what ſhall become of thoſe <hi>Orphans</hi> and <hi>Widowes</hi> in theſe vncharitable daies, which haue no ſtocks at all left vnto them: though I confeſſe both the one and the other are alike in this; that they be not ſo able to help themſelues as others be. Therefore there bee no two eſtates amongſt men, ouer whom God hath a more prouident and tender care, then ouer widowes and fatherleſſe children. He hath prouided for them by a ſpeciall law: <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 22. 22.</note>

                     <p>Hath God then ſo many waies bound himſelfe by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to prouide for widowes and Orphans; and ſhall theſe by vſurie withdraw themſelues out of his fatherly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? Shall theſe be ſecured by vſurious contracts againſt the act of God himſelfe? Verily God will take it more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly at their hands, then at any other. See the difference
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2101:66"/>
in this point betwixt the wiſedome of the world, and of God. The world thinketh vſurie the beſt and the ſafeſt way for Orphans and widowes; becauſe it doth ſecure them moſt from all caſualties, which might fall vpon their ſtocks and eſtates, by any act either of God or man. The wiſedome of God contrariwiſe is, that theſe perſons ſhould moſt of al caſt their care vpon God; becauſe he careth moſt of all for them. But of all practiſes vſurie doth moſt withdraw them from dependance vpon Gods fatherly prouidence, which beſt beſeemeth their condition. If vſurie then be a thing vnlawfull, in caſe of Orphans it is moſt vnlawfull. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly if Almightie God in wiſedome had thought it meete to haue tolerated vſurie in theſe perſons, he might as eaſily haue mentioned the ſame, as <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 23 19.</note> he doth the toleration of lending to ſtrangers. But it was ſo farre from Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that in the very fame <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 22. 22, 23. 24.</note> place where hee maketh a law for the ſafegard of Orphans and widowes, preſently and <note n="c" place="margin">Verſ. 25.</note> immediatly vpon it, is annexed the law againſt vſurie. Shal theſe then who are ſo well prouided for, by a ſpeciall law of God, be tranſgreſſors of the very next law vnto it? God forbid. Let them not come neere vnto that tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all other; let not them of all others come neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                     <p>Orphans are comming into the world; widowes, who intend ſo to continue, are going out of the world; and ſhall theſe two Ages, which of all others ought to be moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and heauenlie; the one for innocencie, and the other for deuotion, be ſtained with vſurie? Chriſt is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> vnto vs, the <hi>firſt</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> the <hi>beginning</hi> and the <hi>end;</hi> and ſhal the <hi>alpha</hi> of our nonage, and the <hi>omega</hi> of our dotage be dedicated vnto vſurie?</p>

I will ſuppoſe that your husbands in their life time did themſelues imploy their ſtocks in honeſt and lawful trading, ſubmitting themſelues to all lawfull aduentures: ſomtimes enduring great loſte with patience; ſomtimes gaining much, as it pleaſed God to bleſſe them. Since their deceaſe during the time of your widowhood, by this trade of Vſurie, diuers of you haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2101:67"/>
vnto farre greater wealth then your husbands them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues euer could. This you cannot denie to bee moſt true. Your anſwere is, you doe thanke God for it, it is his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: whereof I do make great doubt; and ſo would I wiſh you to doe. Is it not ſtrange that a ſillie woman not able to manage her owne eſtate, depriued of her honeſt and wiſe guide and head, ſhould thriue better, with greater eaſe and ſecurity, then her husband with the ſame or better meanes euer could? If this came by any extraordinarie bleſſing of God vpon you; I would lift my hands to heauen with you, praiſing God in his wonderfull works. But if it be knowne to come by the ordinarie trade of Vſurie; I would ſuſpect that not to be of God: for God hath ordained your wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood in reſpect of your former eſtate, to bee an eſtate of humiliation, for the outward condition of this life. But contrary to this ordinance of God, you can make it, by the practiſe of Vſurie, to be an eſtate of exaltation: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in your husband his daies, your ſtocke by his honeſt and painefull negotiation, was ſubiect vnto manifold perils; and by perill vnto great and daily loſſes: your widowes vocation can prouide by ſufficient bonds againſt all theſe, with great increaſe of gaine: bonds ſo ſufficient and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that vnleſſe God diſſolue them beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as ſomtimes he doth) your reſolute purpoſe is, to be ſecured againſt any act both of God and man.</p>

It is you who ſtand anſwerable before God for the vſe or abuſe of ſuch ſummes as you put forth into the hands of others: where you gaine ten in the hundreth, they muſt gain twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cleere, beſides many charges and duties to bee paid out of their gaine.

Dare you truſt them with your ſoule, in that wherein your ſelues ſtand anſwerable vnto God; and not with the vſe of your goods for your owne profit? I beſeech you meditate ſeriouſly vpon theſe things, which are ſenſible; let the tenderneſſe of your ſexe worke vnto a remorſe in this point; take it to heart; bee troubled in conſcience for this ſinne: <note n="*" place="margin">Mordeat hic vt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatur illic.

If God; then is this reaſon good, <hi>Vſurie is neceſſarie, therefore lawfull.</hi> But if men or eſtates haue drawne a neceſſitie of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon themſelues by the cuſtome of ſinne; doth this extenuate or aggrauate the fault? <hi>Woe be vnto them</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay) who draw ſinne, as with cart-ropes.</hi> Cities <note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 18.</note> and Incorporations haue drawne a neceſſitie of this ſinne vpon themſelues by three ſtrong cart-ropes of iniquitie. Firſt, the hardnes of mens hearts, and want of charitie in thoſe who be well able to lend and will not, haue forced many to pay vſurie Secondly, the couetous deſire and pride of borrowers, who out of an inſatiable appetite to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe great matters, doe take vp great ſummes of money, for money; that no money is to bee ſpared for ſuch as bee true borrowers indeede. <hi>Woe vnto them that ioyne land to</hi>

Thirdly, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and deceit in defrauding one another of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at the times appointed, ſo as being diſappointed of their owne, they are compelled to take vp of others, or to ſhut vp their doores. Theſe three fold cart-ropes, not eaſily broken, haue drawne a neceſſitie of vſurie vpon Cities. And

                     <p>A drunkard hath brought his bodie into ſuch an habite, that vnleſſe hee drinke bountifully, euen to the turning of his braine, he is ſick againe. Is not drunkennes in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſinfull, becauſe ſo neceſſarie? A proud woman hath bin wedded ſo long vnto her will, that if ſhe be croſſed in it, ſhe will goe mad for pride, like <hi>Nebuchadnezar;</hi> or die of moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, like a weeſell in a cage. Shall her wilfulneſſe be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe her diuelliſh ſtomack is growne too ſtrong for her wit?</p>
                     <p>The time was when amongſt the borderers, to liue vpon robbing and the ſpoile of their neighbours was a common trade: ſo as ſtealing was thought to be no ſinne: but the 8. Commandement by them was deemed to be of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> his putting in. Their reaſon was, for becauſe that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe was ſo generall and ſo vſuall, as hee who made ſcruple to doe therein as others did, was himſelfe made a pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others. It muſt needs bee granted, that the neceſſitie of ſtealing amongſt them, was greater by many degrees, then the neceſſitie of vſurie can bee in any Countrie or Citie whatſoeuer. And yet I make no queſtion, but if the greateſt Vſurer in the land had been Iudge amongſt them, he would euen then haue condemned their theft, to bee againſt the law both of God and man: and condemned them alſo for making themſelues ſuch ſlaues vnto that ſinne by their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and vnciuill practiſes. I haue learned better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners then to compare our Vſurers with thoſe borderers: For our vſurie, without compariſon, is a farre more ciuill and mannerly theft then theirs euer was. Only my deſire is, that they would be pleaſed to take notice of the weakneſſe of this argument: that we muſt therefore needs allow of vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, becauſe they haue made it neceſſarie. That they would
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2101:70"/>
leaue thoſe queſtions, <hi>What ſhall we doe in this, and that, and the other caſe?</hi> As if a good honeſt borderer being bred and borne amongſt them, ſhould complaine; alas what ſhould I doe! all my goods and cattell are carried and driuen away in one night, I wot not whither; I muſt either ſhift for my ſelf, as the faſhion is, or run my countrie, or ſtarue at home. I hope in God this argument will neuer be ſo ſtrong for v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie amongſt vs, as it hath been for theft amongſt them: God forbid it ſhould And yet theft and robberie hath euer been a great ſinne, euen where it hath been moſt neceſſarie. In concluſion, that wee may not depriue neceſſitie of her right; ſhe hath power to excuſe the borrower, if ſhe be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent vpon him and cannot be preuented. The borrower, I ſay, may lawfully giue vſurie, where incuitable occaſion ſhall inforce an inuincible neceſſitie. If hee borrow not to gaine by borrowing, but to preuent a greater loſſe: If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull meanes be wanting, either for the preſeruation of his credit and eſtate; or for the ſupplie of preſent wants, either of nature or perſon: If theſe occaſions bee impoſed and not drawne vpon him, by ſome former negligence or default: If he attempt to borrow no more then he ſhall be able to repay at the time; and if vpon ſuch occaſions hee cannot borrow freely, then is he no agent in the ſinne, but a meere patient in the oppreſſion of vſurie. But in caſe he may borrow freely, and will not, out of a ſcornefull deſire not to be beholding; or will diſable himſelf by couenants, which he is no waies able to performe; or relieue himſelfe by grating vpon others for exceſſiue gaine; or pull theſe ſnares vpon himſelfe, either by liuing at too high a rate, or by improuident imploying of his ſtock, without reſeruing a due proportion to defray charges and pay duties: in theſe caſes euen the borrower himſelfe may ſtand guiltie as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to this ſinne. And well is hee who can manage his eſtate with that prouident moderation, as hee may ſay with the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> as we reade, chap. 15. 16. <hi>I haue neither lent vpon vſurie, nor men haue lent to me vpon vſurie.</hi> But for the lender, which is the Vſurer, there is no colour or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2101:70"/>
of any ſuch neceſſitie, which can befall him; ſeeing he hath authoritie from God as Steward of his bleſſings; and power amongſt men as owner of his money; for varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of lawfull and vndoubted imployments.</p>

Theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſleights do rather exerciſe the wit in vnfolding of them, then conuince a iudicious vnderſtanding; that vſury ſhould therefore be lawfull, becauſe ſome caſes be intricate. Be not all <hi>Courts</hi> of iuſtice and equitie full of ſuch difficulties, where after long pleading and much debating, the wrong and vniuſtice is hardly diſcouered? He that ſhall heare our learned at the Law vpon the <hi>Statute of Vſurie,</hi> at their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, or otherwiſe, put and argue caſes; what is within the meaning of the ſtatute, and what not; will neuer maruell at the cloſe conueiance of vniuſtice in the cunning practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this age.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2101:71"/>
expreſſed or not? So that vpon the matter, if it appeare iuſt and lawfull, it ſhall not appeare vſurious. It may happily border and coaſt vpon Vſurie; yet our concluſion ſhall ſtill remaine intire: That <hi>Vſurie properly ſo called is ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For our better direction amongſt theſe difficulties, I will propound three rules; which being applied vnto particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes, may inlighten vs for the vnfolding of the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Firſt, <hi>That which is good and lawfull, muſt bee intire.</hi> A little enormitie doth peruert the whole action, as <hi>leuen ſowreth the lumpe.</hi> I ſpeake not of ſuch infirmities which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 6.</note> frailtie doth caſt vpon our deeds; for ſo our beſt actions be vnperfect: but all the ingrediences which be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, muſt bee iuſt and lawfull, elſe the act it ſelfe is not iuſtifiable. It is in morality, as in Logicke, <hi>the concluſion followeth the worſt part.</hi> If the leaſt part of iniquitie appeare in any action morall, we thence conclude that action to be vnlawfull.</p>
                     <p>My neighbour is ready to forfeit his land, being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to a mercileſſe man, who gapeth for a prey: I lend him an hundred pound for a yeer to redeem the ſame land, being of triple value: I couenant with him for ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as I am like to bee admnified for want of my money. Heere is iuſtice and mercy met together. I in mercy haue relieued my neighbour in his diſtreſſe; hee in equitie doth ſaue me harmeleſſe: no man receiucth wrong; neither is the common-wealth any waies preiudiced: The borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer onely is redeemed from the mouth of the Lion: and though I take nine or ten pound intereſt of him, it is but as the opening of a veine to ſtench a greater fluxe, by turning the courſe of blood: wherein it is a ſoueraign thing to part with a little goodblood, to preuent a greater miſchiefe.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe all circumſtances conſidered, there ſeemeth to be that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or equalitie, which the Apoſtle maketh the ground both of <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 4. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Charity.</hi> But there is one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normitie which marreth all the reſt; in that a worke of charity is brought to the market, and ſet at a price; then
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2101:71"/>
which there is nothing more offenſiue or oppoſite to the nature of charity; which will haue all her deeds to be moſt free. To expell one poyſon with another, or to preuent a greater euill by a leſſe, holdeth well in phyſicke: But in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity <hi>we must not doe euill, either that good may come of it,</hi> or that euill may be preuented by it. <hi>In peccatis error facit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma:</hi> It is an erroneous conceit to imagine that one euill cannot be auoided but by committing of an other. But if thou lend thy neighbor for his reliefe in this caſe, it may be thouſhalt be damnified, for want of thy money, more then thy eſtate can well beare. Be it ſo: yet for all that, make no abſolute couenant for intereſt vpon what <hi>may be;</hi> for it may be God will pay thy intereſt ſome other way within the reuolution of that yeere. If not: yet as thy damage being future is caſual; ſo let thy couenant be conditional: <hi>If thou be thus or thus damnified, that then ſuch or ſuch ſatisfaction be made.</hi> This is equall and iuſt intereſt, but no Vſurie.</p>
                     <p>The portion of an Orphan is put into the hands of a Company or Corporation: the principall is fully ſecured: the child brought vp and maintained by the intereſt: That intereſt ſo eaſie as none hath iuſt cauſe to complaine of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: many ſutors for the imployment of ſuch ſtockes: A cuſtome maintained by the indulgence of the ſtarute: the onely Vſurie which our law doth leaue vnpuniſhed: what vniuſtice then can there bee imputed to this practiſe? Or what offence is it either to God or man? Verily I muſt greatly commend your wiſdome and prouidence in taking ſuch a fatherly care for Orphans in ſo peruerſe and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a generation. I muſt likewiſe moſt willingly ſubſcribe to the graue moderation of our law, which hath paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this practiſe of <hi>Townes</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> and let it alone: (for a toleration is all that from the law can bee inferred.) Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by your gentle patience, when the beſt is made of it that can be, there is one thing in this which poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth all. You haue ſo diſpoſed of Orphans goods by this order, that they be in farre better condition for their eſtate, then they could haue been by the painfull labors and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2101:72"/>
indeuours of their moſt wiſe and prouident Fathers, if they had been liuing; in whoſe hands their portion had then been ſubiect to negotiation, by that vnto perill; by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill to decay: this you hold to be a great vertue. Indeed it is too great for a vertue, which muſt euer hold a meane.</p>
                     <p>That order and practiſe which maketh Orphans no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, by yeelding them a greater ſecuritie of principall and certaintie of gaine, then God hath ordained, muſt needs be a thing inordinate in it ſelfe. And, which is worſe, by this meanes Almightie God is turned out of office, by ſecuring Orphans, euen againſt the act of God himſelfe, who would be a father of the fatherleſſe. For this Vſurie hath prouided a farre better fatherhood and more ſecure protection vpon earth for fatherleſſe children, then their owne naturall fathers by their beſt induſtrie, could haue bleſſed them withal. Let the goods of an Orphan, on Gods name, by your faithfull adminiſtration, be of equall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hand of a Company or Corporation, as it ſhould haue been in the hand of a faithfull father: and this ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, vnleſſe it proceed out of your free bountie; elſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whatſoeuer is more then this, by way of adminiſtration, commeth of euill. This I write out of preciſe truth; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this your practiſe within the rule of <hi>toleranda, non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banda.</hi> Let vs then eſteeme of it as a thing tolerable, yet with the acknowledgement of ſome blemiſh.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Our ſecondrule is, <hi>that the poyſon of Vſurie is in ſome contracts ſo cloſely and cunningly conueyed, as the very turne of the intention of the mind may alter the caſe, to make it iust or vniust, the contract remaining one and the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the eye then be ſingle, and the intention right, that which formally is vſurious, vpon the matter may in iuſtice be equiualent to a lawfull contract. If the intention looke awry, that which in forme is lawfull, may in matter bee a paliat or cloaked Vſurie.</p>
                     <p>For A. to lend vnto B. an hundred pound for ten yeeres, the principall to be repayed yeerely by ten pound, and ten pound ouer and aboue to be giuen for the vſe; this is plaine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2101:72"/>
Vſurie within the ſtatute. Therefore to preuent that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and to auoide this practiſe of an Vſurer, A. doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the ſaid B. an annuall rent of twentie pound, for ten yeeres, with the ſame hundred pound. This is bargaine and ſale; yet vpon the matter the very ſame vnder another forme of couenant: the very intention maketh it Vſurie; inſomuch as if the intent could be diſcouered, by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent communication of borrowing, or other pregnant circumſtances, ths law would bring it within compaſſe of the ſtatute for paliate or cloaked Vſury. But if ſimply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pretence ſuch annuity of rent be bought and ſold, we cannot condemne it for Vſurie. Howbeit, if it be an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable bargaine, or be iniurious vnto any by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it may bee a breach of iuſtice and charitic in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind.</p>
                     <p>A man buyeth a piece of land at a reaſonable rate for ready money; couenanting that in caſe hee ſhall repent of his purchaſe within one yeere after the payment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that then at the yeeres end it ſhall be at his choice, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to retaine the land and continue his bargaine, or to haue that intire ſumme repaid backe againe, which he gaue for the land; and ſo the bargaine to be void. This caſe heth ſo indifferent betweene an vſurious and a lawfull contract, that the very ſecret purpoſe and intention of the buyer doth alter it. For if the buyer had a ſimple intent to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the land indeed; yet deſirous to reſerue a liberty to himſelfe, by one yeeres triall of his bargaine; and though at the yeeres end he ſhall take his money againe, for ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience found, which before was not perceiued; or becauſe in the meane time hee hath met with ſome other bargaine fitter for him; this is neither Vſurie, nor vſurious. But if this buyer hauing this ſumme of money, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he cannot put to Vſurie, with ſo good ſecuritie as he would; doth therefore make this purchaſe but a colour, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer intending to continue his bargaine, but onely to keepe the land as a pawne for his principall; and to receiue that yeeres rent for the vſe; this very intention maketh it groſſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2101:73"/>
Vſurie; and ſo altereth the caſe: the contract in words and in writing remaining one and the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Our third rule is: <hi>That hee who deliuereth a ſumme of money for a time, for ſome ſpeciall deſignement couenanted and agreed vpon, declineth the nature of that loane, which in the definition is properly called mutuation.</hi> For in mutuation the money is ſo lent, that the propertie is wholly paſſed ouer to the borrower. But when it is lent onely for ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, the gaine whereof ſhall redound aſwell to the lender as the borrower; herein the lender doth reſerue vnto himſelfe ſome propertie in the money ſo lent, euen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the loane. Which kind of loane doth bend the couenant ſomwhat from the nature of Vſurie, towards the contract of partnerſhip: whereupon ſome couenants ſeeming vſurious, yet withall appearing iuſt and equal, are great inducements to make ſome men thinke that all Vſury is not ſimplie vnlawfull. Whereof inſtance may be giuen in ſuch and ſuch caſes: whereas indeed vpon due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it may appeare, that as ſuch contracts doe begin to bee iuſtifiable; ſo doe they likewiſe decline the nature of Vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in ſome part of the definition before expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>A moneyed man lendeth to his monileſſe friend an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, not to vſe at his pleaſure, but to purchaſe ſuch a leaſe for ten yeeres, which yeeldeth twentie foure pound of yeerely rent: couenanting with the borrower for nine pound a yeere parcell of the ſaid rent, and for the payment of the principall, being likewiſe raiſed out of the ſaid yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rent at the end of ten yeeres. Now what can there bee in this contract againſt any rule either of iuſtice or charitie? The purchaſe is reaſonable; the intereſt redounding to the lender is a reaſonable portion of the borrowers gaine; the borrower hath ten pound yeerely comming in, which in ten yeeres maketh vp the principall; he hath likewiſe the vſe of that yeerely rent of ten pound freely for ten yeeres, and fiue pound certaine rent ouerplus of cleere gaine. This ſeemeth to bee Vſurie, for that it paſſeth vnder the vſuall termes of lending and borrowing. But vpon the matter it is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2101:73"/>
rather a contract of <hi>ſocietie</hi> or <hi>partnerſhip,</hi> for that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per obiect of vſurie <hi>mutuum,</hi> doth here ceaſe. For a ſumme of money ſo deliuered, is not properly lent: for that the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der continueth in part the owner of the money, reſeruing ſome power and intereſt in the vſe of the ſame. In theſe and ſuch like couenants, if there bee any malignitie in the nature, or ſcandall in the forme; it proceedeth of vſurie. If any colour of equitie and iuſtice; it borroweth that from ſome honeſt and lawfull contract.</p>
                     <p>But let <hi>euerie bird take his owne feather,</hi> euery neighbour contract reſume that which is proper and peculiar to it ſelf, that the nakednes of vſurie might appeare by itſelf; I make little queſtion but the malignitie &amp; deformitie of it would eaſily be perceiued. For ſo farre as theſe mixt contracts doe put on the habit of honeſtie, they doe withall relinquiſh and put off the nature of vſurie.</p>
                     <p>Theſe caſes I haue only propounded, to ſhew that as any vſurious contract doth approch vnto equitie; ſo farre forth it doth likewiſe decline the nature of vſurie, and bend itſelf towards ſome lawfull and honeſt couenant, which doth only coaſt vpon it. All which doth ſtill fortifie the maine concluſion, <hi>That vſurie properly ſo called, is ſimply vnlawfull;</hi> and that there is ſtill ſome malignant qualitie in the very nature of it: which together with vſurie, according to the ſeuerall degrees thereof, will diſcouer it ſelfe.</p>

But vpon examination I was bold, for being tedious, to reckon them as they doe ſiphers in the practiſe of addition, <hi>nought, nought, and nought</hi> is <hi>nought;</hi> for 25. of thoſe 32. reaſons doe inferre theſe concluſions following.</p>
                     <p>That increaſe is lawfull: and that a man ought not to let his money take ruſt. That he needeth not to lend freelie to him who hath no neede to borrow; becauſe that were to powre water into the Sea. That a iuſt recompence is due for the ſatisfaction of wrong: as if a man falſifie his word to my hindrance; if hee withhold my money againſt my will to my loſſe and his gaine; if he delay payment beyond the time limited, ſo as I am forced to take vp at tenne in the hundred; if I ſtand bound for a friend for principall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he ſaileth and I pay it; if a father in law withhold his daughters portion to their preiudice; that in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſome recompence is due. That the purchaſe of a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple, or of an Annuitie for liues, is lawfull. That partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is not to be miſliked. That a rich man ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his wealth by a poore mans money; nor the tutor by the orphans ſtocke, without ſome conſideration. That a man pleaſured by the loane of money, ought to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. That a Miller may require a Bakers cuſtome for len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him ſummes of money, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Herein the author hath taken great paines to be labour his owne ſhadow: for I know none who maketh any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the lawfulnes of theſe things. The other ſeuen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2101:74"/>
doe ſeeme as it were ſomewhat to looke towards the point in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If a poore man ought to bee thankefull in word for the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1</note> 
                        <hi>loane of money, then ought the rich man to be really thankefull in his kinde.</hi> It is very true, and what then? <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith the author) <hi>may he couenant or promiſe to be thankefull, if it be his dutie ſo to be.</hi> I make no doubt but that hee may promiſe and performe his promiſe, much better then a poore man can; many other waies beſide paying of vſurie. But had he proued it lawful for a rich man to be eight or tenne pound thankfull for the loane of an hundred, then had he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neere the queſtion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is all one to lend money and to lend a Cow freely:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2</note> 
                        <hi>therfore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is all one to let money and to let a Cow for hire.</hi> I denie the conſequence; many things may bee lent freely, which may not be let for hire: a quart of milke, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by that Cow, may be lent, but not let. A Cow is worſe for the milking, ſo is not money for the vſing, which ſhall be repaied in as currant peeces as it was lent.</p>
                     <p>But the argument which hee ſtandeth much vpon, is <note place="margin">3</note> Gods owne example: <hi>Who paieth intereſt for the poore, and therefore the rich ought to pay for themſelues. God paieth it for the poore, becauſe they be not able to pay for themſelues: the rich therefore ought to pay for themſelues, becauſe they be able.</hi> So that vſurie then muſt needes be paid either by God or man; by God for the poore, by the rich for themſelues. Another reaſon to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>That wee must lend to the poore freely, and therefore muſt we take vſurie of the rich.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">4</note> Vpon this ground (it ſeemeth) becauſe God will not pay for the rich, therefore they muſt pay for themſelues. For it will not out of his head, but that vſurie muſt be paied. <hi>Were it not for vſurie,</hi> he prophecieth, <hi>that the ſame confuſion muſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">5</note> 
                        <hi>needs fall vpon vs, which the Prophet Eſatas threatneth againſt</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 24. ver. 1. 2. 3. 4</note> 
                        <hi>wicked and curſed nations.</hi> That is another reaſon. Nay: <hi>If vſurie be taken away, woe worth all the occupiers in the world.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">6</note> That is another reaſon. Adde them all together; they bee aſſertions, prophecies, execrations, which ſay and aſſeuer,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2101:75"/>
but prooue nothing. For Gods example for paying vſurie for the poore, is taken from a metaphoricall or borrowed ſpeech, and therefore cannot ſtand vpon his owne ground. If it could, we might inferre ſtrange concluſions from Gods example; who returneth for giuing to the poore the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, ſeuen fold, yea an hundred fold. Shall a rich man therefore pay ſo much vſurie? that would prooue a <hi>Neſhec</hi> indeeed. Yea, but <hi>we muſt lend freely to the poore; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may inable our ſelues ſo to doe, we muſt take vſurie</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">7</note> 
                        <hi>of the rich.</hi> That is another reaſon, taken (as I ſuppoſe) from Standgate hole. For ſuch reaſons doe moue thoſe good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to take a purſe, that they may bee the better able to doe this and that; ſome of them purpoſing to doe ſome good with that they ſhall take. Yet all this will not make their act good, if themſelues be taken.</p>

                        <p>By theſe reaſons alreadie alleaged it is to bee hoped, though they be many, that this author is not much to bee feared for doing the cauſe any great hurt. Albeit hee hath preſumed further in this theame then any I can finde euer did before, or I hope will do after him; in laying ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands vpon the booke of God; wreſting that holie writ for the approbation, yea and the great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vſurie. Being of the number of thoſe whereof <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſpeaketh: <hi>Qui Caedem faciunt ſcripturarum in mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam ſuam:</hi> Who doe fell the Scriptures to ſupport a rotten building.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, in the Lebanon of the old Teſtament, hee hath hewne downe that worthie example of <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> who as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for <hi>Pharao</hi> King of Egypt, deliuered to his ſubiects <note place="margin">Geneſ. 47. 20. 24.</note> (now become his ſeruants) not onely the vſe of the land, but ſeed-corne alſo to ſow the ſame; couenanting with them for the fifth part of yeerly rent to the King their Lord and maſter for euer. And verily the Egyptians in this caſe ſat at an eaſie rent, paying but the fifth part, and enioying all the reſt, onely for their paines in tilling the land; which by reaſon of Nilus was a very tender mold, that men might
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2101:75"/>
water it with their feet; and therefore their tillage was no tough labour. But how is Vſurie built vpon this? What af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie hath this rent with intereſt? Forſooth you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that all maner of contract, couenant, or bargaine whatſoeuer it be, is by him taken for Vſurie. If it be vniuſt or oppreſſing, then it is <hi>Neſhec:</hi> which it pleaſeth him to tranſlate <hi>morſurie,</hi> not <hi>vſurie.</hi> If it bee equall and iuſt (as this of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> was) then is it conſcionable and lawfull Vſurie: in which ſenſe, where <gap reason="foreign">

Wondring with my ſelfe who ſhould put theſe extrauagant conceits into his head; at the laſt I found them in <hi>Bullinger,</hi> vpon whom it ſeemeth hee groundeth himſelfe; a moiſt foundation to build vpon. For the ſame purpoſe the ſame Author maketh much of Gods law for the releaſing of debtors the ſeuenth yeere; becauſe poore men, for the Sabbath of the ground that yeere, wanted meanes to pay their debts: yet of them who were able to pay, it might be exacted. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the rich man muſt pay principall and vſurie both the ſeuenth</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>yeere; but not the poore: for there is the word Maſhah, which ſignifieth vſurie; and the verbe Naſhah, which ſignifieth to lend vpon vſurie. Oportet mendacem eſſe memorem.</hi> Doth God releaſe the poore, that Vſurie ſhall not bee exacted of them for that ſeuenth yeere? Vſurie, I ſay, by vertue of your Maſhah? then ſhall it bee lawfull other yeeres to exact it, euen of the poore; whom alone you labour to free from V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2101:76"/>
For doubtleſſe that law did bind onely for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth yeere, and no longer time: the poore therefore will con you little thankes for this argument.</p>
                        <p>Yea but it is a prettie reaſon which hee hath framed out of <hi>Salomons</hi> prouerbs: <hi>He that oppreſſeth the poore to increaſe</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pro. 22. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>himſelfe, and giueth to the rich, ſhall ſurely come to pouerty.</hi> He noteth in the margent <hi>(a notable place to proue that the rich ought to giue intereſt.)</hi> How is that proued? By the rule of contraries; as if <hi>Salomon</hi> contrariwiſe had ſaid thus: <hi>Hee that giueth to the poore freely, and lendeth to the rich to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe himſelfe, ſhal vndoubtedly attaine vnto great wealth.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>To attaine wealth, and to come vnto pouerty,</hi> be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Beſides, I conceiue ſome antitheſis betwixt <hi>oppreſſing the poore to encreaſe himſelfe;</hi> and <hi>giuing vnto the poore freely.</hi> Now <hi>lending to the rich vpon vſurie,</hi> hath crouded in the midſt. How <hi>lending</hi> commeth in, paſſeth my vnderſtanding: there is no mention in the text either of Vſurie or loane. To giue to the rich in bribes, that hee may oppreſſe the poore, is a vice; or to oppreſſe the poore, that hee may the better giue vnto the rich: but is it therefore a vertue to lend to the rich vpon Vſurie? and ſuch a vertue as bringeth a bleſſing from God in ſtead of a curſe? So ſaith the Author in direct tearmes: <hi>Now the contrary vertue hath queſtionles the like oppoſite bleſſing, an equall and like reward of plentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> This is more, I dare ſay, then euer Vſurers did hope for, or imagine: full glad would they be, if we could proue it a thing indifferent. To lend freely is a worke of mercy and bountie: to lend vnto the rich freely is vitious; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuperfluous: he compareth it to <hi>powring water into the ſea;</hi> yet to lend to the rich vpon Vſurie, makes it very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. <hi>A notable place to proue <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurie?</hi> A notable wit that can extract Vſurie out of ſuch a place. For I dare ſay when <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpake this prouerbe, he thought no more of any ſuch vertue, then he did of Alchymie.</p>
                        <p>From Prouerbs deſcend we vnto Parables. Parables and metaphors make fit groundcels for ſuch buildings. Our S. Chriſt in his parable of <hi>Talents,</hi> compareth the diſpenſation <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 27</note>
                           <pb n="137" facs="tcp:2101:76"/>
and vſe of ſpirituall gifts and graces, to the imployment of moneyes amongſt worldlings; where a rich man deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſummes to certaine occupiers, that hee might receiue his principall againe, <hi>cum foenore,</hi> with Vſurie, or aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. <note place="margin">

                              </gap>.</note> Now it is verily thought, Chriſt would neuer haue made ſuch compariſons, if Vſurie were not lawfull and honeſt.</p>
                        <p>And I pray you, what honeſtie doe you find in the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den breaking in of a theefe into a mans houſe in the night? <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 43</note> yet Chriſt compareth his laſt comming euen vnto that. Nay more, what if the maſter had commended his ſeruant in this parable for diſpenſing his talents, as the Lord commended the vniuſt Steward for his wiſdome? Then might it ſafely haue been concluded, that it is as lawfull and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing to take Vſury, as for that Steward to robbe his maſter, and both alike. Nay, ſo farre is this parable from iuſtifying of Vſurers; that were it not a parable, I would haue vſed it as an argument againſt Vſurie. For whereas the ſeruant complaineth of his maſter, as of <hi>an hard man, reaping where he ſowed not, and gathering where he ſtrowed not</hi> (para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles being ſpoken after the faſhion of the world,) it ſhould appeare that Vſurers in thoſe times were hardly thought of, euen of meere worldly men, for reaping increaſe more then they ſowed, out of talents and peeces of money, which haue no power of fructifying in themſelues.</p>
                        <p>That conſequent which commonly is inferred from the rule of equitie, ſet downe by Chriſt, <hi>Whatſoeuer you would that men ſhould doe vnto you, doe you the ſame vnto them,</hi> and therefore I may lawfully take ſo much vſurie of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as I my ſelfe in his caſe would giue; is but a begging of the queſtion: for it muſt be vnderſtood of a iuſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified will; elſe it can be no rule. If I pretend that I doe no otherwiſe vnto him then my ſelf in his caſe would be done vnto; we runne ſtill vpon the queſtion, whether my deſire were then as it ſhould be? For if I my ſelfe would borrow vpon vſurie, either to ingroſſe or foreſtall, or to compaſſe ſome vnlawfull matter, this is a corrupt will and no rule.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2101:77"/>
But if my deſire to borrow bee iuſt and lawfull (as in ſome caſes before mentioned it may be) then is it no entire will; but mixt and forced by ſome neceſſity, for the auoiding of a greater euill; and therefore deemed in the eye both of <note n="a" place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the will of the borrower is in this caſe either corrupt, or no will at all; and ſo conſequently without the compaſſe of Chriſt his rule.</p>
                        <p>Come wee now to the argument of arguments, hatched onely by this Author himſelfe; whereupon hee hath beſtowed great coſt and paines to bring it vnto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſitting vpon it for three leaues together in large fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio. It is grounded vpon <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> his anſwere to the Publicans: <hi>Require no more then that which is appointed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 13.</note> 
                           <hi>you.</hi> Marke the text well; for here commeth an argument wil make Vſurers to laugh and keepe holy day. The Author will demonſtrate out of theſe very words (which a man would little think at the firſt) that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did allow V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie at twelue in the hundred: a rate which our ſtatute law would puniſh with the forfeiture of principall and all. Now good Lord what a thing is this; that humane lawes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted only to loppe and prune the ſuperſluitie of mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould be more ſtrict and ſeuere then the doctrine of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> in the wilderneſſe; who laid the axe to the root, cutting downe ſinne, and burning vp iniquitie with the ſpirit of <hi>Elias?</hi> Twelue in the hundred, with a quicker returne then ordinarie: not ſixe moneths, but <hi>Centeſima</hi> is it called, that is, one in the hundred monethly, which <hi>Iohn Baptiſi</hi> hath iuſtified.</p>
                        <p>And to proue the ſame, he bringeth a long diſcourſe out of <hi>Tullie,</hi> both for the approbation of <hi>Centeſima,</hi> and for the great honour and eſtimation that the <hi>Publicans</hi> were in amongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who had not only authoritie to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2101:77"/>
tribute, cuſtomes, and publike reuenues; but alſo to employ them for the publike good. By reaſon whereof they practiſed the <hi>Centeſima</hi> then allowed by the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Theſe Publicans comming to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and demanding what they ſhould do; <hi>Iohn</hi> bad them require no more then that which was appointed them. But the practiſe of <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſima</hi> was allowed vnto Publicans, by the Romane lawes; and therefore approued of by <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his anſwere to their queſtion. This in briefe is the very dint of his whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>We will not fall out about the premiſſes. Firſt, be it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the <hi>Centeſima</hi> was allowed of by Heatheniſh lawes in <hi>Tullie</hi> his time amongſt the <hi>Romanes;</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> before them; and among the <hi>Perſians</hi> in the daies of <hi>Nehemias.</hi> Secondly, neither can it bee denied but the <note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note> Publicans were much honoured in their place while they liued; and for their good ſeruices had their Images after death erected in <hi>Rome</hi> with a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Thirdly, wee confeſſe likewiſe that ſuch Publicans had the imployment of tributes, cuſtomes and publike reuenues for the beſt behoofe of the Common-wealth: and hereby hauing great ſtore of money in likelihood, were great practiſers of vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie both for the publike and their owne priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
                        <p>But what of all this? Before that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> his anſwere doe make any thing to your purpoſe, two points muſt bee proued, which lie yet vntouched. Firſt, that thoſe Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans who came to <hi>Iohn</hi> his baptiſme, had the like place, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and authoritie for publike goods, as thoſe whereof <hi>Tullie</hi> writeth. Secondly, you muſt prooue likewiſe, that this vſurie was an eſſentiall part of a Publicans office; elſe this text will conclude nothing for you. Theſe haue you wiſely paſſed ouer in ſilence; for I doubt you would much haue failed in the proofe of both.</p>
                        <p>The Romane Publicans had no ſmall power committed to them for the weale publike, when <note n="a" place="margin">Orat. pro on. Plancio.</note>

                     <p>For the text of Scripture in the letter it ſelfe wee finde no queſtion to be made. For albeit ſome haue put interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſenſes vpon the text, according to the faſhion and varietie of conceit and apprehenſion (a thing practiſed for all opinions;) yet is it granted that the letter doth euery where condemne vſurie, both in the originall, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold tranſlations, euen vnder the tearme of increaſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerplus, the moſt harmeleſſe tearme that is, or can be giuen vnto it.

                     <p>Afterwards many Chriſtians of reformed Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2.

For ſuch is the ſubtilty of Satan, that if he cannot hinder the growth of good corne, yet tares ſhall grow vp with it. He thought that when men were ſo buſied about the reforming of thoſe groſſe abuſes of ſuperſtition; that then was the onely time to begin a new ſeed-plot of Vſurie, of Sacriledge, of liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenes in the other extreme. Which vices, howſoeuer they were little feared or thought vpon in thoſe daies; yet by this time we may eaſily perceiue to what ripeneſſe they bee growne, which then were but as ſeedes vnder the ground.</p>
                     <p>And that reuerend Diuine, Maſter <hi>Caluin,</hi> who was ſo <note place="margin">2.

If it be demanded whether it bee lawfull to take intereſt for the vſe or loane of money; anſwere is returned by thoſe ſuppoſed Patrons of Vſurie, that for ought they can ſee, it may bee lawfull ſo to doe; if we make no trade of it, but once or twice vpon occaſion, and vſe it not. If then, we deale no worſe with our brother, <note place="margin">Calu. epiſt. de Vſura.</note> then we would in the like caſe bee dealt withall our ſelues: If we take it not of any who by pouerty is vrged to borrow: If the taking of it doe not any waies hinder the free loane to him that needeth: If the intereſt be but halfe of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers gaine at the moſt: If we looke that the Common-weale be not bitten or preiudiced thereby: <note n="d" place="margin">Virel Chatechiſ. precept. 8.</note> If our Vſurie exceed not that which the lawes doe tolerate where wee dwell: <note n="e" place="margin">Iunius in Leuit. fine.

After they haue examined the point, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as they thinke, the reaſons which are vſually brought againſt Vſurie by the ſchoole; yet in concluſion put al their limitations together, they agree vpon no Vſurie at all, as it is before defined.

Let the caſe then be put after the common intendment of the world: A

lay man commeth to a Diuine and tels him; Sir, I haue a ſumme of money lying by me and little skill to imploy it: I know diuers would bee glad to borrow it, and giue mee good ſecurity. May I not lawfully put it to vſe for eight, nine or ten in the hundred, without ſo many ifs? I am no States man to know when, or how the Common-wealth is bitten or preiudiced by Vſurie: Neither can I tell what the borrowers gaine or loſſe is; he may deceiue me eaſily, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly himſelfe, that he may borrow ſtill: beſides, I doe not loue to prie into other mens affaires, how they thriue. If hee gaine with my money, I ſhall be very glad; if he loſe, it ſhal not be my fault; for I will not entreate him to borrow it: onely my deſire is to be ſure of mine owne with quietneſſe, and ſome certaine moderate increaſe for my money, vntill I know how to imploy it otherwaies my ſelfe. Let this bee the caſe: I haue not met with one Diuine, new or old, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in print, who hath taken this queſtion in hand to ſift and examine, that durſt yet determine this, or any other equiualent or like vnto this, to be lawfull.</p>
                     <p>Now if there bee any who doe animate their priuate friends to ſuch practiſes, I cannot better reſemble them then to thoſe peſtilent Heretikes, the <hi>Carpocratians,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note n="b" place="margin">De prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ.

poore endeauours to enquire after the grounds of this point; and haue found: Firſt, that authority is ſo ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawfulneſſe of Vſurie, as that no man of modeſty <note n="a" place="margin"> 2.

In the purſuit of which argument, as I haue preſumed to ſet downe what I conceiue concerning the force of this penal ſtatute of Vſury: ſo haue I touched as neceſſarily incident to the ſame purpoſe, the binding power of humane lawes in generall. Wherein that I be not miſtaken, vnderſtand me to haue taken a middle way, betweene two aſſertions, both which ſeeme to me extreme. Firſt, the <note n="*" place="margin">Concil.

For the better eſtabliſhing of which vſurpation, ſome of her flatterers doe extend this binding to all humane lawes whatſoeuer: making no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them and the law of God in this; but that the law of God and of man doe both alike bind the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. So be their words. * <hi>Lex humana &amp; diuina quoad obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationem</hi>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2101:81"/>
imagine were groſſe impiety. Another ſort there be who <note n="b" place="margin"> Gerſon. lib. de vita ſpirituali, ſect. 4. Almainus, quaeſt. 1. de poteſtate Eccleſ. cap. 12. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſquius, quaeſt. 12. 14. 29.</note> doe auerre, that we are not any whit bound in conſcience to humane lawes from the authority commanding, but meerely from the matter commanded: So as if the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by law be not contained within the law of God or nature, it is no ſinne before God to tranſgreſſe that ſtatute. Humane lawes (ſay they) bee nothing, to the conſcience, but onely interpretations of lawes diuine and naturall. So as a ſubiect doth offend in tranſgreſſing a law, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then a patient in breaking the rule of diet preſcribed by the Phyſition: wherein hee doth offend God, not for diſobeying the precept of the Phyſition; but for tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the rule of good health, which now is made manifeſt to him by the Phyſitions skil. In like maner, humane lawes doe onely manifeſt and preſcribe that which in conſcience we were bound to obey before.</p>
                        <p>Now as the former aſſertion doth derogate from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of Diuine law which is due vnto it: ſo doth this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much weaken that ordinance of God, which he hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed amongſt men. <hi>In medio tutiſſimus ibis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We haue therefore choſen the middle way, to wit, that men ſtand bound in conſcience to obey good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome lawes, not only from the nature of the thing enacted, but alſo in matters meerely indifferent, both becauſe the generall obſeruation thereof is auailable for the publicke good (which in charity we are bound to reſpect:) And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe we muſt bee ſubiect to that authority which is the ordinance of God. <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 13. verſ. 5.</note> Subiect, I ſay, not onely in ſuffring the penaltie which the Apoſtle tearmeth <hi>wrath,</hi> but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying of lawfull commands, euen <hi>for conſcience ſake:</hi> for conſcience ſake, not becauſe of any humane authority, (which of it ſelfe hath no command at all ouer the inward man) but onely by vertue of Gods law, which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to obey authority: ſo as if wee ſhall willingly and wittingly tranſgreſſe; we ſhall ſinne againſt God.

The Common-weale, and in it the poore people, may rue the time, that euer the leaſt vſurie was left vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; for their purſe in the end muſt pay for all.</p>
                        <p>Yet for all this, if charitie might heale where iniquitie <note place="margin">2. Booke, chap. 16.</note> doth wound, it were the more tolerable. But vſurie as it peruerteth iuſtice euery way; ſo doth it drie vp the verie fountaine of charitie, being naturally oppoſite thereunto; turning euery thing to lucre and gaine, and ſtraitning the bowels of compaſſion, which otherwiſe would dilate themſelues, not onely in free giuing, but eſpecially in libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lending, where money for a time might be ſpared.</p>

                        <p>Theſe points haue been proued in their ſeuerall places; what muſt be the concluſion then out of al theſe premiſſes? Charitie, Iuſtice, Pietie, Nature her ſelfe; the lawes of God, and of men; all authoritie ancient and moderne, ioyning their forces againſt the Vſurer, how can hee ſtand, inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſuch a cloude of witneſſes; or iuſtifie his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence againſt the day of triall?</p>
                        <p>Yet few men there be in theſe daies who haue a remorſe of this ſinne, or doe take it to heart: their conſciences be ſeared as with a hot iron, there is ſuch a thick skin growne ouer their hearts, as they will hardly be circumciſed in this point. Which ſenſeleſſe ſtupiditie may eaſily be perceiued to proceed originally from three principall cauſes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Firſt, the generall practiſe of vſurie makes euery one
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2101:83"/>
in particular to thinke that hee ſhall ſhift with his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as well as others. Lord haue mercie vpon vs (ſaith he) if it be ſuch a matter to take vſurie, what ſhall become of ſuch, and ſuch, who I am ſure haue as good ſoules to God as I? I purpoſe not therefore to trouble my head for that matter. I pray God I haue no greater ſinnes to anſwere for, and then I hope I ſhall doe well.</p>
                        <p>See the efficacie and power of example, when it growes common. It was placed before in the firſt ranke of motiues, perſwading men that vſurie was lawfull, becauſe it is ſo common. Now albeit example be too weake a reaſon to inferre any ſuch concluſion; I hope euen in the eſtimate of the weakeſt iudgement: yet thus farre it doth preuaile with many, to keepe their conſciences from any great touch in this point; for they reſolue themſelues vndoubtedly, that it cannot be ſo hainous a ſinne, which is ſo generall a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe amongſt them of good account. Ah fearefull tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thus to be drawne into ſinne by imitation! It was that which turned ſo many legions of Angels into Diuels, to ſee the brighter and more glorious ſpirits, leaue their ſtation by diſobedience. But did that mitigate Gods wrath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Iude 6.</note> them of inferiour ranke? <hi>Habet ordo diuinae iuſtitiae, &amp;c.</hi> Diuine iuſtice required that they who were drawne into the ſame fall, ſhould be inwrapped in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. When there were but two in all the world to tranſgreſſe, concerning that only forbidden fruit, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> of the one inticed the other. It was that which brought fire and brimſtone vpon thoſe goodly cities of the plaine, when abomination grew ſo commonly practiſed, <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>from the young euen to the old,</hi> that one drew another from the higheſt to the loweſt. Nay ſo forcible was this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a branch of vnnaturall ſinne eſcaped the fire of Sodom, and light in a caue of the mountaine: thus the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall example of Sodom infected the familie of iuſt <hi>Lot.</hi> But did that extenuate the fault? Nothing leſſe. <hi>Moab was the father of the Moabites, and Ben-ammi of the Ammonites,</hi> for many generations. <note place="margin">Verſ. 38.</note>

2 Secondly, men take occaſion from the queſtion of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie, euen becauſe it is a queſtion, to arme themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all remorſe and touch of conſcience. For if they can once heare that it is queſtionable, they aſſume a libertie to themſelues to chuſe a ſide, and to practiſe according to that opinion which likes them beſt. But the groſſenes of their error doth herein appeare; that vnderſtanding Diuines to be ſomewhat diuided about vſurie, they doe preſently imagine the point in queſtion to bee this; whether the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of nine, or tenne in the hundred, according to our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie practiſe, be lawfull. But alas, there is no ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion amongſt Diuines to be found in all their writings. I haue ſought with all diligence my ſelfe; I haue enquired of others; and vpon examination, I finde not any publiſhed vpon this argument, who diſcuſſing this point doth defend any ſuch thing. Many queſtions we haue; what is vſurie, and what not. Some there be who defend certaine ſhreds of vſurie, euen to the raſing of the definition; whoſe reaſons we haue met withall in their <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 14. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 47. 99. 104. and the whole 3. Booke.</note> places. Some alſo of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiticall brood (who to humour the people for their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, will diſpenſe with any thing) haue hatched new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, how to defend profit by money, as good as vſurie euery whit, and yet no vſurie: cunningly twiſted of three lawfull contracts; of the contract of ſocietie, or partnerſhip, and two kinds of aſſurances with the ſame partie: defended by <note n="a" place="margin">Bononiae.</note> 
                           <hi>Io. Eckius,</hi> and notably diſcuſſed at <note n="b" place="margin">Ann. 1581</note> 
                           <hi>Rome</hi> by many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctors, in my preſence, ſaith <note n="c" place="margin">Diſput. 5. q. 24. deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietate punct. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>Gregorie de Valentiâ.</hi> A notable point no doubt, and well worthie the diſcuſſing. So faine would thoſe Diuines giue the world ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment for this practiſe of vſurie; that ſince they cannot with any face defend the old, they would be glad to create a new. But for an abſolute couenant for tenne, nine, or eight in the hundred, according to the cuſtome of Cities, amongſt Diuines of any Church, I cannot yet finde a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 But the third &amp; laſt impediment, which hindreth men from taking of this ſinne to heart, is of all others the moſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2101:84"/>
fearefull to be thought vpon, and yet I feare mee moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable. When men be once ſeaſoned with Vſurie, &amp; haue entangled themſelues in the ſame by any ſetled practiſe; they be after afraid to call it into queſtion for diſquieting their conſciences. But bleſſed is that diſquietneſſe, which procureth eternall peace: and curſed bee that ſenſeleſſe peace, which bringeth euerlaſting torment. A ſinfull ſoule muſt be diſturbed here or elſewhere, there is no remedie: If we iudge not our ſelues before, we ſhall be iudged hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it will be too late to finde mercie. Can men hope for mercie vnder a pretence of ignorance in this point? Verily if it were an inuincible ignorance, God in mercie would paſſe it ouer, as he doth many other things, where the meanes of better information is wanting: But if it bee an affected and wilfull ignorance, it addeth ſinne vnto ſin. Now what is more affected then to decline and auoid the meanes of inſtruction and reſolution, onely becauſe they will not diſturbe and awaken their conſciences out of ſo ſweete a ſleepe of ſecuritie, for ſo ſweete a gaine as vſurie? If hee did nothing but ſleepe out his moneths, the moneys would come in.</p>
                        <p>Wee doe accuſe ſome obſtinate Recuſants of wilfull blindnes, becauſe they doe refuſe the meanes of better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: yet the moſt wilfull amongſt them can ſay thus much for themſelues, that many learned men, and the Church of Rome for many ages, haue defended their cauſe. Which apologie of theirs, though vpon due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination it bee nothing; yet is it much more then euer could be ſaid for vſurie. For though the practiſe of it can plead antiquitie, nothing more; yet was there neuer any Church, Orthodox, or Hereticall, which euer defended the ſame ſince the world ſtood. In ſome places it hath been tolerated. Tolerated, I ſay, and therefore not approoued of in any wiſe.

But may a man therefore take vſurie with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? No verily (ſaith <hi>Beza)</hi> for the rule of conſcience is to be taken, not from the ciuill lawes of men, but from the word of God. Yea the Ciuill lawes themſelues, do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, but rather condemne, that which they tolerate only, being vrged thereunto by the wickedneſſe of men. Theſe be the very words of that famous Paſtor of Geneua, which I haue ſet downe, to the end wee may take notice of the cenſure euen of that Church wherein vſurie ſeemed moſt neceſſarie, and from which men haue taken their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt encouragement, to venture their ſoules vpon this ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Take notice therefore (Chriſtian Reader) I beſeech thee, that thou do not miſtake vs, and deceiue thine owne ſoule. That thou maiſt not miſtake, I haue laboured to be as plain as I can: And that I might not ouerburthen or enſnare thy conſcience, I haue iuſtified ſuch contracts and dealings with money for money, as may ſtand vpon iuſt and equall grounds. The <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> contract of aſſociation or partnerſhip, where both parties are partners in gaine and loſſe, both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon diuine prouidence for a bleſſing: That law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 20.</note> intereſt which properly and truly is ſo called, when a mans money is forced or retained from him ſimply againſt his wil to his detriment; then to receiue ſatisfaction anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his damage: <note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 20. 21.</note> Buying &amp; ſelling for time in thoſe few caſes premiſed: <note n="d" place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> The thankfull gratuitie returned by the borrower out of his gain freely, without any precedent

                           <hi>reall exchange,</hi> which ſtandeth iuſtifiable vpon his owne grounds; if it be not poyſoned, as commonly it is, with vſurie: <note n="f" place="margin">Pag. 28. 29.</note> Thoſe equal conſiderations of courteſie, where one good turne requires another, without couenant for certaintie of cleere gaine in money or money worth: <note n="g" place="margin">Pag. 97.</note> Thoſe aſſurances where there is ſome equall aduenture, and where the hand of God in the loſſe lighteth vpon both parties: <note n="h" place="margin">Pag. 124.</note> To borrow, vpon vſurie in ſuch caſes of neceſſitie, as are before expreſſed. Thus haue I yeelded as much as poſſibly I could, loth to intangle thy conſcience, or to caſt a ſnare vpon thee. And ſome fewe Diuines (I confeſſe) haue yeelded ſomething more, then I <note place="margin">i Pag. 61. 62. 63.</note> can ſee good ground for. But that which I would haue thee to take eſpeciall notice of, is, that an abſolute coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for the loane of thy money, for ten, or nine, or eight, or ſeuen, or ſixe, is without warrant or authoritie, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe Diuines, who, vpon ſifting and examining this point, haue concluded moſt fauourablie for thee. Alas poore ſoule, whither wilt thou turne thy ſelfe for ſuccour when thy beſt friends forſake thee? What wilt thou plead for thy ſelfe when thou commeſt before the eternall Iudge vpon thy triall? How doeſt thou hope to die a Chriſtian, if thou liue a Vſurer? Doeſt thou hope for remiſſion in Chriſt Ieſus? It muſt be then vpon thy true repentance, in abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſinne. Canſt thou plead ignorance? Take heed it be not wilfull and affected ignorance, then is it double ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, which is more fearfull.</p>
                        <p>Be not obſtinate then and wilfully ignorant: let not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie lucre ſo blind thine eyes, that thou ſhouldeſt preſume, either to defend or to practiſe that, vnder a pretence of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for which thou ſhalt finde neither ſound reaſon nor good authoritie; neither approbation of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of any Chriſtian Church, that is, or euer was vpon the face of the earth: look vnto it therfore, leſt that fearful cenſure of our bleſſed Sauiour fall vpon thee, which fell on thoſe accurſed Iewes: <hi>Seeing they do not ſee, and hearing they</hi>
