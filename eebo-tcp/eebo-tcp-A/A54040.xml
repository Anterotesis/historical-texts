            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ENQUIRY AFTER <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> And after the People whom the Lord Eſtabliſheth and will Eſtabliſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in ſome Queries on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. and alſo on Chapter 54.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. ARe there any people to be found, who exceed that ſtate ſpoken of verſ. 2. of ſeeking God daily, and delighting to know his wayes, as a Nation that did Righteouſneſs, and forſook not the Ordinance of their God? They ask of me ſaid the Lord the Ordinances of Juſtice, they take delight in approaching to God. Are there not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſions and ſorts of Profeſſors at this day, who in Gods ſight fall ſhort of this ſtate, and yet think highly of themſelves? yet theſe the Prophet of the Lord was not to ſpare, but to lift up his Voice like a Trumpet againſt them, becauſe of their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and Sin which they committed, notwithſtanding their thus daily ſeeking the Lord.</p>
            <p>Quer. 2. What was the Tranſgreſſion and the Sins which the Prophet was not to ſpare them in, but lift up his Voice like a Trumpet againſt them for? Was it not (among other things) for their wrong faſting, their wrong afflicting their Souls, their wrong ſeeking of God, out of the meek, tender, merciful
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93410:2"/>
ſpirit? Doth God require ſuch faſting or praying of any man? or will the Lord accept ſuch faſting or praying at any mans hand? Ah how many faſt and pray at this day, who never rightly conſidered nor truly underſtood what the faſtings and what the prayers are, which God requireth, and which alone he will accept?</p>
            <p>Quer. 3. What is the faſt which God requireth, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in all Ages? Is not this it, <hi>To looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppreſſed go free; to break every yoke &amp;c. ver.</hi> 6.7. Who can underſtand or learn the faſt, but he that is taught of God?</p>
            <p>Quer. 4. Are there any, whoſe light breaks forth as the morning, and whoſe health ſprings forth ſpeedily; and whoſe righteouſneſs goeth before them, and whom the glory of the Lord gathereth up, or is a Rereward to (as is promiſed to thoſe who obſerve this faſt) and whom the Lord is ready to hear and anſwer in all that they call upon him for, as ver. 8.9? Doth not God teach his Children in the new Covenant to obſerve this faſt? And they who are taught by him to keep it (and do faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep it) do they not inherit this Promiſe?</p>
            <p>Quer. 5. Are there any now among the Sons of men, whoſe light hath riſen in obſcurity, and whoſe darkneſs hath become as noon-day? Whom the Lord guideth continually, and whoſe Soul he ſatisfieth in Droughts, and makes fat their bones: And makes them like a watered garden, and like a ſpring of water, whoſe Waters fail not? Surely if there be any, who are truly taught of the Lord to obſerve that which leads hereto, they cannot miſs of enioying theſe precious promiſes: For he is faithful and true who hath promiſed. (verſ. 10, 11.)</p>
            <p>Quer. 6. Are there any, at this day, whom God honoureth in building the old waſte Places, in raiſing up the Foundations of many Generations; in repairing the breach, and reſtoring the Paths to dwell in? What are the Paths that are to be dwelt in? Are they not the ſame which the Soul is to walk in? Is not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93410:2"/>
the juſt mans path and his dweling place all one, even the Light of the Living, which he is both to walk and abide in? See 1 Joh. 1.7. and Prov. 4.18.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid concerning Chriſt, <hi>He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as he walked</hi> 1 Joh. 2.6. How did Chriſt walk? Did he not walk in the Light of Gods Spirit? in Subjection to Gods Spirit? Was not the fulneſs given him? Was not the Father alwayes with him? And did not he act in the Father, and the Father in and through him? Now, doth not he give forth a meaſure of the ſame Spirit, of the ſame Anointing, of the ſame Power to become Sons unto all his? and are not they to walk according to the meaſure of Light and Life they receive from him? And he that walks according to this rule, can he err in ſo walking? Is not this the pure Path, the living Path, the Path for the ranſomed in the dayes of the Goſpel, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; not in the oldneſs of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but in the newneſs of the Spirit? O that men could conſider this with the true underſtanding, and know the way of Life in the true ſenſe and experience thereof! That which enlightens and gives life to my Soul, is ſomewhat from Chriſt, even a meaſure or appearance of his pure Spirit; it is no leſs: and the Law of Life written inward is more to the Soul then words written out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, though all the words that ever come from Gods holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are very precious, and greatly uſeful, to thoſe, to whom he vouchſafeth to give the underſtanding of them.</p>
            <p>Quer. 7. What is the Sabboth ſpoken of verſ. 13? Is it the Law-Sabboth, or the Goſpel-Sabboth? Is it inferior in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Faſt before mentioned? What is Gods Holy-day, which is the Souls delight, the holy of the Lords honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wherein the Souls that enter into the true Reſt (by Faith in him who is Life) honour the Lord, in ceaſing from their own wayes, pleaſures and words? ſee alſo <hi>Hebr:</hi> 4.3. and 10.</p>
            <p>Qu. 8. They that keep Gods holy Sabboth, do they not delight themſelves in the Lord? do they not feel the pleaſure of his Day, and of his Appearance in his day? Are not theſe of the true Seed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93410:3"/>
of <hi>Jacob</hi> (who prevail with the Lord for the bleſſing?) and doth not the Lord feed them with the Heritage of <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Bleſſings of the Covenant of Life and Peace for evermore.</p>

               <p>Quer. 5 Who is this, whoſe ſtones God layes with fair Colours, and her Foundations with Saphires? whoſe Windows God makes of Agates, and her Gates of Carbuncles, and all her Borders of Pleaſant Stones? Was not the Covenant of Life ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned in the Apoſtles days? and is ſhe not ſo adorned now again?</p>
               <p>Quer. 6. Whoſe children are they, who ſhall be all taught of the Lord, and whoſe peace ſhall be great, who ſhall be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs, who ſhall be far from Oppreſſion; ſo that they ſhall not fear, and from terror ſo that it ſhall not come neer them? Are there ſuch a Generation of the heavenly Birth, of the Covenant of Life, brought forth in this our day, who ſanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and make him their fear and their dread, but are not terrified with the wicked one, nor with the Snares and Engines of the ungodly? Surely they who are taught of God, have peace from him and in him, and are eſtabliſhed in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit and life of his Son, they are like mount Sion, which cannot be ſhaken or removed, by all the Terrors and oppreſſing Devices of the ungodly.</p>

Or will God ſuffer him ſo to do? they may indeed deſtroy the buildings which are not of God: But God is the wiſe, great, Maſter-builder, who counted his coſt before he began and knew he was able to maintain his Building, againſt all the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Oppoſors which could riſe up againſt it.</p>
               <p>Qu. 9. Can any weapon formed againſt the Covenant of Life and the Children thereof, who are taught of God and have great peace from him, and who are eſtabliſhed by him in Righteouſneſs; I ſay, can any weapon formed againſt theſe proſper? Every tongue that riſeth up in judgment againſt them, doth not the holy Tongue condemn? Is not this the Heritage of the Servants of the Lord, in this our day? and doth not the Lord ſay (what ever men ſay to the contrary) that their Righteouſneſs is of him? Indeed, who ever receiveth the true Righteouſneſs, receiveth it from the hand of the Lord, and knoweth it to be of him. And this teſtimony we have, even from the Spirit of the Lord, who taketh away our Unrighteouſneſs and filthy Garments, and giveth us Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from and in his Son; that the righteouſneſs which he giveth us, is his Sons Righteouſneſs, even the very ſame wherewith the Son himſelf was clothed. For as the Seed is but one, and of one (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.) ſo the righteouſneſs is but one neither. Be not haſty in ſpirit but wait to underſtand it in the Light and Spirit of the Lord, which is Wiſdoms place of giving true underſtanding to her Diſciples.</p>
               <p>It is true, there hath been great Darkneſs, and the true Church hath been in the Wilderneſs, and the Remnant of her Seed hunted and perſecuted up and down the Earth by the falſe Church, which hath been cried up for the true. But bleſſed be the Lord the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is paſſing away, and the true Light ſhining again: which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93410:4"/>
Light diſcovers and redeems out of all that is falſe, into that which is true: ſo that he that is truth and no lye is again known, and he ſpeaketh truth and no lye, and anointeth with the true and holy Oyle of Life and Salvation, all that are truly living. And now the kingdom of Darkneſs is going down, and the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt raiſing up and exalting; which is an inward Kingdom, a ſpiritual Kingdom, a Kingdom of Life, a Kingdom of Peace, a Kingdom of Righteouſneſs, a Kingdom of holy Power and Dominion over ſin and death in the heart. And this will ſpread and increaſe, to the bleſſing of Perſons, Families and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as they come to be ſenſible of and ſubject to the Holy Light and Power thereof) which the Bleſſings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> wherewith all Families and Nations are to be bleſſed, as they come to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened from the ſerpentine ſpirit and wiſdom, and leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Innocency and Righteouſneſs of the Lambs Nature and Spirit.</p>
               <p>The mighty God carry on his work, by the ſame mighty Arm of Strength wherewith he began it; and open the eyes of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they may ſee their proper hope and intereſt: for indeed the Lord hath great love to this Nation, and a bleſſing in ſtore for it, (for the Seeds ſake which he hath ſown and cauſed to ſpring up in it,) though many tryals and tribulations muſt firſt be paſſed through, and the ſpirit of Enmity and Oppoſition againſt the appearance of Gods holy Spirit and Power worn out. O that men could come to that which gives the eye-ſight, that thereby they might ſee a right, and no longer take the riſe of their ſeeing from that ſpirit and wiſdom which miſs-repreſents things.</p>
