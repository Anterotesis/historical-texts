         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen we look upon the ways of moſt men now
adays we ſee, that although many have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
eſteem of Learning, and cry it up highly
in thoſe who have attain'd thereunto: yet few
there are that have any great Zeal to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
it unto others: and of thoſe few whoſe
affections may lye ſomewhat that way, in a
whole Age, hardly ſhall wee find one or two,
who are willing to neglect themſelves to doe
ſervice unto others, or caſting themſelves upon Divine Providence,
to poſtpoſe wholy their private and ſingle Intereſts, unto the Publike
Good of many, therefore when it pleaſeth God to raiſe up and put
forth ſuch Publike Spirits, as ſometimes he doth offer, for a bleſſing
to the Society of Mankinde; all others, that have any true love to
Vertue, and eſteem of Learning, or with Uprightneſs favour Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Enterprizes: ſhould appear on their behalf, to give them that
encouragement, which may bring the Works whereunto God hath
fitted them, unto ſome perfection. For hereunto God doth call us,
by the offer of ſuch opportunities, namely, that in the Communion
of Saints we ſhould appeare for the advancement of his Kingdome,
that the things, which neither we nor any one can do by himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
all of us according to our ability, ſhould joyntly promote, as
members of each other; to ſhew that we have a love to the Body of
Chriſt, and would gladly be helpers unto the Truth, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of the Glory of our God therein. Such an opportunity is
<pb facs="tcp:50308:3"/>
now afforded unto us in the Perſon of one Doctor <hi>Cyprian Kinner,</hi>
a Man of ſingularly eminent gracious and naturall Parts, and of a
very Publike Spirit, who by birth being of very honeſt parents, and
well educated in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> hath had from his youth, a ſpeciall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to advance that part of Learning, which is the foundation of all
the reſt, and without which all the other parts will be obſtructed and
remain imperfect both in Church and Common-wealth; that is, the
right Education of Children, to bring their Scholaſticall Studies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome regular courſe and perfection. A Work which every where
to the great prejudice of Chriſtianity, and the whole ſtate of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Felicity, is much neglected, which for this very cauſe ought ſo
much the more to be minded by generous and noble Spirits, who
ſeek not themſelves, but the Glory of God in all their wayes. And
although at firſt, the aforeſaid Doctor <hi>Kinner,</hi> did meet with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
difficulties, which attend Publike Undertakings; namely,
little encouragement from any; and no ſupport for livelihood in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
theſe Studies; Yet he left not off his Deſigne to proſecute
the ſame; but that he might have a ſubſiſtence with more comfort
then by the way of Schooling could be obtained: he did betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
unto the Studies of Law and Phyſick, which ordinarily in thoſe
Parts, yield a plentifull livelihood unto thoſe that follow them. And
having ſoon by the eminencie and vigour of his naturall abilities,
made himſelf perfect therein, he took the Degree of Doctor in both
thoſe Faculties, and in proceſſe of time through Gods bleſſing upon
him in thoſe ways; hee was in great eſteem amongſt all that knew
him: and eſpecially honoured by the Duke of <hi>Brieg</hi> and <hi>Lignits,</hi>
who made him one of his Privy Counſellors: and by his favour and
his own merits having married a Lady of great wealth: he did reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
his Deſigne of advancing the Reformation of Schools, and the
Education of Children, and having an Extraordinary Zeal for that
publike Work: he did ſet apart of his Ladies eſtate, with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the ſum of 12000 Rixdollers (which doth amount to more
then 2000 and 600 li. ſterling) which was dedicated to entertaine a

had not been long upon that courſe, when it pleaſed God to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
thoſe purpoſes, by the comming in of the Imperiall Army
into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> by whoſe cruelty he being diſpoiled of his whole eſtate,
was driv<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n out of his Countrey into exile with his Lady, and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where he hath wreſtled many yeers with the difficulties incident
to that ſtate: hardly maintaining himſelf, ſometimes by being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in Civill Affaires, ſometimes by applying himſelf unto the
practice of Phyſick. Amongſt other places he did paſſe ſometime of
his Exile in <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> and <hi>Hungaria;</hi> where his acquaintance with
Maſter <hi>Alſtedius,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Biſterfeld,</hi> and other Learned men of
chief note, and his conſtant Zeal to promote the Reformation of
Schooling; did cauſe many upon the report of their eſteeme of his
thoughts &amp; endevours on that ſubject, to take ſpeciall notice of him;
and amongſt others M. <hi>Comenius</hi> (who was by the liberality of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Gentleman maintain'd, and ſet apart to further the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne)
having gotten information of him: and what his inclinations
and abilities were to be helpfull in the work, which he had in hand,
did invite him to come unto him in <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> that they might joyne
their thoughts and endevours together for the Advancement of their
Common Aimes: which Doctor <hi>Kinner</hi> did readily condeſcend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and after a yeare or two, when by their mutuall communications
and joint labours, they had ripened ſeverall matters (which will
ſhortly come to light) Maſter <hi>Comenius</hi> was called away by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravian-Bohemian</hi>
Church at <hi>Leſno,</hi> where now he is, and Doctor
<hi>Kinner</hi> being taken off from his private way of ſubſiſtence, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
upon the Object of his publike thoughts, is left alone in <hi>Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> to depend upon Providence. Whiles <hi>Mr. Comenius</hi>
was with him he had a ſhare in that which was allowed unto him for
his maintenance, but he now being gone, Doctor <hi>Kinner</hi> is left in a
great ſtraight; On the one ſide, his zealous affection and love to
ſo neceſſary a Work, wherein he hath made ſo great progreſſes, draws
him to apply himſelf wholly unto it; on the other ſide, his want of
neceſſary means to ſubſiſt, and to be able to publiſh that which he
<pb facs="tcp:50308:4"/>
already hath done, doth draw him from it to employ himſelfe to
other private employments.</p>
            <p>Between theſe two extremities, not knowing what the Providence
of God will finde out and ordain for him, he hath caſt himſelfe upon
it, and offering his endeavours before all to the publike, hee hath
engaged himſelfe by a Vow unto God (which is the ſtrongeſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
he can give of his faithfulnes) to dedicate his whole time to the
proſecuting of the Deſigne, whereof the Summary is herewith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned;
if God will be pleaſed to continue, for a yeare or two, his
life, and procure him aſſiſtance therein; which deſire of his doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſo much the more encouragement from all ſuch as love to have
a hand in publike works of ſo great uſe and importance, by how much
it is modeſt and reaſonable, for he wiſheth onely for ſubſiſtence, ſo
long till the Commentary or ſome larger Expoſition of the Heads of
matters contained in the Summary can be publiſhed, that the Godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
who favour ſuch Publike Enterprizes, may be able to judge
how ſerviceable his Worke and Abilities may be to the ways of
Reformation, and whether or no the reſt of his life ſhould not be
ſet apart for the full accompliſhment thereof. If this much onely at
firſt may be obteined by the publike heartedneſſe of ſuch which
wiſh well to the advancement of Gods glory, and are not unwilling
to contribute ſome liberall help which they can ſpare towards the
moſt likely and effectuall wayes, which as yet have been offered for
the right framing of Childrens ſtudies to the readie attainment of
vertue and knowledge. If (I ſay) this way be obtained, it will be a
great advantage unto a further propagation of Chriſts Kingdom,
and a ſpeciall comfort in theſe evill times, unto faithfull ſouls that
ſhall not withdraw their hands from giving aſſiſtance thereunto,
for they ſhall have a ſhare in the honour of repairing the Walls of
our deſolate <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and be regiſtred amongſt thoſe that have
laid the foundations of many Generations.</p>

For having once publiſhed the ſaid Commentary it is not my Intention to
attempt any thing elſe of this Nature, till I ſhall be confirmed by the
Votes of Piouſly-learned men, that it will be worth the while to proceed.
For whatſoever I have done, muſt according to it's deſerts either ſtand or

            <p>But be pleaſed to underſtand theſe few things before-hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the drift of my Invention for Teachiug is, That all Things Neceſſary to

be known may be inſtilled into Learners without the troubleſome getting
of things by heart, without the uſuall confuſed multitude of Books, and
without the ill Cuſtome of Dictations, by the only meer help of ſenſible
Objects, and by Talk, and Exerciſe both ſerious and by way of ſport and
paſtime, with ſo much firmneſſe (as I believe) that nothing thereof ſhall
eaſily be forgotten, with that ſoundneſſe and certainty, that no man ſhall
eaſily refuſe it, and in that fulneſſe and plenty that nothing either neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
or uſefull (eſpecially of Things Domeſtick and Uſefull) can be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſired, Moreover, with that ſimplicity and plainneſe, that all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Wits, Diſpoſitions and Sects may be indifferently admitted unto this
Method. For it propoundeth nothing, but what every man may with his
owne Senſes truly and properly conceive as an Ens or a Thing in being;
and apprehend it as true, by his own Mother knowledge, aud alſo by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Inſtinct, deſire it as Good. The Convenience, Poſsibility, and every
Proceſſe of this Method, I ſhall as ſhortly as I ſaid before, more fully

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my way of Teaching School, I aime at three Marks
<hi>Piety, Learning,</hi> and <hi>Civill Prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 To the hitting of each Mark (or obtaining of each
end) I aſſigne certain ſteps, to every ſtep, certain tasks,
each of which task's, comprehends certain leſſons. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
alſo herewithall a Directory how to order the Formes in my
Schools, how to ſpeak to my Scholars in each leſſon, and how to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
the Impreſſion or Remembrance of them.</p>
            <p>3 For the Implantation of <hi>Piety,</hi> I make three ſteps. <hi>viz.</hi> The
taking Men off from the love of the World, Reſignation of their
own love, and exerciſe in the love of God.</p>
            <p>4 Under the love of the World are contained Pleaſure, Riches
and Honour, under Self-love, Wiſdom, Strength and Life: under
the love of God, Faith, Hope, and Obedience.</p>
            <p>5 My Scholars therefore by and by after their firſt admittance
muſt be taught, led and accuſtomed to avoid the former, to diſeſteem
the other, and to make much of the latter. In the practice whereof
the degrees thereof being ſtill obſerved, they are to be held and kept,
not only, during the whole courſe of their Inſtruction; but their
whole life alſo.</p>
            <p>6 Towards the obtaining of Learning. I appoint three ſteps; <hi>viz.</hi>
three for the knowledge of Things, three for the framing of Words,
and three for directiou of the Thoughts and Conceptions of the
minde.</p>
            <p>7 Having firſt ranked all Things into proper Claſſes I teach their
Marks or Signatures, their Frame or Structure, with their Vertues
and Operations that every Novice-learner may underſtand what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50308:6"/>
every Thing is, what they contain, and what they do, (that is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they ſerve.)</p>
            <p>8 Having taught to pronounce the words firſt in the Mother
tongue ſignifying each Thing, I ſhew next how to ſhape the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
or Letter ſignifying thoſe words, then their ſetting together ſo
as to make a compleat Language, and laſtly, the uſe of this language
towards the learning of any other. That the Learner hereby may
know, how to communicate his Thoughts to the abſent, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of theirs, and to draw out of both Ancient and Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
whatſoever of humane and divine knowledge is contain'd in
their writings.</p>
            <p>9 Touching the Conceptions of the minde (Which are to be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
applyed to Things) I teach how to guide the proceedings of
the Invention, Judgement upon, and Order of them; That my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
may know how to finde out unknown Things, to diſtinguiſh
the doubtfull, and to put in order the confuſed and diſtracted.</p>
            <p>10 In the firſt ſtep or degree to learning (as I ſaid before) I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the Marks or Signatures of Things, firſt naming them when
brought to our ſight in our Mother tongue, then deſcribing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
habit as well totall as particular of each, and that by its three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
accidents: Laſtly, teaching them to apprehend them diſtinctly,
by ſome one or more differentiall characters.</p>
            <p>11 I ſhew Naturall Things in the living book of Nature; Things
Artificiall in the Shops and Work-houſes of their Makers, &amp; both of
them in the Repoſitories of their figures, &amp; repreſentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> belong
to our School, where I ſhew them either living or carved, (yet as
neere the life as may be) or at leaſt painted. As for Things Divine
(ſo many of them as are expedient to be known) I fetch them, and
explain there of out of Holy Scripture. Laſtly, I compare the <hi>Marks</hi>
of one Thing with thoſe of another, ſhewing what Things do alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
what do more or leſſe according to ſome particular reſpects,
and what do not at all agree in their ſaid marks or ſignatures. So as
their outward likeneſs or unlikeneſs, may be more cleerly knowne,
may ſtick more faſt in the memory, and that the way may be laid, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50308:6"/>
look into the conformity and deformity of their fabrick or ſtructure.</p>
            <p>13 In the ſecond ſtep, I explicate the frame and ſtructure of
Things, and firſt Analytically, or by taking them in pieces, wherein I
divide them (firſt known by their outward Marks) into their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral
parts, as alſo Things naturall into their parts, Eſſentiall and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall;
So that in the former, the Artifice of their Mechanicall
connexion, and in the other the proportion of Elements mixt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are made, and ſo the very ground and ſpecies of their outward
Marks, may be ſet before our Eyes and the cauſes of their ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
durability and operations, may be rightly rendred.</p>
            <p>14 Then Synthetically or by way of Compoſition, where I ſhew
to the very eye how Nature, Art and God himſelf, produce their
works (each of them his own) by deſigning them, doing and undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, that the Learner may know how to imitate, make or
change any thing, that is lawfull, profitable or neceſſary.</p>
            <p>15 At length Syncritically, or by comparing the ſtructure of
Things together, and ſhewing what Things doe agree, either in their,
Active or Paſſive Principles, or in their Organicall parts, either
throughout, partly, or not at all, ſo that there inward likeneſſe, or
unlikeneſs may appeare alſo, and the way laid by theſe ſtructures of
Things to know their Vertues, as before by the Signatures to know
their Structure.</p>
            <p>16 In the third ſtep I teach the Vertues and operative Faculties of
Things, and firſt of all I teach in generall, how by their ſignature and
ſtructure (found out as before and conſidered together) to know their
ſtrength and powers <hi>(viz:</hi> of Things Naturall, as they are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by ſuch or ſuch a ſpirit, of Things Artificiall, as they are ſo or ſo
uſed, by the work-men; of Things Divine as they are thus or thus
applied by men) as alſo the motions, ariſing from their ſaid Powers,
their effects from their Motions, and laſtly their Uſes and ſervice in
the world.</p>
            <p>17 Then I expound in ſpeciall what effects all things worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Countercopy Man in particular, who is the Ruler, Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and <hi>Moderator</hi> of them all, and how they conduce either to Food
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50308:7"/>
or Medicine, to Clothing or Houſing or to Delight or Information.</p>
            <p>18 Then in a yet more eſpeciall manner, I ſhew how that Man
and only him, containes within himſelf, the vertue of all other
things in the world, and that he is furniſhed with various abilities, to
underſtand, imitate or change any of them, ſo that he is a true <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſme,</hi>
and an expreſſe Image of the <hi>Macrocoſme,</hi> yea of God
the Creator himſelfe.</p>
            <p>19 In the fourth ſtep I teach the way of repreſenting by Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
the words of our Mother tongue, and how to pronounce
them, ſo repreſented, teaching my Scholars how firſt to faſhion
lines, whereof afterwards letters are made, then the whole letters
themſelves, laſtly, ſyllables ariſing from the compoſition of letters,
and then they are to pronounce, or ſound thoſe letters and ſyllables,
and to find them up and down, in books of ſeverall prints, always
proceeding from the more ſimple and eaſie lines, letters and ſyllables,
by the more compounded, to the moſt compound, and complexed
of all.</p>
            <p>20 Then I ſet my Scholars ſo long exerciſed in ſpelling, till they
can do it <hi>extempore,</hi> to write and pronounce whole words, ſtill obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the former graduall way of proceeding from the moſt Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the moſt Compound; and I make them dwell ſo long upon
this Exerciſe, till they can readily read and write any word not only
by copying it, but without any Copy by heart alſo.</p>
            <p>21 And becauſe Arithmeticall cyphers are numbring words I
teach to write and to pronounce them alſo, and to tell the valew of
many of them, placed in a certaine order, which we call Numeration.</p>
            <p>22 In the fift ſtep I teach how to draw all theſe words ſo known
a part, into a compleat language, either to be written or ſpoken, and
that materially, formally, or contextually, by putting all words of
a kind into Claſſes by themſelves, then he wing thoſe Claſſes til they
become fit to lye in a well ordered fabrick, and laſtly, by erecting an
Edifice of theſe ſo prepared materials.</p>
            <p>23 For the materiall conſtitution I have deſigned an Exemplary
Dictionary, wherein are firſt placed all words Radicall, whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50308:7"/>
or not, as alſo additionall particles, whether to be joyned,
either before or behind with any of them. This I intend ſhall be
done Pariſſyllabically, ſo as all the Monoſylables ſhall goe before
the by ſyllables, or words of two ſyllables follow, and after them the
triſyllables if any be. Among the declinable, the Nounes ſhall
lead the Van, the Verbes be in the middle and the particles partaking
of both, bring up the Reare. Moreover, of the declinables, thoſe of
the ſame declenſion ſhall ſtand by themſelves in order, according to
the divers prerogatives of their Terminations, Genders and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>24 After this I lay down Rules how almoſt an innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of words may be derived from and compounded out of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and ſimple: ſo far as to reach and expreſſe all Things and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
and how their Radicall ſignification, may be fitted to them:
laſtly, how theſe derivatives may be diſpoſed in Claſſes anſwerable
to their primitives, for the future uſe of declining them.</p>
            <p>25 For the forming and ſetting together of words I intend a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
Directory, wherein I expound by ſhort exemplified Rules,
every tribe in the Claſſes of my Dictionary, and alſo the differences
and other accidents of all words, whether declinable or undecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and additionall, or under one, ſhewing how each tribe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinables
(whether Nouns, Verbs or Particles of this or that Claſſis
(each according to his kind) ought to be declined, how they ought to
be joined together, to make up a Phraſe, how out of Phraſes Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of Sentences periods, and of periods Sections ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
and that either in proper aequivocall or figurative expreſſions,
as may be moſt for the embelliſhing of the context. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textual
Conſtitution I intend an hiſtorical Text or Diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I preſent all the words, aſwell primitive as derivative of an whole
language, with all the ways of declining, connecting and tranſnomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
them, under the form of one continued Hiſtory or Diſcourſe.
That all the Reall Tasks for Exerciſes from the beginning hitherto
ſcatteringly ſet down, may be repeated, together with a true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the co-ordination of the Things ranked in each Claſſis.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50308:8"/>
Having always an eye to the gradation, proportion &amp; accurate choice
of Sentences, Periods and the ſtyle it ſelf, ſo as the firſt part of the
ſaid Diſcourſe may conſiſt of ſhort Sentences and Periods, and be
written in a low and proper ſtyle, the next part of Sentences, &amp;c.
neither very ſhort nor very long, but between both, and in a mean
ſtyle, but that the third may be of more full Sentences, and in a ſtyle
more ſublime and flouriſhing.</p>
            <p>26 In the next ſtep I teach the uſe of the Mother-tongue, in order
to the obtaining of more Languages, ſhewing how the Mother-tongue
of each Nation, (which whether wee will or no, doth
uſe to obtrude it ſelfe upon us) as a Miſtris and Law-giver in
the terming of others) may be made the rule and guide to perfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
forreign tongue, ſo that the emulation now among them may
thereby ceaſe, to make them all able to expreſſe any Thing or
Thought, and laſtly, to learn them all ſpeedily, ſhewing how eaſie it
is to one that knoweth his own tongue, the terms of Art belonging
to all (as what a Radicall word is, what a Derivative or Compound,
what a Termination, Declenſion, Syntaxis, and what a Phraſe, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
Period, &amp;c. are) to learn any other Language whatſoever, and
what deviſe in particular this may be done upon the Latine tongue,
and conſequently upon other learned and popular Languages, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
eſteem.</p>
            <p>27 To theſe purpoſes therefore (premiſing information and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
both by ſpeech and writing, whereſoever they are needfull) I
fit the ſame Inſtruments. <hi>viz.</hi> a Dictionary, Directory, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
the firſt in the courſe and order of the ſame Claſſes, the
ſecond of the ſame kinde of Rules, the third of the ſame words,
ſetting the Latine firſt, and thoſe of other Languages afterwards;
and if there be any Idiome, or property in any of them,
them, which my Rules will not beare, as in deriving, declining or
connecting them, &amp;c. I note them all along by way of Exception or
Obſervation, inſtilling any Language by this way of paralleling or
comparing them, even ten times more eaſily then otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>28 In the ſeventh ſtep I exerciſe my Auditors about Thoughts,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50308:8"/>
ſhewing how they ought to enquire after a Thing unknown whether
it be or not, To ſearch after it, if it lie hid, where it is, or where
it is not? and if it be not as yet, then to finde out the Means, that it
may eitherbe, or be in a poſſibility of being.</p>
            <p>29 For the eight ſtep, I employ them upon Thoughts or Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Judicative, teaching them how they ought to examine a Thing
of whoſe exiſtence, and being they are already ſatisfied, that is, how
they ought to approve of it, or diſallow; Enquiring what is it, or is
not; as well in it ſelfe, as in relation to other Things. Alſo why or
how the ſame is or is not, that which it ſeems to be, and ſo whether
it be true or falſe.</p>
            <p>Then enquiring what that Thing contains, or whether it contains
nothing, and why and how it contains, that it doth contain. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
whether it doth or acteth or not, whether it ſuffereth or not, and
conſequently whether it be ſimply honeſt, or neceſſary profitable
or pleaſant, poſſible and eaſie, to be deſired and done. Or on the
contrary whether it be diſhoneſt or needleſſe, unprofitable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant,
impoſſible or difficult, and ſo to be avoided or neglected.</p>
            <p>Then laſtly, whether yea or no, and in what part and regard, a
Thing, containeth any other thing more or leſſer whether it ſo doth
or ſuffereth not. And ſo whether in reſpect to another Thing it be
more or leſſe honeſt, profitable, pleaſant, poſſible, eaſie, to be deſired,
or practiſed, or the contrary of all or any of theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>30 In the ninth ſtep I verſe them in Thoughts Ordinative, for the
orderly Diſpoſing and Methodizing of Things, Teaching what is
to be firſt or laſt thought, ſaid, or written, of any thing. If any thing
ſhall occur that is confuſed, how it ought to be reduced into order; In
ſpeciall in what courſe thoſe Inventive and Judicative Thoughts,
ought with diſcretion to be brought into the form, either of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,
Diſcourſe or Oration, of a Diſputation, Conſultation, or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,
or entire Body of an Art or Science, and that in ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
as the nature of the thing requires; whether Analyticall, Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall,
or according to the Modern Authours Syncriticall.</p>
            <p>31 And that there may appear a notable proof or example of this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50308:9"/>
tripartite Method, and all the Exerciſes of Learning, Reall, Verball
and Notionall, may be viewed together at one caſt of the eye, wee
ſhall repreſent the Concords and diſagreements, and other relations
of all the Things, which we have conſidered apart in their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in three continued Columns running parallel, or ſide by ſide from
top to bottom both by firſt and ſecond notions, and conſequently in
their terins of Art.</p>
            <p>Shewing how all Naturall Things do like a Tree concur and meet
in the root, and partake all of the ſame ſap, and do differ from each
other, onely as boughes ſpreading ſeverall ways, and conſequently
that they were all at firſt, and may yet be made by one generall I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea:
and furthermore that Artificials, and even Things Myſticall
themſelves, may likewiſe be ſquared by the ſame Rule. And if there
appeare any difference in particulars of this or that Claſſis; we ſhew
that it either proceedeth from the different concurrence of ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
principles, or from a different faſhion of the Organs; or from a
different intention of the Agent, and ſo that there is nothing ſeen in
Things naturall, whereunto there may not be found ſome one or
more of Things Artificiall and Myſticall to anſwer, or if not, ſuch
as yet are found that ſuch ought by their track to be ſought after.</p>
            <p>32 In which harmonicall One-triple, <hi>viz.</hi> Naturall, Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,
Myſticall Syſteem, or Body, all Arts and Sciences that
ever were yet invented, or ſhall ever be hereafter, are as (to
their generall Idea's) implicitly imboſomed, and may be explicitly
inſerted and ſubordinated thereunto, that it may appeare, which
are Parent, and which coozen Faculties, which of them ſpring from
others, &amp; which have the ſame common Originals; which exceed in
perfection, worth and dignity; how many and what in quality, may
yet be invented, and according to what ſpeciall Idea's, they ought to
be ordered and diſtributed; to make the Analogy or Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of naturall Operations compleat and perfect.</p>
            <p>33 Towards the acquiſition of Civill Prudence, there are alſo
three ſteps, a comely carriage in outward Manners, a choice of a fit
courſe of private life, and the skill of duly managing a publike Office
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50308:9"/>
or Employment, if any ſuch ſhall be offered. In all and each of which
things my Scholars are to be thoroughly inſtructed.</p>
            <p>34 Their Manners or Carriage ought to be neat, comly &amp; grave,
as well in their countenance and geſtures as in their ſpeech, which are
to be diverſified according to Age, Sex, Way of life, publike Charge,
Deſerts and Relations to Superiours, Equals and Inferiours.</p>
            <p>35 Their Way of life ought be accommodated and fitted to their
Genius and diſpoſition, and ſometimes to occaſions of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and when publike Exigence requires it, let there be heed
taken in the choice of Miniſters. For <hi>Mercury</hi> is not made out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Block.</p>
            <p>36 The execution of a Publike Office (whether it be for teaching
either in the School or Church, or in taking care of the Affaires
and Health of other men, or in defending their lives and eſtates in
Courts of Juſtice, or Equity) ought to be dextrous and expeditious,
faithfull and conſcientious, cleer of Ignorance, Deceit, or any other
faults whatſoever.</p>
