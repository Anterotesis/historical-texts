         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF THIS REPVBLIKE, nor claime, nor exerciſe an Headſhip, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

Chriſt onely being the Lord of mens conſciences, which ought to be left at liberty.

<hi>as it is</hi> (in <hi>Jobs</hi> expreſsion) <hi>to bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane.</hi>
That the Parliaments claiming or exerciſing any ſuch Eccleſiaſticall Power, or

<pb facs="tcp:159261:5"/>

            <p>It was my primitive <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> to have publiſhed this <hi>Treatiſe</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, I here preſent thee with <hi>Truth Triumphing
over Falſhood, Antiquity over Novelty;</hi> to ſettle both thy
Judgement and Practice, in theſe unſetled times, wherein the
very <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Parliaments, States, Churches, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
are ſhaken and ſubverted, by ſome of our owne dear
Friends, from whom wee leaſt expected it.</p>
            <p>For my part, I take no pleaſure in detecting my <hi>Brethrens</hi> nakedneſſe,
Errors, Over-ſights; nor in diſparaging their Worth or Writings; yet I muſt
needs acquaint thee, for thine owne good, to preſerve thee from ſeducement,
with ſome materiall Obſervations touching their <hi>Independent Treatiſes;</hi>
for which thou maiſt chance to give me thanks.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they all generally take that for granted, which they ſhould
prove and demonſtrate to us: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>there is an exact and moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
forme of Church-Government preſcribed to all Churches in the
Scripture; from which no man muſt vary in the leaſt title: And that
the Independent Way it is, and no other.</hi> But when wee demand of them
how they prove it? or what that Way, Government, and Diſcipline is they
contend for? or in what plaine Scripture Texts they find it inſtituted and
univerſally preſcribed to all Nations, Churches? or how they make good all
their tranſcendent <hi>Encomiums</hi> of their New Way? wee find them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſilent or unſatisfactory: telling us onely a large ſtory of the <hi>Patterne of
the Tabernacle ſhewed to</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Mount;</hi> of the <hi>exact forme of
the Temple ſhewed to</hi> David <hi>by the Spirit; and of</hi> Ezekiels <hi>viſion, and
his and the Angels meaſuring of the Temple:</hi> Which are nothing to the
point; and meere impertinencies, fit to delude the ignorant injudicious vulgar;
who take their weake inferences thence for divine Oracles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they are extraordinary bold, confident, peremptory, copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in their affirmations and poſitions concerning their Way; but very poore,
<pb facs="tcp:159261:6"/>
lame, impotent, deficient in their proofes thereof: You muſt take their bare Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions
for undeniable Arguments, Proofes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, That their whole</hi> Independent Fabricke <hi>is built either upon</hi> falſe
Principles; <hi>As, that</hi> every Church is a complete, abſolute, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
body of it ſelfe; ſubject onely unto Chriſt: <hi>That</hi> no humane
Power upon earth hath any Right or Authority to preſcribe any Rules
or Orders to any particular Congregation: <hi>That</hi> juſt humane Lawes
binde not the Conſcience, in point of obedience: <hi>and the like. Or elſe
upon</hi> falſe, <hi>or</hi> abſurd Inferences <hi>from</hi> true Principles: <hi>As, that</hi> Chriſt
is the King, Lord, Head, and Law-giver of his Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> No man
or humane Power may make Lawes or Canons, to regulate and order
it, or any thing in it, but Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That to maintaine their <hi>New Way of Government,</hi> they are
enforced to deny the undoubted Power and Juriſdiction of <hi>Parliaments, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,
Synods, Kings,</hi> and <hi>Civill Magiſtrates, in Eccleſiaſticall affaires;</hi>
and to maintaine ſuch Paradoxes, Paſſages againſt their lawfull Authority, as,
if duly pondered, may juſtly induce all Wel-affected perſons to miſtruſt and
abhorre their Way, as <hi>Anarchicall,</hi> and deſtructive to all <hi>Chriſtian and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, That they are conſtrained publikely to deny, that <hi>there is any</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vindication. p. 30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Church under the New Teſtament;</hi> though they acknowledge one
in the Old: Upon which ground they muſt of neceſsity likewiſe deny one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Creed; <hi>That there is a Catholike Church;</hi> and themſelves
members of it, or of the <hi>Nationall Church of England.</hi> They pluck up the
<hi>bounds and orderly diſtribution of all Pariſh Churches;</hi> abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to avoyd confuſion; to provide competent maintenance for Miniſters;
to bring all to frequent the publike Ordinances: Warranted by Scripture; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee read not onely of diſtinct Synagogues, and Tribes under the Law, but
Churches under the Goſpel. Approved by the practice of all Chriſtian Churches,
ever ſince there were Chriſtian Emperors, Princes; and as neceſſary as diſtinct
Families, Villages, Cities, Societies of men in civill reſpects; yea obſerved
in <hi>New-England</hi> it ſelfe, though now diſliked in <hi>Old:</hi> and thereby bring in
meere <hi>Ataxy</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They are conſtrained to wreſt Scriptures againſt their meaning; to
invent many ſtrange Apocryphall new ſhifts, Interpretations, Diſtinctions, to
evade direct Scriptures and fundamentall Truths, never formerly queſtioned:
They nullifie and ſlight Examples of the Old Teſtament, in all things that
make againſt them; and yet cry them up againe, when they make for them;
eſpecially in the point of <hi>their</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vindication. pag. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Church Covenant;</hi> which they confeſſe, <hi>hath
no ground at all in the New Teſtament, but onely in the Jewiſh Church
<pb facs="tcp:159261:6"/>
under the Old.</hi> Which yet they will not admit a ſufficient Proofe of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, They intricate, gain-ſay things which are <hi>cleare;</hi> take things
for granted, that are either <hi>falſe,</hi> or <hi>doubtfull;</hi> confound things in <hi>generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
which they ſhould <hi>diſtinguiſh;</hi> deny things that are apparently <hi>true;</hi> yea,
which is worſt of any, not only affirming, but beleeving moſt things<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford p. 369, 370.</note> with a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;</hi>
according <hi>to their preſent light; to the poſture of their preſent
Judgement;</hi> as <hi>they are yet informed;</hi> with a <hi>liberty of altering or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
to morrow, from what they affirme or beleeve to day, upon new
light diſcovered;</hi> Which is in truth to bring a meere <hi>Skepticiſme</hi> into Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to play <hi>faſt and looſe</hi> with God and our owne Conſciences; to <hi>doubt all
things;</hi> firmely <hi>beleeve nothing;</hi> to ſet up <hi>Opinion</hi> in the <hi>Throne and
Place of Faith;</hi> and in concluſion to introduce <hi>flat Atheiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly, They</hi> refuſe Church-Communion with thoſe who are not
of their Way and Churches, <hi>excluding them from the</hi> Lords Table, <hi>and
their very</hi> Children from Baptiſme in their Churches, <hi>if they ſubmit not
to their</hi> Covenant <hi>and</hi> Way; <hi>judging them all profeſſed</hi> Enemies to the
Kingdome and Government of Chriſt; <hi>and ſo</hi> viſibly without the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace: <hi>though never ſo Pious or Religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, Their very <hi>Principles</hi> teach diſobedience to <hi>Parliaments, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
Princes, Magiſtrates,</hi> and all other <hi>Superiors,</hi> in all their juſt <hi>Lawes
and Commands</hi> which concerne the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Religion;</hi> diſſolve all <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
all <hi>Subordinations,</hi> and <hi>humane Society</hi> it ſelfe, as I have here fully

to the Apoſtolicall See of Rome. That regularly no Synod ought to be

which is ſummoned without his authority; And that all Councels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <hi>Nicolaus Cufanus</hi> determines the quite contrary in theſe very
termes. The authority of a Councell doth not ſo depend of him by whom
it was ſummoned, that unles it be ſummoned by the Pope it can be no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:159261:10"/>
for ſo we ſhould avoyd all the firſt eight generall Councels. For wee
read they were ſummoned by Emperors, not by Popes. And the Pope of
Rome, like other Patriarcks received the Emperors Majeſties ſacred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
to come or ſend to Councels. If the Pope be negligent, or if hee
ſay nay the Emperour may by his own authority ſummon Councels by way
of command, to ſtay the wavering State of the Church. Hence we have one
concluſion, that in generall Councels and making Lawes, the Biſhop of Rome
hath no ſuch power as certain flatterers give him. Thus this learned Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
<hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> afterwards Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, is as point-blanck as he:
<note n="l" place="margin">De Concil. Baſil: lib. 1.</note> From theſe authorities (writes he) they thinke themſelves wonderfully
armed, who deny that Councels can be kept without the Popes conſent:
whoſe judgement if it ſhould ſtand, as they woul have it, would draw the
ruine of the Church with it. For what remedy ſhall there be if a criminous
Pope ſhould diſturbe the Church, if he ſhould deſtroy ſoules, if he ſhould
pervert the people with his ill example; if finally he ſhould teach things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to faith, and ſhould fill his ſubjects with haereticall Doctrines? Should
we ſuffer all things to go to ruine with him? But I, whiles I read over anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Hiſtories, while I conſider the Acts of the Apoſtles, do not verily finde
this cuſtome, that Popes onely ſhould call Councels. Neither afterwards, in
the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, and of other Emperors, when Councels
ſhould be called, there was no great account made of the Popes conſent:

Church ſaith directly, Although generall Councels ought not to be called or
kept without the Pope, nor any thing to be decreed and concluded in them
but by his authority, by the Eccleſiaſtical rule (made by Popes themſelves) yet
notwithſtanding in the French Church it hath been ever reſolved, that the
Pope is not thought to bee above a generall Councell, but is bound to
keep its Decrees, Statutes, &amp; Precepts, no leſſe than the people of the Church,
which is the Spouſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and which is eſpecially preſented
by the Councel.</q> Yea <hi>William Ranchin</hi> a famous French Lawyer, though a Papiſt,
in his Review of the Councell of Trent, <hi>l. 1. c. 8. l. 3. c.</hi> 1. to 14. and <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 1, 2,

the Popes minde, by the Emperor and Chriſtian Princes, whether hee

endeavour to entitle him to this prerogative royall of Chriſtian Princes, to
ſummon Synods and Councels, (contrary to the Reſolutions of theſe and
infinite other Popiſh Authors, and the practiſe of moſt popiſh Realmes)
yet none of them entitle any other Biſhops or Prelates to it but the Pope
alone, unleſſe it be by ſome ſpeciall derivation from the Pope as his Legate;
ſo that Biſhops cannot claime this power by any immediate inherent

power of calling Councels, Convocations, Synods, belongs not to Popes
or Prelates, but only to Chriſtian Emperors, Kings, Princes, and other chief
temporall Magiſtrates; which our late famous King <hi>James,</hi> (in the laſt place)
in his Letters Patents prefixed before the Canons and Eccleſiaſticall Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
made in Convocation <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. ratifies to the full; affirming,
that the Synod and Convocation at that time held, was, and ought to bee
ſummoned and called only by vertue of his royall Writ. The like is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by our preſent Soveraigne King <hi>Charles</hi> in his Declaration before the

                  <hi>Queen,</hi> having heard of the diverſity of opinions in maters of Religion
among ſundry of her loving Subjects, and being very deſirous to have the ſame
reduced to ſome godly and chriſtian concord, by the advice of the Lords and others
of the Privy Councell (as well for the ſatisfaction of perſons doubtfull, as alſo for
the knowledge of the very truth in certain matters of difference) commanded a
convenient choſen number of the beſt learned of either part, to conferre together
their opinions and reaſons concerning three particular points that ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to them, thereby to come to ſome good and charitable agreement, with all
convenient ſpeed. Hereupon, nine of the learnedſt Papiſts were choſen on the one
ſide, and nine of the ableſt Proteſtants on the other, to debate theſe three Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>preſcribed to them in writing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>It is againſt the word of God,</hi> and the cuſtome of the ancient Church,
to uſe a tongue unknown to the people, in common Prayer, and
the adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>2. Every Church hath authority to appoint, take away, and change
Ceremonies and Eccleſiaſticall Rites,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> ſo the ſame be to edification.</p>
               <p>3. It cannot be proved by the word of God, that there is in the Maſſe
offered up a ſacrifice propitiatory for the quick and the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It was further reſolved by the Queens Majeſty, that the conference on both
parties ſhould be in writing, for avoiding much altercation of words: that both
ſides ſhould declare their minds, opinions and reaſons in writing, and at the
ſame day deliver them mutually one to the other, to be conſidered, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
their anſwers thereto in writing by a certaine day. Immediately herupon,
divers Nobles and States of the Realme, underſtanding that ſuch a meeting
and conference ſhould be in certain matters, whereupon <hi>(In the Court of
Parliament</hi> conſequently following,) ſome <hi>Lawes might be grounded;</hi> they
made earneſt requeſt to her Majeſty, that the parties of this conference might
be ordered to put and read their Aſſertions in the Engliſh tongue, and that
in the preſence of them of the Nobility and of <hi>The Parliament Houſe,</hi> for
the better ſatisfaction and ordering of their owne judgements, to treat and
conclude of ſuch Lawes as might depend hereupon. This alſo being thought
very reaſonable, was ſignified to both parties, and ſo fully agreed upon; and
the day appointed for the firſt meeting to bee the Friday in the afternoone
(being the laſt of March) at Weſtminſter Church. At which day and place,
both for good order, and for honor of the Conference, <hi>By the Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties
Commandement,</hi> the Lords and others of the privie Councell were
preſent, and a great part of the Nobility alſo: The Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> and the reſt

our Iudgement in writing upon certain Propoſitians; We, as becometh us to
do herein, moſt gladly obey. <hi>The next is, their third obſervation from the law of</hi>
Juſtinian the Emperor, (commanding all Biſhops and Prieſts to celebrate the holy
oblation and prayers in Baptiſme with an audible voyce, &amp;c.) And let them know
this, that if they neglect any of theſe things, the dreadfull judgement of the great
God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſhall fall upon you, neither will wee when wee
know it, reſt, and leave it unrevenged, viz. That this Emperour being a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
did not only make Conſtitutions of Eccleſiaſticall matters; but alſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
revenge and ſharp puniſhment to the violaters of the ſame. <hi>Therefore they
held he had an obliging power over his Subjects, and a coerſiveauthority veſted
in him to enforce obedience to his Lawes: of which more hereafter.</hi>

Raigne to preſcribe to her Clergy in Convocation what they ſhould treat off,

Right reverend Fathers in God right trust and well-beloved: and
trusty and well-beloved, We great you well. Whereas We out of our meere grace and
favour, and for the good and peace of the Church, have granted to you our Arch-Biſhop
of Canterbury, free leave and licence under our great Seale of England, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
date the twelfth of this inſtant <hi>May,</hi> to propoſe, treat, and conclude upon all
ſuch neceſſary Articles and Canons, which you ſhall finde fit to be ordered for the
peace and government of this Church: Provided that you ſhall thereby have no
power to meddle with nor alter any thing ratified and confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And whereas we have further in that Licence which we have granted unto
you,<note place="margin">Note.</note> reſerved power to our ſelfe to command you to propoſe, treat, and determine of
any ſuch thing or things as we ſhall recommend unto you under our Signe Manuall
or Signet. Theſe are therefore to will and require you to propoſe, treat, and conclude
upon ſuch a Canon, as may ſecure us and all our loving ſubjects againſt all growth
and encreaſe of Popery in this our Kingdom; as alſo of any hereticall or ſchiſmaticall
opinions to the prejudice of the doctrine or diſcipline of this Church of <hi>England,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed
by Law: And that in this caſe you agree upon ſome Oath to be taken by your
ſelves, and all the Clergie reſpectively, and by all which ſhall hereafter take upon
them holy Orders, that they ſhall adhere conſtantly to the doctrine and diſcipline
here eſtabliſhed, and never give way (for ſo much as can any way concerne them) to
any innovation or alteration thereof. And when you have made this Canon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
this Oath, we require you to preſent it to us, that we may adviſe upon it; and
if upon mature conſultation we approve it, we ſhall confirme it, and then give you
power under our great Seale both to take the ſaid Oath your ſelves, and to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
it to all ſuch as the Canon appoints. Given under our Signet at our Court
at <hi>White-hall</hi> the ſeventeenth day of <hi>May</hi> in the ſixteenth yeere of our Reigne.</p>
                           <p>To the moſt Reverend Father in God, our right truſty and

of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitane of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
To the right Reverend Fathers in God, our right
truſty and well-beloved the Lords Biſhops; and to our truſty

                  <q>3 ly. by the Kings letters Patents for Confirmation of thoſe Canons after they
were made &amp; preſented to be confirmed by him: In the firſt canon whereof they
thus truly reſolve. That a ſupream Power is given to this moſt excellent Order
(of Kings) by God himſelf in the Scriptures, which is That Kings ſhould rule and
command in their ſeverall dominions all perſons of what rank or eſtate ſoever,
whether Eccleſiaſticall or Civill and that they ſhould reſtrain and puniſh with
the temporall ſword all ſtubborn and wicked doers.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:159261:21"/>
The care of Gods Church is ſo committed to Kings in the Scripture, that they
<q>are commended when the Church keeps the right way, and taxed when it runs
amiſſe, and therefore her government<note n="*" place="margin">NOTE.</note> belongs in chief unto Kings: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
one man would be commended for anothers care, and taxed but for anothers
negligence, which is not Gods way.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The power to call and diſſolve Councels both nationall and provincial is the
true right of all Chriſtian Kings within their own Realms or Territories: <q>And
when in the firſt times of Chriſts Church, Prelates uſed this power, 'twas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
onely becauſe in thoſe dayes they had no Chriſtian Kings: And it was then
ſo onely uſed as in times of perſecution, that is, with ſuppoſition (is caſe it were
required) of ſubmitting their very lives unto the very laws and commands even
of thoſe pagan Princes, that they might not ſo muchas ſeem, to diſturb their civil
Government, which Chriſt came to confirm, but by no meanes to undermine.</q>

<hi>The reſolution therefore of this generall Synod was, That they could make no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

the Lawes hee delivered them in Writing, (many of which are meerly of
State affaires, and temporall matters, concerning the Kings title to the Crowne,

members and Judges; and that all our Eccleſiaſticall Laws, Canons and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions

                  <hi>Gulielmus
Nubrigenſis</hi> relates the ſtory in theſe words, <q>When the Cardinall aſſiſted by
the Kings favour had called together the Eccleſiaſticall perſons of both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to celebrate a Councell of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
there; on the day appointed for the beginning of his Councell, when all
having taken their Robes and enſignes, were about to go in Proceſſion to it,
there fell out a vehement contention between the Archbiſhops themſelves
about the priority of place in the Councell: For that rule of the Apoſtle <hi>(in
honour preferring one another)</hi> was ſo abrogated by the Biſhops of our time,
that neglecting their Paſtorall diligence and care, Biſhops, by how much the
more ſtubbornly, by ſo much alſo the more vainly contend about Praeceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and almoſt all Epiſcopall Controverſie is wholy converſant about the
praerogative of their honours. In concluſion, <hi>Yorke</hi> comming ſooneſt, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied
the firſt ſeate; alleadging, that the ſame belonged to him by the
ancient decree of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> by which it is known to bee enacted,
<hi>that of the Metropolitans of England, he ſhould be accounted the chiefe, who was
firſt ordained.</hi>
                  </q> But <hi>Canterbury</hi> having made a ſolemne complaint of the preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupying
of his place, as if he ſuffered prejudice, refuſed the ſecond ſeate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his ſubjects (or Clerkes of his Province) contending more fiercely for
him, preſently the ſimple contention of words, grew into a brauling. <hi>Yorke</hi>
(the adverſe party being ſtronger) was thruſt with ignominy from the place he
had ſo early taken, who exhibited his torne Myter to the Legate, as a ſigne of
the injury offered to him, and cited <hi>Canterbury</hi> to the Apoſtolicall See. The
Metropolitans therefore thus contending, and things thus diſturbed, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
was not celebrated, but diſſipated, and they who had aſſembled as called
forth to a Councell, returned to their own homes.<note n="q" place="margin">In vita Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardi. p, 125, 126</note>

relates the ſtory in theſe words: <q>A Legate called <hi>Flugonius</hi> came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from the Pope, at King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeconds requeſt, that hee might
both ſeparate Queene <hi>Eleaner</hi> from him by a Divorce, and comprimiſe the
Controverſie between the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> touching
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:159261:44"/>
the precedency which had continued for many ſucceſſions of Biſhops,
and been oft times determined, but never finally ended till the Statute of 31
<hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 10. ſuch was the pride and ambition of theſe Arch-Prelates, whoſe
more than civill contentions, for ſuperiority our Hiſtorians have at large
recorded to their infamy.) This Legate aſſembled a Councell at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
in the Church of the infirme Monkes; whither the Clergie of both Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
plentifully aſſembled, and when the day of beginning the Councell was
come, the Legate ſitting on an high Throne, gave the right hand to the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But <hi>Yorke</hi> hoping that the King would bee more
propitious to him than to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> refuſed the left hand, and ſtriving moſt
impudently with his breech, to ſit between the Legate and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> at laſt
ſate downe in the lap of his Primate. He had ſcarcee, touched <hi>Canterbury</hi> with
his breech with which he ſtrove to get the ſecond place but he was ſhamefully
reprehended both by many Biſhops, and alſo by many Clerkes and <hi>Laymen.</hi>
The Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> ſervants provoked with the indignity of this
wicked fact, and the vehemencie of the juſt reproofe, pulling <hi>York</hi> out of
their Lords boſome, and throwing him down on the ground, trampled him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their feet, and his Archiepiſcopall Robes being moſt ſhamefully pulled
off and torne, they buffeted him with their fiſts. But <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when
as he could not call away nor hold off his ſervants, enraged with ſo great anger,
departed out of the Councell, that at leaſt hee might draw them away with
him by his departure.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſervants following their Maſter left <hi>Yorke</hi> lying proſtrate on the
ground environed with his torne Garments, At laſt <hi>Yorke</hi> fetching many
deep and frequent ſighes ariſeth halfe dead, and goeth all bloody to the King,
who with his ſon was preſent in the Councell (the thing for which I principally
relate the ſtorie) and makes his complaint againſt Canterbury. The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received <hi>Yorks</hi> relation only, was at firſt in cenſed againſt <hi>Canterbury,</hi> but
afterwards, the truth of his owne raſhneſſe and impudency being manifeſted,
he diſmiſſed <hi>Yorke,</hi> who departed from the King with diſgrace, the moſt reviling
him with clamors; <hi>go go</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>thou betrayer of</hi> Saint Thomas; <hi>thy hands doe
yet ſtinke with blood. But he, poore wretch, did now welter in his owne, not</hi> Thomas
<hi>his blood. Hugocius</hi> among theſe tumults perplexed with feare, having pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a bleſſing, ſodainly diſſolved ſo unluckie a Councell, and appealled <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
to the Pope, as guilty of this battery: <hi>Yorke</hi> alſo did the like. At laſt <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
leaſt he ſhould be overwhelmed with appeales on both ſides, ſubmitted
himſelfe and his ſervants to the Popes protection, by appealing both the <hi>Legate</hi>
and <hi>Yorke</hi> to <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo all equally appealed. But the next day <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who
knew the manner of the <hi>Pontificians)</hi> pacified the Legate with gifts, and they
thus reconciled, remitted their Appeales on both ſides. Afterwards the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Cant.</hi> and <hi>Geoffry</hi> of Ely; were againe accuſed by the Biſhop of <hi>York</hi>
before the King, that in the Councell of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> they had laid violent hands
on him; which when they had denyed and purged themſelves upon Oath, they
were reconciled by the Kings command; and by him a truce for five yeares was
made between <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Yorke,</hi> who promiſed betweene themſelves upon

the want of their Mother; for unleſſe we ſhould receive gifts from you, and other
good and honeſt men; we ſhould want neceſſaries to ſupply our lives, which

conſent, you may free your Mother from ſcandall, and obtaine Juſtice in the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> without giving any bribes. Now the forme provided is this;
Firſt of all, we deſire two Prebends to be given us by all Cathedrall Churches,
and out of Abbies, where the Monkes and Abbots have divers portions, of each
one Monkes intire allowance, one from the Covent, another from the Abbott:

King was then abſent by reaſon of his infirmitie, and ſome Archbiſhops, Biſhops

                     <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> p. 96. 97, 98, 99. See <hi>Eadmerus, Houeden, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſhed, Speed Daniel,</hi> in the life of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. and <hi>Antiqu. Eccleſiae Brit:</hi> and <hi>Godwin,</hi> in the life of <hi>Becket.</hi>
                  </note> Parliament held at <hi>Clarindon,</hi> by
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. his command, who was there preſent; where all the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
Biſhops, Abbotts, Priors, Earles, Barons, Nobles, and great men of
the Realm, made a Recognition or Recerd of part of the Cuſtomes and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Kings Anceſtors; to wit, of King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, and others, which
ought to be obſerved and kept by all men in the Realm, by reaſon of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention,
and diſcords frequently emerging betweene the Clergy, and the Kings
Iuſtices, and great men of the Realme: the ſubſtance whereof was conteined
in theſe 16. Chapters recorded by <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>1. That if any controverſie concerning the advowſon and preſentation of
Churches ſhould ariſe betweene Laymen, or betweene Laymen and Clergie
men, it ſhould bee heard and determined in the Court of our Lord the
King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>2. That the Churches of the Fee of our Lord the King, could not bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in perpetuity (or appropiated) without his grant or conceſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. That Clergiemen accuſed of any thing, being ſummoned by the Kings
Iuſtice, ſhould come into the Kings Court to anſwer the ſame there; that ſo
the Kings Court might determine what was to bee anſwered there and what
fit to be anſwered in the Eccleſiaſticall Court; that ſo the Iuſtice might ſend
into the Court of holy Church, to ſee how the matter ſhall there be handled;
And if the Clarke ſhall be convict, or confeſſe the crime, that the Church from
thenceforth ought not to protect him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>4. That it ſhall not be lawfull to the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and perſons of
the Realme to goe out of the Realme, without the Licence of our Lord the
King; and if they ſhall goe thence, if it ſhall pleaſe the King, they ſhall give
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:159261:47"/>
him ſecurity, that neither in going nor in returning, nor in ſtaying, they
ſhall procure hurt or dammage to our Lord the King or the Realme.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>5. That excommunicate perſons ought not to give a pledge to remaine,
<hi>(vadium ad remanentiam)</hi> nor to take an Oath, but onely to give a ſurety or
pledge of ſtanding to the judgment of the Church, where they are abſolved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>6. That Laymen ought not to be accuſed, but by lawfull accuſers &amp; witneſſes,
in the preſence of the Biſhop, that the Arch-Deacon may not loſe his right,
nor any thing that he ought to have from thence. And if thoſe who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſhall be ſuch that no man will or dares to accuſe, the Sheriffe being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Biſhop, ſhall ſweare twelve lawfull men of the Vicenage or
Town, before the Biſhop, that they ſhall manifeſt the truth (concerning
ſuch) according to their Conſciences.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>7. No man who holds of the King in Capite, nor any of his Dominicall
Miniſters (or houſe-hold ſervants) ſhall be excommunicated, nor the Lands
of any one of them put under interdict, unleſſe our Lord the King (if he bee
within the Realme) be firſt acquainted therewith, or his Iuſtice, if he ſhall be
forth of the Realme: (the reaſon then rendred was, leſt the King ſhould at
unawares Kiſſe or admit to his Councell ſuch an excommunicate perſon reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to him,) that ſo he may doe right concerning him; and ſee that what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth
to the Kings Court, ſhall be there determined, and that what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the Eccleſiaſticall Court may bee ſent unto it, that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
deſcided.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>8. Concerning appeales, if they ſhall happen, they ought to proceed from
the Arch-Deacon to the Biſhop, from the Biſhop to the Archbiſhop; and if
the Archbiſhop ſhall faile in exhibiting Iuſtice, they may appeale to our Lord
the K. in the laſt place, and that by his precept the controverſie may be ended
in the Arch-Biſhops Court, ſo that there ought to bee no further proceeding
without the aſſent of our Lord the <hi>King.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>10. If any be cited by the Arch-Deacon or Biſhop for any offence, for which
he ought to anſwer to them, and will not appeare upon their citations, it ſhall
bee lawfull for them to put him under interdict, but they ought not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
him, till he be convented before the chiefe Officer of the <hi>King</hi> in
that pariſh, that he may admoniſh him to appeare to give ſatisfaction, <hi>And</hi>
if the Officer of the <hi>King</hi> ſhall faile therein he ſhall be in the <hi>Kings</hi> mercy, and
from thenceforth the Biſhop may with Eccleſiaſticall Iuſtice curbe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
accuſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>11. Archbiſhops, Biſhops and all perſons of the Realme, who hold of the
<hi>King</hi> in Capite, may haue their poſſeſſions of the King as a Barony, and ſhall
anſwer for them to the Juſtices and Miniſters of the King, and ſhall follow,
and doe all Royall Cuſtomes, and like other Barons, ought to bee preſent in
judgments of the Kings Court, with the Barrons, untill it proceed to diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Members, or unto death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>12. When an Archbiſhopricke, Biſhopricke, or Abbey, or Priory ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
voyde in the Kings Dominion, it ought to be in his hands, and he ſhall
receive all the rents and iſſues thereof as the Dominicall rents, And what
ſhall come to the Church is to bee diſpoſed of,</q> Our Lord the King ought to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:159261:47"/>
commend the beſt perſons to the Church, and the election ought to be made
in the Kings owne Chappel by aſſent of the King himſelf, and adviſe of ſuch
perſons of the Realme, which he ſhall call unto him to do theſe things; and
there the perſon elected ſhall do his homage and fealty to the King, as to his
Liege Lord, of life and members, and of terrene honour, ſaving his Order,
before he ſhall be Conſecrated.</p>
               <p>13. If any of the Nobles of the Realme ſhall deny to do Iuſtice to any
Archbiſhop, or Biſhop, or Archdeacon concerning him or his, our Lord the
King ought to do them Iuſtice. And if peradventure any ſhall deny to our
Lord the King his right; the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Archdeacons ought
to admoniſh him, that he may ſatisfie the King.</p>
               <p>14. The Church or Churchyard ought not to detain the Chattels of thoſe
who are in forfeiture of the King, againſt the Iuſtice of the King, becauſe
they are the Kings owne, whether they bee found within or without the
Church.</p>
               <p>15. Pleas of Debts which ſhalbe due either by interpoſition of an oath,
or without oath, are in the Iuſtice of the King (that is, triable in the Kings
temporall Courts.</p>
               <p>16. The Sonnes of Peaſants (or Villanies) ought not to bee ordained
(Prieſts) without aſſent of the Lord, in whoſe land they are knowne to
bee borne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Recognition or Record of the Cuſtoms and Liberties of the Realm,
the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, Clergy, with all the Earles, Barons,
and Nobles ſwore, and firmly promiſed</hi> viva voce, <hi>in the word of truth,
that they would keep and obſerve it to our Lord the King and to his Heirs,</hi> bona
fide <hi>and without</hi> male engin <hi>for ever.</hi> His itaque geſtis, poteſtas Laica in res &amp;
perſonas Eccleſiaſticas, omnia pro libitu, Eccleſiaſtico jure contempto, tacentibus
aut vix murmur antibus Epiſcopis, potius quam reſiſtentibus, uſurpabat; <hi>writes</hi>
Matthew Paris. <hi>Whereupon</hi> Thomas Becket <hi>then Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury,
<hi>repenting of his oath to obſerve them, humbled and afflicted himſelfe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
with faſting and corporall pennace, yea he ſuſpended himſelf from the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Altar, untill the Pope abſolved him from his pretended offence and
oath, which he readily obtained: After which</hi> Becket <hi>reſuſing to conforme
himſelfe to the King and theſe Lawes he had ſworne to, departs ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings licenſe into</hi> Flanders, <hi>and from thence repaired to Pope</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
<hi>at</hi> Sennes, <hi>who curteouſly entertained him; and refuſed the demands
of the Kings Embaſſadours, to do him juſtice againſt</hi> Becket, <hi>or to confirme
theſe Lawes and ancient Cuſtoms of the Realm. Whereupon the King ſent this
enſuing Writ to every Sheriffe of</hi> England,<note n="*" place="margin">Matthew Paris ibid.</note> Praecipio tibi, quod ſi aliquis

Books to one wherof he prefixed his name, in high affront of that Committee
which ſuſpended him and contempt of the Parliaments Authority not to be

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:159261:61"/>
his, who pretended ſo much reſpect and honour to the Parliament heretofore,
engaged me (according to my <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Proteſtation,)</hi> to give a publicke

indubitable Right and Priviledge, to intermeddle in and make Lawes for all
Church matters (as I have manifeſted by a cloud of witneſſes in all ages in the

they ſequeſtred him from his living in <hi>Colemanſtreet,</hi> for the very things I

INNOCENCIES TRIVMPH, (an unfitting Title for a <hi>ſequestred No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent)</hi>
to deny thoſe very matters of fact, which he voluntarily confeſſed in my

a loving,<note place="margin">Page 4, 5.</note> &amp; tender affectionate jealouſie over the Parliament, leſt poſſibly they might
daſh their foot against that ſtone, by which all Rule, all Authority and power will
one day be broken in pieces. So that if his tongue or pen, have in the least miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in this point, it was Error Amoris, not Amor erroris: he being extreamly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
over the Parliament, leſt they ſhould touch with any Title or claime the moſt

               <p>But good Sir, firſt, can any rationall man thinke (though you ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

as you have apparently done.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If this proceeded from ſuch affectionate jealouſie over the

your Independent way (for there can be no other reall end of theſe your Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamentary

                  <hi>Scripture phraſe,</hi> as well as in common parlance. To apply this to your crime.
Firſt, you preached and printed theſe paſſages, of purpoſe to <hi>foreſtall</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Aſſemblies pious reſolutions, to ſettle one uniforme Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and ſuppreſſe all private Coventicles of Sectaries or Anabaptiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it. 2.<note place="margin">Pſal 19. 13. 2 Pet. 2. 10.</note> To eſtabliſh ſupport that Independent way, which you had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand without any lawful warrant, conceived, ere the Parliament had made
choyce of, or ſetled any Church-Government for you; as the whole Tenor of
your Bookes and Sermons evidence. Thirdly, It was no leſſe then high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
in you, being a meere Divine, and a man altogether ignorant of, or
unskilfull in the ancient Rights and Priviledges of our Parliament (as your
writings demonſtrate, and your ſelfe intimate, <hi>p. 5.)</hi> to undertake to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and judge of them ſo peremptorily, and in ſuch manner as you have
done: When as if you had known any thing concerning the Rights of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
you might have learned this among other things; That Divines are no
competent Iudges of Parliaments Priviledges: That the Priviledges, Rights,
and cuſtomes of our Parliaments, are only to be judged and determined by the
Parliament it ſelfe, not in or by any other inferior Court, much leſſe in a Pulpit
That the power and juriſdiction of the Parliament for making of Lawes,
is ſo tranſcendent and abſolute, as it cannot bee confined to cauſes or perſons
within any bounds; and that the ſtate and defence of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
is the very firſt matter and care of the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> as all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Preſidents manifeſt, and Sir<note n="*" place="margin">In his 4. <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> c. 1. Of the High-Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and <hi>Camden, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſhed, Vowell</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</note> 
                  <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> with others might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
you. And for a man to undertake to judge of that which is above his
power; is expreſly defined to bee preſumption, by <hi>Richardus de Media villa
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:159261:63"/>
in 3. Sententiar: Diſtinct,</hi> 26. and other Schoolemen on that place; and by
<hi>Summa Angelica, Tit. Praeſumptus.</hi> Fourthly, You had no lawfull calling nor
warrant from Gods Word, or our Lawes to handle the Iuriſdictions and rights
of Parliament in your pulpit, nor yet to diſpute them in your writings in ſuch a
daring manner by way of oppoſition, or to encourage people to diſobedience to
its Eccleſiaſticall Lawes and deſcitions: Therefore in this you were preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
by the Scriptures owne definition, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10. Fourthly, after you were
queſtioned before a Committee of Parliament for theſe very paſſages in your
firſt Sermon, as exceeding ſcandalous &amp; Derogatory to the Members and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament, yet you in a daring manner, whiles you were under
examination, audaciouſly preached over the ſame againe in ſubſtance in your
Pulpit on a ſolemne Faſt day, and publiſhed them with additions in no leſſe
then two printed Bookes: Yea ſince your very cenſure by the Committee
for them, you have in a higher ſtraine then ever, gone on to juſtifie them in
print once more, in your <hi>Innocencies Triumph;</hi> (like an incorrigible delinquent)
wherein you ſlander the <hi>Parliament</hi> more then before, and ſhew your ſelfe a
man<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 10 12. 1 Tim. 3. 2, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>diſpiſing Government</hi> (at leaſt any Church-Government, the Parliament
ſhall eſtabliſh not ſuitable to your fancy) <hi>ſelfe-willed, and even ſpeaking evill of
Dignities</hi> in your forementioned clauſes &amp; others: Therefore in this regard you
are ſuperlatively <hi>preſumptuous,</hi> by St. <hi>Peters</hi> reſolution: Yea moſt men, whoſe
ungrounded zeale to your new way hath not eaten out his braines, and reaſon
too, muſt readily acknowledge it, notwithſtanding your <hi>two reaſons</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
To wit, Firſt, <hi>your former uninterrupted zeale to this Parliament and its
cauſe:</hi> (you meane perchance before you were an Independent, and ſince,
whiles you thought it would embrace your new way) which doth but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
your ſubſequent oppoſition in preſſe and Pulpit, againſt its undoubted ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.
Secondly, <hi>The grounds and reaſons you have given of your opinion;</hi>
(which I ſhall examine in due place) as if men might not do preſumptuouſly
againſt the lawfull power of Parliaments and civill Magiſtrates, as you have
plentifully done, even with ſome colour of reaſon, as well as <hi>inſanire cum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione:</hi>
which is all I ſhall anſwer to your reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Hee writes, Let Maſter</hi> Prynne, Or any other evict mee, of any
wilfull or unwilfull violation of the priviledges of Parliament (and I ſhall bee as
willing as willingneſſe it ſelfe can make me to further ſuch a conviction) and no man
ſhall be more ready then I to crave their pardon,<note place="margin">Page 5.</note> or undergoe their Juſtice; nay, I
ſhall repent my ſelfe and abhor my errour in duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>Certainely this your promiſed late Repentance (which is yet contingent,
and improbable, after ſo many publike offronts and oppoſitions againſt the
power and proceedings of Parliament) will bee a very poore recompence and
ſatisfaction for all your former miſdemeanors and ſcandalls to the Parliament;
yet late repentance being better then none at all; I ſhall now challenge you
to make good this your promiſe, ſince your owne Conſcience and judgment
cannot but informe you, I have written enough in the former Sections to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
and convince you and all the world beſides, that you have not only viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but denyed, oppugned thoſe priviledges of Parliament in Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:159261:63"/>
affaires, which our owne Parliaments in all ages, and Parliamentary Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
in all other Kingdomes have unqueſtionably exerciſed, enjoyed without any
ſuch publique oppoſition as you have made againſt them. And if you now make
not good your promiſe, few or none will ever credit you hereafter.</p>
               <p>5ly. For the Authors you cite to juſtifie yourſelfe; they are miſerably wreſted
and miſtaken for the moſt part. The firſt you quote is Maſter <hi>Edwards:</hi> who
maintaines point blancke againſt you throughout his Treatiſe, <hi>a</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Page 156. to 183. 237. 237. 238. 280. to 307.</note> 
                  <hi>Legiſlative
and coerceive power in Parliaments and civil Majestrates, even in Church-affaires
and matters of Religion, in the</hi> very pages you quote, and elſe where There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you palpably abuſe the Author and Reader in quoting him to the contrary,
who is ſo point-blancke againſt you.</p>
               <p>For the paſſage you quote out of his Page, 256. <hi>The Parliament interpoſeth no
Authority to determine what government ſhall be:</hi> whence you inferre <hi>(p. 7.)
Therefore his opinion appeares to be, either that the Parliament hath No autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>or at leaſt intends not to make uſe of it, in determining a government.</hi>
                  </hi> It was
written only with reference to that preſent time, the Parliament having at that
time when he writ (during the Aſſemblies debate and conſultation) <hi>interpoſed
no Authority to determine what government ſhall be:</hi> yet before that it had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the old prelaticall Lordly government to be aboliſhed, and called an
Aſſembly to adviſe with about a New. But to inferre from thence as you doe:
Therefore his opinion is, <hi>either that the Parliament hath no Authority, or at leaſt
intends not to make uſe of it in determining a Government,</hi> Is an inference quite
contrary to the next enſuing words, and pages; to the whole ſcope of the Authors
Booke;<note n="*" place="margin">See his Title Page 15. 15</note>

                  <hi>For the Paſſages he aleageth out of the Divines of</hi> Scotland, That the Prince

Legiſlative Power in matters eccleſiaſticall in a conſtitute Church.
That the ordinary power of the King is not to make Eccleſiaſticall Lawes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer,<note place="margin">ANSWER.</note> 1. That their only meaning (if I miſtake not) in theſe paſſages is, that
the Prince or chiefe civill Majeſtrate of HIMSELFE, without a Parliament, or
without the aſſiſtance and conſent of his Nobles, Commons, Clergy, cannot
legally make any eccleſiaſticall Lawes to obliege his people: upon which reaſon
our Brethren of <hi>Scotl.</hi> rejected the late<note n="*" place="margin">See the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Scotiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners againſt <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</hi>

                  <hi>New ſervice booke and Canons,</hi> and our
ſelves the late Canons &amp; &amp;c Oath (which <hi>Canterbury</hi> wold have obtruded on us)
becauſe they were made and preſcribed only by the Kings Authority and the
Prelates or Convocations, not the Parliaments; upon which very reaſon the
Parliaments of both Kingdomes have reſpectively adjudged both one and other
illegall. But that the King, or ſupreame temporall Majeſtrates aſſiſted by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Orthdox Divines, may not make binding eccleſiaſticall Lawes; or
that their or our Parliaments have not a reall Legiſlative power in any matters
eccleſiaſtike (the only point controverſed) is directly contrary both to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Doctrine and Practiſe of our Brethren and their Church uſed ever
ſince the Reformation, &amp; to the proceedings of their laſt Parliaments and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Aſſemblies as I have<note n="*" place="margin">Page 102, 103. 104.</note> formerly manifeſted. You may therefore bluſh, at
this your perverting of their meaning as if they held, that the Parliaments, of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
or <hi>Scotland</hi> had no power to make Eccleſiaſticall Lawes for Religion or
Church gouernment; when as their Bookes, Actions, addreſſes to our preſent
Parliament, their preſence, aſſiſtance in our Aſſembly, proclaimes the
contrary: And the very publique Confeſſion of faith profeſſed and ſubſcribed in
their Church <hi>Anno 1560 Chap.</hi> 14 (ſince confirmed by ſeverall Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament)
doth the like. But admit all thoſe Authors really (as not one of them is
in verity) oppoſite to the Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction, and Legiſlative power of
Parliaments, yet the unanimous practiſe and reſolution of all Chriſtian
Realmes, Synods Parliaments, in all ages, contrary to their private novell opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is ſufficient infinitly to overbalance them in the Judgements of all prudent
men. And thus much for Mr. <hi>Goodwins Innocencies tryumph, as to the preſent point.</hi>

Chriſt is our only King, Head, Lord. Therefore we muſt not be ſubject to any

Wives, Children ſervants will reaſon thus; Chriſt is our onely Head, Husband,
King, Lord, Father, Maſter. Therefore we will not, we ought not to be ſubject

only to the immediate Rules, Laws, edicts of Chriſt himſelfe. Mutinous or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
Souldiers will thus argue with their Generalls and Commanders.
Chriſt is our only Captaine, Generall and our Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Ergo</hi> we will be

people diligently to repaire to all the Ordinances of God, to ſanctifie the

of Miniſters of all neceſſary Church Officers, and for prayer, preaching reading

I preſume all will grant and my <hi>Brother</hi> will not deny: which is all I contend

               <p>Thoſe Lawes and <hi>Ordinances</hi> which God Himſelfe enjoynes us to obey

<hi>If ſervants in obeying their Maſters, Children</hi> their Parents, Wives their

Towards men who ſpeake evill of us:</hi> Whence thus I argue. If a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
muſt bee carefully exerciſed and kept as well toward the lawfull precepts
and lawes of Man as of God, then certainly they binde the Conſcience as well
as the Law of God: elſe what had conſcience to do with them? But the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is moſt evident by the former texts; Therefore the deduction thence.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If ſuch Lawes ſhould not bind the conſcience and inward man to
the cheerfull practicall obedience of them; but only the purſe and outward
man, the obedience to them would bee lame or ſlaviſh; the Lawes Nugatory,
and contemptible, the end of the Laws (which is cheerefull obedence to them

               <p>I ſhall now propound and anſwer the principall contrary Objections,
which are theſe.</p>
               <p>1. It is, contrary to Chriſtian liberty, and a plaine tyranny, that humane Lawes
ſhould obliege the Conſcience, Christ having freed us from all humane Ceremonies
Lawes, obligations; and the Scripture enjoyning us,<note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 5. 1. c. 1 10. Col. 2. 16. to 22.</note> to ſtand faſt in the
liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free,<note n="p" place="margin">

yoake of Bondage: Not to be the ſervants of men: Not to be ſubject to Ordinances,
as touch not, taſt not, handle not (which all are to periſh with the uſing) after the
commandements and Doctrines of men: If therefore humane Lawes ſhould binde
the Conſcience, Chriſtian liberty would be deſtroyed, and tyranny over conſciences
introduced.</p>
               <p>1. Anſwer;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> 1. That it is no wayes repugnant to, but very conſiſtent with

not repugnant to Gods Law: Neither do the objected ſcriptures extend
to ſuch Lawes or Edicts at theſe.</p>

to change the meere indifferency of it, into a thing ſimply good or evil:

did give this charge to Moſes: <hi>See that thou doe all things according to

when the Temple was built, God was ſo exact in this, that he would not leave it to
<hi>David</hi> himſelfe, <hi>though both a King and a Prophet, and a man after Gods

My <hi>Brothers</hi> firſt Argument from the premiſes, if turned into a logicall
forme, is this.</p>
               <p>God in the Old Teſtament ſhewed and preſcribed to <hi>Moſes in the Mount,</hi>
an exact patterne of the Tabernacle and its implements, from which hee
muſt not vary in one Pin, or Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> He hath preſcribed an exact uniforme, univerſall modell of Church-Government,
and Diſcipline under the Goſpell for all Churches, Nations,
Ages whatſoever, from which they muſt not vary in the leaſt Pin, or
Title.</p>
               <p>What an Independent argument this is, will appeare; Firſt by conſidering,
that the Tabernacle (as all well know) was no part of the Congregation or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Church of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> (made up onely of Circumciſed perſons, of
which our preſent controverſie, concerning Church-Government is meant,)
but only the place wherein the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> met to Worſhip God during their Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
in the Wilderneſſe, which Tabernacle ceaſed when the Temple was
built, and the <hi>Arke</hi> placed therein, it being in truth nought elſe, but a materiall
moveable Temple, anſwerable to our Churches, Chappells, and places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
meeting for Gods Worſhip now, but only in its moveableneſſe: The like
may be ſaid of <hi>Salomons</hi> materiall Temple: what Argument can then be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thence to prove ſuch an exact forme of Church Government ſetled under

he was to make and ſee all things made according to this patterne without

<hi>Ergo,</hi> the framing, ſetling of Church-government &amp; Diſcipline under the

                  <hi>Brother,</hi> If you grant all theſe foure Arguments abſurd, falſe, or incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,

to conſider, on what falſe ſandy ground and abſurd Inconſequencies
your Independent Churches are built.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I pray inform me, <hi>Brother,</hi> if you are able: If there be ſuch an exact
apparent unalterable forme of Church-government preſcribed under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,

whereas you averre, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David</hi> might not in the building of
<hi>the Tabernacle and Temple VARY IN ONE PIN OR TITLE,</hi> in
your Text: I ſhall thence retort the Argument here upon you thus.</p>
               <p>The forme of the Government of the Church under the Goſpell, is not ſo
fully or particularly held forth, in direct termes in the New Teſtament, as the
patterne of the Tabernacle and Temple was in the Old: Neither is there any
ſuch precept in the New, not to vary in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaſt Title from any frame or pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of Church-government therein preſcribed, as therewas for not varying
from their patternes in the Old.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is no ſuch exact punctuall forme of Church-Government
therein inſtituted or preſcribed, as is pretended.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Admit the Argument true; yet then the great queſtion remaines
unreſolved, Whether your Independent forme onely, bee this patterne in the
Mount preſcribed in the New Teſtament? This I am certaine neither the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of the Tabernacle, Altar, Temple, nor <hi>Ezechiels</hi> meaſuring of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
will ever be able to evidence, neither by way of argument, nor illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And therefore you may doe well to inſiſt no more upon them, unleſſe
you will make the world ſwallow downe this Independent Logick &amp; Divinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> had a patterne of the Tabernacle ſhewed to him in the Mount
and David the patterne of the Temple ſhewed him by the Spirit, both

and by him delivered in writing, to his Son King <hi>Solomon,</hi> (the ſupream tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

Therefore if any good concluſion can bee deduced hence, it will be this; That
under the Goſpel the ordering, ſettling of the Government; Diſcipline and
Miniſters of the Church, belongs to the ſupreame temporall Magiſtrate, as it
did under the Law, not to the Prieſts, or every particular Independent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation

to whom they <hi>Wrote</hi> for reſolution <hi>v.</hi> 1. To this the Apoſtle gives a final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciton
in the negative, ſhewing ſundry reaſons for it, v. 10. to 16. &amp; then v. 17.
he concludes, <hi>As the Lord hath called every one ſo let him walke, AND SO OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAINI
IN AL CHVRCHES.</hi> Now what, <hi>Brother,</hi> is this private caſe of
conſcience to one ſet forme of Church Diſciplin or Government? doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſay; that this he ordained to be the very ſame in all Churches? no verily,
there is no ſuch mention or intention, in the Text: or Chapter ſo that the true
deduction from hence will be but this abſurd <hi>Nonſequitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle by the determination of Gods ſpirit <hi>ordained in every
Church,</hi> that Beleeving <hi>Wives or Husbands, ſhould not forſake their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
Conſorts if they deſired to cohabit with them: Ergo</hi> he ordained one
and the ſelfe-ſame unalterable ſet forme of Church-government and
Diſcipline in all Churches whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Your 2d. text, makes cleane againſt you: For firſt, the Apoſtle 1. Cor. 16. 1.
2. doth not ſay, that he gave order for a <hi>collection in all Churches alike:</hi> but only
in <hi>the Churches of Galatia:</hi> and there were many Churches elſe beſides them;
Therefore this extends only to particular Churches, not to all. And ſo no proofe
of any one univerſall Government of Diſcipline preſcribed alike to all Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It was an order only upon a particular emergent tranſient occaſion, which
might ſeldome or never happen againe, to wit, The<note n="o" place="margin">Acts 11. 28. 29. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>preſent neceſſity of the
Saints at Ieruſalem, in reſpect of a dearth and famine there.</hi> To argue therefore
an univerſall ſtanding Church-government and Diſcipline from a particular
tranſient occaſion, not permanent and laſting but contingent and temporany,
for this particular time and occaſion only, is very incongruous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle here preſcribed no publique duty relating to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government,
or Diſcipline, nor yet to be performed in the open Congregation
(for then there might have beene ſome vigor in the Text) but but only a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
preparatory benevolence to be weekly laide apart in private according to
Gods bleſſing on every mans eſtates, as is cleane by the words <hi>Vpon the firſt day of

there may be no collections when I come:</hi> Therefore this Action hath no relation

Church. Fourthly, This collection and the maner of it, for <hi>every man to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide

                  </gap> demand of my Brother, 1. Whether this text did ſimply bind
all the Corinthians to a weekely preparatory contribution towards the poore
Brethrens neceſſities that were in Jeruſalem, ſo as they might not deny or
vary from it? it being rather a bare adviſe then a peremptory precept &amp; a meere
voluntary charitable action, as is cleare by comparing it with Act. 13, 28. 29. 30.
Rom. 15. 25. 26. 2 Cor. 8. &amp; 9. 1. to 15. eſpecially v. 7. <hi>Every man according as he
hath purpoſed in his heart ſo let him give, not grudgingly as of neceſſity: for God loveth
a cheareful giver.</hi> 2. Whether they were neceſſarily tied to make privat contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
only on the firſt day of the week &amp; no other? or had they not a liberty not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
this order to do it on any other week day, as wel as on the firſt?
or every day, or every fortnight or 10. dayes, if they pleaſed, as their particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
and conditions adminiſtred abillity or opportunity for ſuch a charitable
worke? 3ly. Whether this preſcript forme of collection (admitting it obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
during this occaſion) did bind any Church but this of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and thoſe of
<hi>Galatia</hi> only? or whether it obliged all other Churches then, or ſimply binds all
Churches now to this forme of preparatory or privat contributions, or not?
If you ſay, no, then you yeeld the cauſe: ſince this preſident binds no Churches
now to any punctuall, imitation. Therefore it is no proofe at all for any one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
univerſall unvariable forme of Church-government and diſcipline in all
ages preſcribed by Scripture: If you ſay, yea, then all Chriſtians, Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the world (&amp; your Independent to) offend againſt this the Apoſtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
inſtitution in not retaining this form of privat collections, by ſegregating
ſomething for the uſe of the poore Sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts on every Lords day, or weekly, &amp;
in ſuffering publique gatherings for the poore in Churches on Lecture dayes,
or week-day faſts, whereas theſe were no ſuch collections, but only laying ſom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
up in private, by way of preparatory Charity againſt the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
who would then receive every mans particular Charity by itſelfe, and
not trouble them with any publike collections. In one word: No Churches, nor
Independent Congregations hold themſelves ſtrictly obliged to this forme
of collection, (which was not publique but private, every man by himſelfe)
but all hould they may with ſafe conſcience vary from it. Therefore (if this
collection be a part of Church-government or Diſcipline under the Goſpell
as you make it) this Government, Diſciplin is both mutable and arbitrable in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:159261:76"/>
this particular; and ſo by conſequence in others to, as occaſions and conditions
of the Church do vary.</p>
               <p>Your third Text of <hi>Acts 14. 23. When they had ordained them Elders in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Church:</hi> proves nothing for what you alledge it. For firſt, it extends not
to all Churches then planted in the World, but onely to <hi>every Church</hi> in <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,
Lyſtra, Iconium, Antioch,</hi> to which <hi>every Church</hi> relates, as is cleare by
comparing it with the three preceding and following verſes; whence the
Argument from this Text can be but this: The Apoſtles, ordained <hi>Elders in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church at Derbe, Lyſtra, Iconium, and Antioch</hi> (and ſo in every City in <hi>Creete
Tit. 1. 5.) Ergo</hi> in all Churches throughout the world. Which is no infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
inference. They might do it in all or moſt Cities where the Congregations
were great, yet not in Villages or leſſer places, where the number of Beleevers
was but ſmall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This proues there were Elders ordained by the Apoſtles in many,
if not moſt Churches: But yet it concludes not infallibly, that there muſt of
neceſſity bee Elders ordained by thoſe who are no Apoſtles in all Churches.
There were ſuch Elders then, <hi>Ergo</hi> there muſt of neceſſity be ſuch now in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church, unleſſe there be a direct precept enjoyning them for perpetuity, is
no infallible Argument.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Admit it generall and binding unto all; yet this proves onely
that there ought by Apoſtolicall preſident and inſtitution to be Elders (not one
but more) in all Churches: what then becomes of ſome of your Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Churches which have none (as Maſter <hi>Simſons</hi> had none in <hi>Holland)</hi> and
as no new Independent Churches in or about London had, when they were
firſt gathered. Theſe certainly were no true Churches of Chriſt by this rule,
becauſe they wanted Elders.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This <hi>Text</hi> ſpeakes onely in the generall, that <hi>they ordained El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in every Church,</hi> But what ſort of Elders they were, Ruling, or Preaching
Elders onely, or ſuch who did both Rule and Preach: or in what manner they
were ordained, whether by lifting up of hands onely to chuſe them, and no more;
or by laying hands upon them, or by the Apoſtles owne impoſition of hands on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as Apoſtles, or joyning with others as ordinary Miniſters, or in any other form,
is not expreſſed; So that this Text onely informes us, that there were Elders or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
in every Church; but determines nothing of their office, or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or form they were ordained: Therefore it concludes nothing for any exact com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
unalterable, univerſall forme of Church-government in all particulars, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to all Churches; ordaining of Elders, being onely one part of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
not the whol; &amp; no part of Diſcipline &amp; that left very indefinitely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the manner and forme, which the Scripture hath not by any direct precept
or preſident reduced to an unalterable certainty, but rather left Arbitrary and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
as will appeare by comparing <hi>Num. 8. 10. Acts 1 23. 24. 25. 26. c. 6. 5. 6. c. 14.
23. 1 Cor. 4. 14. c. 5. 17. 22. 2 Tim. 1. 6. 1 Tim. 4. 14. Tit.</hi> 1. 5. It being a great
Controverſie at this day: whether impoſition of hands be now ſimply neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
in the ordination of Presbyters, Deacons, or Lay-Elders? or whether it be
but an arbitrary ceremony which may be omitted without prejudice, if there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:159261:77"/>
be cauſe? whether it belonged to the Apoſtles onely as Apoſtles, or as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
whether it be appropriated to Preaching Elders onely, as ſuch? or to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Elders as well as they, or to the<note n="[†]" place="margin">See Numb. 8. 80.</note> whol Church or Congregation, and ſuch
as they ſhall appoint? Or to Arch-biſhops, and Biſhops only as ſuch? as many held
of late, though now that queſtion is out of date. So as neither of theſe Texts in
ſeverall, nor any, nor all three of them conjoyned, prove any ſuch concluſion,
or univerſall ſet forme of Church-government and Diſcipline, for all Churches,
as is pretended.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, It is a principle of the Law of Nature, and common Reaſon,
which all Republikes, Churches, Societies of men in every age till this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
have admitted, that the Lawes, Ordinances, Decrees, of the greateſt
Civill or Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, where the whole Realme, Republike,
Church, or Nation, are perſonally, or repreſentatively preſent by their deputies
or Proxies, obliege all inferiour Corporations, Societies, Churches, Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
Perſons, within their ſeverall Iuriſdictions, to ſubmiſſion and reall
obedience, eſpecially when juſt and agreeable to Gods Word, or at leaſt to
paſſive (whiles in force) where unjuſt or contrary to the Word. Hence the
publike Laws Ordinances Edicts, of Parliaments and general Aſſemblies of the
Eſtates, have in all Kingdomes, Ages, without the leaſt diſpute, oblieged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
all Corporations. Societies, Perſons, within their ſeverall juriſdictions,
becauſe they are the Repreſentative Body and ſupreame power of thoſe
Realms, where all are virtually preſent and conſenting, when all, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor

Creeds, Canons, Decrees, of <hi>Oeumenicall, Nationall, or Provinciall
Councels,</hi> ratified by Emperors, Kings, and Parliaments, obligatory in point
of juriſdiction to all Churches, perſons within their juriſdictions. And in truth,
the chiefe end, uſe of Parliaments, Councels, Synods<note n="m" place="margin">See here Sect. 1. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>(approved by God,</hi>

               <p>Sixthly. It cannot be gainſayd; but every man and woman in the world,
conſidered meerly as ſuch, or as ſingle perſons ſtript of all their naturall, civill,
or Eccleſiaſticall relations, are of equall Authority, and have no juriſdiction,
power, or ſuperiority at all one over another, no more than fellow ſervants,
fellow Citizens, or neighbors out of office have over one another: yet look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſelfe-ſame perſons as they ſtand cloathed with their ſeverall Relations,

which they may obey or reject at pleaſure; but of Iuriſdiction and Authority;
ſo farre as to be enforced to obedience, and juſtly puniſhed for diſobedience

The ſame rule and reaſon holds as firmely in all Eccleſiaſticall Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Take ſeverall private Chriſtians as Chriſtians, or ſeverall Pariſhes or
Congregations, as they are ſuch; and it is certain one of them hath no Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
nor power at all over another in any Eccleſiaſticall matters, either to
preſcribe Lawes to, or inflict cenſures upon one another; but only a power to
exhort, admoniſh, reprove, adviſe, or aſſiſt one another in a brotherly way. But
yet looke upon the ſelfe-ſame particular perſons, Churches, as Members of a
Parochiall or Nationall Church, and then in this Relation they are and
ought to be ſubject to the juſt rules, precepts, Canons, Orders of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,

power over every particular Church within their limits as for any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Congregation, to claim or exeriſe a juriſdiction in point of direction or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
over any or every particular member of it. Our Independents no
doubt will grant, that if two or three ſeverall Congregations unite themſelves
into one Church, they do by vertue of this union, become all lyable to the
Iuriſdiction, Canons, Orders Determinations, Cenſures of that one Church;
and thoſe, who whiles divided, had no authority nor power, but onely of their
owne members, have by this union a Iuriſdiction over the Members of all
theſe Churches, thus eonjoyned into one: As it is with ſeveral perſons united in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one Corporation Society, Church, or when ſeverall powers Or juriſdictions
meet and joyne together in one, as the Parliaments, Commiſſioners, Armies of
two Provinces, Kingdome in one Parliament Councel Army; the Lords, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Knights and Burgeſſes of every County, Citty, Town, and Burrough in
both Realmes in one Parliament, they have by this their union the whole
power and authority of both united Kingdomes, Armies, Parliaments.

and a joynt Iuriſdiction over both, which they had not before whiles

Villages, Kingdoms (as our ancient <hi>Saxon Heptarchy)</hi> are all conjoyned into
one City, Realm, and therby ſubordinated to one new Iuriſdiction. If this then
muſt be yeelded to me; it will inevitably follow by the ſelfe-ſame reaſon,
that ſeverall particular Churches being united together in one Synod, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
Aſſembly, Parliament or Presbytery, (even for this very end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

which I will give this further direct anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. I deny, that every particular Church or Congregation in a Chriſtian
State, where there are many adjacent Churches under the ſelfe ſame Civill
Government, is an abſolute compleat, independent Body, City, or Republike
of it ſelfe, (as is objected) to all intents and purpoſes, without dependency on,
or relation, or ſubordination to any other. True it is, that in ſome reſpects, ſo far
as concerns its own private intereſt, it is a compleate body, having a Miniſter
Elders, Members, Ordinances, Prayers, preaching, Sacraments, reading of the
Word maintenance, and the like, of its owne, within it ſelfe; (yetſo; as not
ſimply to exclude all others from preaching or communicating with them,
when there is occaſion:) and in this regard the definition of a Church; given in

                  <hi>Homilies</hi> and by others: (That it is a company of men outwardly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

the Sacraments duly adminiſtred) belongs unto it. But yet it followes not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
that it is either an abſolute, or Independent Church, or a compleate
body in all reſpects, exempt from all ſuperior juriſdiction, but a dependent,
ſubordinate Congregation, and a meere Member in reſpect of the Nationall,
Provinciall or Catholike Church. For as every private perſon, familie, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Society, City conſidered in themſelves, are compleate, perfect men, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Societies &amp;c. but in relation to the Families, Kingdoms, Cities, Republikes

As a private Chriſtian, or Church, they have a private compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
abſoluteneſſe, and Ordinances within themſelves, of which no other
particular Chriſtian or Church can deprive them, not judicially queſtion them
for: But yet this private Chriſtian as a Member of a Congregation, and this

of Chriſt, are neither abſolute, not independent, but ſubordinate to the other

<hi>Brother,</hi> will you argue thus? <hi>Adam</hi> was a compleat and abſolute man alone;
<hi>therefore he needed not a helper or wife, or family to be joyned to him.</hi> Suppoſe
you ſhould take a ſingle perſon, who formerly lived alone by and of himſelfe,
without relation to, or communion with any other men, like a Popiſh <hi>Hermite</hi> or
<hi>Anchorite,</hi> into your family, Church; or incorporate him into this City, or any
company in it: will you ſay that becauſe this man was abſolute, and under no
command at firſt, <hi>Ergo</hi> he muſt continue ſo ſtill in your family, Church, this
City, and his company; and neither you, nor any of them may, or can of right
enact any thing to controle him? I trow not: When there were only ſingle Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
living remote from others in the world, they were abſolute and compleate
Churches, Republikes of themſelves; but when theſe ſingle families multiplyed,
and combined themſelves into Villages, Cities, Provinces, Republikes; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
they thereby loſt their priſtine liberty, abſoluteneſſe, independencie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſſe,
and of intire ſmall bodies, Churches, Republikes, became onely parts
and members of thoſe larger ones to which they were thus combined. So it is with
particular Mother Churches, when there was but one particular Church in the
world, or in one State or Kingdome (the caſe of all the firſt Churches planted by
the Apoſtles) without any Neighbour Churches to combine with, this Church
being under no ſuperiour Chriſtian Magiſtrates, was abſolute and independent in
it ſelfe, there being no other Church to joyne with. But if this one Church
through the encreaſe of Chriſtians ſhall ſwell ſo great, as to ſpread it ſelfe over
all the City, or Republike wherein it is, and ſo upon neceſſity muſt divide
it ſelfe into ſundry particular Congregations, then all theſe Churches being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one and the ſelfe-ſame <hi>Republike,</hi> and united together under one ſupreame,
Civill Magiſtrate, as members of the ſame Nation, Kingdom, City, Republike, and of

they were not ſubject to the determinations of publick Synods. 2. That none of the

For firſt they were all ſubject to the Apoſtles rules and directions, both

Chriſt more careleſſe of his Church before then under the Law, becauſe he gave them
