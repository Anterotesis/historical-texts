            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not long ſince I met you in this place, upon an occaſion which gave me much more content, and comfort then this doth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I have to ſay to you now, will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:167934:3"/>
need no Preamble to let me in to my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: For the occaſion of this Meeting is plain enough. I could have wiſhed with all my heart there had been no cauſe for it.</p>
            <p>At that Meeting I did acquaint you what the firſt Riſe was of this Government which hath call'd you hither; and in the Authority of which you came hither.</p>
            <p>Among other things that I told you of then, I ſaid you were a free Parliament. And ſo you are whilſt you own the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Authority that call'd you hither. For certainly that word implyed a <hi>Reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or it implyed nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Indeed there was a Reciprocation implied, and expreſſed: and I think your actions, and carriages ought to be ſuitable.</p>
            <p>But I ſee it will be neceſſary for me now, a little to magnifie my Office; which I have not been apt to do. I have been of this minde, I have been alwayes of this minde, ſince firſt I entered upon it, That if God will not beare it up, let it ſink. But if a Duty be incumbent upon me, to beare my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto it, (which in modeſty I have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167934:3"/>
hitherto ſorborn) I am in ſome meaſure now neceſſitated thereunto. And therefore that will be the Prologue to my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I call'd not my ſelf to this place; I ſay again, I call'd not my ſelfe to this place; of that God is Witneſſe. And I have many Witneſſes; who I do beleeve could readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay down their lives to beare Witneſſe to the truth of that: that is to ſay, That I call'd not my ſelf to this place. And being in it, I beare not witneſſe to my ſelf. But God and the people of theſe Nations have borne Teſtimony to it alſo.</p>
            <p>If my calling be from God, and my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony from the People; God and the People ſhall take it from me, elſe I will not part with it. I ſhould be ſalfe to the Truſt that God hath plac'd upon me, and to the Intereſt of the People of theſe Nations, if I ſhould.</p>
            <p>That I call'd not my ſelf to this place, is my firſt Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>That I bear not witneſſe to my ſelf, but have many Witneſſes, is my ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:167934:4"/>Theſe are the two things I ſhall take the liberty to ſpeak more fully to you of.</p>
            <p>To make plain and clear that which I have ſaid, I muſt take liberty to look back.</p>
            <p>I was by birth a Gentleman, living nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any conſiderable height, nor yet in obſcurity: I have been call'd to ſeveral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the Nation: To ſerve in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments: And (becauſe I would not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tedious) I did endeavour to diſcharge the duty of an honeſt man in thoſe ſervices, to God, and his peoples intereſt, and of the Common-Wealth; having, when time was, a competent acceptation in the hearts of men, and ſome evidences thereof. I reſolve not to recite the Times, and Occaſions, and Opportunities that have been appointed me by God to ſerve him in: nor the preſence and bleſſings of God bearing then Teſtimony to me.</p>
            <p>I having had ſome occaſions to ſee (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my Brethren and Countrey-men) a happy period put to our ſharp Warres, and Conteſts with the then common enemy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, in a private capacity, to have reaped the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167934:4"/>
fruit, and benefit together with my Brethren, of our hard labours and hazards: to wit, the enjoyment of Peace and Liberty, and the Priviledges of a Chriſtian, and of a man, in ſome equality with others, according as it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to diſpence unto me.</p>
            <p>And when, I ſay, God had put an end to our Wars, at leaſt brought them to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hopeful iſſue, very near an end, (after <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight) I came up to <hi>London</hi> to pay my ſervice, and duty to the Parliament that then ſate; and hoping that all mindes would have been diſpoſed to anſwer that which ſeemed to be the minde of God, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to give Peace and Reſt to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and eſpecially to thoſe who had bled more then others in the carrying on of the military Affaires, I was much diſappointed of my expectation: For the iſſue did not prove ſo; what ever may be boaſted, or miſ-repreſented, it was not ſo, not ſo.</p>
            <p>I can ſay in the ſimplicity of my ſoul, I love not I love not, (I declined it in my former ſpeech) I ſay, I love not to rake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:167934:5"/>
ſores, or to diſcover nakedneſſes. That which I drive at, is this; I ſay to you, I hoped to have had leave to have retired to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life: I begg'd to be diſmiſſed of my Charge: I begg'd it again and again. And God be Judge between me and all men, if I lie in this matter. That I lie not in matter of fact, is known to very mans; but whether I tell a lie in my heart, as labouring to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you that which was not upon my heart, I ſay, the Lord be Judge: let unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table men that meaſure others by themſelves, judge as they pleaſe. As to the matter of fact, I ſay it is true. As to the ingenuity and integrity of my heart in that deſire, I do appeale, as before, upon the truth of that alſo. But I could not obtaine what my ſoul longed for. And the plain truth is, I did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards apprehend, That ſome did think (my judgement not ſuiting with theirs) that it could not well be. But this I ſay to you, was, between God and my ſoul; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and that Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe I am in ſome ſtrait, to ſay what I could ſay; and what is true of what then followed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:167934:5"/>I preſſed the Parliament, as a Member, to period themſelves, once, and again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ten, and twenty times over. <hi>I</hi> told them (for I knew it better then any one man in the Parliament could know it, becauſe of my maner of life, which was to run up and down the Nation, and ſo might ſee and know the temper and ſpirits of all men, the beſt of men) that the Nation loathed their ſitting: I knew it. And ſo farre as <hi>I</hi> could diſcerne, when they were diſſolved, there was not ſo much as the barking of a dog, or any general and viſible repining at it. You are not a few here preſent that can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert this as well as my ſelf.</p>
            <p>And that there was high cauſe for their Diſſolving, is moſt evident, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there was a juſt fear of the Parliaments perpetuating themſelves; but becauſe it was their deſigne. And had not their heeles been trod upon by importunities from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, even to threats, <hi>I</hi> believe there would never have been thoughts of Riſing, or of going out of that Roome to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:167934:6"/>I <hi>my ſelfe was founded; and by no mean perſons tempted; and addreſſes were made to me to that very end, that it might have been thus perpetuated, That the vacant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be ſupplied by new Elections, and ſo continue from Generation to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have declined, I have declined very much, to open theſe things to you: yet having proceeded thus farre, <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, that poor men under this Arbitrary Power, were driven like flocks of ſheep, by fourty in a morning, to the Confiſcation of Goods, and Eſtates, without any man being able to give a reaſon that two of them had deſerved to forfeit a ſhilling. <hi>I</hi> tell you the truth, and my ſoul, and many perſons whoſe faces <hi>I</hi> ſee in this place were exceedingly grieved at theſe things: and knew not which way to help it, but by their mournings, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their negatives when occaſions ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have given you but a taſte of miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. <hi>I</hi> am confident you have had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to hear much more of them: for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:167934:6"/>
nothing is more obvious. It's true, this will be ſaid, That there was a remedy to put an end to this perpetual Parliament endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, by having a future Representative. How it was gotten, and by what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities that was obtained, and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly yielded unto, is well known.</p>
            <p>What was this remedy? It was a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willingneſſe to have ſucceſſive Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What was that Succeſſion? it was, that when one Parliament had left their Seat, another was to ſit down immediately in the roome thereof, without any Caution to avoid that which was the danger; (<hi>viz.</hi>) Perpetuating of the ſame Parliaments; which is a ſore now that will ever be running, ſo long as men are ambitious and troubleſome, if a due remedy be not found. So then, What was the buſineſſe? It was a Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a Parliament that ſhould have been, and was perpetuall, to a Legiſlative Power always ſitting: &amp; ſo the Liberties, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and Lives of People, not judged by any certain known Lawes and Power, but by an Arbitrary Power, which is incident and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:167934:7"/>
to Parliaments by an Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: I ſay, to make mens eſtates liable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation, and their perſons to impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſometimes by Lawes made after the fact committed: often by taking the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in capital and criminal things to themſelves, who in former times were not known to exerciſe ſuch a Judicature.</p>
            <p>This I ſuppoſe was the caſe; and in my opinion the remedy was fitted to the diſeaſe: eſpecially coming in the Reare of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo exerciſing the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as this had done, but immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Truly, I conſeſſe upon theſe grounds, and with the ſatisfaction of divers other Perſons, ſeeing nothing could be had otherwiſe; that Parliament was diſſolv'd, we deſiring to ſee if a few might have been call'd together for ſome ſhort time who might put the Nation into ſome way of certain ſettlement, did call thoſe Gentlemen out of the ſeveral parts of the Nation for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And, as <hi>I</hi> have appealed to God before you already, I know (and I hope I may ſay it,)

though it be a tender thing to make appeals to God; yet in ſuch exigencies as theſe, I truſt it will not offend his Majeſty, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make them before Perſons that know God, and know what Conſcience is, and what it is to lie before the Lord. I ſay, that as a principal end in calling that Aſſembly, was the ſettlement of the Nation; ſo a chief end to my ſelfe was, That I might have opportunity to lay down the Power that was in my hands I ſay to you again, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that God, who hath bleſſed and been with me in all my adverſities and ſucceſſes, that was as to my ſelf my greateſt end. <hi>A</hi> deſire perhaps, (and I am afraid) ſinful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to be quit of the Power God had moſt Providentially put into my hand, before he called for it; and before thoſe honeſt ends of our fighting were attained and ſetled. I ſay, the Authority <hi>I</hi> had in my hand, being ſo boundleſſe as it was, <hi>I</hi> being by Act of Parliament General of all the forces in the three Nations of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (In which unlimitted condition <hi>I</hi> did not deſire to live a day,) did call
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:167934:8"/>
that meeting for the ends before expreſſed.</p>
            <p>What the event and iſſue of that meeting was, we may ſadly remember. It hath much teaching in it; and I hope will make us all wiſer for the future.</p>
            <p>But this meeting ſucceeding, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid to you, and giving ſuch a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to our hopes, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not now make any repetition thereof; only the effect was, That they came and brought to me a parchment ſigned by very much the major part of them, expreſſing their reſigning and re-delivery of the Power and Authority that was committed to them, back again into my hands: And <hi>I</hi> can ſay it in the preſence of divers perſons here, that do know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>I</hi> lie in that, that <hi>I</hi> did not know one tittle of that reſignation, until they all came and brought it, and delivered it into my hands: of this there are alſo in this preſence many Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>I received this Reſignation, having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed my endeavours and perſwaſions to keep them together; obſerving their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, <hi>I</hi> thought it my duty to give advices
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:167934:8"/>
to them, that ſo I might prevail with them for union: But it had the effect that I told you: and I had my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</p>
            <p>When this was ſo, we were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to ſeek how to ſettle things for the future. My power again by this Reſignation, was as boundleſſe and unlimited as before; all things being ſubjected to Arbitrarineſs, and a perſon having power over the three Nations boundleſſely, and unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And upon the matter all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment diſſolved, all Civill Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations at an end; as will preſently be made appear.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen that undertook to frame this Government, did conſult di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers dayes together, (they being of known Integrity, and ability) how to frame ſomewhat that might give us ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement; and they did ſo: and that I was not privy to their Councels, they know it.</p>
            <p>When they had finiſhed their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:167934:9"/>
in ſome meaſure, or made a very good preparation of it, it became Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative. They told me that except I would undertake the Government, they thought things would hardly come to a Compoſure, and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but blood and confuſion would break in upon us. I denied it again, and again, as God and thoſe perſons know, not complementingly as they alſo know, and as God knowes.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, after many Arguments, and after the letting of me know that I did not receive any thing that put me into any higher Capacity then I was in before, but that it limited me, and bound my hands to act nothing to the prejudice of the Nations, wihout conſent of a Councell untill the Parliament; and then limited by the Parliament, as the Act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expreſſeth, I did accept it.</p>
            <p>I might repeat this again to you, if it were needfull, but I think I need not. I was arbitrary in Power, having the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:167934:9"/>
Armies in the three Nations under my command: and truly not very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by them; nor very ill beloved then by the people, by the good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and I beleive I ſhould have bin more beloved if they had known the truth, as things were before God, and in themſelves; and before divers of theſe Gentlemen whom I but now mentioned unto you.</p>
            <p>I did, at the intreaty of divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of honor and quality; at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of very many of the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army then preſent, and at their requeſt, <hi>I</hi> did accept of the place, and title of Protector, and was in the preſence of the Commiſſioners of the Seal, the Judges, the Lord Major and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Souldierie, divers Gentlemen, Citizens, and divers other people, and perſons of quality, &amp;c. accompanied to Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall, where I took my oath to this Government. This was not done in a corner: it was open and publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:167934:10"/>This Government hath bin exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by a Councell, with a deſire to be faithfull in all things; and amongſt all other truſts, to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in calling this Parliament.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given you a very bare and leane diſcourſe; which truly I have bin neceſſitated unto, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in, becauſe of the unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the occaſion; and becauſe I would not quite wearie you, nor my ſelf. But this is a Narrative that diſcovers to you the Series of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of Tranſactions leading me into this Condition wherein I now ſtand.</p>
            <p>The next thing I promiſed you, wherein I hope I ſhall not be ſo long, (though I am ſure this occaſion does require plaineneſſe and freedom,) is, That as I brought not my ſelf into this Condition, (as in my own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion I did not; and that I did not, (the things being true which I have told you) I ſubmit it to your Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:167934:10"/>
and there ſhall I leave it, let God do what he pleaſeth.) The other things I ſay that I am to ſpeak to you of, is, That I have not, nor do not bear witneſſe to my ſelf. <hi>I</hi> am far from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to him that ſaid ſo; yet truth concerning a member of his hee will own, though men do not.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I</hi> think (if <hi>I</hi> miſtake not) I have a cloud of witneſſes. I think ſo; let men be as froward as they will. I have witneſſe within, without, and above. But <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſpeak of them that are without, having fully ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the witneſſe Above, and the witneſs in my own conſcience, upon the other Account; becauſe that ſubject had more obſcurity in it, and <hi>I</hi> in ſome ſort needed appeales; and <hi>I</hi> truſt might lawfully make them, as well as take an oath, where things were not ſo apt to be made evident. <hi>I</hi> ſhall enumerate my witneſſes as well as I can.</p>
            <p>VVhen <hi>I</hi> had conſented to accept of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:167934:11"/>
the Government, there was ſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity to be performed; and that was accompanied with ſome perſons of conſiderableneſſe in all reſpects; who were the perſons before expreſſed; who accompanied me at the time of my entring upon this Government, to VVeſtminſter-Hall to take my oath.</p>
            <p>There was an explicite conſent of Intereſſed perſons; and an implicite conſent of many, ſhewing their good liking, and approbation thereof. And (Gentlemen) <hi>I</hi> do not think that you are altogether ſtrangers to it, in your Country: ſome did not nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate it; very many did approve it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> had the approbation of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army in the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland; I</hi> ſay of the Officers <hi>. I</hi> had that by their Remonſtrances, and under ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; There was went along with that explicite conſent, an implicite conſent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:167934:11"/>
of perſons that had ſomewhat to do in the World; that had been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall by God, to fight down the enemies of God, and his people, in the three Nations. And truly, until my hands were bound, and<hi> I </hi>limited,(wherein<hi> I </hi>took full contentment, as many can bear me witneſs,) when<hi> I </hi>had in my hands ſo great a power and Arbitrarineſs, the Souldierie were a very conſiderable part of the Nations, eſpecially all Government being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved<hi>. I </hi>ſay, when all Government was thus diſſolved, and nothing to keep things in order but the Sword, and yet they (which many hiſtories will not parallell) even they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that things might come to a Conſiſtencie, and Arbitrarines might be taken away, and the Government put into a perſon (limited and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as in the Act of Settlement) whom they deſtruſted the leaſt, and loved not the worſt: this was another evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:167934:12"/>I would not forget the honourable and civill entertainment, with the approbation I found in the great City of <hi>London</hi>; which the City knowes whether <hi>I</hi> directly or indirectly ſought. And truly <hi>I</hi> do not think it is folly to remember this. For it was very great, and high, and very publick; and as numerous a Body of thoſe that are known by names, and titles, (the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall corporations, and ſocieties of Citizens in this City,) as hath been at any time ſeen in <hi>England</hi>; and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome appearance of ſatisfaction alſo.</p>
            <p>I <hi>had not onely this witneſſe, but</hi> I <hi>have had from the greateſt County in</hi> England, <hi>and from many Cities, and Boroughs, and many Counties, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Approbations; not of thoſe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered here, and there; but from the County of</hi> York, <hi>and City of</hi> York, <hi>and other Counties, and places, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in their publike, and generall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:167934:12"/>
Aſſizes, the Grand-Jury in the name of the Noble men, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Yeomen, and inhabitants of that County, giving very great thanks to me for undertaking this heavy Burthen, at ſuch a time: and giving very great Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and incouragement to me to go through with it. Theſe are plain.</hi> I <hi>have them to ſhew. And by theſe in ſome meaſure it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> I <hi>do not bear witneſſe to my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not all: the Judges, (and truly I had almoſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it) they thinking that there was a diſſolution of Government, met, and conſulted, and did declare one to another, that they could not adminiſter Juſtice to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their conſciences, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they had received Commiſſions from me. And they did receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions from me. And by vertue
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:167934:13"/>
of thoſe Commiſſions they have acted. And all the Juſtices of the Peace, that have acted, have acted by vertue of like Commiſsions: which was a little more then an implicit Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I beleeve all the Juſtice adminiſtred in the Nation, hath been by this Authority; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>I</hi> lay before you: deſiring you to think whether all theſe Perſons before mentioned muſt not come before you for an Act of Oblivion, and Generall Pardon, who have acted under, and teſtified to this Go.vernment, if it be diſowned by you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have two or three witneſſes more, equivalent to all theſe I have reckoned, if <hi>I</hi> be not miſtaken, and greatly miſtaken. If I ſhould ſay, all you that are here, are my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>I</hi>ſhould ſay no untruth. <hi>I</hi> know you are the ſame perſons here, that you were in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:167934:13"/>
But <hi>I</hi> will reſerve to ſpeak to this at the laſt; for this will be the iſſue of my ſpeech. <hi>I</hi> ſay, <hi>I</hi> have two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that are more, then all <hi>I</hi> have accounted, and reckoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>All the people in <hi>England,</hi> are my witneſſes: and many in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> All the Sheriffes in <hi>England</hi> are my witneſſes. And all that came in upon the Proceſs iſſued out by the Sheriffes are my witneſſes. Yea, the Returnes of the Elections to the Clerk of the Crown, not a thing to be blown away with a breath; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes on the behalf of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the Counties, Cities, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, Al are my witneſſes of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the condition, and place I ſtand in.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall now make you my laſt witneſſes, and ask you whether you came not hither by my Writs, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:167934:14"/>
to the ſeverall Sheriffs? and ſo to other Officers in Cities, and Liberties, to which the People gave obedience: having alſo had the Act: of Government communicated to them: to which end greate Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Copies were ſent down, on purpoſe to be communicated to them; And the Government alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to be diſtinctly read un. to the People at the place of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, to avoid ſurprizes; where alſo they ſigned the Indenture, with proviſo, That the perſons ſo choſen ſhall not have power to alter the Government, as it is now ſettled; in one ſingle Perſon and a Parliament.</p>
            <p>And thus I have made good my ſecond Aſſertion, That I bear not witneſſe to my ſelfe; but the good people of <hi>England,</hi> and you all are my witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Yea ſurely, And this being ſo,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:167934:14"/>
though I told you in my laſt ſpeech, that you were a free Parliament; yet I thought it was underſtood, that I was the Protector, and the Authority that called you, and that I was in poſſeſsion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by a good Right from God and men. And I believe, if the learnedſt men in this Nation were called to ſhew a Preſident ſo clear, ſo many wayes approving of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; they would not in all their ſearch finde it.</p>
            <p>I did not in my other ſpeech to you take upon me to juſtifie the Government in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and I told you the reaſon of it; which was plain. It was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick; and had been long publiſhed; and it might be under the moſt ſerious inſpection of all that pleaſed to peruſe it.</p>
            <p>By what I have ſaid, I have approved my ſelf to God, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:167934:15"/>
my conſcience, in my actions; and in this undertaking. And I have given cauſe of approving my ſelfe to every one of your conſciences in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, why ſhould we ſport with it? with a buſineſſe thus ſerious? May not this Character, this ſtamp, bear equall Poyze with any hereditary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which may have, and hath had, in the common Law, matters of Diſpute, and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of learning? wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have exerciſed more Wit, and ſpilt more blood, then I hope ever to live to ſee, or hear of in this Nation.</p>
            <p>I ſay, I do not know why I may not balance this providence, as in the ſight of God, with any heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Intereſt, as being leſſe ſubject to thoſe Crackes, and Flaws, they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:167934:15"/>
are commonly incident unto. Which Titles have coſt more blood, in former times, in this Nation, then wee have leiſure to ſpeake of now.</p>
            <p>Now if this be thus, and I am deriving a Title from God and men, upon ſuch Accounts as theſe are: Although ſome men be froward, yet that your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that are Perſons ſent from all parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the Notion of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Government for you to diſowne, or not to owne it; for you to act Parliamentary Authority, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the diſowning of it; contrary to the very fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall things; yea, againſt the very root it ſelfe of this Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment; to ſit and not owne the Authority by which you fit, is that that I believe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:167934:16"/>
more men then my ſelfe; and doth as dangerouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint, and diſcompoſe the Nation, as any thing could have beene invented by the greateſt Enemie to our peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; or could well have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>It is true, there are ſome things in the Eſtabliſhment, that are Fundamental: and ſome things are not ſo, but are Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. Of ſuch, no queſtion but I ſhall eaſily agree to vary, or leave out, as I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by reaſon. Some things are Fundamentals, about which I ſhall deale plainly with you, they may not be parted with; but will (I truſt) be delivered over to Poſterity, as being the fruits of our Blood and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:167934:16"/>The Government by a ſingle Perſon and a Parliament, is a Fundamentall; It is the <hi>Eſſe.</hi> It is Conſtitutive. And for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though I may ſeem to plead for my ſelf, yet I doe not, no nor can any reaſonable man ſay it. But if the things throughout this Speech be true, <hi>I</hi> plead for this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all honeſt men therein, who have borne their Teſtimony, as afore-ſaid, and not for my ſelf. And if things ſhould doe otherwiſe, then well, which <hi>I</hi> would not fear; and the Common Enemy, and diſcontented Perſons take Advantage at theſe Diſtractions, the iſſue will be put up before God, Let him own, or let him diſown it, as he pleaſe.</p>
            <p>In every Government there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Fundamental, ſomewhat like a <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that ſhould be ſtanding, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable. Where there is a Stipulation on one Part, and that fully accepted, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what hath been ſaid; ſurely a Return ought to be: elſe what does that Stipulation ſignifie? If I have upon the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:167934:17"/>
Tearms aſore-ſaid undertaken this great Truſt, and Exerciſed it, and by it called you, ſurely it ought to be owned.</p>
            <p>That Parliaments ſhould not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Perpetual, is a Fundamentall. Of what Aſſurance is a Law to prevent ſo great an evil, if it lie in one or the ſame Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator to unlaw it again? Is this like to be laſting? It will be like a Rope of Sand; it will give no Security. For the ſame men may unbuild, what they have built.</p>
            <p>Is not Liberty of Conſcience in Religion a Fundamentall? ſo long as there is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience for the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, to exerciſe his Conſcience in ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting what Form of Church-Government he is ſatisfied, he ſhould ſet up; why ſhould not he give it to others? Liberty of Conſcience is a Naturall Right: and he that would have it ought to give it; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Liberty to ſettle what he likes for the Publick.</p>
            <p>Indeed that hath been one of the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:167934:17"/>
of our Conteſts. Every Sect ſaith, Oh! Give me Liberty, But give him it, and to his Power he will not yeeld it to any Body elſe. Where is our Ingenuity? Truely that's a thing ought to be very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal. The Magiſtrate hath his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and he may ſettle Religion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Conſcience. And I may ſay it to you: I can ſay it; all the Money of this Nation, would not have tempted men to fight, upon ſuch an Account as they have engaged, if they had not had Hopes of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, better then they had from Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; or then would have been afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, from a Scottiſh Presbytery, or an Engliſh either; if it had made ſuch ſteps, or been as ſharp, and Rigid, as it threatned when it was firſt ſet up.</p>
            <p>This, I ſay, is a Fundamentall. It ought to be ſo: it is for us, and the Generations to come. And if there be an abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Impoſer, without fitting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances, and Exceptions from the Rule, we ſhall have our People driven into Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:167934:18"/>
as they were when thoſe poor, and afflicted People, that forſook their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and Inheritances here, where they lived plentifully and Comfortably, for the Enjoyment of their Liberty, and were neceſſitated to goe into a vaſt howling Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe in <hi>New England,</hi> where they have for Liberty ſake ſtript themſelves of all their Comfort, and the full Enjoyment they had, embracing rather loſſe of Friends, and want, then to be ſo enſnared, and in Bondage.</p>
            <p>Another, which I had forgotten, is the <hi>Militia,</hi> that's Judged a Fundamentall, if any thing be ſo. That it ſhould be well and equally placed, is very neceſſary. For put the Abſolute Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> into One without a Check, what doth it? I pray you, what doth your Check put upon your Perpetuall Parliaments, if it be wholly ſtript of this? It is equally Placed, and Deſires were to have it ſo (<hi>viz.</hi>) in one Perſon, and the Parliament, ſitting the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. What ſignifies a Proviſion againſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:167934:18"/>
perpetuating of Parliaments, if this be ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them? Whether without a Check the Parliament have not Liberty to alter the Frame of Government, to Ariſtocraſie, to Democraſie, to Anarchy, to any Thing, if this be fully in them? Yea into all Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and that without Remedy? And if this one Thing be placed in One, that One, be it Parliament, be it Supream Governour, They, or He hath Power to make what they pleaſe of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if you would have a Balance at all; and that ſome Fundamentals muſt ſtand, which may be worthy to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over to Poſterity; truely, I think, it is not unreaſonably urged, That the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be diſpoſed, as it is laid down in the Government: and that it ſhould be ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually placed, that one Perſon, neither in Parliament, nor out of Parliament, ſhould have the Power of Ordering it. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell are the Truſtees of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in all Intervals of Parliaments; who have as Abſolute a Negative upon the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:167934:19"/>
Officer in the ſaid Intervalls, as the Parliament hath whilſt it is ſitting. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made uſe of: a man cannot be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor a penny charged upon the People; nothing done without Conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in the Intervals of Parliament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conſent of the Council, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to ſay, That there is very little Power, none but what is Coordinate, in the Supream Officer; and yet enough in him that hath the Chief Government, in that particular, he is bound in ſtrictneſſe by the Parliament, out of Parliament by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that doe as abſolutely binde him, as the Parliament, when the Parliament is ſitting.</p>
            <p>For that of Money; I told you ſome things are Circumſtantials. To have two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds, to Defray Civil Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, to pay the Judges, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, defraying the Charges of the Councell, in ſending their Embaſſies, in keeping In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and doing that that's neceſſary,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:167934:19"/>
and for ſupporting the Governour in Chief: All this is by the Inſtrument ſuppoſed and intended; But it is not of the <hi>Eſſe</hi> ſo much, and ſo limited, as ſo many Souldiers, 30000, twenty thouſand Foot, and ten thouſand Horſe. If the Spirits of men be compoſed five thouſand Horſe, and ten thouſand Foot, may ſerve. Theſe things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Chief Officer, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to be moderated, as occaſion ſhall offer.</p>
            <p>So there are many other Circumſtantiall things, which are not like the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi>; But the things which ſhall be neceſſary to deliver over to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, theſe ſhould be unalterable, elſe every ſucceeding Parliament, will be diſputing to Change, and alter the Government, and we ſhall be as often brought into Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we have Parliaments, and ſo make our Remedy our Diſeaſe. The Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, appearing Evils, appearing Good, and better Judgement, will give occaſion for the ordering of things, for the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:167934:20"/>
of the People. And thoſe things are the Matter of Conſideration between you and me.</p>
            <p>I have indeed almoſt tired my ſelf. That that I have further to ſay, is this, <hi>I</hi> would it had not been needfull for me to have called you hither to have expoſtulated theſe things with you, and in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as this is: But Neceſſity hath no Law. Feigned Neceſſities, imaginary Neceſſities are the greateſt Couſenage that men can put upon the Providence of God, and make pretences to break known Rules by. But it is as Legall, and as Carnall, and as Stupid, to think that there are no Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, that are manifeſt Neceſſities: Becauſe Neceſſities may be abuſed or feigned, And truely I ſhould be ſo, if I ſhould thinke ſo, and I hope none of you thinke ſo.</p>
            <p>I ſay, That the wilfull throwings away of this Government, ſuch as it is, ſo own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, ſo approved by men, ſo teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to, in the Fundamentals of it, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:167934:20"/>
and that in Relation to the Good of theſe Nations, and Poſterity; I can ſooner be willing to be Rolled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Grave, and Buried with Infamy, then I can give my Consentunto.</p>
            <p>You have been called hither together to ſave a Nation; — Nations. You had the beſt People indeed in the Chriſtian World in your Truſt, when you came hither. You had Affaires, and theſe Nations delivered over to you in Peace and Quietneſſe: You were, and we all were put into an uninterrupted Poſſeſſion, no body making Title to us. Through the Bleſſing of God our Enemies were hopeleſſe and ſcattered. We had Peace at home: Peace almoſt with all Neighbours round about: fit to take Advantages where God did adminiſter them.</p>
            <p>To have our Peace and Intereſt, that had thoſe hopes the other day, thus ſhaken, and under ſuch a Confuſion; and wee rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereby (almoſt) the Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of thoſe Strangers that are amongſt us, to Negotiate their Maſters Affaires;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:167934:21"/>
To give them Opportunity to ſee our Nakedneſſe, as they doe, a People that have been unhinged this Twelve Yeares day, and unhinged ſtill; as if Scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Diviſion, and Confuſion ſhould come upon us (as if it were deſired) which are the greateſt Plagues God ordinarily layes upon Nations for ſinne: I would be loath to ſay, they are Matters of our Delight: But if not, Why not the Matter of our Care, ſo wiſely as we ought by uttermoſt Endeavours to avoid? Nay, when by ſuch Actions, as theſe are, theſe poor Nations ſhall be thrown into heapes of Confuſion, through Bloud, and Ruine, and Trouble, upon the ſaddeſt Account that ever was, if breaking ſhould come upon us, and all becauſe we would not ſettle when we might; when God put it into our Hands: Your Affairs now almoſt ſettled every where: And to have all Recoyl upon us, and we our ſelves ſhaken in our Affections, looſened from all Knowne and publick Intereſts, as I have mentioned to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:167934:21"/>
you: Who ſhall anſwer for theſe things to God? Who can anſwer for theſe things to God, or to Men? To the People that ſent you hither? Who lookt for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from you; who lookt for nothing but Peace, and Quietneſſe, and Reſt, and Settlement. And when we ſhall come to give an Accompt to them, we ſhall be able to ſay; Oh! we have quarrelled for, and we conteſted for the Liberty of <hi>England.</hi> Wherein forſooth for the Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? I appeale to the Lord, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Endeavours, and the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will ſpeak for themſelves; That the Liberty of <hi>England</hi>; The Liberty of the People; The avoiding of Tyranous Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, either upon Men as Men, or Chriſtians as Chriſtians, is made ſo ſafe by this Act of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, that it will ſpeak ſufficiently for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And when it ſhall appear what hath been ſaid, and done; and what our Tranſactions have been: For God can diſcover, and no Priviledge will hinder the Lord from diſcovering, no Priviledge
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:167934:22"/>
or Condition of men can hide from the Lord: He can, and will make all manifeſt, if he ſee it for his Glory. And vvhen theſe ſhall by the Providence of God be manifeſted, and the People ſhall come and ſay, Gentlemen, What Condition are we in? We hoped for Light, and behold Darkneſſe obſcure Darkneſſe! We hoped for Reſt, after ten Years Civil Wars: We are plunged into deep Confuſion again. I, we know theſe Conſequences will come upon us, if God Almighty ſhall not finde out ſome way to prevent them.</p>
            <p>I had this thought within my ſelf. That it had not been Diſhoneſt, nor Diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, nor againſt true Liberty, no not of Parliaments; when a Parliament was ſo Choſen, in Purſuance of, in Conformity to, and with ſuch an Approbation, and Conſent to the Government, ſo that he that runnes might reade by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority you came hither: That an own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Call, and of the Authority bringing you hither, might have been
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:167934:22"/>
required before your Entrance into the Houſe.</p>
            <p>But this was declined, and hath not been done, bccauſe I am perſwaded ſcarce any man could reaſonably doubt you came with contrary Mindes. And I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to beleeve, the People that ſent You, leaſt doubted thereof at all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt deal plainly with You. What <hi>I</hi> forbare upon a juſt Confidence at firſt, You neceſſitate me unto now. — That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Authority calling You is ſo little valued, and ſo much ſleighted, Till ſome ſuch Aſſurance be given, and made known; That the Fundamentall Intereſt of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be Settled, and Approved, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proviſoe contained in the Return; and ſuch a Conſent teſtified, as will make it appear, that the ſame is accepted, I have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſtop to be put to your Entrance into the Parliament Houſe.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry, I am ſorry, and I could be ſorry to the Death, that there is Cauſe for this. But there is Cauſe. And if things
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:167934:23"/>
be not Satisfied, that are reaſonably De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. I for my part ſhall do that that becomes me, ſeeking my Councell from God.</p>
            <p>There is therefore ſomewhat to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, that I hope will (being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with the Qualifications that I have told you of: Reforming Circumſtantials, and Agreeing in the Subſtance and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals (which is, the Government Setled, as it is expreſſed in the Indenture) not to be altered; The making of your mindes known in that, by giving your Aſſent and Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to it; is that, that will) let you in, to Act thoſe things as a Parliament, which are for the good of the People. And this thing ſhewed to you, and Signed, as aſore-ſaid, doth Determine the Controverſie; and may give a happy Progreſſe, and Iſſue to this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Place where you may come thus, and Sign, as many as God ſhall make free there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is in the Lobby without the Parliament door.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:167934:23"/>The Government doth declare, that you have a Legiſlative Power without a Negative from me. As the Government doth expreſs, you may make any Laws; and if I give not my Conſent within twenty dayes, to the Paſſing your Lawes, they are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Laws, whether I conſent, or no, if not contrary to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. You have an Abſolute Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power in all things that can poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Good, and Intereſt of the Publike. And I think you may make theſe Nations hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py by this Setlement: And I for my part ſhall be willing to be bound more then I am, in any thing that I may be convinced of, may be for the Good of the People; In Preſervation of the Cauſe and Intereſt ſo long contended for.</p>
