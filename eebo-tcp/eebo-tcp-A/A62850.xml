            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Militia Reform'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE following Discourse (most Noble LORD) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at your Request, and finish'd within the short time You prescrib'd, is now made a Present to the World; which, if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour deserves any Return, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to your Lordship for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication. You have long since justly acquir'd the Esteem of all good Men; and the known mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their Prayers, when they wish their Relations happy, is that they may equal your Lordship's Probity and Understanding. But tho you neither want, nor desire the regards of any besides the <hi>Vertuous</hi>; yet no News can be more pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to hear of a constant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93516:5"/>
Addition to your Friends, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infallible Sign, that the Number of Publick-spirited Men increases: For he must needs be your sworn Enemy, who is not a hearty lover of his Country. I purposely forbear to express your Name, or to enlarge an Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, which, I know, will not be grateful, tho unsuspected of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; and therefore I leave your Lordship to be entertain'd by mine, or your own more solid Observations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. TO employ one's Thoughts on what he pleases, and to speak as freely as he thinks, is the greatest Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of living in a free Government; the next to this is being Master of what you possess from the Favour of others, or by your own Industry; and then, that Merit is indifferently rewarded in Persons of all Conditions and Degrees. Their due Value is ordinarily set upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93516:5"/>
the two last by most Men, and Life it self should be readily expos'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or acquire the first; for, without it to live, is, in my Opinion, worse than any Death. Under Despotick Princes none dares mutter at his own, or the Sufferings of his Fellows; much less put so much Confidence in his dearest Friend, as to condole their common Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, where the Informer is tempted with immense Rewards, and certain Death or Disgrace attend the Accus'd. This is the bless'd Unity of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution which some admire so much, because no Complaints are heard in it; whence they would persuade us, that it is also free from all Grievances. But where Laws secure the Rights of the SUBJECT, with the same Care as the Privileges of the MAGISTRATE, no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is any pinch'd but he cries out; and the Authors of the Peoples Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are oblig'd to change their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, or to rectify their Mistakes. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the PRINCE is disabus'd, when his MINISTERS have seduc'd him by false Representations; or sometimes the MINISTERS refuse to act, if the PRINCE be resolv'd upon Arbitrary Courses. Now, 'tis our peculiar Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93516:6"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> that no other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Europe</hi> is equal to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the DIGNITY of the Magistracy, or the LIBERTY of the People be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd. But particularly in all dubious Affairs of Publick Concern, 'tis every Man's Duty to assist his Country by his Advice, as well as with his Hand in time of Danger: And Matters are as freely debated among us abroad, as within their own Walls by our Senators, who likewise in their printed Votes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of all their Resolutions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. These Considerations, join'd with the Request of a Person I honour, have prevail'd with me to deliver my Opinion at this time concerning the modelling and disciplining of our MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITIA; and I question not but it will by our Wise and August <hi>Parliament</hi> be establish'd on such a foot as shall effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally defend us hereafter against all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Force, and constantly preserve our Freedom and Peace at home.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But before I descend to any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, I must premise something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the present Factions that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately divide us, and which discover their fatal Effects too much upon the present Occasion. One says, the TORIES
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93516:6"/>
will never heartily consent to any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del that makes the MILITIA useful: Another replies, that this is only an ill-natur'd Insinuation, while some of the WHIGS oppose the thing openly, and are glad of any Pretence to conceal their true Reasons. But these Names are now of a very doubtful signification. We hear of Court and Country, of Apostate and Adhering WHIGS; nor are the TORIES more united among themselves. 'Tis observable that no Man, however otherwise negligent of his Conduct, is willing to own that without any reason at all he differs from others in Word or Action: but whether he dissembles, or ingenuously tells the Cause of his Dissent, yet <hi>Interest</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> (real or mistaken) are the two principal Springs of all Divisions. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we find by frequent Experience, that where <hi>Interest</hi> secretly governs, <hi>Conscience</hi> is openly pretended; but in this case no body's bare Profession is to be regarded, his Actions being the most certain Interpreter of his Thoughts. If one therefore, who would pass for a <hi>Patriot,</hi> has any Interest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from that of the Publick, he's no longer entitl'd to this Denomination;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93516:7"/>
but is a real Hypocrite that's ready to sacrifice the Common Good to his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Gain, than which no worse can be said of any particular Faction. Now such Distinctions as these of WHIG and TORY, cannot miss of being often made with a great deal of Partiality and Injustice; for, according to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Passion, he's a WHIG whom you love, and he that you hate's a TORY; and so on the contrary, as you happen to be engag'd in either Party. Nothwithstanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis sometimes a mighty easy thing to see through all these feign'd Pretences. Should one, for Example, who was formerly taken for a Friend to LIBERTY, now that he has got or expects Preferment, neglect or oppose any Publick Good, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting which he might be disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or depriv'd of his Post; this Man must not think to live always upon the Credit of the old Stock, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that either he has entirely chang'd his Sentiments, or was never sincere; and that he resisted the former Powers, because they were not kind enough to him, but not out of any fix'd Enmity to SLAVERY. Some Folks there be who seem'd at the beginning to favour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93516:7"/>
the REVOLUTION, yet ever since oppos'd the Government, because they think their real or fanci'd Merit not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently rewarded by the King, to whom it is impossible to heap Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon every Body tho never so deserving, unless they would be all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders without any to obey them. But we likewise know others who from Enemies to King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> are become his Friends; and this of all Changes is the most natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, that one who by Education, Example, or otherwise, was once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd against the Interest of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, should upon better consideration desert a Party to join with the Publick. Several of these, it may be, never thought during one hour of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or End of Societies, till the late Differences gave 'em an opportunity and incouragement to do it: And if the Discovery of Truth proves to be the Result of their Study, we ought not to reject their Reasons now, because we justly disallow'd their Errors before. Certainly a true PATRIOT can be of no Faction, nor consequently for excluding any from sharing the Blessings of that LIBERTY they are willing to support.

If the <hi>Romans</hi> admitted their vanquish'd Enemies to an equal participation of their Laws and Privileges, how much more readily should we embrace our own Country-men with both Arms, and welcome the return of our prodigal Brethren to their Duty towards our common Mother? But granting that in this Business of the MILITIA, some of those who promote it are not sincere, tho Charity commands us to hope the best, we need not be sollicitous whether they are or not, so long as the thing is good in it self, and they concur with us in establishing a Constitution they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afterwards resist if they would, nor, I hope, be willing, if they could. This is the highest Mark of Sincerity; and, for my part, I shall never think him a Fo to <hi>England</hi> that has a hand in it. But if any continue still scrupulous, let him not be asham'd to imitate the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the great <hi>Apostle,</hi> who said, <hi>Some preach</hi> Christ <hi>even out of Envy and Strife,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.15,—11.</note> and some also out of good Will; The one preach</hi> Christ <hi>out of Contention, not sincerely; —but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of love.—What then? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, everyway, whether in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or in Truth,</hi> Christ <hi>is preach'd;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93516:8"/>
and I therein do rejoice, yea and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice.</hi> Now what's judg'd lawful in <hi>Religion,</hi> and by an Apostle too, may, I think, with a very good Grace be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>Politicks.</hi> After all, I am the farthest imaginable from being an Advocate for any disaffected Persons. The Government is under no Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to indulge Men continuing in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to it; nor should those, who are resolv'd upon adhering to the late King, think upon abusing the Lenity of the present, if the Immortal BRUTUS spar'd not his own Sons, when they were found plotting the Restoration of the <hi>Abdicated</hi> Tyrant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another thing I am sorry to hear out of a great many peoples Mouths, is, that we have not Vertue enough to agree upon any tolerable Model of training our MILITIA, and that it's almost impossible we should ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our former Reputation of Valour. But this Argument is nothing the less weak for being so common; and the true Intent of such as always cry none but good Men can make good Laws, is (besides affronting others) to place all Power in the hands of their own Party, who with them are the only good Men.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93516:9"/>
'Tis Government or Education makes all the Difference among Nations as to Military and Civil Discipline, foreign Commerce, domestick Oeconomy, or the like. Upon the first Discovery of this Island by the <hi>Romans,</hi> its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were found as savage as we know the <hi>Americans</hi> to be now. The Climate of <hi>Rome</hi> is still the same, the Bodies of its Citizens, and the Distances of other Places remain the same; yet they have wholly lost the Secret of conquering the World, and are become as poor and mean spirited as their Ancestors were gallant and brave: for the latter were free, and the former are ignorant Slaves. To come nearer home, all the Pains imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable have been taken for a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble space to render our selves luxurious and illiterate, the better to dispose us to favour the tyrannical Designs of our late Kings; but have we not so retriev'd our Credit in <hi>Europe</hi> under the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of his present Majesty, as if we had voluntarily suffer'd it to be eclips'd a while, that it might shine the brighter ever after? And to apply this more particularly still, I readily own that the MILITIA, as now regulated, is burdensom and useless; but it follows
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93516:9"/>
not that all are necessarily so, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary being plain from the Histories of every Age as well as from present Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. And before I have done I shall give a Demonstration that the Frame of our Militia could not be more successfully contriv'd to render it the Object of the Peoples Contempt and Aversion, with a Design to create in them a good Opinion of Mercenaries, and to make 'em believe a necessity of always keeping up a Standing Force of such. In a word, when our Men are better train'd, they will not make such a ridiculous Figure under their Arms; and when the Charge is less felt or laid out to better purpose, it will be more cheerfully paid.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But we are still encompass'd with many Dangers. It's said that those Souldiers who have so bravely fought for ours and the Liberties of <hi>Europe,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it is not from any private Interest of their own, but out of regard to our future Safety, they desir'd to be kept on foot; and that in Honour we ought not to discharge Men who suffer'd so much for our sakes. We are to blame indeed if we don't sufficiently provide for our own Security; but as to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93516:10"/>
Souldier's Merits, I answer first, that their past Service is duly acknowledg'd, and order'd to be rewarded. Secondly, That such as never saw our Enemies, are more clamorous than those who beat them. And, Thirdly, That this unreasonable Demand was not made by the Body of the common Souldiers, who are generally desirous of returning home to their Wives, or their Relations, or their Callings; and more particularly at this time, because that hitherto they have known nothing but the Danger, Want, or Fatigue of the War; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, once tasting the Pleasures of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Ease, they will every day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come less willing to disband. And now the Question all this while ought not to have been, whether these Gentlemen mean what they say, or only pretend it; but what's most for the Advantage of the Nation. This was the Motive of raising them, and should be that of establishing or laying them aside. War being their Trade, 'tis no wonder if they be always for continuing it; nor can it ever happen to be otherwise, should they be wholly left to themselves, no more than any other Persons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Intervention of the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93516:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would reform the Abuses of their own Professions. But the <hi>Parliament</hi> has now put an end to this Dispute; and, to the great Satisfaction of all good Men, granted to his Majesty a sufficient <hi>Guard</hi> both for the Honour and Safety of his Person, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Number besides to secure some important Places till the New MILITIA is regulated, which, I hope, in a little time may be happily effected. In the following Model Provision is made for several hundreds of the disbanded Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and I dare say the Change propos'd in their Condition will give most of 'em Satisfaction; tho, by the way, they ought to be content, should the <hi>Parliament</hi> proceed no further to gratify them than they have already resolv'd. The most stupid Souldier knows very well an Army has nothing in it so charming that could induce the Nation to raise one, but upon some pressing Necessity, and not to keep' up per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually; nor can the Service perform'd be ever so great, as not to be requited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such a Return. I cannot determin whether it would occasion more Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Mirth to hear a Man contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that because the Souldiers defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93516:11"/>
our Liberty at the publick Charge for nine Years against the <hi>French,</hi> we can do no less than become their Slaves for ever. This Paradox is too gross for any to maintain, or perhaps to intend; yet every considering and indifferent Person must perceive the Consequence to be true. I shall therefore, to avoid the Labour of proving what is self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, put you only in mind of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who, having engag'd the Maid to speak a good Word for him to her Mistriss, would needs when the Lady consented quit her, and marry the Maid, out of pure Gratitude for the pains she had taken on his behalf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But the Honour and Safety of the Nation is the commendable Design of all sides; wherein they are certainly in the right, since all Countries must have some Force to defend them against fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Invasions and domestick Tumults: for as it was their own Good and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which occasion'd Men first to quit the State of Nature, and to associate themselves into Governments; so the Raising and Regulation of their Forces must be directed and accommodated to the same ends. An Island is best si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated for Preservation, as having need
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93516:11"/>
of little other Force, either to infest foreign Coasts, or to protect its own, besides a numerous FLEET which it can never want. But if it be likewise a Government for Encrease, such as ours, its Situation naturally leading it to Trade and planting of Colonies; and if it has the noble Ambition of holding the Balance steddy between other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, of succouring the Distress'd, and grudging Liberty to none, then it must be always provided with a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>Land-Force.</hi> Of this there's no Dispute. Then the only Question is, Whether it be safest to trust Arms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the hands of ignorant, idle, and needy Persons; or, only when there's occasion for it, in the hands of sober, industrious, and understanding Freemen. That the latter can never be dangerous to our Liberty and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at home, and will be infinitely more effectual against an Enemy attacking, or invaded by us, I am now going to prove; and at the same time to deliver an intelligible and practicable MODEL of disciplining and maintaining such a Force with very little Charge, and no Trouble at all. My Method shall be to lay down a few <hi>Propositions,</hi> and those
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93516:12"/>
very short, to each of which I subjoin a <hi>Discourse</hi> confirming or explaining it, and containing what other Remarks might be naturally made in that Place. But I am so far from writing all I have read or observ'd upon this Subject, that I shall omit several useful things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the World seems to be already well satisfy'd, or that are not absolutely es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to my purpose. As I expect the common Fate of all Writers, that some probably out of Ignorance or Malice, and others, perhaps, from substantial Reasons may except against my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; so I desire (as in Justice I am bound) that all real Imperfections, or whatever the Injudicious and Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous may mistake for such, be wholly laid at my own door, and not charg'd upon the Subject, which ought not to suffer under the Disadvantage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Management.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now my First Proposition shall be, THAT <hi>ENGLAND</hi> CONSISTING OF FREEMEN AND SERVANTS, NONE BE CAPABLE OF SERVING IN THE MILITIA BUT THE FORMER. By FREEMEN I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Men of Property, or Persons that are able to live of themselves; and those who cannot subsist in this Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93516:12"/>
I call SERVANTS. The bare Explication of the Terms should, one would think, be sufficient to perswade any Man of Sense that the former should not only be sooner trusted with Arms than the latter; but that they must needs use 'em likewise to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For besides that all the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Nature has made common to both are improv'd in FREEMEN, the very Temper of their Bodies being much stronger and livelier by better feeding, which is no little Ingredient to Courage, they fight also for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property; whereas the other have nothing to lose but their Lives, which are likewise infinitely dearer to those whose Circumstances render 'em more agreeable and easy. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who understood the Art of War beyond all the World, did not make SOLDIERY a Refuge to Poverty and Idleness; for none but Men of Fortune and Property, whose private Interest firmly engag'd them to the Publick Good, had the Honour of serving in their Armies. Nay, so far were they from employing the poor and servile sort, that unless a Man was worth a certain Sum appointed by Law, he was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93516:13"/>
excluded from military Duties, which in that Government was thought no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable Privilege.

               <hi>MARIVS</hi> for example, did constantly make Levies of the poorer sort, putting Arms into the hands of those that had no stake to lose, and who for that Reason would be sure not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the Good of the Commonwealth, but only his Profit that employ'd them: nor will they be more faithful to the latter than to the Government when any other makes them a more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Offer. Now, all this is natural enough, and should not surprize any body: for the same Reason that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with the <hi>Rich</hi> to fight for that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whose excellent Constitution secures his Property to him, moves the <hi>Indigent</hi> to serve against it; and that is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93516:14"/>
to make both their Lives more easy; whence it may be concluded that Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens will always appear for Liberty, and Servants fight for Bread. 'Tis well known, that all the World over, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Sword is in the hands of the <hi>People,</hi> it is a free Government be it of one or of many; and on the contrary, all Tyrannies are supported by <hi>Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> nor is there any thing peculiar in our Soil, our Air, or in our Persons to hinder the same Circumstances from producing the like Effects. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be consider'd, that all Wars carri'd on by FREEMEN are suddenly finish'd, because, not being instigated by Want or the desire of Rapine, they are ever longing to return home to reap the Pleasure of their own Possessions, together with the agreeable Society of their Families, Relations, and Friends. But all Wars manag'd by MERCENA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES prove extremely tedious and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densom, for they never end till the Country that employs them be exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all its Treasure, which is their sole Motive of making Peace. It ought to be also remark'd, that a MILITIA of <hi>Freeholders</hi> is not only harder to be conquer'd than that of <hi>Servants</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93516:14"/>
but must be even superior to an Army wholly compos'd of <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> under an Arbitrary Monarch: for the latter, notwithstanding their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Privileges, are not absolutely Free, but retain'd on the behalf of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; whereas Men of Property being all disciplin'd (as we propose) and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms in their hands for the Defence of <hi>Liberty,</hi> upon which from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy they are taught to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to prefer it to all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (Life, Riches, and Honors without it being not only precarious, but of no other use except to prolong a miserable and infamous <hi>Slavery</hi>;) FREE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN, I say, thus train'd, excel all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Greatness of Soul and Courage: Nor are their haughty Spirits ever to be subdu'd, especially when they consider they are fighting for their own, and not otherwise employ'd for their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows than these are for them, their common Endeavours being to secure every Man's private Property. Such a Constitution, where all Persons are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually educated in Civil and Military Discipline, was never conquer'd by any Standing Armies, unless previously weaken'd by some intestine Divisions.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93516:15"/>
On the other hand, of two Free Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments 'tis possible indeed for the greatest to overcome the least; but then we find (to use the Words of a most observing Man) that the Walls and Towers of such a Government become its Funeral Piles, and that it expires in its own Flames, leaving nothing to the Conqueror but its Ashes; witness <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum</hi> when master'd by <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Numantia</hi> by <hi>Rome.</hi> I need not longer insist upon this Matter, and therefore shall remark in the last place, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any free Empire degenerated into Tyranny, as that of <hi>Rome</hi> is known to have done, then Men of Property were not enjoin'd or encourag'd to serve themselves, but either permitted to find others that would go out in their room, or to pay down so much ready Money; upon which occasion says one, speaking of the <hi>Romans,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Talesque sociantur armis, quales Domini habere fastidiunt. <hi>Vegetius l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93516:15"/>
time they resolv'd to continue arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But however the following Order was publish'd by GRATIAN, VA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENTINIAN, and THEODOSIUS: <note n="*" place="bottom">Inter optimas lectissimorum militum turmas, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem è numero servorum dandum esse decernimus, nevè ex Caupona ductum, vel ex famosarum ministris tabernarum, aut ex cocorum aut pistorum numero, vel etiam eo quem obsequii deformitas Militia secernit, nec tracta de Ergastulis nomina. <hi>Cod.

               <hi>We decree,</hi> say they, <hi>that in our best Troops there be no Slave enroll'd, nor any Servants out of Houses of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor any from Places of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous resort, nor out of Eating-houses, the Houses of Correction, or other such infamous Fellows.</hi> Yet we are so far from observing this Rule of listing FREEMEN only, that in the, <note n="†" place="bottom">14 Car. 2. §. 25.</note> Act now in force for regulating our MILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIA, no Man is oblig'd to serve in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but may send whom he pleases to appear for him, tho never so poor and weak, or ignorant of the use of Arms, and all other Arts.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus far have I discours'd of the Persons who are to constitute our MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITIA, and now I come to the Method of <hi>training</hi> them; after which I shall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93516:16"/>
orderly proceed to their Number, Charge, Age, and other necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations. My Second Proposition therefore is, THAT ONE AFTERNOON EVERY WEEK THERE BE A PAROCHIAL EXERCISE OF ALL MALES, AS WELL SERVANTS AS FREEMEN, FROM 16 TO 40 YEARS OF AGE. Whether this be done on Mondays, or Thursdays, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays, is indifferent; and I must not forget that the <hi>Switzers</hi> think no Day so proper for it as SUNDAY, from the following Reasons, <hi>viz.</hi> First, because no other Business is interrupted by the Exercise propos'd, all Labor being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prohibited on that Day; so that Servants and their Masters have equal Leisure, none are hinder'd from going to Fairs or Markets, nor any Meetings or Bargains interrupted. Secondly, There needs not a more frequent repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Parochial Exercise, no Mercenary Souldiers in the World (whatever is boasted of their Discipline) being train'd near so many Days in the Year, tho no Duty be perform'd in foul Weather. And thirdly, because after the Publick Service of GOD is over, People are thus restrain'd from idle Santring or immoral Courses, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93516:16"/>
as the <hi>Switzers</hi> think, in the next Work most becoming good Men, the publick service of their COUNTRY. But I prescribe no time, all that I aim at being to have as many Days in the Year appointed as will be sufficient, and also convenient. Every Saturday then, or Sunday in the Afternoon (for so I may suppose) all the Men of every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish are to assemble on some Green or Plain, it may be where the <hi>Buts</hi> were of old, and instead of Tipling, Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other Diversions equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to their Minds and Bodies, they learn the use of Arms; wherein, as we see by Experience, they will be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the very Children, who by that time their Age obliges them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the same place, will be superior to their Fathers, and need so little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, that they cannot be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from acquiring this Art. To this publick Meeting will all the superan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated and experienc'd Men, all the marri'd and single Women resort, and create in those that are to exercise a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Emulation of excelling one another in Agility or Skill, as every one is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to merit the Affection or Applause of the Spectators. This weekly Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93516:17"/>
will not only be to all People a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastime, and relaxation from their ordinary Labor or Busness, but also great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influence their very Constitutions, by rendring them more robust, nimble, healthy, and accustom'd to all manner of Fatigue. When 'tis once settl'd, we can easily imagin how it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated: But to effect the former, we have now a happy Occasion put into our hands of rewarding no small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those Persons who have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in our Service abroad these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Years past: For let all the <hi>Serjeants</hi> of the disbanded Army, and, if their Number be not sufficient, several of the <hi>Corporals</hi> or other expert Souldiers, be distributed one a piece over all the Parishes of <hi>England,</hi> and enjoy half Pay, or what the <hi>Parliament</hi> shall judg more convenient for one Year; during which time they shall be oblig'd to discipline the People on the Days and Place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And for their further Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, let it be provided also that they may have free Licence to follow what lawful Callings they please in that Country or Town during their Lives. Thus King CHARLES the First, when he was in the good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93516:17"/>
of issuing out a Proclamation <note n="*" place="bottom">Rushworth<hi>'s Collect. Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 197.</note> 
               <hi>to instruct and exercise the Train'd Bands, as well Officers as Soldiers, by Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd in Military Exercises,</hi> order'd <hi>that divers Low-Country Soldiers should be assign'd to the several Counties for this end.</hi> But how this good Design was put in execution every one knows; nor are we more ignorant how the MILITIA was render'd useless under his Successor, when it was enacted that single Companies should be exercis'd but <note n="†" place="bottom">14 Car. 2. §. 21.</note> four times a Year; and this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise not to continue above two Days at a time, whereby they were likely to prove glorious Soldiers. Now, it is plain that all the People of <hi>England</hi> may be <hi>parochially</hi> exercis'd in the Use of Arms one Afternoon in every Week throughout the Year (unless prevented by bad Weather) without any Expence but the pay of one Man for the first Year only; and without any trouble at all, but on the contrary, to the great Satisfaction and Recreation of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Here it may be objected, that this second Proposition of Exercising all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93516:18"/>
without any distinction, seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the first, which ordains that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men of Property be of the MILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIA. To this I answer, that there is a vast difference between training all to Arms, and having every body of the Army. I am still of the same Opinion, that none but FREEMEN be of the MILITIA; and yet I am for training the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Servants.</hi> First, there's no trouble in doing it, they being to appear with their Landlords or Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and tho they belong not to the Number of the Companies, yet they may well be exercis'd in them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any danger in it, seeing their Arms are only deliver'd to them on those publick Days by the <hi>Overseers</hi> in whose custody they are all the Week; for I suppose a little <hi>Armory</hi> in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. Besides, the FREEMEN are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways arm'd themselves, and ready to suppress the others upon the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Disorder. Thus every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Kingdom becomes a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; for tho a Servant changes his County, his Master, his Work, or Treatment, yet wherever he comes there he's train'd, and has no exemtion from Exercise. The Design of this is three-fold;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93516:18"/>
First, because when the POOR and SERVANTS become FREEMEN themselves (as, thanks to our <hi>Liberty,</hi> it happens every day) they may not be ignorant of Military Duties. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That if the Nation is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to send part of their MILITIA upon any Foreign Expedition, their <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers</hi> may not be raw undisciplin'd Fellows, but ready train'd to their hands; nor any thing wanting but to appoint 'em Officers, and to distribute 'em into Regiments. Thirdly, Upon any sudden Invasion from abroad, or in case of some Domestick Insurrection, they may be added as AUXILIARIES to the MILITIA (by which name I shall always design them hereafter) and be appointed either to serve in the Field, or to keep in Garisons, as shall be judg'd most expedient in such Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. The <hi>Romans</hi> made use of 'em upon all these Occasions, and call'd 'em <note n="*" place="bottom">Subitarii Milites, exercitus tumultuarius.</note> 
               <hi>Subitaneous Souldiers,</hi> or a <hi>Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Army,</hi> from the sudden and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary manner or cause of raising them. The <hi>Parochial Assemblies</hi> to treat of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or Military Affairs, are answerable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93516:19"/>
to the COMITIA CURIATA of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Rome</hi>; and, by the way, seeing some Parishes may be very thinly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, let every such be join'd to the nearest, and both be reputed as one.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Having thus laid the Foundation of all <hi>Discipline</hi> in the Parishes, my Third Proposition is, THAT THE FORCES OF EVERY HUNDRED ASSEMBLE AT THE CAPITAL THEREOF FOUR TIMES A YEAR, BOTH FOR PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICK EXERCISE, AND TO DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PUTE GAMES AND PRIZES. These Meetings answer in some sort the COMITIA CENTURIATA of the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherefore I shall make bold to call them <hi>Centuriate Assemblies</hi>; for our <hi>Hundred, Cantred,</hi> or <hi>Wapentake,</hi> is term'd <hi>Centuria</hi> by the politest Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that wrote of our Affairs in Latin. It is then easily understood, that in those <hi>Centuriate Assemblies</hi> the People meet not to learn the bare handling of their Weapons, that being already perform'd in the <hi>Parochial Exercises</hi>; but to shew their Experience, and the Progress, they have made at home. Here also they are form'd into, greater Bodies, and taught all that is peculiar to such, or different from their Duty in single Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.
<pb facs="tcp:93516:19"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:93516:20"/>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93516:20"/>
As for the <hi>Games</hi> and <hi>Prizes,</hi> all wise Nations have instituted the like, sometimes for promoting of Trade, or only for breeding good Horses; but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to educate their People in the love and practice of Arms, or other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises tending to fit and dispose 'em to a Martial Genius, such as Racing, Fencing, Wrestling, throwing the Bar, or the like; of which you may find various Examples in the Governments of Antient <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Let the <hi>Prizes</hi> in themselves be never so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, yet once that Honor and Reputation are annex'd to them, Men will as eagerly contend for 'em, as if they were the highest Lucre in the World. It has been observ'd in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that nothing is so effectual to make one undertake or quit any Enterprize, as the <hi>Commendation</hi> or <hi>Disgrace</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; yet these have fail'd sometimes, but a prospect of <hi>Gain</hi> seldom or never. Now our PRIZES are not without their Profit, as well as Use and Delight; for, besides the real Value of what is got, the Winner likewise stands fairest for Preferment, where Places are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd according to Merit. As for the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93516:21"/>
Charge of those GAMES it may be made very easy, an Annual Revenue being establish'd for that purpose. 'Tis so much the Interest of the <hi>Hundreds</hi> to concur in it, that rather than it should not be done, the Capital Town, where the Meeting is to be, will gladly raise the Sum in consideration of the brisk Trade it must occasion at those times: But all such Expences ought to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the Inhabitants according to their real or personal Estates. And they'l contribute to no Tax, tho never so necessary, so willingly as to this; because in the first place it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd, as the best part of some other Revenues, on Men of no Merit: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because it is not carri'd out of the Country: And thirdly, because e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man has his lucky Hit for the PRIZE to fall to his own share. Now, 'tis all one wherein the PRIZE consists, whether it be a Silver Chain, a Medal, or any sort of Plate; for the Disputes in other Places were not less eager to obtain Garlands of Oak or Laurel. But the most proper, in my Opinion, are some good and beautiful <hi>Arms</hi>; for the Conqueror, and his Heir after him,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93516:21"/>
will be as loth to part with them in Fight, as proud of wearing them in time of Peace. And this is indisputably more natural, and will prove far more effectual than the Policy of JULIUS CESAR, who us'd to adorn the Arms of his Men with Gold, Silver, and Gems, that they might the less tamely quit such precious things to the Enemy. There must be also a proportionable difference between the PRIZES, the same nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Kind nor Value belonging to the Horse and Foot, or to him that hits the Mark in shooting, and to another that wins at some other Game; for I would have them of all useful sorts, and a Field-piece likewise in every <hi>Hundred</hi> to breed expert Gunners, with Magazines of Powder, Bullets, and all other requisite Ammunition in every <hi>County.</hi> Lastly, I would have it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd that he who at these GAMES has got one PRIZE, should not be permitted to stand for any other at that time; and that the Names of all the Winners be carefully register'd, as well out of regard to the Reputation of particular Persons, as that the Publick may know where to find able Men in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93516:22"/>
time of need. What a Change this Institution will beget in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; what Trade it will occasion in the Country; and what Emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Inhabitants of every <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> (to speak nothing of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Design) can scarcely be imagin'd by such as have never experienc'd any thing like it; and yet there's nothing new or notional in all this, the same having been successfully practis'd either wholly or partly in many other Places of the World. I shall add no more of the <hi>Hundreds,</hi> but that every <hi>City</hi> being a County of it self, and other populous <hi>Corporations,</hi> may hold their <hi>Centuriate Assemblies</hi> within their own Precincts, and be not oblig'd to any Exercise abroad, except the <hi>Annual Encampment,</hi> whereof I am now going to treat.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Tho it be of the highest Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to have all Persons in our Nation <hi>parochially</hi> exercis'd, and accustom'd in the <hi>Hundreds</hi> to muster in larger Bodies; yet they may be still ignorant of the Discipline of a compleat <hi>Army,</hi> to which all they have hitherto done is only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient, as we first learn the Names of the Letters, and then to join them into
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93516:22"/>
Syllables, in order to read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a Book. My Fourth Proposition is therefore, THAT <hi>ENGLAND</hi> BE DIVIDED INTO THREE E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAL DISTRICTS, CALL'D THE NORTHERN, MIDDLE, AND WES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERN CLASSES; AND THAT THE STANDING MILITIA OF THE WHOLE CONSISTING OF SIXTY THOUSAND MEN, TWEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY THOUSAND THEREOF DO ANNUALLY ENCAMP FOR THE SPACE OF THREE WEEKS IN SOME ONE OF THE CLASSES; AND SO TO SUCCEED BY TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENNIAL ROTATION, WHICH RULE IS ALSO TO BE OBSERV'D IN THE COUNTIES PROPORTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONABLY. This military Division of the whole Kingdom may be as easily imagin'd or perform'd, as the Circuits appointed for distributing of Justice. Nor is there any Difficulty in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the <hi>Triennial Rotation</hi>; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for example, that in the Month of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1698, the twenty thousand Men, which is the Portion of the Wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern <hi>Class,</hi> encamp somewhere in <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> those of the middle <hi>Class</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:93516:23"/>
1699, at any Place in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> and those of the Northern <hi>Class</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1700, in some part of <hi>Yorkshire:</hi> Then you return again in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1701, to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,</hi> the Year after to <hi>Surrey,</hi> the sixth Year to <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and so perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually round. The <hi>Rotation</hi> in the <hi>Counties,</hi> or changing the Place of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment, is grounded upon the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Equity; for if the CAMP proves a Trouble (as 'tis impossible it should) to the County where it is, then Justice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that all should bear their share of it: And if on the contrary it be highly profitable by the vast Trade it must oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion in the Consumption of Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or otherwise; and considering too that ready Money will be paid for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, then 'tis as reasonable that all should enjoy the Benefit in their turns. As for the Order to be observ'd, to take away all occasions of Dispute, there needs no more but to cast Lots at the beginning in every <hi>Class,</hi> to know what County shall be the first, second, third, and so on. But if an Objection should be rais'd by any against the Number of the <hi>Classes,</hi> from the Largeness of their Bounds, and consequently the great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93516:23"/>
Distance in many Parts from the Place of Encampment; I answer, that 'tis not the precise Number, but the Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution for which I contend: for the Kingdom may as well be divided into six <hi>Classes,</hi> each containing 10000 of the MILITIA, and annual CAMPS in any two of 'em at a time. Thus still the <hi>Triennial Rotation</hi> remains the same, and we have every Year 20000 Men (besides the <hi>London-Militia</hi>) encamp'd somewhere in the Kingdom, to the great Terror of all our Enemies, and to our own unspeakable Advantage and Reputation; we have an Army of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand FREEMEN to defend the whole Nation, and yet every part of it always provided with a sufficient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, either absolutely to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to stop any Enemy till our whole Forces draw together. But then this wheeling Number of sixty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand is very inconsiderable, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of many thousand FREEMEN more, that are always ready to relieve, to repair, to succeed, or to join them upon occasion; to speak nothing of those <hi>exempted from Duty,</hi> nor of the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>servile</hi>; all which Orders of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93516:24"/>
Men are not only well disciplin'd, but oblig'd also to serve upon uncommon Emergencies. But to return to our CAMP, there our MILITIA learns the highest Perfection of Discipline, and is taught to make regular Sieges and Attacks in all Forms, to storm Castles, to fight Battles, to gain advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Posts, to make honorable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, to intrench themselves, to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, decamp, and, in one word, to perform all the other Duties of an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> Now, besides the Necessity and Usefulness of all these Exercises, they will be extraordinary entertaining too. The whole Country round will come to divert themselves in this Place, and pass that Season the most agreeably of all the Year. It would be a superfluous Labor to spend more Words in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this part of our MODEL; and so I come to make one Remark concerning the Expences, after taking notice that the yearly general Exercise, prescrib'd by the Act for regulating our MILITIA, yet in force, is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue but only the space of <note n="*" place="bottom">14 Car. 2. cap. 3. §. 21.</note> four Days.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93516:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The <hi>Assessments</hi> laid by this same Act are so grievous as well as useless, that a long Experience, and the general Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry against them, spare me the pains of shewing their Defects; nor will I for the same Reasons make any stop at the Abuse of calling People so often from their Business, for no other end but to fill the <hi>Muster-master's</hi> Pockets; neither will I insist upon the intolerable Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of <hi>Trophy-money</hi>; all those things, as I said before, being so universally known, that every body can prescribe a proper Remedy. I propos'd three Weeks (and I still think it time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) for the <hi>Annual Encampment, viz.</hi> a Fortnight for actual Service, and the other eight days, upon the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of three <hi>Classes,</hi> for coming and going; and fewer will do, if the <hi>Classes</hi> be six in Number. But suppose another Week be added, then 'tis plain that the Charge of a hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men during one Month, is no more than the Pay of ten Thousand for a Year; whence every body may infer how much cheaper we may entertain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thousand FREEMEN for a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night or three Weeks, than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93516:25"/>
MERCENARIES for a Twelve-month, making all reasonable Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Difference of their Pay. The Expence in our MODEL then is both laid out to much better purpose, and made a great deal easier than any of this nature heretofore. Nay the very <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> should recommend it self to all Mens Approbation, seeing it comes with respect to the <hi>Charge</hi> but every third Year to the turn of each <hi>County,</hi> and as to the <hi>Duty</hi> much seldomer to particular Persons; whereas the <hi>Rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> was monthly, and took in the whole People in a Year: They had 24000 Men under Arms every Month, and I don't propose twenty thousand for one Month in twelve. But the <hi>Iewish</hi> MILITIA kept Guards and Garisons too; <hi>Now the Children of</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>after their Names,</hi> (says the Author of the first Book of their Chronicles) <hi>the chief Fathers, and the Captains of Thousands and Hundreds, and their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that serv'd the King in any Matter of the Courses, which came in and went out Month by Month throughout all the Months of the Year, of every Course w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

So far of the Persons qualified to serve in the MILITIA, and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of <hi>training</hi> them: Now we shall speak of their AGE; for altho this Particular is generally neglected in <hi>Mercenary</hi> Armies, yet it has been ever carefully consider'd in all <hi>free</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: because the Design of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to render the People happy, they impartially assign Labor and Ease to those Periods of Life to which they are most sutable.

when their Country was in danger, and by their Valor and Experience did often save it from Destruction.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93516:27"/>
seldom punctually paid, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily have recourse to Stealing, Robbing, Plundring, Assassinating, and the like flagitious Practices; and what's still worse, the <hi>Arbitrary Princes</hi> who maintain them, must e'en let them live upon their shifts, by countenancing or conniving at these Disorders: for there's no Remedy unless they be duly paid, which is never done except in Free Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, such as ours and <hi>Holland.</hi> But in a well-regulated MILITIA Gentlemen make their Discipline to be properly an Exercise or Diversion in time of Peace; and in War they fight not only to preserve their own Liberty and Fortunes, but also to become the best Men in their Country. Nor are they any thing influenc'd by that PAY which the Government justly allows them: for as they who sit quietly at home should bear their Charges who serve 'em abroad, and not let those be Losers in their private Affairs, whose Valour provides Security to theirs; so on the other hand, when it becomes their turn who are now employ'd to keep at home, they will as cheerfully contribute to maintain those who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

'em abroad, as they receiv'd their PAY before. There is no Weight at all then in the Objection, especially since no time is lost to Young or Old: and that there is none is very evident, for no body will say that either Gentlemen or Artizans lose any time in the <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Exercises</hi>; all People allow more time upon their Pleasures every Year than is spent in the <hi>Centuriate Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi>; and their turn in the CAMP re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns so seldom as to admit of nothing to be said against it. After all, if <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> will be at the pains of fighting for their own, (and who can doubt but they will?)

            <p n="11">11. The AGE of the Persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting our MILITIA being thus determin'd, we proceed next to their COMMANDERS, who make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Sixth Proposition, which is, THAT ALL THE COMMISSION'D OFFICERS OF THE MILITIA HAVE REAL OR PERSONAL E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STATES PROPORTIONABLE TO THEIR SEVERAL DEGREES; AND
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93516:28"/>
THAT ALL PERSONS THUS RIGHTLY QUALIFI'D IN EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY COUNTY SUCCEED ONE A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOTHER BY TRIENNIAL RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATION, THE LORDS LIEUTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANTS ONLY EXCEPTED, WHO, BEING GENERAL OFFICERS, ARE NOT TO BE CHANG'D WHILE THE KING IS PLEAS'D TO CONTINUE 'EM IN THEIR POSTS. The Reasons for qualifying the OFFICERS by their <hi>Property</hi> are the same with those I have offer'd under the first Proposition for admitting FREEMEN only to serve in the MILITIA, which spares me the Labour of Repetition in this place. As for the <hi>Rotation</hi> of <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> propos'd, it is grounded upon uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested Experience and Equity. All good Politicians have ever allow'd that to be the best and noblest Government where Men learn alternately to <hi>command</hi> and to <hi>obey</hi>; because at this rate they are not only fitted to serve their Country upon all occasions, but likewise made compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of the Merit or Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of others. This was the known Practice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose <hi>General Officers</hi> were, in the ordinary Course of

               <pb facs="tcp:93516:29"/>

their Government, annually elected, no body thinking it a Disgrace to serve under him this Year, whom he had commanded the last, nor to be afterwards an inferior Officer in that Army whose Exploits were the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Conduct before. And truly this sort of <hi>Rotation</hi> seems to me a Duty requir'd by the Light of Nature: for keeping an equal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance between those of the same Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications contributes above all things to keep 'em in Peace and Friendship. If the <hi>Offices</hi> shall be thought hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, pleasant, or profitable, no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy envies another, because they are all to enjoy 'em in their turns: And if on the other hand they should be found a Charge or Trouble, then doubtless every one ought to bear his share of the Burden; nor is it at all material, whether they be elected by LOT, or successively appointed by the KING. The PEERS, who are commonly the Lords Lieutenants of Counties, are by this <hi>Model</hi> restor'd to all the Privileges that were truly good and excellent in their first Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the immediate Command of

all the FREEMEN in <hi>England</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the KING being their proper Charge; and the eternal Fame which some of their Ancestors have worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquir'd, is wholly owing to the glorious Actions they perform'd in this Quality on the behalf of their Country; and not in the least to that immoderate Power they might then exercise over the PEOPLE, who, if they record any <hi>Nobleman</hi> upon this account, do it as an Example they execrate and abhor, and not out of Gratitude or Love, as in the former case. To the only Objection I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend against this Proposition, which is, that it seems to limit his <hi>Majesty's</hi> Authority, I answer, That no Man can trust him with a greater Power of doing Good (for he would neither accept nor use any other) than I am willing to do; seeing in the Opinion I entertain of his Justice, Valor, and Wisdom, I believe my self not inferior to any: which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ought to be esteem'd the more sincere, inasmuch as I never had nor expect any particular Favor from him besides <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:93516:30"/>
the common Blessings of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He knows already that all the <hi>Power</hi> he has is bounded by Laws, and we are convinc'd by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that he refuses no Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it when he judges it to be for the Advantage of the Nation. Thus have the Act for <hi>Triennial Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> and that of <hi>regulating Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in cases of High Treason</hi> (to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more) past by his Authority; whereas no Prince that design'd to injure his Subjects, would ever give his Assent to either of them. A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Sagacity and Prudence will not easily be deluded by the mean Obsequiousness of any MINISTERS, who make their Court with gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they take to be their Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's <hi>Inclinations</hi>; and, without any regard to his or the Nation's real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, lay out all their Efforts to gain him some <hi>invidious Point:</hi> for it is a setl'd Maxim with most of this Race, That ALL KINGS WHATSOEVER WOULD BE ABSOLUTE; presuming on which pernicious Doctrine they bring a certain Ruin on the Affairs of <hi>Princes,</hi> if not happily prevented by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93516:31"/>
their own timely Fall, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens in <hi>Free Governments.</hi> But a good KING, instead of lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Power by Concessions of this nature, gains more Security, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and Glory, than could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the most numerous <hi>Armies.</hi> I cannot upon this occasion but relate the remarkable Story of THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POMPUS King of <hi>Sparta, who,</hi> as VALERIUS MAXIMUS <note n="*" place="bottom">Cum primus instituisset (Theopompus Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanorum Rex) ut Ephori Lacedaemone crearentur, ita futuri Regiae potestati oppositi quemadmodum Romae Consulari Imperio Tribuni plebis sunt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti; atque illi uxor dixisset, id egisse illum ut fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liis minorem potestatem relinqueret; Relinquam, inquit, sed diuturniorem.

I leave it indeed less,</hi> answer'd he, <hi>but more lasting. And this,</hi> adds our Author, <hi>was excellently said; for that Power only is safe, which is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited from doing Hurt.</hi> THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POMPUS <hi>therefore,</hi> continues he, <hi>by confining the Kingly Power within the Bounds of the Laws, did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it by so much to the People's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as he remov'd it from being Arbitrary.</hi> But, lest I might seem to digress, I demand, What Power is taken out of the KING'S hand by our Proposition? For in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Militia</hi> the Colonels, Majors, Captains, and other Officers are to be appointed by the <note n="*" place="bottom">14 Car. 2. cap. 3. §. 2.</note> Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and I would have 'em chosen by his <hi>Majesty</hi> himself, or whom he pleases to depute, but only <hi>qualify'd</hi> to serve their Prince and Country more effectually: Nor can the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination be any where more safely lodg'd than in the KING for his Life, provided the Act restrains it to Election under his <hi>Successors,</hi> who will enjoy all reasonable Power, since
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93516:32"/>
they may appoint or continue the General Officers at their pleasure. And, besides the foregoing Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, nothing can render his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Majesty</hi> more easy than this part of the <hi>Model,</hi> seeing that by it he has an admirable Opportunity of gratifying all Sides, and disobliging none; for if he should put any TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES in Commission, the WHIGS would presently cry, that he was committing himself solely into their Enemies Hands; and should the WHIGS be the only Persons intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the TORIES would justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still disaffected: Whereas on the foot of the <hi>Rotation</hi> propos'd he may fairly employ those of both Parties duly qualify'd to serve their Country. And indeed I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to affirm, that this impartial Distribution of <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi> is the only way possible to heal ours, or the Divisions of any other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: for such as are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Preferment,</hi> are most of 'em offended upon no other score; and they who are in possession of those <hi>Advantages</hi> will
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93516:32"/>
be always for retaining and engros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them, either by the Exclusion or absolute Ruin of their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But as in <hi>War</hi> the KING has equally protected all his Subjects, so I hope in <hi>Peace</hi> he'll abolish their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Distinctions,</hi> and render <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the Glory and Terror of the World.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93516:33"/>
What's amiss in this respect among our selves is more easily discover'd, than reform'd. I shall therefore at this time content my self with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a Remedy in what immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerns my Subject, and so the Seventh Proposition of this <hi>Scheme</hi> shall be, THAT ALL NOW UNDER THE AGE OF EIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEEN YEARS, OR THAT SHALL BE BORN HEREAFTER, BE IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAPABLE OF HOLDING ANY POST OF HONOR OR PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIT UNDER THE GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT (EXCEPTING IN THE PROFESSIONS OF DIVINITY, LAW, AND PHYSICK) UNLESS THEY FIRST QUALIFY THEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELVES BY SERVING TWO CAMPAIGNS BY LAND OR SEA. By this Proposition none al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready arriv'd to the complete Age of <hi>Manhood</hi> are excluded from bearing Offices; and they who are now full <hi>Eighteen,</hi> are only kept back till they are Twenty, before which time they could scarcely expect Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even as Matters now stand. I cannot therefore foresee that any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93516:33"/>
Opposition will be made to this part of the <hi>Model,</hi> seeing it neither affects them who are actually engag'd in Business, nor such as stand Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for Preferment: For the blame of being unqualifi'd, as propos'd, ought to be attributed to a Defect in our <hi>Constitution,</hi> and not to any want of <hi>Merit</hi> in particular Persons. The YOUTH themselves (if we can i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin 'em so basely dispos'd) are not in a Condition to obstruct it; and if it happens to pass, it becomes as familiar to those who shall be born hereafter as the other parts of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. There remain then no Adversaries in all probability, unless some People should envy the happy Effects of it to their <hi>Country,</hi> which we may better judg impossible than SOLON that no <hi>Parricide</hi> could be perpetrated in his Republick, which is the Reason that he ordain'd no Punishment for this horrid Crime. The most unthinking among us must perceive that no other Method can be so effectual to render our <hi>Country</hi> famous, and our <hi>Government</hi> last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When the <hi>Young Men</hi> (of all
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93516:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others the most ambitious of Glory and Honor) are once convinc'd that this is the only Road to Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will timely qualify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so all Posts will be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd with Persons of known Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Whoever has read the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding part of this Piece, cannot mistake my Sense about the <hi>Land-Campaigns</hi>; but as to the SEA, he that is two Summers aboard any Man of War in our ordinary Guards, or that goes twice in any Vessel into the <hi>Baltick, Mediterranean,</hi> or the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and once to any part of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> shall be deem'd right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualifi'd. It signifies nothing whether it be in War or Peace; for the principal Design is to acquaint 'em with the Nature of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice so important to our Island, and to give 'em an opportunity of seeing Forein Countries in order to put a true Value upon their own. When one that has thus past a part of his time is afterwards a Member of the House of <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Commons,</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> or <hi>Navy,</hi> he must needs speak more pertinently, and be less
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93516:34"/>
easily deceiv'd in the usual Disputes, whether any Miscarriage is occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by Treachery or Accident; he can discern the Guilt or Merit of the Seamen; he can judg of Victualling, Maning, or otherwise fitting out our Ships; and determin the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seasons for every Action far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than another that never was at Sea unless in a Ferry-boat to <hi>Calais</hi> or the <hi>Bril.</hi> We know likewise by the great Care the KING has taken to supply his Ships with able Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by what we may observe in the Accomplishments of several Persons who fail'd in them, that there is not a properer place of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most part of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> there being no doubt to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the particular Art of <hi>Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And to speak no more of the Marine (for to hint these things is enough) when <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are so long debar'd all their ordinary Land-Exercises, they have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent opportunity of studying <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy</hi> or <hi>Astronomy,</hi> and mastering the best part of Antient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>History:</hi> for they must read
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93516:35"/>
something in their own defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Idleness,</hi> the most painful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the World; and they may keep Books as conveniently in their Cabins, as in their Studies at home. After a considerable number are thus initiated at Sea, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by Land make the ordinary Tour of <hi>Holland, Germany, Italy,</hi> and <hi>France</hi>; and that several, perhaps, have travell'd both by Land and Sea, no Government in the World can be so well suppli'd with Learn'd, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, and able Men to fil all sorts of Stations. The <hi>Romans</hi> did after this manner educate their Children from their very Cradles in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory and Practice of those things wherein they were afterwards to make a glorious Figure in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Country. They, to whom the particular Inspection of the YOUTH was committed, were not Persons retir'd, and strangers to Business; but Men of nice Breeding, and that understood Mankind as well as the Liberal Arts and Sciences. They inform'd their Pupils (to whom they were rather Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93516:35"/>
than Masters) in the Duties of grown Age, before they arriv'd to it; and, having no Interest to keep 'em more ignorant than themselves, they did not waste their time by teaching 'em any barbarous Jargon, trifling Notions, or useless Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they must unlearn again if they would be understood, or not be counted ridiculous when they come abroad into the World. <hi>The Young Men,</hi> says <note n="*" place="bottom">Adolescentuli statim Castrensibus stipendiis imbuebantur, ut imperare parendo, duces agere dum sequuntur, assuescerent: Inde Honores petitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri assistebant curiae foribus, &amp; concilii publici spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatores, antequam consortes erant. <hi>Epist.</hi> 14. l. 8.</note> PLINY, <hi>were early accustom'd to Arms in the Field, that they might learn by obeying to command, and to act the part of a General while they follow'd one.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93516:36"/>
propos'd not so much to imitate, as to exceed them. Every Morning they went to their Levée, and thence accompani'd them to the FORUM and other publick Places, where they patiently bore Hunger, Thirst, and all manner of Fatigue, that they might attain to the highest pitch of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and be throughly vers'd in <hi>Civil Affairs.</hi> When the Business of the Day was over, they dutifully waited home upon their Patrons, and these again on their part took abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of care to improve the <hi>Youth.</hi> They were as cautious to give 'em any ill Examples in Words or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to their own Children. They entertain'd them with the greatest familiarity, and the general Subject of their Discourse was about fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Laws, and the several kinds of Government; in their own, they taught 'em wherein consisted the <note n="*" place="bottom">Quae Vis magistratibus, quae caeteris Libertas <hi>Id. ibid.</hi>

               <hi>Magistrates Power,</hi> and <hi>the Liberty of the People</hi>; they explain'd the Art of War, and read Divine Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93516:36"/>
concerning the Excellency of Vertue; never forgetting to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate upon every occasion the Love of their Country as the Foundation of all their future Actions at Home or Abroad: Nor did the Conversation want facetious and pleasant Intervals to make it easier to both sides. This was the true Source, not only of that unparallel'd Friendship, Valour, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Justice, Eloquence, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity wherein that bravest People of the Universe excel'd; but even the preeminence of their <hi>Historians</hi> above all the Modern proceeds from hence: For the <hi>Young Gentlemen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so intimately acquainted with the Actions of their <hi>Patrons,</hi> and writing down their remarkable Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or copying their most finish'd Compositions, they afterwards fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mention'd or quoted them; so that all the best and vertuous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples became commonly known. But of this Subject I shall speak more copiously in my BRUTUS, or THE HISTORY OF LIBERTY AND TYRANNY which I am now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting, with a Design, whenever

That the number of extraordinary Men is very small in our Age, we need not desire a clearer Demonstration than to find so few Histories tolerably pen'd; for 'tis want of Matter, and consequently of Encouragement, but not of Ability, which makes our Writers so much inferior to those of past times, when CICERO himself courts to be immortaliz'd by the

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93516:38"/>
treacherous Enemies, or else to AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIST our Friends and Allies. That such Occasions may frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, none will go about to deny; yet Multitudes (I'm afraid) will dislike the Methods I would have observ'd in the management of our <hi>Forein Wars.</hi> But my Assertions are not the less solid because some People are Cowards, and others now unaccustom'd to what their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors successfully practis'd hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Nor ought the rest of the <hi>Scheme,</hi> should any reject this part of it, be counted the more weak or inconsistent. So my Eigth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is, THAT THE MAIN BODY OF OUR ARMIES A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BROAD BE WHOLLY COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POS'D OF THE FREE MILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIA, THE ONE HALF TO BE ANNUALLY RELIEV'D BY SUC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSIVE LEVIES IN THE CLASSES; AND BE ALWAYS CORROBORATED WITH A SUF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICIENT NUMBER OF AUXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIARIES. We prov'd before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the First Proposition, that FREEMEN will fight better than
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93516:39"/>
SERVANTS, that all Wars carri'd on by the former are quickly finish'd, that wherever the Sword is in their Hands that Government is free, and that they are consequently disus'd or discourag'd from bearing Arms by such as design to set up a Tyrannical Power. Now, all these Reasons should prevail with us to send our MILITIA of <hi>Citizens</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad instead of <hi>Mercenaries.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> in point of War are the best Example, with respect to Success or Safety, that any Nation can imitate; and while they strictly adher'd to this Rule, they were both invincible themselves, and no People on Earth could resist the Force of their Arms: But when their Antient Orders were neglected or abolish'd, then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an easy Prey to all that invaded them. Thus the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations, tho infinitely superior in Numbers and Territories, yet by reason of their luxurious living, and that they plac'd their chief Strength in mighty Bodies of <hi>Mercenaries,</hi> they were quickly subdu'd by the MILITIA of <hi>Italy</hi>; nor would the Inhabitants
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93516:39"/>
of that Country perform less at this present time, were they under the same Discipline. The <hi>Gauls, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and <hi>Brittons</hi> were more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, it's true, than the <hi>Asiatic</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and better order'd (for they were a kind of MILITIA) but they were also finally subdu'd and broken by the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions. On the other hand, when the Sword was taken from the <hi>Citizens</hi> or <hi>Freemen,</hi> and put into the Hands of <hi>Servants</hi> by the Arbitrary Emperors who durst not trust Men of Property, the Oriental Countries not only shook off the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; but likewise the <hi>Lombards</hi> and <hi>Goths</hi> invaded <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> it self; and tho not exceeding the old <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> in Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or Conduct, yet they absolutely conquer'd the Conquerors of the World. In short, the <hi>Romans</hi> lost their LIBERTY and PROPER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, and with them all that ardent LOVE to their Country, which made them so freely bleed in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before. And indeed no Man of sense ever meant any other thing by that Inclination for one's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

so much celebrated in the Works of Orators and Poets, but only the good Government of it. <hi>Dimicare pro Aris &amp; Focis</hi> was a synonymous Expression in the mouth of a <hi>Roman,</hi> for <hi>pugnare pro Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria.</hi> Hence it is that BRUTUS reproaching CICERO for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Court he made to OCTAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US, speaks to him in these Terms; <note n="†" place="bottom">Videmur ergo tibi Salutem accepturi, cum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam acceperimus?

great distance from you that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be Slaves, and, wherever I may be free, there think my self in</hi> Rome. We likewise are taught to love our Country above all others, valuing our selves every moment upon being ENGLISH MEN; and that most deservedly, for we cannot speak too magnificently of our Felicity. But we never mean our Soil or Climate, seeing these are much excel'd by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others in the World; therefore it must be our Government that makes the Scale heavier on our side. A partial Affection to the Land where we first drew our Breath, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from other Considerations, is but a childish Prejudice, not less ridiculous than that of some elder Persons, who think it an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Blessing to be laid in the same Graves with their Relations. The <hi>Romans</hi> then were always possess'd with a hearty Kindness for their Country; and being earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of returning to it in Peace, as well as certain of receiving the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Applause due to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they perform'd Wonders abroad.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93516:41"/>
The Reason why no other People did as much is, because the Government of no other Place was so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted. Here was no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Citizen</hi> and the <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> between the <hi>Husbandman</hi> and the <hi>Soldier</hi>; whence the Minds of the Inhabitants were enlarg'd to that degree, that they became capable of designing and effecting every thing. Their KNOWLEDG and POLITE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS made them sensible of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their Constitution, which still encreas'd their Fondness of it, and render'd 'em so valiant to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it. Their City and Territory were divided into several TRIBES, not unlike our Counties, and their Assemblies call'd COMITIA TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUTA. Their People again were distributed into six <hi>Classes,</hi> besides the lesser Divisions of <hi>Centuries,</hi> and <hi>Curiae</hi> or <hi>Parishes.</hi> Now, their MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITIA going always abroad by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> out of the <hi>Tribes</hi> and <hi>Colonies,</hi> together not seldom with their <hi>Allies,</hi> whenever they were beaten (as in the dubious Events of War it must happen sometimes) they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

               <pb facs="tcp:93516:42"/>

repair'd; and so one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my constantly sent after another, which could not fail where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were all disciplin'd, till no Force whatsoever was able to stand before them. But when a <hi>Mercenary</hi> Army is once routed and dispers'd, then all is irrecoverably lost, because that either you cannot presently take the Field again, or you only oppose the Enemy with undisciplin'd Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. Now we may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive why a MILITIA of <hi>Freemen</hi> are for venturing a Battle whenever they are favor'd with an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing it, whereas MERCE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARIES are observ'd to decline fighting as much as they can; for, to speak nothing of what we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concerning their different Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, the first are sure of making good their Losses by a <hi>Rotation</hi> of their Fellows, and the latter wait for Advantages, because the Loss of one Battle is often enough to ruin them. From all that is premis'd, I think I may conclude, that to make succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Levies of our own FREE MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITIA out of the several Parts of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93516:43"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> and corroborated with some AUXILIARY REGIMENTS, is the best Method of waging the Wars abroad, whether we design to bring 'em to a speedy Period, or to spread wider the Terror of our Fame and Arms. The Names of all Persons capable of Military Duties in every County must be carefully registr'd to facilitate the <hi>Rotation,</hi> as was done in the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribes, where every Man was sworn (both in regard of the Charge and Service) to conceal neither the Name, Age, Condition, or Quality of any in his Family, that every one, who was able, might by his Purse or Person contribute to the Publick Good. The Regiments may likewise be denominated from the <hi>Countries</hi> or Places that send them, which will create an Emulation in the several Parts of the Kingdom to outdo each other's Actions. They will be as eager sometimes for regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Honor which one lost, as fearful to lose what the other won. Thus Men of ARTS and ARMS will be the very same Species among us, whereas now they are extremely
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93516:43"/>
different in most Parts of the World; for the former are generally <hi>Cowards,</hi> and the latter <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>rude.</hi> From all these Considerations, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perswaded that any Man of <hi>Property</hi> will refuse to go in his turn (which can seldom happen) on fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Service. If he hires a mean Person to supply his Place, this is raising a <hi>Mercenary Army,</hi> whereby he makes his <hi>Man</hi> become his <hi>Master.</hi> And how little soever FREEMEN think of the matter, while such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are out of the Kingdom, yet they'l find 'em wonderful trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som on their Return, should there be no other Difficulty but that single one of disbanding 'em. 'Tis strange what a Confusion very small Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of 'em produce in a Country, as has been abundantly demonstrated by the Ingenious Author of the unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable <hi>Argument against a Standing Army.</hi> The few Soldiers that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd in King CHARLES the First's time from an unsuccessful Voyage to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> were not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disbanded as they ought to have been, but quarter'd up and down in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93516:44"/>
several Parts of the Kingdom: And a Great Person, who was an Eye-witness tells us, <q>That these <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rushworth<hi>'s Collect.

The High-ways were dangerous, and the Markets unfrequented; they were a Terror to all, and undoing to many.</q> I said before, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Roman Freeman</hi> was oblig'd to bear Arms (if need were) twenty times from the seventeenth to the six and fortieth Year of his Age; that they were excus'd from Duty after fifty; and that in case of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Necessity the old Soldiers might be compel'd if they did not give in their Names when desir'd, but that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93516:44"/>
they did for the most part voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer their Service to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This whole matter, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other admirable Effects of their Discipline, is represented to the life in the Speech of a Farmer to LICI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIUS a <hi>Roman</hi> General.

But if I had not compleated the Number appointed by Law, nor were to be excus'd from Duty by reason of my Age; yet since in my own room I could give you, LICINI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US, four Soldiers, it were just I should be discharg'd.

any General judges me an able Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, I shall never excuse my self. What Post the Tribunes will assign me, lies in their own breasts.

            <p n="14">14. All Men would live some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where eternally if they could, and they affect to become Immortal even here on Earth. To have their Names perpetuated, was the true Spring of several great Mens Actions; and for that only end, have they patiently undergon all manner of Toil and Danger. But this Inclination never discovers it self so plainly, as in the care Men take of their Posterity. Some are content to live Beggers all their Days, that their Children after them may be rich: for they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these as their own Persons multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd by Propagation; whence such
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93516:49"/>
as had none themselves, adopted the Children of others to bear their Names. The Legislator of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> as well as he of <hi>Sparta,</hi> had a peculiar regard to this natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, which in no Country must be neglected for Reasons upon which I need not insist at this time: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ninth Proposition is, THAT NO MAN BE OBLIG'D TO GO UPON ANY FOREIGN EXPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DITION DURING ONE YEAR AFTER HIS MARRIAGE; NOR ALL THE SONS OF ANY MAN AT ONCE; NOR AN ONLY SON EVER, UNLESS HE'S WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LING HIMSELF. The Design of this Proposition is made so plain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that, without more to do, I may pass to the Tenth and last of our Scheme, which is, THAT ALL LEVIES PERMITTED TO FO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REIGN STATES IN THIS KINGDOM, OR ANY FORCES LENT TO THEM, DO ENTIRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY CONSIST OF AUXILIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES; AND THAT NO FREE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN HAVE LEAVE TO SERVE ABROAD UNLESS AS A VOLUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIER

TO QUALIFY HIMSELF FOR IMPLOIMENT AT HOME. The Reasonableness of this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is likewise so evident from what went before, that it wants no larger Commentary. I could add here se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Particulars, but they'l come to be establish'd of course, if this SCHEME prevails wholly, or for the best part. I shall therefore write nothing now concerning the Methods of Listing or Disbanding, of Paying or Clothing, nor of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or Punishments; tho with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the last, I cannot omit one pleasant Passage: for the <hi>Romans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong divers kinds of Penalties, such as Fine or Imprisonment, us'd upon certain Occasions to <note n="*" place="bottom">Fuit haec quoque antiquitus militaris animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versio, jubere ignominiae causa militi venam solvi et sanguinem dimitti;—ut non tam poena quam me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina videretur. <hi>A.

If this <hi>Scheme of Reforming the</hi> MILITIA be so intelligible and coherent, as I flatter my self it may, it would be a superfluous Labor, and no Complement upon the Reader's Sagacity, to remark distinctly all the good Effects and Consequences of it. Yet one I find convenient to mention, not that I think it less ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious than the rest, for it appears most evident at first sight; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some Gentlemen are pleas'd to oppose it, and it is that I am for ARMING ALL THE PEOPLE. Now this is, in my Opinion, so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and necessary, that, should we obtain nothing, besides, it were well worth our while to procure an Act for this alone: For what can better demonstrate the Confidence his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty places in the unquestionable Affection of his Subjects, or more encrease and confirm the Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on these have for him, than that he puts 'em in a Condition of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves against all his and their Enemies, without needing or expecting the Assistance of others? But notwithstanding I took all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93516:50"/>
care to be duly inform'd, I could never hear any weighty Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection made to this Proposition, tho two are commonly offer'd, and the first of 'em is, that there will be no end of <hi>Robberies,</hi> and <hi>House-breakings</hi> in the Country, if the common People be once arm'd. I perceive these Gentlemen design to be <hi>popular,</hi> and the Vulgar are huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblig'd to 'em for their good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But supposing the worst, <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries</hi> will be so far from being more frequent than at this time, that this is the only right Method of totally suppressing all such Disorders. It is an ordinary thing for two or three Fellows to commit a <hi>Robbery</hi> in sight of twenty People, stronger and stouter than themselves, but that are either without Arms, or know not how to use 'em; whereas, upon the foot of our MODEL, when any House or Persons are known to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd, they are not only provided for their own Defence, but the Neighbours are all ready to come in to their Assistance, both with Arms in their hands, and as able to handle
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93516:51"/>
'em as <hi>House-breakers</hi> can be suppos'd to do. But if the objecting Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have any meaning, it is that <hi>Rogues</hi> only should have Arms, and honest Men none to oppose them: For when any are dispos'd to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Laws, they always take care to arm themselves without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deference to Publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor do we find that Thieves ever want Weapons, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Prohibitions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, which they no more regard than they do those which forbid 'em to steal. But good Men, on the contrary, will yield Obedience to the Laws; and so be expos'd, if thus left naked and unarm'd, to the Insults and Assaults of the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd Villains. The next Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, That if the People be arm'd, there's an end of all the GAME in the Kingdom. Now supposing this were true, I think of the two we should sooner expose a few Birds to the People, than the People to the French or other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But indeed the GAME is in no danger. Deer, for example,
<pb facs="tcp:93516:51"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:93516:52"/>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:93516:52"/>
might be destroy'd with Bows and Arrows, no less than with Guns; yet in old times Englishmen were not disarm'd, but restrain'd from shooting Deer only by Laws, which may be accommodated to Guns as well as to Bows. Hare, Partridg and Pheasant are the principal GAME for Gentlemens diversion; and every one knows that these are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently and frequently destroy'd by Nets, Hounds, Setting-dogs, and other Methods, than by shooting. Severe Penalties, which those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd will be sure to see inflicted, will prevent any thing of this nature; and I hope we'l never see the Nation disarm'd a second time, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of preserving the GAME. But, perhaps, it will be said, that altho FREEMEN may be trusted with Arms, there will be danger from the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Servile.</hi> This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was sufficiently answer'd in the Discourse subjoin'd to the Second Proposition; and besides I may add, if that will satisfy, that <hi>Servants</hi> are not arm'd according to this Scheme, but only disciplin'd against a time of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93516:53"/>
Necessity. I suppos'd before an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> in every Parish, out of which on the days of Exercise only the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> are furnish'd. And here I would not forget to hint that all such Arms provided at the Parochial Charge should be try'd and approv'd at the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> without any Liberty lest to the Overseers to purchase others for this end, and that they be likewise all distinguish'd by the Parish Mark. I had several Opportunities in this Discourse to shew the Defects of the Act now in force for regulating the MILITIA, and my last Remark upon it shall be, that the <hi>Isles of Wight</hi> and <hi>Purbeck</hi> are left to <note n="*" place="bottom">14 Car. 2. cap. 3. § 22, 30, 31.</note> train their People as formerly. The <hi>Tower-Hamlets</hi> likewise <hi>having been always</hi> (as 'tis said in the Act) <hi>under the Command of his Majesty's Constable or Lieutenant of the Tower for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Preservation of that Fort,</hi> are permitted to be disciplin'd in such manner and form as heretofore.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93516:53"/>
The Reason of this Clause is very plain; for those two Islands lying so much expos'd to forein Invasions, it was fit they should be extraordinarily well provided for Defence. And so the <hi>Tower-Hamlets,</hi> because they were to keep Guard in the Tower, and might from thence distress the City, tho, lest they might not prove so unkind to their Neighbours, they were neglected as the rest, and exercis'd according to the Act: but the other Parts of the Kingdom being most likely to disrelish the Measures of the COURT, were industrious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uncapable of Resistance. And that this Suspicion may not seem ill grounded or malicious, I would fain know which was the best Model of training the MILITIA, the New or the Old? if the former, why should the Benefit of it be deny'd to those Places that stood most in need of it? and if the latter, why ought not the whole Nation to be as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently train'd as one or two Islands? But all Persons own that <hi>Guernsey</hi> and <hi>Iersey, Wight</hi> and <hi>Purbeck,</hi> are equal
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93516:54"/>
in their Discipline to any Standing Forces. But of this enough; nor can I allow my self to question but all Parties will now unanimously join to render the MILITIA useful for the King's and our common Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for that a <hi>Standing Army</hi> or a <hi>Militia</hi> is of absolute Necessity, is agreed on every side; but the <hi>Army</hi> is order'd to be disbanded, and should those who were for continuing it now oppose the regulating of the <hi>Militia,</hi> they give us a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that either they never thought us in so great Danger as they pretended, or that they would have us entirely lost, because we refus'd to be sav'd after their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, tho our own be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and less expensive. I should now conclude, seeing no Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remains against <hi>arming the whole Free People of</hi> England; but I must first take notice, that our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors in <hi>Germany</hi> did in the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire practise the very same thing, and that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways came arm'd to their Publick
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93516:54"/>
Assemblies. <note n="‖" place="margin">Nihil autem neque publicae neque privatae rei, nisi armati agunt.

               <hi>The Germans transact no publick or private Affairs,</hi> says <hi>TA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CITVS, but under their Arms; yet is it not usual for any to carry Arms till the Community first allows him to be capable. Then some principal Person in the Assembly, or the young Man's own Father, or one of his Relations, gives him a Shield and Spear. This is their Ceremony of declaring them to be of Age, and this is the first Honor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd on Youth.
