            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Lastly, the Soule were better so to be</l>
               <l>Borne slave to sin, then not to be at all,</l>
               <l>Since (if she do beleeve) one sets her free,</l>
               <l>That makes her mount the higher from her fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet this the curious wits will not content,</l>
               <l>They yet will know (since God foresaw this ill)</l>
               <l>Why his high providence did not prevent</l>
               <l>The declination of the first mans will.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>If by his word he had the current stayd,</l>
               <l>Of Adams will, which was by nature free,</l>
               <l>It had been one, as if his word had sayd,</l>
               <l>I will henceforth that man no man shall be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For what is man without a moving mind,</l>
               <l>Which hath a judging wit, and choosing will?</l>
               <l>Now, if Gods power should her election bind,</l>
               <l>Her motions then would cease, and stand all still.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And why did God in man this Soule infuse,</l>
               <l>But that he should his maker know and love?</l>
               <l>Now if love be compel'd, and cannot chuse,</l>
               <l>How can it gratefull, or thank-worthy prove?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Love must free-hearted be, and voluntary,</l>
               <l>And not enchaunted, or by fate constrained;</l>
               <l>Not like that love which did Ulysses carry</l>
               <l>To Circes Isle, with mighty charmes enchained,</l>

               <l>Besides, were we unchangeable in will,</l>

               <l>Equall to God, whose wisedome shineth still,</l>
               <l>And never erres, we might our selves esteem.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So that if man would be unvariable,</l>
               <l>He must be God, or like a Rock, or Tree;</l>
               <l>For even the perfect Angels were not stable,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>God first made Angels bodilesse pure minds,</l>

               <l>Then this desire of Nature is not vaine,</l>

               <l>And doubt if Soules immortall be or no;</l>
               <l>That doubt their immortality doth prove,</l>

               <l>Now if himselfe were but a mortall thing,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>For when we judge, our minds we mirrours make;</l>

               <l>They should the name of reasonable bear;</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Take heed of over-weening, and compare</l>
               <l>Thy Peacocks feet with thy gay Peacocks train,</l>
               <l>Study the best, and highest things that are,</l>
               <l>But of thy self an humble thought retain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Cast down thy selfe, and only strive to raise</l>
               <l>The glory of thy Makers sacred name;</l>
               <l>Use all thy powers, that blessed power to praise,</l>
               <l>Which gives thee power to be, and use the same.</l>
