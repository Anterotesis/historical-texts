            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from Mr. <hi>Richard Harriſon</hi> in DUBLIN, to his brother Mr. R. TUKE, now reſident in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have written to you ſeverall times of our great and proſperous victories againſt our enemies formerly: but now I muſt write unto you of the fearfull Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies acted againſt our poore Countrey men, by the barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Iriſh, ſince the unluckie ceſſation, our forces being drawne away from hence daily, and our victuals exhauſted through the great and daily concourſe of the Iriſh to this miſerable City, we being left as a prey to the enemy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting daily and hourely to be maſſacred and murdered in our beds, being ſtrongly conceited ſo, through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold outrages and ſlaughters committed upon our poore brethren, in their ſeverall Caſtles and Garriſons, as in that of <hi>Catherlow, Malohon, Racoffie,</hi> and divers other places, which the Iriſh have taken, contrary to their pretended Truce ſince the bloody Ceſſation, having cruelly murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all our men, women, &amp; children that recided in them: they at this preſent manage all the affaires in the City, the Caſtle excepted, where our Lords, Juſtices, and Councel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> keepe themſelves cloſe, fearing to be ſurprized. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is very lamentable, we are as ſheepe appointed for the ſlaughter, our wives &amp; children ſwooning in the ſtreets
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111352:3"/>
for want of bread, and our wofull eyes made ſpectators of their cruell inſolencies, in ſetting up their Idolatrous Maſſes in all our Churches, whereof they have taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and baniſhed our beſt Divines; the Lord for our ſinnes having already begun a great famine of the word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; neither are we ſuffered to depart the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but are expoſed to the mercileſſe cruelty of hunger, cold and famine, as alſo the ending ſtroke of grizly death which we hourly expect. Oh our miſeries are unſpeakable, but like to increaſe if not prevented by ſudden (but I hope in the Lord) a provided death. But our only woe is, that you are like to ſuffer with us, and that very ſoone, if ſome ſpeedy courſe be not taken for the ſtopping of the great multitude of Iriſh Papiſts which daily flock from hence into this kingdome, under pretence to aſſiſt his Majeſtie againſt the Puritans. I do beleeve that this ſhall be the laſt that ever I ſhall write unto you (my deer Brother) but in regard of my duty and loyalty which <hi>I</hi> owe to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will to my beſt endeavour ſet down in briefe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my own knowledge how this plot or miſery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and ſtill acted in both kingdomes, hath been a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſixteen yeares, to eſtabliſh popery both here and in <hi>England,</hi> to the intent that my deer native countrey men may be the more cautious in not falling into their mercies as we have done.</p>
            <p>About the yeare 1630, the Earle of <hi>Cork</hi> and my Lord Chancellour <hi>Loftus,</hi> being Lords Juſtices of this kingdom, the ſaid Earle being zealous of Gods worſhip, did put in execution the ſtatute againſt Recuſants, which took ſuch effect here, that the common ſort of Iriſh came daily to our Engliſh Churches for two moneths and more: in the meane time the Earle of <hi>Weſtmeaths,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Barnewall</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:111352:3"/>
of <hi>Crickſtow,</hi> are imploid as agents to the Queen, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of all the Iriſh. <hi>I</hi> cannot tell how the buſineſſe is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but the Kings Letters of favour are obtained to the Lords Juſtices, commanding them not to moleſt his good ſubjects the Iriſh, in their former liberty of conſcience, which was accordingly obayed. Afterwards the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> ſucceeded in this governement, (who being a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man to get wealth) threatned the ſubverſion of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (though by him never attempted, the Iriſh being migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily terrified) imployed <hi>Weſtmeath</hi> and <hi>Barnewall</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to the Queen: theſe Agents fall cunningly to work, and compounded with his Majeſty to afford him a mighty ſum of money throughout the whole kingdome, if ſo be they might enjoy their former liberty. Preſently they obtaine his Majeſties Letters againe to the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> commanding as they deſired, then all things go well with them: but that the money is not gathered, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are iſſued out, and none ſo deeply taxed as the poore Proteſtants in purchaſing the freedome of the Papiſts who afterwards cut their throats and daſhed their children in pieces: well the money is collected, the Papiſts take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they build Abbies and Couvents in every corner of the land, the Locuſts flock in daily to this miſerable City, they build their Maſſe houſes in every ſtreet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and increaſe in three year to the number of fifteen hundred Prieſt, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Fryers, and Monks, as is here ſtill extant by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Paul Harris,</hi> one of their owne Seminary Prieſts: the High Commiſſion is ſet up for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our honeſt Miniſters, and it is made Court of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for Seminary Prieſts to pleade and ſue for Pariſhes for themſelves, as may appear by this ſtory following; the ſaid <hi>Paul Harris</hi> being Seminary Prieſt in the Back Lane,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111352:4"/>
was to be put out of his Pariſh by the titular Romiſh Arch Biſhop of <hi>Doublin,</hi> and one <hi>Patrick Cale</hi> appointed in his place: <hi>Haris</hi> appeals to our High Commiſſion Court, and cites <hi>Cale</hi> to anſwer his ſuit, which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did: after long pleading <hi>Harris</hi> was adjudged to keepe the Pariſh, he having formerly obtained a Letter of favour from Sir <hi>George Ratliffe</hi> to our godly Biſhops to that intent, to proceed further in the plot: <hi>Strafford</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armes all our Engliſh, and raiſes an army of the Papiſts to the number of eight thouſand, and ſends them to the North againſt the poore Scotch, allowing every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as many Maſſe Prieſts as they pleaſe to uſe. But what is all this to the many inſolencies and approbrious words uſed againſt us, by tearming us traitors to the Crowne and dignity, affirming (they having the Kings Commiſſion for their warrant in murdering and deſtroying an hundred and fifty thouſand ſoules. And great likelyhood there is of a ſtrong party they were aſſured of in <hi>England:</hi> their Agents <hi>Nicholas Plunket</hi> and the reſt of his confederates being all that Summer before the rebellion with his Majeſtie at Court, and waiting upon his perſon to Scotland, from whence they poſted into Ireland, and proclaimed openly the Kings authority to handle in that wofull manner you often heard of. I have ſent unto you for your better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, the ſpeech made at <hi>Granarde</hi> in the County of <hi>Longford,</hi> by <hi>Edmond O Bealy,</hi> the titular Romiſh Primate, the 27 of Auguſt, 1641, before the reſt of his fraternity. It was found in Latin about <hi>Anthony O Lork,</hi> a Franciſcan Fryar, ſlaine at the Battell of <hi>Clodeum Mill,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cavan:</hi> but afterwards tranſlated into Engliſh by Archdeacon <hi>Watſon,</hi> for the better ſatisfaction of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men.</p>

            <p>You ſee their cunning trickes in ſtriving to overthrow our Religion, I beſeech the Lord to preſerve <hi>England</hi> from their tyrannie though I my ſelf never hope to ſee it or to eſcape their crueltie, hoping to meet you in heaven I reſt.</p>
