         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Secondly, by remembring that from the <note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Anſ. to Animad. verſ:</hi> p. 132.</note> beginning of this <hi>debate,</hi> the <hi>poſthumous Annotations</hi> on the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>renounced</hi> and <hi>reiected</hi> by me, as departing manifeſtly from the judgment of that <hi>learned</hi> man, formerly expreſſed in thoſe writings which he had <hi>completed</hi> and publiſhed in his <hi>life</hi> time, and conſequently as unſufficient <hi>arguments,</hi> or teſtimonies of his <hi>change,</hi> when produced againſt his own <hi>repeted</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> declarations to the <hi>contrary;</hi> And yet from theſe are the proofs now <hi>principally</hi> brought in this <hi>Review,</hi> and by the contrariety betwixt theſe and his <hi>Book De ſatisfact:</hi> his change concluded, with what appearance of reaſon the <hi>Reader</hi> will ſoon diſcern, when he hath conſidered the <hi>premiſſes,</hi> and what ſhall now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally be added thereto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For this manner of dealing <hi>two</hi> things onely are pleaded in the <hi>Review,</hi> which here muſt be regarded, before I proceed: 1. That the <hi>Accuſer having to deal with that book of Annotations</hi> that goes <hi>under his name, If they are none of his, it is neither on the one hand or other, of any concernment to him.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To this I reply, <hi>firſt,</hi> that it is in the <hi>Reviewer</hi> a manifeſt <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> a courſe which is ſure to render all <hi>debates infinitet</hi> In my anſwer to his <hi>Preface</hi> of <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on <hi>Iguntius</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> &amp;c. I inſerted, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> one, and onely <hi>one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, A Defence of the learned H. Grotius.</hi> And ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48503:4"/>
the whole ſtream of the <hi>Controverſie</hi> is <hi>diverted</hi> into that one <hi>narrow chanel,</hi> removed from the <hi>queſtion</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> to the inquiry into <hi>Grotius</hi>'s his opinions; and that is one <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitent diverſion.</hi> After this, when both in that my <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> and alſo in my ſecond <hi>Defence,</hi> I had confined my plea to <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius himſelf,</hi> and thoſe writings publiſhed by him in his <hi>life</hi> time, and known to be <hi>written,</hi> and <hi>perfected</hi> by him, expreſly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this book of <hi>poſthumous Annotations</hi> on the <hi>Epistles,</hi> the <hi>Reviewer</hi> is now pleaſed <hi>principally</hi> to inſiſt, and found his charge againſt <hi>Grotius,</hi> on thoſe his <hi>poſthumous Annotations;</hi> which is a perfect <hi>diverſion</hi> again, inſtead of a <hi>reply,</hi> and to the <hi>waving</hi> evidently, becauſe <hi>changing</hi> of the <hi>whole queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as <hi>uneffectual</hi> at this <hi>plea</hi> it, it is yet much more <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> if <hi>circumſtances</hi> be conſidered, being evidently <hi>prevented,</hi> and <hi>ſuperſeded</hi> by that which hath <hi>paſt</hi> in this <hi>debate.</hi> For if there were any truth in thoſe words of his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Oxford Heads, [My Defenſative as to my dealing with</hi> Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<hi>'s Annotations is ſuited to what the Doctor pliads in his behalf]</hi> then certainly he muſt be <hi>concern'd</hi> in this, which yet he reſolves to be none of his <hi>concernments;</hi> For it is ſure that my <hi>plea</hi> was framed in <hi>Defence of Grotius himſelf,</hi> (not of thoſe <hi>incomplete</hi> if not <hi>falſe images</hi> of him, thoſe parts of the <hi>Annotations,</hi> which I profeſſed to <hi>reject,</hi> and not to <hi>plead</hi> for.) Accordingly my words in the firſt propoſal of this matter to debate, were theſe, <hi>[This very pious, learned, and judicious man hath of late among many fallen under a very unhappy Fate, being moſt unjuſtly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated ſometimes as a Socinian, ſometimes as a Papiſt—]</hi> And then how can this <hi>Defenſative</hi> be, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, conformed or <hi>ſuited to my plea,</hi> if it refer not to the <hi>ſame ſubject, viz.</hi> to <hi>Grotius,</hi> or thoſe <hi>Books</hi> of his, which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be his <hi>completed,</hi> genuine <hi>writings?</hi> ſuch alone being <hi>competent</hi> teſtifications of his ſenſe, and ſo meaſures to judge of his <hi>perſwaſions,</hi> whether he were a <hi>Socinian</hi> or no.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A <hi>ſecond</hi> part of his plea is by reflecting again on that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which, ſaith he, he had formerly offered from the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Preface to the volume of Annotations on the Epiſtles.]</hi> But here, in the very <hi>entrance,</hi> is a <hi>mistake,</hi> which, for the <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of my ſelf, more then on <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of any <hi>advantage</hi> the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48503:5"/>
               <hi>Reviewer</hi> can gain by it, I muſt firſt take notice of. The <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> was by him <note n="b" place="margin">Epiſt. to the <hi>Oxford</hi> Heads.</note> cited from ſome words of the <hi>Preface to the laſt part of the Annotations, beginning</hi> thus, <hi>Jam vero ſciendum eſt—</hi>To thoſe words there found, I gave anſwer in my <hi>ſecond Defence,</hi> p. 7. and he now tels me that a <hi>ſlight in spection will ſerve to manifeſt how ill it,</hi> i. e. my <hi>anſwer</hi> or the <hi>ſenſe</hi> I gave of the words produced) <hi>agrees with the intention and words of the Prefacer, who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>tells us, that</hi> Grotius <hi>had himſelf publiſhed his Annotations on the Gospel five years before, and</hi> ſo <hi>proceeds,</hi> reciting the words of the <hi>Prefacer</hi> for eight lines to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and concluding, that if the <hi>Apologiſt read this Preface, he ought to have deſiſted from the plea inſiſted on; If he did not, he thought aſſuredly he had much reaſon to despiſe them with whom he had to do.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">Who would not think there were ſomewhat herein really <hi>miſtaken</hi> by me, which called for this ſo <hi>ſolemn rebuke?</hi> But the <hi>Reader</hi> is intreated to conſult the place, or if it be not <hi>worth</hi> his <hi>pains,</hi> he may <hi>believe</hi> me, who made the <hi>inſpection</hi> more then <hi>ſlightly,</hi> and can aſſure him, that there is no part of what he thus now recites, to be met with in that <hi>Preface,</hi> whence he hath formerly drawn his <hi>teſtimony.</hi> I ſay in that <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>laſt part of the Annotations</hi> under <hi>Gretius</hi>'s name, from whence it was, that the <hi>words [Jam viro ſciendum—]</hi> were (truly) cited, and to which <hi>Words</hi> it was viſible, that I gave that <hi>anſwer,</hi> which he now pretends to refute from the <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>words of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer.</hi>

to be <hi>agreeable</hi> to the words of Saint <hi>John,</hi> that <hi>without him was nothing made that was made.</hi> Is it not now as <hi>viſible,</hi> that he hath left <hi>that</hi> place of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>ſpeaking clearly to the Deity</hi> and <hi>creative</hi> power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>which all things were</hi> at firſt <hi>made,</hi> as if he had lived to ſet out <hi>Annotations</hi> purpoſely on that place, and had therein ſo interpreted it?

And for the other places, as it is ſufficient that he hath recited them to that purpoſe on <hi>John</hi> 1. ſo the account is clear why he is not found to do it elſwhere. On <hi>Iſaiah</hi> keeping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the literal <hi>Hebrew,</hi> he had no occaſion in thoſe conciſe notes, to take notice of that, which onely the <hi>Chaldee</hi> there had ſaid.

To the <hi>third</hi> as before, That he cites out of <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> after him, the uſe of the word <hi>hypoſtaſes,</hi> and the <hi>diſtinction</hi> of them.

            <p n="51">51. In the <hi>next</hi> place, I am reproved that I <hi>neither make inquiry into his Treatiſe,</hi> for <hi>the places in the Old Teſtament,</hi> wherein
<pb facs="tcp:48503:14"/>
the <hi>Deity of Chriſt</hi> is <hi>teſtified to,</hi> and <hi>are corrupted by that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man,</hi> nor <hi>yet will look into</hi> Grotius<hi>'s Annotations</hi> on <hi>thoſe texts,</hi> which <hi>I remember at all times to be pleaded to that purpoſe.</hi> To this I anſwer, 1. That I never undertook the <hi>vindicaton</hi> of all <hi>Grotius's Annotations,</hi> nor ever ſaid any thing, which ſhould ingage me in ſuch a <hi>long</hi> task as this. 2. The <hi>diſcouragements,</hi> which I mentioned to have already received from making <hi>inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> into this <hi>Reviewers</hi> former <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> were taken from what had appeared from <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 1: compared with, and found evidently to <hi>ſuperſede</hi> this Authors ſuggeſtions of <hi>[but one, if one place, in all the Bible, left by</hi> Grotius <hi>clearly teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this truth]</hi> For when, beſide that of <hi>John</hi> 1.

            <p n="52">52.

            </p>
            <p n="53">53.

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48503:15"/>
ſenſe of the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> ſuch as pertain'd to the then <hi>approching</hi> affairs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> are a competent account of his not inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the more <hi>remote</hi> and <hi>ultimate</hi> completions in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So his general advertiſements, more then once given (ſuch as hath been produced from his <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. and to <hi>Iſa</hi> 53.) are ſufficient to teſtifie his acknowledgment of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being <hi>predicted</hi> in thoſe places of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> where his <hi>Annotations</hi> on the ſeveral <hi>verſes</hi> make no <hi>particular</hi> mention of him. And ſo, when he gives a ſenſe of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately belonged (in his opinion) to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, interprets every part of that verſe, he yet thus <hi>prefaceth</hi> it, <hi>ſic tamen ut multò excellentius haec ad Meſſiam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere non Chriſtiani tantum agnoſcant, ſed &amp; Chaldaeus hoc loco]</hi> thus giving onely a <hi>lower</hi> notion of the words to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and reſerving the <hi>ſublimer</hi> and more <hi>excellent</hi> to <hi>Christ.</hi> So again chap. 11. 1. <hi>Redit ad Hezechiae. laudes, ſub quibus ſenſu ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miore latent laudes Meſſiae;</hi> and many paſſages there are to the ſame purpoſe: As others alſo of referring to the <hi>Annotations</hi> on the <hi>Gospels,</hi> wherein he hath ſpoken ſo largely of this <hi>ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer completion</hi> of ohe <hi>Prophecies,</hi> that he would not repete them in the places of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to which they belonged.</p>
            <p n="54">54. In the next place he comes to the <hi>compariſon</hi> betwixt <hi>Calvin</hi>'s and <hi>Grotius</hi>'s dealing in this matter, and makes many offers of <hi>anſwer,</hi> to which I am concern'd to make <hi>particular</hi> replies.</p>
            <p n="55">55. <hi>Firſt,</hi> he denies Mr <hi>Calvine equally chargeable, or in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of proportion with Grotius.</hi> To which I <hi>anſwer,</hi> that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be, or be not <hi>truly</hi> chargeable, in <hi>any</hi> degree, I am not concern'd to examine, having not <hi>accuſed</hi> him, but onely made the <hi>parallel</hi> betwixt that <hi>learned</hi> man and <hi>Grotius,</hi> in this, that each of them have by ſome been deemed <hi>chargeable.</hi> 2. The <hi>compariſon</hi> which I made, was not of the <hi>equality,</hi> or indeed of the <hi>degree of proportion,</hi> but expreſt with ſuch <hi>caution,</hi> as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prevented that <hi>reply,</hi> my words being theſe, <hi>that it will upon inquiry be found in ſome degree; if not equally chargeable, on the learnedſt and moſt valued of the Reformers, particularly on</hi> Mr Calvin <hi>himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Here I ſaid, <hi>in ſome degree,</hi> but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not to define the <hi>equality,</hi> or to conſider what <hi>proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> that <hi>degree</hi> held with that wherein <hi>Grotius</hi> was <hi>chargeable,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48503:15"/>
not indeed believing that either <hi>Grotius</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> had given any reaſons for that <hi>charge,</hi> which I ſee lie <hi>heavy</hi> on <hi>both</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="56">56. 3. The <hi>compariſon</hi> of <hi>equality,</hi> which I made between theſe two <hi>learned</hi> men, referred onely to the <hi>bitterneſs</hi> and <hi>injuſtice</hi> of the <hi>accuſations</hi> and <hi>contumelies</hi> that fell upon them, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in theſe words, <hi>[Calvin himſelf hath been as bitterly and unjuſtly accuſed and reviled on this account, as ever</hi> Eraſmus <hi>was by</hi> Bellarmine <hi>or</hi> Beza, <hi>or is probably</hi> Grotius <hi>can b.]</hi> And there will be no way to <hi>disprove</hi> my <hi>compariſon</hi> in this, but by heaping far more <hi>unjuſt</hi> reproches on <hi>Grotius,</hi> then yet this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewer</hi> hath done, which if others are reſolved to do, yet ſhall I not thereby be <hi>refutable,</hi> who, as <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me, affirmed it onely <hi>not probable</hi> that they would.</p>
            <p n="57">57. In the next place he requires me to <hi>prove of</hi> Mr Calvin <hi>that he hath in all his Commentaries on the Scripture, corrupted the ſenſe of any text, giving expreſſe testimonies to the Deity of Chriſt, and commonly pleaded to that end and purpoſe, although he deny not but that he differs from the common judgment of moſt in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of ſome few prophetical paſſages judged by them to relate to Chriſt.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="58">58. To this I <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. That the <hi>latter</hi> part of this (his <hi>not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> &amp;c.) is in effect the <hi>confeſſing</hi> all that I had ſaid of Mr <hi>Calvin,</hi> which was but this, that he was by <hi>ſome charged of diſarming the Church of her defences againſt adverſaries, by diverting thoſe places of Scripture which had formerly been uſed to aſſert the great myſteries, to other inferior ends;</hi> And then I need undertake no farther tasks of <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>proving</hi> Mr Calvin <hi>to have corrupted the ſenſe of any text</hi> &amp;c. which he knows I never <hi>affirmed</hi> of him.

find a <hi>Catologue</hi> of twenty paſſages affixt to thoſe <hi>eminent</hi> firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> eſpecially to Mr <hi>Calvin,</hi> as 1. <hi>that the enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Scrpent and the ſeed of the Woman,</hi> Gen. 3. <hi>is ſimply to be interpreted of the hoſtility of Men and Serpents;</hi> that the <hi>prophecies of the Scepters not departing from</hi> Judah <hi>till</hi> Shiloh <hi>comes,</hi> Gen. 49. <hi>expounded of Chriſt, gives the Jews occaſion to ſcoff;</hi> that the <hi>words of</hi> Balaam, <hi>Num.</hi> 24. <hi>A ſtar ſhall riſe out of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>muſt not properly be expounded of Chriſt;</hi> nor <hi>that of the Lord by</hi> Moſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>I will raiſe them up a Prophet, which yet</hi> Saint Peter <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, and <hi>Saint Stephen Acts</hi> 7. 37: <hi>affirmed</hi> to belong to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Out of thee Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leem ſhall he come forth to me that is to be a ruler in Iſrael]</hi> muſt <hi>not be expounded preciſely and properly of the divinity of Chriſt.</hi> That <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Behold thy King cometh lowly—is by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters triflingly and in a falſe manner expounded of his entrance into Jeruſalem, which yet</hi> Saint Matthew <hi>and</hi> Saint John <hi>have applied to it.</hi> Theſe are a few eſſayes whereby to judge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others.

            </p>
            <p n="59">59. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he affirmes that what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> raved againſt Mr <hi>Calvin, was chiefly from ſome expreſſions in the Inſtitutions about the Trinity, (wherein he is acquitted by the moſt learned of themſelves) and not from the expoſitions of Scripture.]</hi> But 1. the truth of this will be judged by what was <hi>laſt</hi> ſaid, for all thoſe <hi>twenty paſſages</hi> are fetcht from the <hi>expoſitions</hi> of <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp;c. on thoſe ſo many <hi>places</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> And 2. 'tis certain I ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not the <hi>Book,</hi> wherein he had written what was thus <hi>chargeable,</hi> and ſo had not been <hi>reproveable,</hi> if they had been <hi>all out of the Inſtitutions,</hi> thoſe being as acknowledgedly his, as the <hi>Commentaries,</hi> and both much more then the <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> on the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> are <hi>Grotius</hi>'s; and 3. if <hi>he ſtand by learned men acquitted of the charge,</hi> then as I ſaid, that may make the <hi>parallel</hi> more <hi>exact</hi> betwixt him and <hi>Grotius,</hi> though I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not that every <hi>learned</hi> man hath been thus <hi>just</hi> to acquit him.</p>
            <p n="60">60. But then fourthly, for <hi>Calvino-Turciſmus</hi> by me mentioned
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48503:16"/>
in a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> he tels me, I have <hi>forgotten the deſign of it, and that</hi> Calvin <hi>is no more concerned in it than others of the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, nor is it from any doctrine about the Deity of Chriſt in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but from the whole of the Reformed Religion, with the Apoſtacies of ſome, that they compare it with Turciſme,</hi> adding, that <hi>ſomething indeed in a chapter or two they speak about the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, from ſome expreſſions of</hi> Luther, Melanchthon, Calvin, <hi>and others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="61">61. To all this I <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. that 'tis viſible I ſpeak not of Mr <hi>Calvin alone,</hi> but of the <hi>learnedſt and moſt valued of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi> and of Mr <hi>Calvin</hi> onely, as <hi>one</hi> of them. 2. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>forgetting the deſign of Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Giffords Book,</hi> would be far from a <hi>crime</hi> in me, had I been <hi>guilty</hi> of it, (the ſubject matter of it is not ſo much <hi>worth remembring)</hi> much leſſe any <hi>indication</hi> that <hi>Grotius</hi> were <hi>inſufficiontly vind cated;</hi> yet when the <hi>Reviewer confeſſes,</hi> that <hi>in a chapter or two it ſpeaks about the Trinity, from ſome expreſſions of</hi> Luther, Melanchthon, <hi>and</hi> Calvin, and others: this clearly evidences, that theſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> were there thus <hi>accuſed</hi> in the matter of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as now it ſeems <hi>Grotius</hi> is; And 3. if <hi>Hunnius's Calvinus Judaizans,</hi> which is <hi>home</hi> to the buſineſs, be <hi>anſwered by</hi> Pareus, <hi>and an account of the calumny given by him]</hi> this ſtill renders the <hi>parallel</hi> more <hi>complete.</hi> An <hi>account</hi> of the <hi>calumny</hi> and the <hi>firſt author,</hi> and <hi>grounds</hi> of it againſt <hi>Grotius,</hi> being happily rendred by himſelf alſo in the <hi>Diſcuſſio,</hi> p. 17.</p>
            <p n="62">62. The <hi>Reviewer</hi> concludes this matter with a ſignification of his <hi>conſtant adhering to his propoſition</hi> formerly aſſerted, <hi>with one limitation expreſſed</hi> (of <hi>his own obſervation.)</hi> But I that <hi>firſt</hi> gave the occaſion of the <hi>debate</hi> in my <hi>Digreſſion</hi> concerning <hi>Grotius,</hi> did never propoſe it with reference to that <hi>limitation,</hi> not being able to foreſee, how much this <hi>Reviewer</hi> had read, or obſerved of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s writings, nor can I yet paſs judgment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what hath now been offered to him by another, will be yielded to come within the compaſs of that <hi>limitation,</hi> or no.

            <p n="63">63. On the <hi>ſecond ſort</hi> of ſuggeſtion, the <hi>Reviewer</hi> hath choſen to be <hi>brief,</hi> and hath well prepared for it by expreſſing <hi>diſlike</hi> and averſation to any ſuch <hi>undertaking,</hi> that ſeemed incumbent

on him, <hi>viz. to prove that Grotius was a Papiſt.]</hi> But to this I <hi>reply,</hi> as before, that this <hi>task</hi> is ſure <hi>incumbent</hi> on him, if, as he ſaid, his <hi>defenſative</hi> be <hi>ſuited to what I pleaded in his behalf.</hi> For 'tis certain, that in the <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> I had ſo propoſed the <hi>debate,</hi> and undertaken to <hi>vindicate</hi> him from this <hi>ſuggeſtion, viz.</hi> that <hi>he was a Papiſt.</hi>

            <p n="64">64. That he <hi>cloſed with the Roman intereſt,</hi> he is now willing to infer, from his <hi>obſervation</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 5. To that therefore I have turned, and there find no other <hi>premiſſes</hi> toward this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> than onely theſe, 1. that <hi>Disperſi ex Judaeis, inſtrumenta Eccleſiae Catholicae, multos de populo Romano Chriſto genuere,</hi> that <hi>thoſe that were disperſed from Judaea—begat to Chriſt many of the people of Rome,</hi> and that theſe are there called <hi>partus maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> the <hi>man-childe</hi> or <hi>maſculine birth,</hi> in reſpect of the great <hi>conſtancy</hi> which appeared in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>thoſe</hi> times; then 2. that the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath this above other Churches, that no Church ſubjected more people to the word of God, ſo that her victories by the weapons of Chriſt, were not inferior to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſucceſſes of Old Rome:</hi> 3. that <hi>the regiment of other Churches after the Apoſtles death belonged to that.</hi> Now this being clearly applied by him to the <hi>infancy</hi> or <hi>firſt ages</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that which is <hi>firſt</hi> ſaid of the <hi>conſtancy,</hi> is indeed much for the <hi>honour</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Roman Church,</hi> but no way for the <hi>intereſt</hi> of the <hi>preſent,</hi> which having much departed from the <hi>Primitive,</hi> cannot in any reaſon partake of thoſe <hi>elogies,</hi> which he there beſtows on that <hi>maſculine birth,</hi> at the <hi>firſt</hi> appearing of it in the world. So likewiſe 2. of the <hi>ancient Roman Church</hi> it is, that he ſaith, it <hi>converted ſo many to the faith,</hi> which is a <hi>truth</hi> known, and acknowledged in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> but is not at this day aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed (witneſs <hi>S.

For having cited from ſome words of <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> that <hi>ſoon after the death of the Apoſtles and their audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, many falſe doctrines were preached and divulged in the Church,</hi> he hath theſe words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I know who hath endeavoured to elude the ſenſe of this complaint, as though it concerned not any thing in the Church, but the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and perſecuters of it, the Gnoſticks. But yet I know alſo, that no man would ſo do, but ſuch a one as hath a juſt confidence of his</hi> own ability, <hi>to make paſſable at leaſt, any thing that he ſhall venture to ſay or utter. For why ſhould that be referred by</hi> Hegeſippus <hi>to the ages after the Apoſtles and their hearers were dead, with an exception againſt its being ſo in their dayes; when if the perſon thus expounding this teſtimony may be credited, the Gnoſticks were never more buſie nor prevalent than in that time which alone is excepted from the evil here spoken of? Nor can I underſtand how the oppoſition and perſecution of the Church ſhould</hi>

               <hi>be inſinuated to be the</hi> deflouring <hi>and</hi> violating <hi>of its chastity, which is commonly a great</hi> purifying <hi>of it: ſo that speaking of that breaching and preaching of errours, which was not in the Apoſtles times, nor in the</hi> time of <hi>their hiarers, the chiefeſt time of the rage and madneſs of the Gnoſticks; ſuch as ſpotted the pure and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted virginity of the Church; which nothing can attein unto, that is forreign unto it, and that which gave Originall unto Sedition in the Church: I am of the mind, and ſo I conceive was</hi> Euſebius <hi>that recited thoſe words, that the good man intended corruptions in the Church not out of it, nor oppoſitions to it.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. What <hi>iuſt confidence</hi> any man can have of his <hi>own abilities to make any thing paſſable that he ſhall venture to utter]</hi> unleſs it be found in a <hi>due</hi> care never to adventure to <hi>utter</hi> any thing, which hath not perfect <hi>truth</hi> in it, I acknowledge my ſelf unable to apprehend. But how unjuſtly I am here charged of any kind of <hi>confidence</hi> of my <hi>own abilities,</hi> and how unſufficiently my <hi>anſwer</hi> in defence of the <hi>ancient Church-writers</hi> is here invalidated, will, I hope, ſoon appear, by a ſhort view, 1. of my <hi>anſwer,</hi> 2. of the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>teſtimony</hi> it ſelf, on which it was clearly grounded, 3. of that which is here <hi>objected</hi> againſt the fitneſs of my <hi>anſwer.</hi>
