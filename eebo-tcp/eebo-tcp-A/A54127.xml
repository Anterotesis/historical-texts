            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Declaration or TEST To Diſtinguiſh PROTESTANT DISSENTERS, FROM PAPISTS, and POPISH RECUSANTS.</head>
            <p>I A. B. Do ſolemnly in the Preſence of God, and in my Conſcience, Profeſs, Teſtify and Declare, that I do not believe that the Church of ROME, or PAPAL CHURCH, is the True Church, out of which, there is no Salvation; Or that the POPE, or Chief Biſhop of ROME, is Chriſts Vicar or Vicegerent on Earth. Or that He, or the See of ROME jointly or ſeverally, is Head of, or hath any Supremacy over the True CATHOLICK CHURCH in General, or my ſelf in Particular. Or is ſole or chief Judge in Spiritual Matters, or of the Senſe of the Holy Scriptures. Or that the POPE or his Prieſts have power to Pardon Sins, paſt, preſent, or to come.</p>
            <p>And I do believe, That at, or after the Prieſts pronouncing his words of Conſecration upon the Elements of BREAD and WINE, commonly called the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> or <hi>Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> there is not any <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> nor any part of the Subſtance of the <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Wine</hi> changed into <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Blood</hi> of CHRIST. And that the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the MASS, and the Uſe of, Adoring and Bowing to <hi>Crucifixes, Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> in Worſhip; As alſo, that the Invocation and Adoration of the Virgin MARY, or any other <hi>Saint</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> and Prayers to and for the <hi>Dead,</hi> are Practices <hi>Erroneous, Superſtitious</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and contrary to the Truth of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> I Believe there is no <hi>Mediator</hi> between GOD and MAN, but CHRIST JESUS only the Lord of Life and Glory.</p>
            <p>And I do further Believe, That neither the POPE, nor any other, by or under his Authority, hath any Power to Depoſe PRINCES, or to Abſolve their Subjects of their <hi>Allegiance</hi> on any account whatſoever. Or hath Power to Authorize, or give Leave to <hi>Me,</hi> or any other Subject of this Realm whatſoever, to PLOT or Conſpire the Hurt of the KINGS Perſon, His State, Government, or People.</p>
            <p>And I do Truly and Sincerely Profeſs, and in good Conſcience De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That <hi>I</hi> Believe KING CHARLES the II. is the Lawful and Rightful <hi>KING</hi> of this Realm, and of all other His Dominions and Countreys. And <hi>I</hi> do Promiſe to be True and Faithful to Him, and His Lawful Succeſſors; And to live a Sober and Peaceable Life under His and Their Government, as becomes a True Chriſtian, and <hi>Proteſtant Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>I</hi> do ſolemnly in the Preſence of GOD, Teſtifie and Declare, that <hi>I</hi> make this Declaration, and every part thereof, in the plain and Ordinary Senſe of the Words read unto Me, as they are commonly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> without any Evaſion, Equivocation, or Mental Reſervation whatſoever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
