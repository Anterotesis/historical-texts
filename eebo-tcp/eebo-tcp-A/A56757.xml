            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In a LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to your Deſire, I have made
many Experiments with the <hi>Barbado
Seeds</hi> you ſent me, and I find them
wonderful ſerviceable againſt Dropſies; they
open the Sluces of Nature, and let the wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44430:3"/>
Humours run away both by Seige and
Urine, and that in a very plentiful manner,
with very little diſturbance to Nature. If you
have any more <hi>Indian</hi> Specificks, I pray ſend
them into the Countrey, and I will make
Obſervations upon them, and I hope with as
good Succeſs; for by this Method the Art
of Phyſick is likely to be much improved,
and in time we may be able to Anſwer the
Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> to write a Hiſtory
of the Cures of Diſeaſes thought to be incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>I was lately ſent for ſix Miles from my
own Houſe to a Countrey Farmer, who was
miſerably ſwelled by the Dropſie, not only
his Belly, but his Leggs and whole Habit of
Body; I had given him many Medicines, but
I found that his ſtubborn Diſeaſe would not
give way, and at length trying your Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
in ſeveral forms, I perceived a plentiful
Evacuation of Water by Seige and Urine, he
is become very lank, and his Colour begins
to return, and I hope by the Uſe of good
Volatile Salts and bitter Medicines to reſtore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44430:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ferments to the ſeveral parts, and prevent
the danger of a Relapſe.</p>
            <p>Another Perſon who was a Servant, was
ſo exceedingly ſwelled, that his Friends had
all concluded that he muſt be tapp'd, but
having heard of the former Cure, came ten
Miles to my Houſe, being brought in his
Maſter's Coach; I uſed the ſame Method,
and in due time Cured him.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs own, as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> ſaith, that
the Theories of divers Diſeaſes are ſo hotly
diſputed amongſt many Eminent Phyſitians,
that in many Caſes a Man may diſcern
more probability of the Succeſs of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
than of the Truth of the received Notion
of the Diſeaſe. And as the Controverted Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
are not to this Day agreed on, nor
eſtabliſht in the Schools themſelves, ſo divers
who are not acquainted with the Schools, do
by the help of Experience and good Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks,
and the Method their mother Wit and
other Emergency prompts them to take, do
very great and extraordinary Cures; the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44430:4"/>
Cauſes of Diſeaſes are much leſs certain, and
much more diſputed than the Uninquiſitive
imagine: Nor are the Methods of Curing,
which depends upon thoſe Cauſes, ſettled as
they ſhould be; and therefore he fears that
the generality of Phyſitians have but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Method in the Cure of many Diſeaſes;
and therefore he obſerves that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
ſome good Medicines in an unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
manner, though they may diſparage
an Author, yet they may ſave the Life of a
Patient.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations have encouraged me
to communicate my Obſervations of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which may a little gratifie the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
part of Mankind, until the Learned Dr.
<hi>Sloan,</hi> from whom we expect conſiderable
Informations, gives us a more compleat Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>American</hi> Rarities, and their Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Opperations.</p>
            <p>This I muſt ſay, that after univerſal Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations
by Purging, Vomitting, Sweating,
which ought to be left to the Prudence of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44430:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
able and experienced Phyſitians: I have ever
found Specifick Allerative Remedies wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Advantagious.</p>
            <p>Many Perſons of different Ages and Sexes
have been Cured of Dropſies by theſe Seeds,
taking only the Spirit, the Tincture, and the
Extract of the ſame, ſometimes in Broom-Beer,
and ſometimes in Rheniſh-Wine, only
obſerving an agreeable Dyet, and enduring
Thirſt as much as may be.</p>
