            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Aſtrology be unlawful, whether is it in erecting the figure, or in judgment? If in erecting the figure, what is there in it, but plain Aſtronomy? and what is it but a map of the heavens at ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular time? for though Cities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Towns, nor Houſes on earth change their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet the Stars doe, at leaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us.

as lawful as Geography. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>For if there be nothing in it more then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy, why is it not as lawful as any other of the ſeven liberal Arts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If judgment be unlawful, I ask whether if upon mine own, and many others obſervations, we finding for the moſt part, we have hot weather in the Dog-dayes, is it not lawful for me to judge, it will be ſo this or the next year, though God can alter it as he pleaſe? And ſo if I ſee the Moon full South, may I not judg it full Sea at ſuch a place, becauſe God can alter it? We tie not God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>Deo volente</hi> is underſtood, neither in humane actions doe we tie the will of man: yet we ſay the Stars doe ſo ſtrongly incline that they guide the will very often.</p>
            <p>Now then if both parts, that is all the parts, both erecting and judgment are lawful, then the whole Aſtrology is lawful, neither may the whole be condemned for a part of a part, if any ſuch be found unlawful, we muſt not

blame <hi>Moſes</hi> for having skill in Aſtrology, becauſe the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> joyned inchantments with it, for which they are blamed in divers places of the Prophets, which indeed is the ignorance, not the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and which <hi>Moſes</hi> withſtood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 11.

            <p>Thus much in Engliſh.</p>
            <l>When as king <hi>Charles</hi> to <hi>Pauls</hi> did go, to bleſs God for his Son:</l>
            <l>The Stars appear'd in firmament, and in the afternoon.</l>
            <l>Toward ſix a clock, of that ſame day, the Sun eclipſed was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>I pray thee, tell me what it means, and what will come to paſſe:</l>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48213:15"/>
Their Kingdom ſhall Eclipſed be, theſe Stars doe ſpeak it plain,</l>
            <l>If I have any skill to judge, theſe ſignes are not in vain.</l>
            <p>Now which of theſe will you find fault with? either you muſt deny there were ſuch apparitions, but you may as well deny there is any Sun at all, or will you accuſe God for making them, then I confeſſe you ſilence me indeed. Or will you denie they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no ſuch thing that the event ſhewed. Or will you denie the iugd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lawful? then either ſhew ſome other way whereby Gods meaning may be known, or elſe for ſhame never open your mouth more againſt Aſtrology, but rather confeſs your fault, and give glory to God with <hi>Acham,</hi> for you have robbed him of his chief end in creating them, in denying them to be ſignes, or that no man knoweth their meaning. I could name a hundred more the like events if time would permit.</p>
            <p n="22">22 And who ſhall tell us the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of all theſe but the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48213:15"/>
let the Miniſter interpret the word of God, but the Aſtrologer his works, eſpecially of the Stars, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but God would have both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, &amp; <hi>ne ſutor,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena's are Gods Embaſſadors to a land, and that land is in an ill caſe that hath never a one that knowes their language: No marvel then, though <hi>Eſay</hi> count it as a plague to have the Aſtrologer taken away. And I fear if ſuch Miniſters as ſpeak againſt Aſtrology ſhould change pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Aſtrologers, they would prove more unable to interpret theſe, then the Aſtrologers the word.</p>
            <p n="23">23 Is it likely that God, that was ſo careful in time of the Prophets to forewarn his people and to comfort them alwayes in their miſeries, to ſend them ſtill one Prophet, or other, to tell them of their freedome, and hath he left us now no meanes in the time of the Goſpel? hath he no care of his Church now, hath he forgot to be gracious? God forbid.</p>
            <p>Now if this or any other of theſe be granted, then Aſtrology in general
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48213:16"/>
cannot be condemned, but rather be commended, and is it not an heynous ſin in any, eſpecially in Miniſters that will uphold Gods truth with a lie, and ſo call evil good, and good evil.</p>
            <p>But you will object ſome goe too far in it, I anſwer, prove who they are, and blame them that doe it, and not the Art it ſelf. Blame not <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Egyptians</hi> joyned inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with it. But you will object that Horary Queſtions are unlawful, becauſe you ſay, there can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given that the propounding a queſtion at ſuch or ſuch a time, should produce a true anſwer. I anſwer, though no reaſon could be given, yet finding by continual experience that they doe produce true anſwers, wee cannot condemn them. And you may aſwel condemn laying Iron over Beer to keep it from ſowring as this: for no reaſon can be given ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther why thunder ſhould ſowre it, or the Iron preſerve it.</p>
            <p>But beſides experience, we can give you reaſon ſufficient, if you are able to underſtand reaſon. You know
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48213:16"/>
that though the will of man be free to propound his queſtion when he will, yet as I ſaid before, <hi>Deo volente,</hi> God firſt willing, is alwayes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And you know alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that not a hair can fall from his head, nor yet a word from his mouth, without his providence, both for <hi>quid</hi> and <hi>quando<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> what, and when. And therefore as the Stars are his ſervants to effect his pleaſure, they do ſo incline the will and other concurrences withall, whereof there be many, neither doth the <hi>quaerent</hi> ſtand upon ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe election of time, but onely when he can conveniently meet with the Aſtrologers, they ſo incline him to propound the queſtion at ſuch a time as that the Heavens ſhall be in ſuch a poſition as to give a true anſwer to the queſtion demanded. And this is ſtrongly backt by that which Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers obſerve daily, but none other can, that a man by reaſon of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination can, or at leaſt ſcarce ever doth move a queſtion at any time with earneſt deſire of ſatisfaction, but the Aſcendent thereof will be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48213:17"/>
either the ſame ſigne or at leaſt one of the ſame Triplicity with the ſigne of the Aſcendant of the Radix of his nativity. If <hi>tendanda gratta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

for ſeaſons, but as for hearbs in the ſame chapter v. 29. there ſuch hearbs as have ſeed in themſelves, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to man for meat, and in Verſe the 30, every green hearb for food for cattel. Now if that be a good reaſon that becauſe the Stars are made for lights and for ſignes of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, therefore not for ſignes and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, notwithſtanding the word is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe for ſignes and ſeaſons. I may more ſafely reaſon thus, God creates the hearbs for food, and will you turn them to Phyſick? where is your warrant? you know what is ſaid of the holy writings <hi>Exo.</hi> 30. 33. whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever uſeth it to any other purpoſe then that which it was made for muſt be cut off. Yet you will uſe hearbs for Phyſick that were made for food, &amp; will not uſe the Sars for ſigns w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were made for ſignes. Alſo if it be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to uſe the Stars for ſignes, (I mean Aſtrology) becauſe the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> uſed enchantments with it: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is unlawful for them to uſe hearbs for Phyſick, becauſe Witches and Conjurers uſe enchantments

And therefore no marvel, though there was a time when Phyſick was as much cried down as Aſtrology is now. Beſides that it is as likely that Phyſicians in curing any diſeaſe, make a ſecret compact with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and more then Aſtrologers, for it is certain that together with a green ointment which cures all diſeaſes new and old, hot and cold, they have their charmes for Tooth-ake, for biting with a mad Dog, for the falling ſickneſſe, convulſion fit, &amp;c. Again it experience will doe nothing in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, what reaſon beſides experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can be given that ſuch an hearb ſhould cure ſucha diſeaſe. If any could be given, Phiſicians might quickly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48213:21"/>
learne to cure all diſeaſes. Or if that be ſo as they ſay, that if an Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doth not know, both all the Stars and the nature of them, he cannot give a right judgment. Where is that <hi>Phyſician,</hi> that <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Surely you will ſay, if an Aſtrologer layes it on, that he did it by ſecret compact with the Devil, as ſome great Profeſſors told me long before I knew what Aſtrology ment, that becauſe in Surveying I could tell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances before I meaſured them, that I could do it by no good meanes, and that I ſcandalized the Goſpel by it wiſhing me either to give it over, or my profeſſion. And how know you that ſuch an hearb is in ſuch a degree of heat, or of cold? Phyſicians differ as much about them as Aſtrologers about Aſtrology. Beſides Phyſitians

And the truth is, a Phyſician without it, is ſcarce half a Phyſician, for I dare boldly ſay, that a Phyſician working Mathematically will three to one tell both the ſtate of the diſeaſe, the place afflicted, and the danger of death, or hope of recovery, without failing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one, to the Urine thrice, witneſſe Dr. <hi>Napier,</hi>

and vertues, what truth he found in his figure (for of the lawfulneſſe they doubted not) his anſwer was, that where his figure deceived him once, the Urine did it ten times, and that ſometime they would ſpeak quite contrary things: but he always found in his figure moſt truth. And for that the Urine would not ſhew many things that the figure would, as about women with child. And this Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> told me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom I was an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hearer, and that time did ſcruple Aſtrology very much, and this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he told me, ſatisfied both Mr. <hi>Bowles</hi> and him.

buſineſſe, and craved her aſſiſtance, to whom ſhe conſented, together they went, and finding the Gentlewoman diſconſolate without hope of life, yet committed her ſelf to my wife, who finding no ſuch danger as the other feared, bids her be of good comfort for ſhe doubted not but all would be well quickly, the word was no ſooner ſpoken, but in comes a meſſenger whom they had ſent to Dr. <hi>Caeſar</hi> of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> forbidding the women to uſe any more ado, for ſhe was not in labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (No? quoth my wife, I ſee then the Doctor hath no skill) and I doubt not but by Gods goodneſſe it ſhall appear within this quarter of this hour, and accordingly it fell out preſently, God gave a ſave delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance both of woman and child, and the woman mended quickly after. If an Aſtrologer ſhould commit ſuch an errour, it would be recorded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to all poſterity.</p>

            <p>The other of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> quoted by the ſaid <hi>Rowland,</hi> is concerning a rule uſed by ſome Aſtrologers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time when the effects of an Eclipſe begins, which is this: Obſerve at the middle of the Eclipſe how far the Luminary eclipſed, is diſtant from its riſing, and how long it continueth above the Horizon, then reduce them into minutes, and ſay by the golden Rule: If the whole continuance of the Luminarie eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed give 365 dayes, what ſhall its time from the riſing give? The time hereby found, ſay ſome, is the time of the beginning of the effects. But Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> there reckons many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eclipſes whoſe effects, (of his own knowledge) began preſently after the Eclipſes. Where note, that we need no ſtronger witneſs to prove that Eclipſes have their effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that theſe effects are found by Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, deny it they that can, and for my part, I am of his mind, for the time
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48213:31"/>
of the beginning of the effects, and ſo is <hi>Origanus</hi> and ſo is Mr. <hi>Wings</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeris.</p>
            <p>Yet let me anſwer one objection more, which is this. Though in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of Figures you doe not work by the Devil, yet they that come to you doe beleeve you doe. I aske, muſt I give over my calling of a Surveyor or Inginee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or muſt our Saviour Chriſt give over caſting out Devils, becauſe ſome thought he wrought by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> yet I would have none ſo bold to tell the effects of Eclipſes or great conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before they fall, leaſt they miſſe of the time when they will fall, as <hi>Lilly</hi> did, for as <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
