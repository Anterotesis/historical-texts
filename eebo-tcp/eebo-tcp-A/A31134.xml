            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The greateſt Part of the City of <hi>London</hi> being Burnt down in <hi>Anno</hi> 1666, As alſo the Cities Publick Buildings, with the greateſt part of their Revenue, The <hi>Chamber</hi> was forc'd (before the Grant of the <hi>Coal</hi> Revenue) to Disburſe divers Great Sums of Mony (All which were taken up at Intereſt) to Recover the City out of its Ruins, in Rebuilding their <hi>Priſons</hi> and other Publick Buildings, Clearing and Paving the <hi>Streets,</hi> Repairing the <hi>Common Sewers,</hi> and other Publick Works. And whereas before the ſaid <hi>Fire,</hi> the Fines received upon Renewing of <hi>Leaſes</hi> were a great Support to the <hi>Chamber;</hi> Moſt of the Cities <hi>Houſes</hi> being Burnt down, The City was forc'd (for Encouragement of <hi>Tenants</hi>) to make Long Leaſes thereof without <hi>Fines,</hi> whereby the <hi>Chamber</hi> hath ever ſince been deprived of a conſiderable Income thereby.</p>
            <p>The Cities <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> having in the Reign of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second been frequently Queſtioned and Invaded (the better to ſubject the City to <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi>) And at laſt Judgment upon the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> given againſt their being a Corporation; They were forc'd (for their neceſſary Defence therein) to Disburſe very great Sums of Mony out of the <hi>Chamber of London;</hi> By which Means aforeſaid, and the conſtant Payment of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> The Debt (which in 1665 was 265000 <hi>l.</hi>) is now Swelled to near 750000 <hi>l.</hi>

The WIDOWS and ORPHANS (to whom this Debt is Owing) are many Hundreds in Number, and very Many of them have no other Subſiſtence to Depend upon; Wherefore it is Humbly hoped the PARLIAMENT will Compaſſionate Their and the Cities deplorable Caſe, and afford a Relief ſuitable to the Greatneſs of the Debt; Which They Preſume the rather to Hope, in Regard the <hi>Citizens of London</hi> have (on All Occaſions) been Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Publick, and particularly in Their <hi>Guards,</hi> during All the Time of Proſecuting <hi>The Popiſh Plot,</hi> And upon Occaſion of the late Diſturbances before His Preſent MAJESTIES Arrival to this City, Which hath Coſt the <hi>Citizens</hi> near 300000 <hi>l.</hi>
