            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DISCOVRSE
CONCERNING
Puritans.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common Maxim amongſt Politicians,
that a State is mayntained by Accuſations,
but ruined by Calumnies: and therefore
(ſays Marquis <hi>Malvezzi)</hi> happy ſhall
the Subjects be of that wiſe Prince, which
countenances Accuſations, and checks Calumnies: for
the ſuffering of Accuſations to goe leſſe in repute, and
Calumnies to get footing, hath beene the encreaſe of
manſlaughter, and the continuance of enmity in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Many believe that nothing which is done would
be knowne, if this means of diſperſing privy calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
ſpeeches were not uſed, whereas little is known
becauſe it is uſed: for falſhood conſtantly affirmed for
truth ſometimes deceives, and when it does not, but
is knowne to be falſhood, yet it forces to ſome ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of judgment, and makes us yield ſome way even to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111926:3"/>
that which we believe not. This is moſt apparent at this
day in this Kingdome in the Caſe of Puritans, for did
accuſation and legall proceſſe take place, few crimes
would be proved againſt Puritans, and did not malicious
calumny prevaile, as few men would be proved Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
whereas now nothing is ſo monſtrous, which is
not branded upon Puritans, and no man is ſo innocent
as to eſcape that brand. So great alſo is the audacitie
of thoſe which lacerate the fames of Puritans, &amp; with
ſo much confidence doe they vent their obloquies, that
they which know the falſity thereof, &amp; eaſily perceive
that the ſame aſperſions are more truly due to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and raiſers of them, yet they are dazeled, and driven
to ſome doubtfull admittance thereof. Neither could
this audacity be ſo prevalent amongſt the vulgar, but
that Scholars, and the greateſt of the Clergie are now
become the moſt injurious deteſters &amp; depravers of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,
having taken up in Pulpits and Preſſes, almoſt as
vile and ſcurrilous a licence of fiction and detraction,
as is uſuall in Play-houſes, Taverns, and Bordelloes.
Some men divide generally all Proteſtants into Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
and Antipuritans, but I ſhall admit of ſubdiviſions
in both, for all men are not alike, which either affect or
diſaffect, either Puritans or Antipuritans. Antipuritans I
ſhall thus divide. Some Antipuritans are ſo termed
meerly becauſe they are no Puritans, but ſuch I diſlike
not, for I my ſelfe am neither the one nor other, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
merit the name of Puritan, neither doe I hate them
ſo as to profeſſe my ſelfe a Antipuritan.</p>
            <p>Others are accounted Antipuritans, becauſe they
are of the Romiſh Religion, and ſo profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but their enmity is but a due antipathy, and
as a neceſſary conſequence of their Religion, and ſuch I
take no notice of, I think Puritans expect no other from
them. Others againe there are which are very averſe
from ſome Puritanicall Tenets, and hold Puritans in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111926:3"/>
very many things erroneous, but yet they meane well
themſelves, and beare no hatred to the Perſons of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
they allow Puritans ſound in the moſt and waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
matters of faith, they hold diſſent in diſputable
things no ground of malice, and they attribute no infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
to themſelves in thoſe things wherein they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
from theſe men I am but little removed. The
worſt ſort of Antipuritans, and they which ought only
to be ſo called, are they which bitterly hate and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
many good men under the name of Puritans, and
many good things in thoſe which are Puritans, whoſe
antipathy is to mens perſons, as well as opinions, and
in opinions thoſe which are ſound, as well as thoſe
which are erroneous. Theſe are the Antipuritans which
I ſhall now ſtrive to detect, whom I hold to be of
great number and power in the State at this day, whom
wee may account the chiefeſt cauſers, and procurers of
all thoſe miſchiefs and plagues which now incumber
both Church &amp; Commonwealth, and to be guilty of all
thoſe crimes, which falſly they charge upon Puritans,
being therein like <hi>Caeſars</hi> enemies, which therefore only
hated him, becauſe they had deſerved hatred from him.
By ſuch Antipuritans is all love to goodneſſe and zeal
to the Proteſtant Religion, and all hatred of vice, and
diſlike of Popiſh Superſtition, brought into contempt.
For as they admit all true of Puritans which Papiſts
object againſt Proteſtants, ſo they account all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
almoſt (beſides their own faction) Puritans. By
ſuch is the Religion of the <hi>Scots</hi> made ridiculous; by
ſuch is the amity of the two Nations, and therein the
Honour and ſafety of the King his Crowne, and Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
much indangered. By ſuch is <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
of our Religion for hearkning therein to <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>
traduced, and another reformation attempted, by
ſuch is Antiquity preferred to obſcure Scripture, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
in Ceremonies to the diſadvantage of unity in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111926:4"/>
hearts; by ſuch is the outſide and walls of Religion
trimmed and decored, whilſt the ſoule thereof is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
or defaced; by ſuch is the Kings heart ſtolne
from his Subjects, and the Subjects eſtranged from the
King: by ſuch is the Name of Royalty pretended
whilſt a Papall Hierarchy only is intended; by ſuch is
diſſention nouriſhed in the State, that they may fiſh in
troubled waters: by ſuch is truth in other men ſtyled
faction, and faction in themſelves ſtyled truth; by ſuch
are innovations preached and printed for neceſſary
points, whilſt neceſſary doctrines in other men are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.
In the power of ſuch it now remayns to teach
and publiſh all things conſonant to their owne ends,
and to quaſh and ſilence all gainſayers, and either to
promote or detrude all Suiters for preferment at their
diſcretion being abſolutely poſſeſſed of Preſſes, Pulpits,
and the eares of great men; by ſuch are many good men
reviled and oppeſſed for their conſtancie to the true
Religion, whilſt many factious, ſemipopiſh Dunces are
unduly preferred every where for neutrality in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or ſome worſe innovation; by ſuch are Puritans
made as Sinkes and Sewers to unlode and diſcharge
their own filth into, whilſt their black railing tongues
expume nothing againſt Puritans, but what is true of
themſelves. Theſe things (if I am not deceived) will
appeare in this enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In all ages true Religion hath been odious amongſt
Heathens, and true devotion amongſt Senſualiſts, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme
appear'd to Painims meere Superſtition: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
ſeemed to the Jews groſſe blaſphemy: and now
amongſt Chriſtians Proteſtantiſme is nothing elſe but
Hereſie: and amongſt Proteſtants Zeale is miſnamed
Puritaniſme; But in this word Puritaniſme is a greater
myſtery of defamation then ever was before, it may
well bee called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is a word, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation,
fit only for theſe times wherein the ſhine of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:111926:4"/>
the Goſpell is at the brighteſt, and the malice of Satan
at the higheſt. This word ſprung up almoſt with the
Reformation, no ſooner had the woman brought forth,
but the Serpent purſued her to devoure her iſſue, and
ſhe being fled into the Wilderneſſe, this ſtreame of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
was ſpued forth after her to overtake her.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Downe</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in his Viſitation
ſpeech 1638, endevours to make it credited, that Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
have increaſed ſince the Reformation by degrees,
both in number and malice: but the contrary is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
true.</p>
            <p>Diſſent in Eccleſiaſticall Policie about Ceremonies
and other ſmaller matters, being not of the ſubſtance of
Religion, firſt gave occaſion to raiſe this reprochfull
word Puritan in the Church: but ſince that time mens
minds being better ſatisfied, &amp; peace being more firmly
ſetled about thoſe indifferent things, the more few Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
remayned, and the more moderately thoſe few
became inclined, the more furiouſly their enemies raged
againſt them. <hi>Baſtwick, Prin,</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> the only
men which Law can take hold of, are Names now as
horrid in the World, as <hi>Garnet, Faux, Ravilliack,
Preciſians</hi> have now wonne the Scene from <hi>Jeſuites:</hi>
Poyſoning of Emperours, maſſacring of Provinces,
blowing up of Parliaments are all now growne into
oblivion, and drown'd in the ſtories of Ceremony-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Howſoever as amongſt Antipuritans, ſo amongſt
Puritans (it muſt be confeſſed) there are ſome differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be obſerved. Some Puritans thinke all Puritans
alike to be loved, and all Antipuritans alike to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but ſure there is truer affinity in minde betweene
ſome which are Puritans, and ſome which are not, then
between ſome Puritans and others, or ſome of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
opinion and others. <hi>Paul</hi> unconverted equally
oppoſes <hi>Peter</hi> as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> does, and in regard of
this joynt oppoſition, both are unanimous, but even in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111926:5"/>
this oppoſition both have their oppoſite ends. <hi>Magus</hi>
oppoſes maliciouſly for ambition and lucres ſake, but
<hi>Paul</hi> ignorantly ſeeking thereby the ſame Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
whom <hi>Peter</hi> ſerves in a truer way. Therefore in
regard of the mayne end, there is more unity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> the perſecuter, and <hi>Peter</hi> the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
then betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Magus,</hi> though both
perſecuters of the ſame cauſe. The like is now viſible
in <hi>England,</hi> for every man which is an Antipuritan, is
not ſo for the ſame Reaſons, ſome have more of malice,
others are more ignorant, ſome are peſtilent Engineers,
and through the ſides of Puritans knowingly ſtab at Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
it ſelfe, others are but Engines miſimployed, or by
their own blind zeale miſled, and theſe perhaps whilſt
they perſecute Gods children, imagine they doe God a
gratefull ſervice therein.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Samaria,</hi> from an unkindly mixture of <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
and <hi>Syrians,</hi> a ſtrange <hi>heterogeneous</hi> of-ſpring different
in Religion from both did ariſe; and the like is now in
<hi>England,</hi> nay, it may be ſaid here (as it was in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
dayes) There are almoſt as many Religions as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
and as many Opinions as Men. Papiſts have
their differences, Proteſtants theirs, therefore needs
there muſt be many more differences where Papiſts
and Proteſtants live ſo confuſedly blended together.
For examples ſake, how many differences have we even
about indifferent Ceremonies; and that meerly amongſt
Proteſtants? Some men loath Ceremonies out of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
to Popery, which too ſuperſtitouſly extols them;
others again admire them for Antiquities ſake, which
before Popery innocently (yea, and perhaps profitably
for thoſe infant times of the Goſpell) uſed them. Theſe
two ſorts of men, though different, are not dangerous.
Again, ſome men are thought to diſreliſh Ceremonies
out of ſtomack to that autority which commands them;
but if there be any ſuch, I think they are very few, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111926:5"/>
ſcarce viſible to the eye of man. Others on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
give reverence to them for Poperies ſake, which
depends ſo much upon them; and I feare there are many
ſuch amongſt us. Againe, ſome men ſtand devoted to
Ceremonies, as they are the lighteſt things of the Law;
like the Tythers of Mint and Annis in the Goſpell, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
them inſtead of weightier matters, and none
are more unmercifull then theſe to ſcrupulous minded
men. Others in the meane while account all things of
the ſame moment, both great and ſmall, pretending to
ſpie ſome faults, and ſome truths on either ſide, and
therefore they hold it indifferent to aſſent to either, or
diſſent from either in any point whatſoever. But the
wiſeſt ſort conceive there may be errours on both ſides,
but not alike groſſe and pernicious, and therefore ſuch
eſchew the wrong, and apply themſelves to the right
in either ſide, yet neither honour, nor deſpiſe either ſide
alike. And theſe inſtances ſhew that all men doe not
profeſſe, or condemne Puritaniſme alike, or from the
ſame ends, and yet in the Chaos of this Country, as
things now ſtand,
<q>
                  <l>Frigida cum calidis pugnant, humentia ſiccis,</l>
                  <l>Mollia cum duris, ſine pondere habentia pondus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I could wiſh therefore that all well meaning men
would take notice of theſe things, and affect by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
not paſſion; for ſince ſome good men are Puritans,
and not all, and ſince ſome ill men are Puritans, and not
all, this ought not to be a rule of love and hatred in all
caſes alike. That which is moſt objected to Puritans, is
fury, faction, and hypocriſie: if I ſee theſe in a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
no Puritan, yet to mee Hee is a Puritan: and if I

him by his actions, uot by his words, and if <hi>Cato</hi>
be accuſed of mutiny, I cenſure him by himſelfe, not by
his accuſers, I condemne none meerly becauſe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by others; for it is uſuall for the Wolfe to ſit on the
bench &amp; condemne the Lambe at Bar, for that which is
moſt proper to the Wolfe moſt unnatural to the Lambe,
and yet this proves the Wolfe the more a Wolfe, and the
Lambe the more a Lambe. I cannot but profeſſe it, there
is nothing more ſcandalizes me at this time, then to ſee
Puritans being ſo few in number, ſo deſpicable in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
ſo harmleſſe in example, ſo blameleſſe in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
yet ſentenced and condemned in judgment, as if
they were the greateſt Incendiaries, and the only Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators
in the Chriſtian World. Doctor <hi>Heylyn</hi> a violent
pamphleter againſt Puritans, calls <hi>Burton</hi> the great <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator</hi>
of Puritans, and the Law hath paſt upon him with
great ſeverity, yet <hi>Burtons</hi> crime was that Hee wrote
againſt <hi>Altar-worſhip,</hi> and it was adjudged that his ſtyle
was ſeditious. It is not manifeſt that his intention was
ſeditious therein, and if it was ſo, it is manifeſt that He
was moſt vaine and abſurd therein as our State is now
eſtabliſht, and as our King is generally revered. They
which pretend great danger to the King likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
out of ſuch paper machinations as theſe, may have
three miſchievous ends therein. Firſt, that they may
be thought the only ſolicitous men of the Kings ſafety.
Secondly, that they may diſparage the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
loyalty. Thirdly, that they may cruſh their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Puritanicall party; but, it is thought, they which
pretend moſt danger hereby to the King: doe leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
themſelves, and therefore they doe ſpin that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection
and diviſion out of the ſufferings of <hi>Burton,</hi>
which his attempts could never have effected. Let us
then a little farther ſearch into the myſterious abuſe,
and miſapplication of this word Puritan. Thoſe whom
we ordinarily call Puritans are men of ſtrict life, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111926:6"/>
preciſe opinions, which cannot be hated for any thing but
their ſingularity in zeale and piety, and certainly the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſuch men is too ſmall, and their condition too low,
and dejected: but they which are the Devils chiefe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
in abuſing this word, when they pleaſe can ſo ſtretch,
and extend the ſame that ſcarce any civill honeſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
which is hearty and true to his Religion can avoid
the aſperſion of it, and when they liſt againe, they can ſo
ſhrink it into a narrow ſenſe, that it ſhall ſeem to be ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at none but monſtrous abominable Heretickes and
Miſcreants. Thus by its latitude it ſtrikes generally, by
its contraction it pierces deeply, by its confuſed applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it deceives inviſibly. Small ſcruples firſt intitle mee
to the name of Puritan, and then the Name of Puritan
intitles me further to all miſchiefe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> riſe up againſt <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> it is queſtioned by
ſome, whether they ſo riſe up, for the good of Religion, or
for the overthrow of wholſome Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Anſwer is ſoone made, that Epiſcopacie cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
to any but Puritans, there is no opinion can ſmell
ſharper of Puritaniſme, then that of a Church parity, and
of Puritans what good can be expected? but the Scots al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
deſire redreſſe in other grievances, and here their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is againe queſtion'd. Anſwer is as ſoone made again,
That the Scots being declared open Puritans, they muſt
needs be enemies to Monarchicall government, and that
no redreſſe can ever ſatisfie them, but ſuch as ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
royall dignity, and eſtabliſh a popular rule amongſt
them. But ſome of the Scots in ſome actions doe very
much miſdemeane themſelves, and here it's thought by
ſome, that this ought not to redound to the prejudice,
or blame of the whole Nation: but ſtrait the Antipuritan
ſteps in againe with anſwer to the former purpoſe, that
the ſame faction which makes them all Puritans, makes
them all mutiners, and that there is no truſt to be given,
nor favour ſhewed to any whoſe very religion is diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111926:7"/>
Other the like examples may be inſtanced in.
Parliaments of late in <hi>England</hi> have beene jealous of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
this laudable zeale made them at firſt come into
contempt as Puritanical, and then the imputation of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniſme
made this laudable zeale contemptible; and ſo
by degrees, as any thing elſe might be charged upon Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
as diſobedience, and diſaffection to Monarchy, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could bee charged but proceeding from Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme.
Some ſcrupulous opinions make <hi>Say, Brooks,</hi>
Puritans, Puritaniſme inferres them mutineers, mutinie
makes all that they can doe or ſay, all that they forbeare
to doe, or ſay, it makes their very thoughts wicked and
perverſe. Thus wee ſee what a confuſed impoſture there
is in this infamous terme of Puritan: but we will yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evidence by plaine inſtance how broad the devils net
is in the vaſt application of this word, and how deepe his
pit is by its abominable ſenſe, and the nature of its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that we may the better diſcover that net which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangles
ſo many, &amp; ſhun that pit which ingulphs ſo ſure.
Puritans (as I ſaid before) were at firſt Eccleſiaſticall only,
ſo called becauſe they did not like a pompous or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
kinde of diſcipline in the Church like unto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh:
but now it is come about, that by a new enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the name, the world is full of nothing elſe but
Puritans, for beſides the Puritan in Church policie, there
are now added Puritans in religion, Puritans in State, and
Puritans in morality. By this meanes whole Kingdoms
are familiarly upbrayded with this ſinne of Puritaniſme:
As for example, All in <hi>Scotland</hi> which wiſh well to the
Covenant, though ſome Papiſts, ſome Courtiers, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the whole body without exception have now
declared themſelves for it, yet all theſe are manifeſt Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.
So alſo in <hi>England,</hi> all the Commons in Parliament,
and almoſt all the ancient impartiall temporall Nobility,
and all ſuch as favour or relliſh the late proceedings of
both the houſes, which is the mayne body of the Realme,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:111926:7"/>
Papiſts, Prelates, and Courtiers excepted, nay, and its like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and more then halfe <hi>Ireland,</hi> all theſe are
Puritans. They which deprave this great Councell of
the Kingdome, ſuggeſt to the K. that the major part is
gull'd and dorde by the Puritan party; but this is only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are aſhamed to ſpeake it out openly in groſſe
termes, that all the major and better part in the Court of
Parliament is Puritanicall. But this ſuggeſtion is utterly
falſe and impoſſible, for ſuch as the major part in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, ſuch are thoſe that choſe them and ſent them
thither, and ſuch are thoſe that now approve their actions
there, and both in the elections of Parliament men, and in
the conſultations of Parliament affaires, the Kings party
is as wiſe, cautious, and vigilant (if not more) as the other
party, and no ſubtilty could circumvent or cheat them out
of their votes, if the Puritans were ſo ſmall and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a ſide, as now they make them. No man of what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
ſo ever can admit this, it is to all undeniable, that
the blame of a parliament, is the blame of the whole
Kingdome. But I returne to my Eccleſiaſticall puritan.
Though it be true that Eccleſiaſticall puritans are fewes
now, then heretofore they have been, yet it is as true that
Eccleſiaſticall puritaniſme is made a larger thing by farre
then it was, being now ſpread abroad like a net to enſnare
the more, as our many late additions and innovations te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,
which have crept into the Church (as may be ſcared)
for the vexation and moleſtation of ſuch men as were not
diſquieted with former ceremonies. It is generally ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
that our prelates have aymed at two things in
the novelties which they have lately induced into the
Church; firſt, the ſuppreſſion of thoſe which are enemies
to their pride, avarice, and ambition, by them termed
puritans: ſecondly, their owne further caſe, promotion,
and advantage. Both theſe ends ſeeme to be leveld at in
ſanctifying the Altar, and unſanctifying the Lords day, in
advancing auricular confeſſion, and corporall penances by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111926:8"/>
externall mortifications, and crying downe lecturing, and
preaching; for if we marke it, theſe new Doctrines doe
not only ſerve to terrifie and ſcandalize tender conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and thereby to deprive, and ſilence many painfull good
Miniſters, and to ſcare away into forreigne Plantations,
whole troups of Laymen, and to enwrap the reſt in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
but each of theſe doctrines beſides hath a further
reach in it of benefit to the Clergie. The Communion
Table hath lately gained a new Name, a new Nature, a
new Poſture, a new Worſhip that Emperours and Kings
may be brought again to take notice how far the perſous
and offices of Prieſts excell in ſanctity the perſons and
offices of Princes. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> within one hundred yeares
after Prelacie began to arrogate to it ſelfe was preſently
taught this leſſon, for taking his ſeat in the Chancell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Eaſterne and ancient faſhion, a Deacon
was ſent to him in great ſtate, to let him underſtand that
none but men in holy Orders might preſume to ſet their
feet on that ſacred ground. This was then the Biſhops
Law, not the Emperours, nor knowne in any other of his
Dominions, but <hi>Italy</hi> only, but ſure it was fit diſcretion,
that much ſhould bee aſcribed by Biſhops to that place,
from which they were to derive much, and which wonld
be ſure to repay their homage with ſo great an advantage
of homage back againe. Preaching is now alſo grown too
burthenſome, and the Lords Day to Prieſts according to
that ſanctity which Puritans allow it, it requires too
much praying, preaching, ſinging, which are not only to
them tedious but alſo apt means to encreaſe, and foment
Puritaniſme amongſt the people. Auricular Confeſſion
alſo is a godly deviſe to bring the Laity into ſubjection,
and to make the people bow before the power of the
Keyes, and it may aptly force the conſciences of Kings
themſelves to feare the ſcourges of gowned men. Adde
laſtly Mr. <hi>Wats</hi> his bodily mortification to Mr. <hi>Sparrows</hi>
confeſſion, and then Laymen will be ſoone inured againe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:111926:8"/>
to finde out the fitteſt penances, eſpecially <hi>Praesbyteris, &amp;
ars advolvi,</hi> and ſo in time their purſes, their bodies, their
conſciences ſhall all bee made ſenſible of the ſpirituall
Scepter of Prieſts.</p>
            <p>Its no great wonder then if our Court Divines,
and their dependents doe what they can to draw us nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
daily towards Popery, under ſhew of Antiquity,
Uniformity, and Charity, for (without all doubt) of all
Religions, Popery is the moſt beneficiall to Prieſts, moſt
tyrannous to Laymen. Neither is it ſtrange that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
ſo much zeale to devotion to the Kings Crowne and
Prerogative, as things now ſtand in <hi>England,</hi> as if none
truly affected the ſame but themſelves, for its cleare, that
they cannot ſubject the people but by the King, nor the
King without the people: and ſo long as they ſtand poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of the Kings good opinion, no man ſhall have power
to confute them.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Jawes</hi> is a great inſtance for Antipuritans, and a
great prop to the Epiſcopall Cauſe, its alleadged of him
that Hee hated Puritans for their hatred to Epiſcopacie,
and loved Epiſcopacie for its amity to Monarchie: His
Aphoriſme was, <hi>No Biſhop, no King:</hi> Let us therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
from King <hi>James</hi> in their words to King <hi>James</hi> in
his owne. In his Preface before his <hi>Baſilicon Doron</hi> his
words are: The ſtyle of Puritans properly belongs to
that vile Sect of the Anabaptiſts only called the Family
of love. Such were <hi>Browne, Penry.</hi> Howbeit there are
others which participate too much with Anabaptiſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
civill Magiſtrates, &amp;c. It is only this ſott of men
which I wiſh my ſonne to puniſh in caſe they refuſe to
obey Law, and ceaſe not to ſtirre up Rebellion. But I
proteſt upon mine Honour, I meane it not generally of
all Preachers or others, which like better of the ſingle
forme of Policie in our Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then of the
many Ceremonies in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111926:9"/>
perſwaded that Biſhops ſmell of a Papall ſupremacie, that
Surplices, Caps, &amp;c. are outward badges of popiſh errours.
No, I am ſo farre from being contentious in theſe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
things, that I doe equally love and honour the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and grave of either opinion. It can no wayes become
mee to pronounce ſentence ſo lightly in ſo old a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.
Since wee all agree in grounds, the bitterneſſe of
men in ſuch queſtions doth but trouble the peace of the
Church, and give advantage to Papiſts by our diviſion.
Theſe were the golden words of that peacefull, juſt
Prince upon his ſecond thoughts: ô that they were now
duly pondred, and taken to pieces word for word! ô that
they were eſteemed and underſtood in their own weight
amongſt us, that they might reconcile our preſent diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and that the ſame peace which followed him to
his glorious Urne, might ſtill bleſſe theſe our times! O
how contrary are theſe milde words to the unnaturall
ſuggeſtions of Antipuritans! Such as daily accuſe all
good men for Preciſians, and all preciſe men for Puritans,
and all Puritans for the only Firebrands of the World,
thus arming the King againſt his Subjects, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
raiſing Subjects againſt the King: Puritans here are
deſcribed both what they are, and what they are not, the
King had been miſinterpreted before, writing generally of
Puritans, now to avoid all miſtake, hee expreſſes himſelfe
plainly and definitely. A Puritan poſitively in King <hi>James</hi>
his ſenſe, is He which imitates Anabaptiſts in rebellion,
turbulence, and oppoſition to Law, and ſuch are liable to
Law; but negatively a Puritan in the acception of King
<hi>James,</hi> is not Hee which diſlikes Epiſcopacy, or the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Diſcipline of <hi>England.</hi> This King <hi>James</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
upon his Honour, though to his great diſhonour Hee
be now often cited to the contrary. As for thoſe which
relliſh not Biſhops and Ceremonies or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
He wiſhes them to be at peace only with thoſe of the
oppoſite opinion, Hee himſelfe vowing equall love and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:111926:9"/>
honour to the grave, and learned of either ſide, and not
taking upon him to bee a Judge in ſo old, and difficult a
controverſie; He only like a ſweet arbitrator perſwades
both parties to peace and amity. I wiſh our Biſhops
would now ſtand to this arbitration, I wiſh they would
neither condemne the Scotch diſcipline, nor urge the
Engliſh; I wiſh they would put difference betweene ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
and ſcrupulous Puritans, and not inferre the one
out of the other; I wiſh they would either diſclaim King
<hi>James</hi> as a manifeſt favourer of Puritans, or elſe imitate
him in the ſame definition, and opinion of them. K. <hi>James</hi>
further takes notice, that the reformation in <hi>Scotland</hi> was
far more diſorderly, then in <hi>England, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. whilſt
the mayne affaires there were unduly carried by popular
tumults, and by ſome fiery-ſpirited Miniſters, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten the guiding of the multitude, and finding the
reliſh of government ſweet, did fancie to themſelves a
democratick forme of policy, wherein they were likely
to be <hi>Tribuni plebis.</hi> That the Crown might be diſincom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
of theſe uſurping ringleaders, the King adviſes the
Prince to entertaine and advance godly, learned, and
modeſt Miniſters, promoting them to Biſhopricks, but
reſtrayning them heedfully from pride, ambition, and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.
Theſe things then are hence obſervable. 1. <hi>Scotland</hi>
differs from <hi>England</hi> in turbulent Miniſters: Secondly, this
is imputed to the iniquity of the times, not to Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,
as if by nature the Scots were more enclining to
Puritaniſme then other Nations. Thirdly, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that iniquity of thoſe times, there was a number ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
of worthy Miniſters fit for preferment. Fourthly,
King <hi>James</hi> erects Biſhops Sees in <hi>Scotland</hi> for pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
reaſons, and therefore He ſpeaks not of <hi>Denmark</hi> &amp;c.
Laſtly, notwithſtanding that peculiar reaſon. Hee adviſes
the Prince to be indifferently at war with both extreams
alike, as well to repreſſe Papal Biſhops, as to curbe proud
Puritans. For (ſayes the King) the naturall ſickneſſes which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111926:10"/>
have ever troubled and beene the decay of all Churches
ſince the beginning changing the Candleſtick from one to
another, have beene pride, ambition, and avarice: and
theſe wrought the overthrow of the Romiſh Church in
divers Countries. K. <hi>James</hi> knew well how apt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had ever beene to abuſe their power and pomp, what
enemies they had beene to our Saviour, and what a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
they had erected over all Chriſtendom ever ſince <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>
almoſt, and therefore though Hee diſlikes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie
in the Church, (as Hee had reaſon) yet Hee ſo
limits and circumſcribes his Biſhops both in power and
honour, that they might be as ſenſible of their chaines and
fetters, as of their Miters and Croſiers. I wiſh K. <hi>Iames</hi>
had particularly ſignified what bonds and bounds Hee
thought fit to prefix to Epiſcopacy, to preſerve it from
corruption, and what his opinion was of a Prelacy ſo
active in ſecular affaires as ours is now in <hi>England,</hi> and
how it would have pleaſed him to ſee a Metropolitan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Proteſtants almoſt a rivall to the French Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
The world, in my opinion, hath little reaſon to dote
upon a gowned Empire, we have all ſmarted long enough
under it, men of meane birth commonly beare preferment
with little moderation, and their breeding having beene
ſoft and eſſeminate, in their malice &amp; cruelty, they neereſt
of all approach to the nature of women: and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of learning they extend their power, and win up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others more then they ought. When the Church was
at firſt under Heathen or Jewiſh Governours, which
ſought as enemies to ruine it, not as Fathers to protect it,
they which were within could not live in peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
without ſome Politicall bonds, ſo at that time there
was a neceſſity of ſome coercive power, within beſides
that which was without. The world is now unſatisfied
what kinde of power that was, whether Epiſcopal or
Presbyteriall, or what Epiſcopacy, or Presbytery was in
thoſe dayes. Yet me thinks what government ſo ever
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111926:10"/>
then was, it is not neceſſarily precedentary to us now.
The Epiſcopal ſaction at this day takes advantage by the
abuſes of the Presbyter al, &amp; the Presbyterial by the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal,
and moſt men think either the one power or the
other neceſſary, and ſome more favour the Epiſcopal as
K. <hi>Iames,</hi> ſome the Presbyterial as M. <hi>Calvin;</hi> but ſure the
Presbyterial is leſſe offenſive then the Epiſcopal, and yet
neither the one nor other of neceſſity. Kings may grant
<hi>uſuram quandam juriſdictionis</hi> either to Biſhops or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but the juriſdiction it ſelfe is their owne property,
from which they ought not to depart, nor can without
wrong to their charge committed to them. For the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
which God gives the Prince, is not given for his uſe
alone, but for the peoples benefit, ſo that ſince He cannot
let it fall to decay without making it inſufficient for
good and entire government which is miſchievous to the
people, he cannot juſtly leſſen it at all. And it is manifeſt
that except one ſupream head be alone in all cauſes as wel
Eccleſiaſtical as civill, humane nature muſt needs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of thoſe remedies which are neceſſary for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
ſince power cannot be divided, but it muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed
to him which ſuffers that diviſion, and being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed
it proves inſufficient. All confeſſe ſome go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
neceſſary for men in holy Orders, to whom the
power of the Keyes belongs, but ſome account Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
but as meere temporall or Lay perſons, and therefore
conclude againſt their authority over ſacred Eccleſiaſtical
perſons as incompetent, eſpecially in caſes meerely eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall.
For this cauſe ſpirituall Governours have ever
beene in the Church to whom ſome have attributed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
right depending from none but God, and ſubordinate
to none but God, but this hath beene controverted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and no little debate and ſtrife hath followed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
But it ſeemes to me, that princes doe receive from
God a ſpirituall unction, whereby not only their perſons
are dignified, and their hearts prepared and enlarged with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111926:11"/>
divine graces fit for rule; but their functions alſo innobled
and ſanctified above any other whatſoever, and higher
advanced then the ſenſe of Laick or Secular will beare.
To Princes an aſſiſtance of counſell is requiſite in ſpirituall
as in civill affaires, but that, that Counſaile ought to bee
compoſed onely of perſons Eccleſiaſticall, or that thoſe
perſons ought to bee inveſted with all thoſe Enſignes of
Honour and Authority which our Biſhops now claime
as of divine right, ſeemes not neceſſary. Clergy-men are
not alwayes the moſt knowing in all Eccleſiaſticall caſes,
neither are they at all indifferent and impartiall, in many
which concerne their owne honour and profit, (as the
world feeles to its regret) therefore for juriſdiction they
are not the moſt competent. But be they of what uſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they may ſtill remaine ſubordinate, and at the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
election, and admitted of <hi>ad conſilium ſolum,</hi> not <hi>ad
conſenſum:</hi> and it had beene happy for all Chriſtians theſe
many hundred yeares by-paſt if they had not been further
hearkned to. The Sacerdotall function is not at all diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by this ſubordination, for whether the order of
Princes be more ſacred then that of Biſhops, or not, it is
all one to Prieſts, for an obedience they owe, and muſt
pay, be it to the one Order, or the other. Our Biſhops at
this day ſtand much upon their Divine right of Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and they refer their ſtyle to the providence of God
immediately, not to the grace of the King: and though in
words they acknowledge a Supremacy of power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to the King; yet indeed I think they mean rather a
priority of order. Whatſoever Supremacy they meane,
if it be not ſuch as makes them meerely ſubordinate, and
dependent, ſo that the King may limit, alter, or extinguiſh
their juriſdiction, as far as He may to his civil Judges, they
derogate much from his Kingly office.</p>
            <p>Biſhops for their claim of Juriſdiction ought to prove,
that they alone did exerciſe it over all in all cauſes from
our Saviours dayes, till the entrance of Chriſtian Princes:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111926:11"/>
and that being cleared, they muſt further prove, that thoſe
times alſo are leading, and precedentary to ours. In both
theſe their proofes are lame, eſpecially in the latter; for
neither is the power of the Keyes the ſame thing as Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
nor is juriſdiction now as it was in the Apoſtles
dayes, nor is the State of the times, now the ſame as
then.</p>
            <p>In thoſe dayes either Chriſtians were to implead one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
before Infidel Magiſtrates whatſoever the caſe were,
criminall or civill, ſpirituall or temporall, or elſe they
were to erect ſome tribunall in the Church, or elſe they
were to await no juſtice at all: and becauſe ſome judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
within the Church was moſt fit, therefore Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
according to the exigence of thoſe times, did indow
his Church with a divine Oeconomy, which was partly
miraculous, &amp; of uſe then, but not now. The Spirit of God
did then internally incite ſuch and ſuch men at ſuch times
to reſide &amp; preſide in ſuch &amp; ſuch places; and ſome of the
Apoſtles at ſome times could judge by inſpiration without
proofes &amp; allegations, and could execute ſentence of death
or other ſpirituall puniſhment upon ſecret hypocrites, not
intrenching upon temporall authority, but in theſe times
this diſcipline is uſeleſſe, &amp; therfore decayed. Whatſoever
the offence then was, what injury or treſpaſſe ſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
brother and brother, (the only remedy was <hi>Dic Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae,</hi>
and yet that precept ſerves as ſtrong for temporall
as ſpirituall treſpaſſes, ſo that it cannot be enforced now
to continue, unleſſe wee meane to drowne all temporall
authority. As for the extent alſo of ſpirituall power in
thoſe dayes I will onely cite a learned Politician of the
Popiſh religion: who admitting (it ſeemed) that the keyes
of heaven were given to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alone, and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours,
and not to all Biſhops and Miniſters whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
thus proceeds. By the keyes given to S. <hi>Peter</hi> many
Holy Fathers mean, the one of knowledge, &amp; the other of
power, and that that power ought not to be underſtood
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:111926:12"/>
univerſally, but only concerning the Kingdome of Heaven
which is ſpirituall: for the Civill, Royall, and Temporall
power is expreſly forbidden him by Chriſt. Even ſo that
alſo of knowledge, it is not to be underſtood of natural, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike,
or morall things, but as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, of Chriſts
myſteries only.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in matters of faith Eccleſiaſticall authority
may approve, and Secular cannot condemne, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or policy what all the Prelates in the World approve,
temporall authority may condemne. It is a great wrong
to pretend, becauſe Chriſt hath given Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
and power of the Kingdome, and forbidden him
the earthly, contrary to this precept to extend ſpirituall
things to temporall. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> often ſaith, <hi>That
Grace doth not deſtroy any thing in Nature, but leaveth her
all her owne; adding moreover divine perfection.</hi> The
Temporality hath of its own nature, power, to forbid all
things repugnant to publike quietneſſe and honeſty; and
Chriſt came not to take away this authority from Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
He only adds power to his Miniſters in matters
of faith, not knowne by nature, but revelation. For ought
wee know, this power of opening or ſhutting Heaven,
of binding and looſing ſins was miraculous, and ſo but
temporary: but admit it in this Catholike Writers ſenſe,
yet we plainly ſee, it is no prejudice at all to limit Secular
Princes thereby. The ſame learned Papiſt writes: That
the Eaſterne and Weſterne Churches continued in unity
and charity for the ſpace of nine hundred yeares after
Chriſt, and this peace was eaſily kept, becauſe the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
power was then in the Canons, to which all
Churches acknowledged themſelves equally ſubject. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
Diſcipline was then ſeverely mayntained in
each Country by its own Prelates, not arbitrarily, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
according to Canonicall rigour, none of them
intermedling in anothers government. No Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
did pretend to conferre Benefices in other Biſhops Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:111926:12"/>
or to get money out of others by way of Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
and Buls: but when <hi>Rome</hi> began to ſhake off all
ſubjection to Canons, then notwithſtanding any ancient
order of the Fathers, Councels, or Apoſtles themſelves,
inſtead of her ancient Primacy ſhe brought in an abſolute
Dominion, free from any Law or Canon &amp; this made the
diviſion. Neither could any re-union bee brought to
paſſe within theſe 700 yeares, becauſe this abuſe which
cauſed the Diviſion is not remedied. Whilſt the union
held, Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine was joyntly obſerved, that
<hi>Every one ſhould be ſubject to Princes, no man pretended to
be free from puniſhment.</hi> Nay, and after the diviſion, the
ſame opinion remayned, that every Chriſtian in temporall
buſineſſes is ſubject to the Prince. And nothing is more
temporall then offence, becauſe nothing is more contrary
to the Spirit. Amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> alſo it is ſtill held that
Biſhops ought to judge what opinion is found, what He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall,
but to puniſh thoſe of hurtfull opinions belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Secular.</p>
            <p>The State of <hi>Venice,</hi> as well as other Catholike King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
walks between two extreames, betweene Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
which have no other ayme but to diminiſh Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
authority, and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> which hath no
other ayme, but to increaſe it, and to make the Temporall
her ſervant.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> making uſe of Religion
for worldly ends and reſpects under a ſpirituall pretenſe,
but with an ambitious end and deſire of worldly wealth
and honour would free themſelves from obedience due
to the Prince, and take away the love and reverence due
by the people to draw it to themſelves. To bring thoſe
things to paſſe, they have newly invented a doctrine that
talks of nothing but Eccleſiaſticall greatneſſe, liberty,
immunity, and juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>This doctrine was unheard of, till about the year 1300,
then it began to be written ſcatteringy in ſome books, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:111926:13"/>
till 1400, there were not written above two Bookes
which treated of nothing elſe; after this ſuch Writers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
a little, but after 1560, there were ſcarce any
Books printed in <hi>Italy,</hi> but in diminution of Secular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and exaltation of the Eccleſiaſticall. And now
the people have ſcarce any other Books to read, nor have
the Confeſſors any other doctrine, or need any other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Hence comes this perverſe opinion, that Magiſtracy
is a humane invention, and to be obeyed for policy only,
not for conſcience: but that every intimation of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
perſons is equivalent to a divine precept; there
want not in <hi>Italy,</hi> pious, learned men which hold the
contrary, but they are not ſuffered to write, or print. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are forraine Books permitted, or ancient Authours
left ungelded of all which ſerves for Temporall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
as appeares by a book printed 1607, called <hi>Index Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius:</hi>
and <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth in 1595, publiſhed
a rule in his <hi>Index,</hi> that all Catholike Writers Books ſince
1515, might be corrected, not only by expunging but alſo
by interlining, and this hath beene practiſed though not
publikely above ſeventy yeares. Thus we finde the Court
of <hi>Romes,</hi> but not the Authors meaning, and finally, wee
are ſure to have no book true. I have hitherto cited this
egregious Politician, for theſe purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That we may ſee how eaſie it is for Clergie-men
to wreſt all authority out of the Temporalties hands, if
Princes will be ſo eaſie to be hood-winkt, and deluded by
them, and to reſigne their judgments to them in ſuch caſes
as concern their profit, and advancement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That we may take notice how far the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt
of Papiſts themſelves doe diſcover, and detect the
errours and tyranny of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
way of deceiving, whereby all hope of remedy is cut
off. I obſerve this alſo the rather becauſe our Prelates in
<hi>England</hi> at this day aſſume to themſelves almoſt as vaſt and
unqueſtionable a power of ſhifting and repreſſing all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:111926:13"/>
diſputes, and of authorizing and publiſhing all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
whatſoever ſavouring their cauſe, as the Court
of <hi>Rome</hi> does.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that I might produce the ſame Author againſt
himſelfe in thoſe points wherein he taxes Proteſtants. We
will yield that for the ſpace of nine hundred yeers the See
of <hi>Rome</hi> did not uſurpe over other Sees, but did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
equall ſubjection to the Canons, and that the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and ſeparation of the Eaſterne Churches happened,
when <hi>Rome</hi> arrogated above Canons; but withall we muſt
have it yielded to us, that thoſe Canons had been compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
only by Clergy-men, and that in too much favour of
Clergy-men, and too much abridgment of Temporall
Rights and Priviledges, and that they did concerne mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
more then meerly ſpirituall, and ſpeculative, and
things known by meere revelation. So that though one
Prelate did not uſurpe over another, yet all Prelates had
uſurped over the Laity from the times of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Church had Biſhops before in its times
of perſecution, but of what power or pompe? It is ſaid
of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that in regard of his ſway in <hi>Geneva,</hi> he wanted
nothing but the Name of Biſhop; and it may be as truly
ſaid of the Biſhops before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that they wanted
all but the Name.</p>
            <p>The power of Biſhops before the inſtallment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes, was rather like that of Arbitrators then of
Judges, and that held in all caſes alike, Civill and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
but in caſe of diſobedience they did not intrench ſo
far upon the Lay power, as to inflict any pecuniary, or
corporall puniſhment, but they did deny the Sacrament,
and eject delinquents out of the Congregation, and this
was then an abſciſſion from Chriſt, being done <hi>Clave non
errante:</hi> that is, whilſt God did inſpire (according to his
promiſe) a miraculous power of binding and looſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:111926:14"/>
The Prieſtly function was then an Office, not a Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
of ſacred dignity, not Power: but the Function of
a Prince was ever ſacred both for honour, and power, for
dignity and command. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great was the firſt
Prince which tooke upon him the care and protection of
the Church, after that it had ſuffered contempt and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for 300 yeares: and now did even that authority and
protection ceaſe, and devolve into his hands, which the
poore perſecuted Biſhops had but feebly managed before;
but ſuch was the extraordinary indulgence of this pious
Emperour, as well to religious perſons, as to Religion it
ſelfe, that taking little notice what the Church had gaine
by him as its Head and Governour, He heaped up greater
Titles and Honors upon Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Patriarchs,
and Popes, as if ſome other ſupreme Ruler more ſacred
and competent then himſelfe were neceſſary. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it is thought, that this was as poyſon poured into the
Church, and not Balme, for from that very time Clergy
men began to be more glorious, but leſſe gracious, more
rich outwardly, but more poore, and vile inwardly.
Within a little ſpace after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> there was juſt cauſe
of complaint that exceſſive Honours had corrupted the
Church, and that Religion had proſpered better in former
times, when it had wooden Chalices and golden Prieſts,
then now, when it had golden Chalices, but wooden
Prieſts. It is remarkable alſo, that ſoon after <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
the temporall power being too much reſtrained, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed,
and the ſpirituall as much inlarged and exalted, the
whole face of Chriſtendome began to be imbroyled with
wars, and poyſoned with hereſies, ſo that the Hiſtorians of
thoſe times have almoſt nothing elſe to write of but the
forcible inveſting and deveſting by armes of ſuch Biſhops
and Patriarchs, and of the oppoſitions of ſuch and ſuch
Councels and Synods, and of the Appeals, Jars, Schiſmes,
Excommunications, and Commotions of ſuch, and ſuch
Prieſts, and Monks. Nay, ſuch were the ill effects of thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:111926:14"/>
ages which were certainly more zealous then politike,
that they cannot yet be wholly rectified, and purged in
theſe our latter times, which are growne too too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
being more politike then zealous: Thus did the
Church fare for 900 yeares till the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops
began to Empire above all, and then did the greateſt
part of the Clergie themſelves, eſpecially Eaſt from
<hi>Italy,</hi> make their departure and ſeparation. Neither did
the Romiſh Vice-god after this great rent and diviſion
in the World hang his head for ſhame, or ſeeke any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
by letting fall his pompous, painted plumes, but
audaciates himſelfe rather to mount higher yet, and to
detrude the Weſtern Emperour quite out of the bounds
of <hi>Italy.</hi> And in this, his induſtry fails him not, for after
much bloud-ſhed in many cruell conflicts Hee gains in
<hi>Italy</hi> a Temporall, and in all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides a ſpirituall
Monarchy, making a triple Mitre ſhine as gloriouſly
upon the ſeven-hilled City, as the Diadem had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
During his wars with the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi>
He had other conteſtations alſo with <hi>England,</hi> and ſome
other Potentates at ſometimes, but all diſmaid him not,
only once Hee was heard to ſay, <hi>It was time for him to
compound with the Dragon, that hee might cruſh the leſſer
Adders at his pleaſure.</hi> Yet after this even this Holy
tyranny grows too inſolent and inſufferable, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires
its owne diſſolution, ſo that many Countries in
the Northweſt parts lying more remote from <hi>Rome,</hi>
quite revolt from her Allegeance, and Proteſt againſt
her. Amongſt thoſe other Countries alſo leſſe diſtant,
which ſtill in words confeſſe her Supremacy, her
Reigne is now but little more then precarious: <hi>Venice</hi>
regards not Buls and Anathemacs, <hi>France</hi> diſdains a
yonger brothers benediction, and <hi>Spain</hi> being honoured
with the title of the Popes eldeſt Son, confeſſes him a
Fathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but employs him as a Chaplain, gives verball,
but reaps reall honours by him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:111926:15"/>
               <hi>Auguſtus</hi> having caſhiered an unworthy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
gave him leave to ſay, that he had caſhiered <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus:</hi>
and ſo the Popes great ſonnes ſhake off his
yoke by degrees, but conceal it, and give him leave to
doe the like.</p>
            <p>It is now very good policy in the Pope, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Temporall things as they ſtand <hi>in ordine,</hi> or
have relation to ſpiritual things, but rather to relinquiſh
his right to ſpirituall things, as they ſtand in order
to Temporall: it is eminent wiſdome in him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
threatning, roaring, curſing, and ſending his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Epigrams, out of his owne Territories: as hee
was wont to doe: Nay, his very laſt refuge of ſending
forth his poyſoning and ſtabbing Miniſters cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
in ſeaſon much longer. But to returne to our
learned Stateſman: as Hee juſtly taxes the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſo He unjuſtly taxes Proteſtants of the contrary
extream, and this will appeare out of his own words.
For He grants, firſt, that the Secular Magiſtrates have
nothing diminiſhed of their authority by Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
and it is cleere that Princes were abſolute Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Church before Chriſt both in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and Temporall Caſes.</p>
            <p>In the next place Hee yields, that the power and
knowledge of Clergy-man called the power of the
Keyes, is no other but ſuch as Chriſt infuſes in ſmeere
ſupernaturall things, knowne only by Faith and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
not by any Phyſicall, or Ethicall Principles;
but it is eaſily proved by us, that ſuch power can extend
to no proper juriſdiction at all in humane affaires, but is
a meere ſpeculative motion, and ſuch wee deny not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hee yields that in Juriſdiction there bee
three things diſtinct.</p>
            <p>Firſt, matter of Law.</p>
            <p>Secondly, matter of fact.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:111926:15"/>
Thirdly, matter of execution: whereby retribution
is made to every fact according to Law. The firſt of
theſe, and that in Spirituall Caſes alone being tryable
by Clergy-men only. Admit this and nothing follows,
but that things meerly Spirituall, are beſt knowne to
Spirituall perſons, there is no power here concluded.
As for example. In caſe of Hereſie, that I hold ſuch
an opinion, muſt appeare by witneſſes and proofs, and
herein all kinds of witneſſes beſides Clergy-men are
competent.</p>
            <p>Next, that this opinion is hereticall, requires the
judgement of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, but it does not
follow, if they be the fitteſt Judges herein, that they
muſt be the ſupreme Judges herein, and not aſwell
Dependent and Subordinate as our Civill Judges are
in common actions. But in the laſt place, that ſuch
an hereticall opinion ſo dangerous and peſtilent to the
Church and Common-wealth ought to be corrected or
cradicated by ſuch coercive force, and the raiſing of
that force whereby it is to be puniſhed is in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in the power of the Supreame Magiſtrate,
for two Magiſtrates cannot have a Supreame power of
the ſame ſword. Either the Secular muſt command
the Eccleſiaſticall, or the Eccleſiaſticall muſt command
the Secular, as to coercive power, or a worſe confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then either muſt needs follow.</p>
            <p>So then, it is the Execution of Juſtice alone, which
is eſſentiall to the Supreame Governour, Matter of
Law requires a Counſellour, matter of Fact a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Matter of Execution alone intimates a Prince,
and that Principality cannot bee divided betwixt two
perſons of a ſeverall nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:111926:16"/>
From hence then it appeares plainly that no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
differing from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> aſcribes more
to Clergy men, then this firſt point of adjudging
according to the Law of God in things Divine; and
this implyes rather a dependent, then an independent
condition in the Judge: and in this Proteſtants joyne
with full conſent. But all this while I finde my ſelfe
in a digreſſion: my ſcope is not to prove that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
doe attribute ſufficient to Prieſts, it lies upon
mee to prove that they attribute too much to them, and
herein I am to undertake not only the Epiſcopall, but
the Presbyteriall ſide alſo, not only Proteſtant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
but even Maſter CALVIN that great Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate
alſo.</p>
            <p>Divines have much trumped the World hitherto in
not ſetting forth the true bounds and limits of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
Juriſdiction, but if I miſtake not, the firſt
power (which they claime as moſt eſſentiall) they take
to be the power of the Keyes, though they define not
certainly, what that is, whether a Power, or
Office; or to whom belonging, or of what extent,
and continuance.</p>
            <p>The ſecond power which they inſiſt upon, as next
iſſuing out of the power of the Keyes, is in Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
Ordination of Miniſters, Expoſition of
Scriptures, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The third and more remote kinde of cauſes wherein
they challenge an Eccleſiaſticall power, is of ſuch as
concerne Matrimonie, Teſtaments, Hereſies, Faſts,
Tythes, and Immunnities of Clergymen, &amp;c. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubtleſſe they would proceed, but that theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
ſo much of the Temporality, and diſcover their
trumpery; but I have ſaid, if in all theſe caſes Clergy
men are neceſſarily more knowing and impartiall then
all the elſe, there is neceſſity of their Counſell to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111926:16"/>
matter of Law, but not of their Conſent in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
coercive, and forcible remedies for the execution of
Law. I have ſaid alſo that Clergy-men being as well Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
of the Common-wealth as ſons of the Church, and
theſe Caſes importing as well perturbance of the State as
annoyance to the Church, that there can be but one Head
which ought to have command over both, and in both. It
is manifeſt alſo that many Caſes are partly temporall, and
partly ſpirituall, and that ſcarce any is ſo temporall, but
that it relates in ſome order to ſpirituall things, or any ſo
ſpirituall, but that it hath ſome relation to temporall
things, ſo that the true ſubject of Eccleſiaſticall and civill
juſtice cannot rightly be divided. Further, alſo it is as
manifeſt that where any doubt, ſtrife, or uncertainty may
ariſe between one Iuriſdiction, and another, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
any ſupreame power of deciſion, no aſſured
peace can continue, and by conſequence no ſtability or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
ſubſiſtence to either, is to be expected. It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
therefore to be inferred, that either the Temporall or
the Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrate muſt bee in all Caſes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
predominant, and that ſince the Eccleſiaſtical ought
not by Chriſts owne command, therefore the temporall
ought, as hath been further proved by ſundry arguments,
and Scripture proofes alledged out of this famous Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.
So much of the temporall power, and its neceſſary
Supremacie: my endevour ſhall be now to maintain that
no Eccleſiaſticall power is at all neceſſary in meere Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
perſons.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> according to the Popiſh grounds main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
that ſpirituall juriſdiction differs from temporall,
&amp; is not incompatible but aſſiſtant therto, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
not the ſame ends, but ſeverall, which by ſeverall
meanes may be the better compaſſed. But the ſpirituall
Magiſtrate (as I conceive) can propoſe no other end, then
what the Secular ought to ayme at, for either the Prince
ought to have no care at all of the Honour of God, and
the good of men, and that which is the prime meane of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111926:17"/>
both, true Religion, or elſe his ends muſt bee the ſame
which the Prelate aymes at, <hi>viz.</hi> to vindicate Religion
by removing and correcting ſcandalous offenders. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
to preſerve the innocent from contagion by the
ſeparation of open offenders. Thirdly, to prevent further
obduration, or to procure the amendment of ſuch as have
tranſgreſſed by wholſome chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>This is beyond all controverſie, as alſo that the Perſon
and Power of a Prince, are as ſacred to effect theſe ends,
as the Prelates: and certainly, God did not ſo ſanctifie
their perſons and offices for any leſſe end. And therefore
in ancient times Holy Biſhops did Preach and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
nothing more to Princes then the care of Religion,
though proud Prelates now arrogate this onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and though it be ſtill apparent, that no offence is
ſo ſpirituall but that it is a civill evill, as well as a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
to Religion: forſomuch as true Religion is the
foundation of a State. And this could not bee, neither
were Princes anſwerable to God for the corruption of
Religion, if God had not given them a ſupreame power,
and that effectuall to bring all offenders whatſoever to
confeſſion, ſatisfaction, and contrition or to expell them
the congregation by themſelves, or their ſurrogates.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> inſtances in adultery &amp; drunkennes, &amp;c.
and ſayes, that the temporall power puniſhes theſe by
externall force, and for publick examples ſake, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the State, but the Spirituall Judge puniſhes them
without force internally for the amendment of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent.
Hee might as well have named ſwearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſtealing, murdering, and all ſinnes whatſoever,
and ſo have made all men twice puniſhable, and the
Eccleſiaſticall Courts as full of buſineſſe as the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
to the great vexation of the State, and danger of
diviſion, out of this falſe ground onely that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
power hath not a competence for the amendment
of off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nders, or for the care of Religion, but only for the

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:111926:17"/>
This is a way to erect <hi>regnum in regno,</hi> and to maintaine ſuch
concurrent juriſdictions, as cannot poſſibly ſtand together, for all
being ſubject to ſin and offence, as well the Spirituall as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
either the one or other muſt goe unqueſtioned, and this may
produce diviſion: or elſe both; and that will cauſe moſt certaine
confuſion. Both ſides here ſeem ſtrangely puzled, the rigideſt of
the Epiſcopall faction allow Princes a coercive power over
Prieſts, and Prelats, where they performe not what their duty is
in their functions or juriſdictions, and this power requires a
higher power of ſummoning, arraigning, and legally trying them:
and yet the moderateſt of the Presbyteriall faction would have
Princes queſtionable, tryable and puniſhable by the Spiritualty.
This is a groſſe confuſion, which will appeare to bee ſo more
plainely in the ſequell; when it is more fully cleared, that to
Princes alone God has preciſely committed <hi>utram<expan>

            <p>Tis true, as <hi>Calvin</hi> alleadges, Princes are ſons of the Church,
they are in it, not above it: the word intruding the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall,
ſuch as is both militant and triumphant; paſt, preſent,
and future, for that hath no other head but Chriſt: to that all
Princes and Prieſts are equally ſons: but take Church for ſuch or
ſuch a Nationall, Locall Church, and then the Prince is head
thereof, under Chriſt; and the Clergie are part of his charge,
and under his protection. The ſame man alſo may in diverſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
be both father and ſon to the ſame man without confuſion
of relations. A King, a Biſhop may hear the Word, &amp; receive the
Sacrament from an inferiour Miniſter; a Subject may be naturall
Father to his Prince, and in this reſpect a filiall ſubjection is due
from the ſuperiour, and ſo a King may referre his owne caſe to
his Chancellor, yet this deſtroyes not the greater, higher, and
more generall ſuperiority in other things, at other times. And
to me it ſeemes that even in the exerciſe of the Keyes, the Prieſt
officiates under the Prince, as the Chancellor does in matters of
Law, even when the Kings owne caſe lyes in Judgement before
him, and when perhaps he makes a decree againſt his owne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and contrary to his owne Maſters private advertiſement:
and yet the King is not properly either Lawyer, or Theologue,
though both are actuated, and organiz'd as it were, by the ſoule-like
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111926:18"/>
commanding, over ſeeing, and over-ruling of his more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and divine power.</p>
            <p>Herein the Prieſt alſo may learn a limitation from the Lawyer,
for though the Judge be bound to pronounce right judgement
againſt his owne Maſter, yet this holds not in all caſes alike; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his limited condition, for in Criminall caſes ſuch as
concerne the ſafety of the Kings owne perſon, or the royall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his calling, therein judgement muſt be utterly mute. And
therefore it is a weake argument of Maſter <hi>Calvin,</hi> though it be
his beſt; when he inferres a neceſſity of an Eccleſiaſticall Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
from hence, becauſe elſe the Prince himſelfe wanting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
ſhould eſcape free: for the reaſon is the ſame in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Law; the King is not queſtionable, or reſponſible, for
perſonall crimes, and yet this is held no politicall miſchiefe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
if the Prince ſhall not goe unqueſtioned, or undiſciplin'd
by the Spirituall, yet the ſupreme ſpirituall Magiſtrate muſt, and
this is an equall, if not a greater miſchiefe: for both cannot be
equally lyable to the judgement of each other. Neither is it to
much purpoſe that the example of Biſhop <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſo harſhly, ſo
unreverendly treating pious penitent <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> is ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cited alwayes by either faction Epiſcopall and Presbyteriall;
for though the name of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> be great, yet I will crave leave
to ſpeake as an advocate againſt him in the name of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Theodoſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reverend Sir, you take upon you to be a judge over me, and
to condemne me of a bloody Maſſacre committed unjuſtly at
<hi>Theſsalonica,</hi> and being ſo condemned, you proceed againſt me
with your ghoſtly puniſhment, ſubjecting me to your Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
ſeverity: But I pray conſider what miſchiefes may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
hereupon; if Emperours may bee puniſhable by Biſhops,
then common equity requires that Emperours have the benefit of
a faire hearing and arraignment, or elſe were their condition
more miſerable then the condition of the meaneſt vaſſals: for as
Princes actions are more inſcrutable, and their counſels more
myſticall; ſo alſo their ends are for the moſt part more lyable to
envy, and miſinterpretation: It is not poſſible for you without
due diſcuſſion, inquiry, and examination of impartiall witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
perfectly to underſtand all the true circumſtances, reaſons,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:111926:18"/>
and grounds of this my fact; and without this underſtanding
it is not poſſible for you to pronounce a juſt cenſure againſt
me. It's neceſſary then that ſome Tribunall be prepared for
you, and ſome Bar for me, that upright ſentence may paſſe,
and that juſtice may be done underſtandingly, and upon this
it muſt needs follow that I am your meere Subject, and muſt
lay downe my Scepter to bow my ſelfe under your Croſier,
till this difficulty be fully ended. Admit this alſo, and then
you may uſe what procraſtination you pleaſe in this intricate
deciſion; or in the like manner queſtion me of all other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities,
and ſcandalous deviations, which rumor, envy,
or treaſon it ſelfe forges againſt me; and thus ſhall I have
no leaſure to judge other men, it will ſcarce be poſſible for
me to acquit my ſelfe in judgement from other men: that
power which God hath put into my hands for the protection
of ſo many Myriads, will be utterly diſabled by that higher
power which is put into your hands over me. By the ſame
reaſon alſo that I am to render an account to you in this
place, I am to render the like to all your ſuperiours, equals,
or inferiours in other juriſdictions, of all ſinnes whatſoever,
whether reall, or imputable, Eccleſiaſticall, or Civill, ſo
that no end is like to be of my tryals, purgations, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, my crime is ſenſibly evident; if I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
this, you could not prove it ſo; and if I would not
confeſſe this, you could not force me, for it was a politicall
thing, and farre off acted: and my meere confeſſion can give
to you no juriſdiction. But be my crime as manifeſt in it ſelfe
as the diſobedience of <hi>Saul</hi> was to <hi>Samuel,</hi> or as <hi>Davids</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was to <hi>Nathan,</hi> or as <hi>Solomons</hi> incontinence was to all
the world, or as <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his Idolatry: yet why ſhould I
ſuffer more then they? What new coercive, vindicative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
have Prieſts gained over Princes by Chriſts Goſpell,
which the Jewiſh Prieſts never uſed, claymed, or heard of?
If Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be now neceſſary, ſure it was in
uſe before Chriſt; and then wee ſhould have heard of ſome
Kings Excommunicated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by ſome Prieſts; for if the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
power had not of its owne nature a competent force
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:111926:19"/>
and habitude to reſtraine all things repugnant to publike
quietneſſe, and honeſty, a Spirituall power was neceſſary; and
yet we read of none ſuch. But if there was a ſufficiency in the
Temporall power, as is moſt manifeſtly apparent; then we
cannot imagine that Chriſt came to take away any of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from Magiſtrates: but that power which he added,
was rather an excellency of grace and vertue in matters of
faith, and illumination.</p>
            <p>It cannot bee alleadged by you, that that puniſhment is
meerely ſpirituall, and ſo no politicall evill: for as it puts
other men into the condition of Publicans, Heathens, and
worſe; ſo it further yet degrades, diſables, and oppreſſes
Princes. How ſhall he be honoured and obeyed as the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent
of God in all cauſes, whom the Laity ſees ejected out
of the Church, and expelled out of the Communion of the
faithfull, as a rotten contagious member? how ſhall hee be
held more ſacred then a Prieſt, whom the ſentence, interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and the confounding blow of a Prieſts ſpirituall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
ſhall render ſo contemptible, miſerable, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
in the eyes of the world?</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being accuſed in matters of Doctrine, made his
appeale to a wicked Heathen Emperour; and yet now a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
godly Emperour being accuſed by any Church-man, no
appeale is allowed, though in meere civill accuſations.
Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes did either endure ſome new power not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
known to the world, or not; if it did, then our Saviours
Goſpell came into the world to the detriment of civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which is contrary to Religion, and all reaſon: and if
no new addition of power were imported, then <hi>Tiberius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
though a Heathen, and Tyrant, remained as abſolute as
before; and yet in his time there was more neceſſity of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
judicature, then is now. But you will ſay, if
Princes be not ſubject to ſome chaſtiſement, then ſome ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
muſt paſſe unremediable. Not ſo, for here God is the
revenger, and ſtrikes often, as he did <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah;</hi> but if not, yet
either the Temporall or Spirituall Governour muſt paſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtiz'd,
which is all one; for two Supreames cannot be, nor
no entire government without ſome ſupremacy, nor no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111926:19"/>
without immunity, and exemption from judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The perpetuall conflicts and conteſtations betweene Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Prelates, which are likely to enſue, will ſoone cleere
this; that either Princes muſt at laſt ſubmit to the tribunals
of Church-men, and raigne at their diſcretion; or elſe Church-men
muſt ſubmit to them: for both tribunals cannot ſtand
compatible. For my part, I excuſe ſo grave a Father as you
are, of ambition herein; and therefore I am the leſſe cautious
in ſubmitting my ſelfe at this time: but I conceive this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
may bee the ground of dangerous conſequences to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and therefore I deſire it may not from me paſſe into a
preſident for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Let not proud Prelates from this my voluntary humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
arrogate to themſelves as if it had beene due; or derogate
thereby from the more ſacred order of Princes: neither let
Princes from this particular learne to yeeld to any Spirituall
Monarchy whatſoever. My beliefe is, that the Prince is the
Head, the Fountaine, the Soule of all power whatſoever, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
or Temporall; wherein he ought not to indure at all
any kinde of rivality of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, nor can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of any diminution in any part of his juriſdiction, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence to God, dammage to his charge, and danger to
himſelfe. So much for <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ſo much for that juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
which is due to Prelates: I ſhould now ſpeake of the
exerciſe thereof, as it is granted by the favour of Princes, but
this is a very tender point.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes to ſome, that Princes ought not to incumber men
in Sacred Orders, in any kinde of judicature which is not
purely Spirituall; nor that Prelates can accept of any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
imployment whatſoever, without diſhonour to their
Orders, and neglect to their cure of Soules: and yet now
none ſo greedy of ſuch imployment. A ſacred place may not
be put to ſecular uſes, that's prophane: but a ſacred perſon
may, that's honourable.</p>
            <p>A Biſhoprick now adayes is but a Writ of eaſe, to diſmiſſe
from Preaching, and attending Gods ſervice; whereby the
man is preferred from the Church to the Court, from the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111926:20"/>
Altar to ſome Tribunall, from Gods ſpirituall to the Kings
temporall affaires. In the High Commiſſion, at the Councel
Table, in the Star-chamber, and the Chequer, Churchmen
are now more active then in their owne Conſiſtories, and yet
their ambition further aimes (as 'tis ſaid) to the Chancery,
Court of Requeſts, &amp;c. which could not chuſe but redound
to the ſcandall of Religion, the obſtruction of Juſtice, and
vexation of the Subject: if there were not learned and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men enough in Policy and Law to ſerve the King, unleſſe
Divinity were deprived of ſome of her followers, there were
ſome ſeeming umbrage why the King might borrow of God;
but when Gods more holy office is neglected, that the Kings
meaner may be the worſe adminiſtred, the world much gazes
and wonders at it.</p>
            <p>The functions of Divines are too ſacred for any ſecular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to officiate, and therefore it ſhould ſeeme, their perſons
alſo ought to be too ſacred for ſecular functions; for it ſeems
prepoſtrous, that it ſhould be thought an honour to Prieſts
to relinquiſh ſpiritual, and adhere to temporall imployments.
<hi>Nic: Machiavell</hi> did obſerve that Chriſtian Religion had long
ſince falne to the ground had not the regular ſtrictneſſe of
poore inferiour Prieſts and Fryers held, and propped up the
reputation of it in the World, as much as the pride and luxury
of the great Cardinals, and Prince like Biſhops, did ſtrive to
ſinke and demoliſh it. The ſame obſervation holds true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us Proteſtants at this day, for the more our Prelates
enjoy, the more ſtill they ſeeke; and all our three Kingdomes
are growne ſo ſicke of their pride, injuſtice, and pragmaticall
faction, that ſcarce any remedy but bloud-letting can cure
them. We finde in Scripture the moſt high and holy Offices
of Religion performed by Princes, even amongſt, and above
the greateſt of Prieſts; but we ſcarce finde any inſtance at all
where Prieſts intermedled with any State affaires, either
above, or under Princes: and yet with us now the imploying
and entruſting of Clergy-men in Temporal buſineſſes, is held
as politick as it was in times of Popery: although no time
could ever juſtly boaſt of that uſe. But to paſſe over Temporal
buſineſſes, how violent have our Biſhops beene in their owne
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111926:20"/>
Canons about Ceremonies, and indifferencies? and what
diſturbance hath that violence produced? They ſtrive as for
the beauty and glory of Religion, to bring in the ſame former
of Liturgie, the ſame poſture of the Communion-Table, the
ſame geſture at the Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all our three Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
as if uniformity were alwayes beautifull: and yet we
ſee, all men are created with ſeverall faces, voyces, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions,
without any deformity to the univerſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis not externall variety, but internall diſſention, which
ſpoyles the harmony of Religion; and diſſention is more nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
by the harſhnes of Paſtors over their flocks, eſpecially
over the weake ones in ſcruples, then by permitting various
Rites and Formes in the externall worſhip of God. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
liberty and variety in indifferences, and Ceremonies is
more favour'd in Scripture, than any univerſall ſimilitude, or
rigorous force whatſoever, over the perplexed, anxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of weake men. We ſee in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where there is
no Ceremonies, they enjoy that uniformity without conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which wee ayme at onely, and ſeeke to purchaſe with
infinite debate, and perſecution; and under their peace and
unity, the Proteſtant Religion thrives, and Romiſh Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
utterly ceaſes: whereas under our ſtrife and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Religion and true Devotion is over-run, and over-growne,
like Corne choaked with weeds. Nay, it is thought
that if our Biſhops had bin more gentle-handed all this while
towards ſuch as diſreliſht Ceremonies for Poperies ſake, and
had rather pitied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as men of tender conſciences, than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
and defamed them, as ſeditions Puritans, theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
had not laſted ſo long: for when the reformation was
not yet fully perfected, the Puritans of thoſe dayes were more
fiery than now; but not being ſo odious in the Church, leſſe
combuſtion followed thereupon: whereas now they are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully
heated, that no moderate complyance can ſerve
the turne.</p>
            <p>There ſeemes now little remaining of Puritaniſme, but the
breathleſſe carkas of it, and yet till that too be interred and
conſumed, no truce can be admitted. The very ſufferings of
Puritans now are ſufficiently quit, and imputed as the effects
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:111926:21"/>
of their owne malice, their puniſhment is argument enough
for the deſert of their puniſhment; the more they have borne,
the more they muſt now beare; and the more they now beare,
the more they ſhall hereafter. Fury is one of the maine thing;
objected to Puritans; but in truth, the World has not any
thing more furious then ſuch as moſt pretend againſt them.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the hatred of Puritans flowes and deſcends
from the higheſt of the Clergie to the loweſt: and young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in the Vniverſity know it now their wiſeſt courſe to
ſtudy the defamation of Puritans, as the firſt and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
point of their learning and qualification, and as their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
path to promotion. And to make their deteſtation ſure,
and themſelves irreconciliable, they muſt ingage themſelves
by ſome notable ſervice of novelty, quarrelling with ſome
point of Proteſtantiſme, or refining ſome point of Popery;
they muſt taxe Proteſtants as ſome ways injurious to Princes,
or extoll Papiſts as zealous obſervers of Antiquity. It muſt
be maintained that Royalty cannot ſtand without the prop of
Epiſcopacy, though it never yet found greater enemy; and
that Puritaniſme only hinders the ſtretching of our Religion,
or elſe Papiſts and we ſhould ſoone agree. Thoſe of vulgar
wits which ſerve not for ſuch ſtraines, that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
from ſuſpicion of Puritaniſme, muſt doe ſomething
factiouſly, or be vitious, or elſe their hopes of preferment
are almoſt deſperate.</p>
            <p>Charity to Papiſts, conformity to Ancient Fathers, and
decent uniformity amongſt our ſelves, are the ſpecious colors
wherewith they dreſſe and deck all their pretenſes; for want
of Sectaries living in theſe days, they rake out of their toombs
<hi>Hacket, Copinger, Browne, &amp;c.</hi> to upbraid us, for want of
oppoſites enow here in <hi>England,</hi> they calumniate the <hi>Scots</hi>
to our diſhonour; for want of true imputations, they forge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
crimes how monſtrous ſoever, and their moſt ſure one is,
that which is moſt undiſcernible, hypocriſie. Nevertheleſſe it
muſt bee beleeved that the Antipuritan diſparages not our
Anceſtors in the reformation, but for love of antiquity; not
teares in ſunder the bonds of Religion, Nature, Policy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two the moſt cloſe-united Nations of the World, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111926:21"/>
out of love to unity: nor fills whole Kingdomes with bloud,
but out of love to Order. Such was ſure <hi>Diogenes</hi> his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
trampling upon <hi>Platoes</hi> Couches; ſuch was <hi>Neroes</hi> unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
ſetting on ſire the ſtreets of <hi>Rome:</hi> Such was <hi>Procuſtes</hi>
his ſymmetry, cutting his gueſts according to his beds. And
therefore its thought <hi>Puritans</hi> are not ſo much hated for their
oppoſition to Ceremonies, as Ceremonies are multiplied, and
inforced for ſuppreſſion of all zealous Chriſtians, under the
umbrage of <hi>Puritans:</hi> and that for the ſame purpoſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Piety have blown thoſe coales which they might have
quenched.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Downe</hi> makes a very ſharpe ſpeech to the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as being very diſobedient, and animated
therein by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Covenanters; but his chiefeſt eloquence
uttered againſt his owne Countrymen the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom he
paints forth as the chiefeſt Traytors, perjured Rebels, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
and Hypocrits in the World: nay, he denounceth them
worſe than Anabaptiſts, and ſuch as have more than juſtified
the <hi>Powder-Traytors,</hi> and all the rebellious practiſes of the
<hi>Jeſuites:</hi> Afterwards he addes alſo, That <hi>Puritaniſme</hi> is not
the Nationall ſin of <hi>Scotland</hi> only, but that they of the ſame
faction in <hi>England</hi> had beene as deep in the ſame condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that they had not ſo much power. See here the
lively portraiture of an <hi>Antipuritane,</hi> ſee a true <hi>Boner</hi> revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
againe, but in <hi>Proteſtant</hi> habit; and for ought I ſee, here
are none exempted from this black venomous cenſure in all
the Kings Dominions, but thoſe of the Popiſh and Epiſcopall
Faction. It's not to be wondred at that the King thinks ill of
his Subjects, or that <hi>Burton</hi> or <hi>Prin</hi> ſuffered worſe then Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
merits: It's rather to be wondred at, that our ſtreets doe
not runne with blood dayly, ſince this is the Goſpell our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Fathers of the Church preach. This ſpeech was
thought worthy to be diſperſed in Print over all our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
in Engliſh; but ſince, becauſe it redounds ſo much to
the honour of the three Nations, and the repute of <hi>Proteſtant
Religion,</hi> it's Tranſlated into Latine, and Coppies are Printed
for all Chriſtendome to take notice of. In this ſpeech its ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that <hi>Puritans</hi> who began about 80 yeares ſince, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from bad to worſe by ſix degrees; firſt they did diſlike,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:111926:22"/>
then contemne Biſhops; then they did diſobey their juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
then ſeparate themſelves; then they fell into the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
of holding no difference betweene Biſhop and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
laſtly, they rebelled, and grew more immoderate than
<hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> And here Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> is alledged, who ſayes,
That the contempt of Biſhops is the beginning and ground
of all Hereſies and Schiſmes.</p>
            <p>Here we ſee what <hi>Puritanes</hi> are, the moſt curſed Miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
on earth; next we ſee who <hi>Puritans</hi> are, all ſuch as hold
not with Epiſcopacy: that is in probability halfe <hi>Ireland,</hi>
more then halfe <hi>England,</hi> all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and many other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Countries. King <hi>James</hi> did put a difference betwixt
ſuch as diſreliſht Biſhops, and Ceremonies meerly, and ſuch
as under that pretext fraudulently ſought to perturbe the
State, and make a factious ſeparation. But here the difference
of all <hi>Puritans</hi> is graduall only, not ſubſtantiall; for diſlike
of Biſhops is the beginning of all <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and muſt needs end
in <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> and rebellion.</p>
            <p>How plainly does it here appeare, that Epiſcopacy is the
true <hi>Helena</hi> of all this warre; and yet Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> is to be
underſtood of the Paſtorall function, not of the Eccleſiaſticall
juriſdiction of a Biſhop, or elſe in his ſenſe the <hi>Genevans,</hi>
and the greateſt part of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are Heretiques, and
King <hi>James</hi> made a frivolous diſtinction. Such ſtuffe as
this had not miſ-beſeemed a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but its very odde in a
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Biſhop; except wee conſider him, as one who
hath looke back towards the <hi>Onions</hi> and <hi>Fleſh-pots</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
and is inamor'd again upon thoſe glorious titles &amp; enſignes of
Honour, and Pompe, which <hi>Rome</hi> confers upon her Courtiers.
But to conclude this point, I wiſh Princes would not allow
ſuch Biſhops to be carvers to themſelves, and make them
Judges in caſes of their owne intereſſe: they are ſurely good
ſpectacles for Princes in Theologicall deliberations, as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Counſellors are in State affaires; but miſerable are
thoſe Princes whoſe eyes cannot ſee without ſuch ſpectacles.
If Religion did not proſper worſe, if peace were not more
violated, if perſecution were not more common in Countries
wher Biſhops govern, than where they are expelled, we might
ſuſpect the <hi>Scots,</hi> as Hereticall, and Rebellious by nature; for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:111926:22"/>
chuſing all the plagues of warre rather then Biſhops: but
when we ſee the contrary, we may aſwell liſten to the <hi>Scots</hi>
againſt Biſhops, as to Biſhops againſt the <hi>Scots.</hi> So much of
the Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Puritan,</hi> next after whom ſprung up the
<hi>Puritan</hi> in Religion, of whom I ſhall ſpeak very briefly.</p>
            <p>There are many men amongſt us now, which brooke
Biſhops and Ceremonies well enough; and perhaps favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
interpret our late innovations; and yet theſe may be too
grave to eſcape the name of <hi>Puritans.</hi> To be a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> may
be allowed, but to diſpute againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſmels of preciſeneſs:
to hold the <hi>Pope</hi> fallible is tolerated, but to hold him Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
is abominable <hi>Puritaniſme:</hi> to goe to Church is faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
but to complaine of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> or to be grieved at the
publick countenance of <hi>Popery,</hi> whereby it intwines our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and now drinkes up that Sap which is ſcarce afforded
to <hi>Proteſtantiſme,</hi> or at all to take notice how far ſome of our
Divines are hereat conniving, if not cooperating, is a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of a deepe infected <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that is not moderate in Religion is a <hi>Puritan,</hi> and hee
that is not a <hi>Caſſandrian,</hi> or of Father <hi>Francis Syncters</hi> faith,
is not moderate: he ſavours too much of <hi>Calvins</hi> groſſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
exploded now by our fineſt wits. But I paſſe from this
kinde of <hi>Puritan</hi> to another; whom I ſhall call my Politicall
<hi>Puritan;</hi> for the bounds of <hi>Puritaniſme</hi> are yet larger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
men of other conditions.</p>
            <p>Some there are yet which perhaps disfavour not at all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Eccleſiaſticall Policy, or moderate <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
this is not ſufficient to acquit them from the name of
<hi>Puritans,</hi> if they aſcribe any thing to the Lawes and Liberties
of this Realme, or hold the Prerogative royall to be limitable
by any Law whatſoever. If they hold not againſt <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and with <hi>Ship-money,</hi> they are injurious to Kings; and to
be injurious to Kings, is <hi>proprium quarto modo</hi> to a <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our preſent civill, nay more then civill warre with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and all the miſchiefes thereon attending, the diſaffection
betweene the King and his Subjects, and all the miſchiefes
thereon attending the diſcontinuance of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
remedies of all State-maladies, and univerſall grievances,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111926:23"/>
which is a miſchiefe whereby all miſchiefes become incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
all are cauſed by the abuſive miſtake and injurious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application
of this word <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> are Puritans, and therefore enemies to Monarchy,
the Engliſh are Puritans, and therefore haters of Royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
both the Nations have beene hitherto famous for
their devout reverence, and obſequious zeale to their Princes;
but now Puritaniſme has infected them, and perverted them
to diſloyalty. Thus is the Kings heart alienated from his
Subjects, and by conſequence, the Subjects loyalty blunted
towards him, to the incomparable, almoſt irreparable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of both: neither is this diſaccord betweene the King
and his beſt Subjects, more fatall and pernicious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
then his accord with the Recuſant faction.
Papiſts have now gotten the repute of the beſt Subjects, and
fitteſt for truſt in places of eminent ſervice; nay 'tis almoſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that forraine Papiſts be brought in for the ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the indangered royalty: for though the Popiſh faction
at Court be ſtrong and active enough for matter of Counſell,
yet for matter of force the Puritans in City and Countrey be
too predominant.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Downe</hi> in his viſitation ſpeech layes all
the calamities of Church and Common-wealth upon Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts,
and for proofe thereof inſtances in the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whom he charges of rebellion, charging withall that
rebellion upon Puritaniſme. The firſt thing (ſaies he) that made
me out of love with that Religion, was their injurious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with Kings, which I obſerved both in their practice and
doctrine. He taxes firſt their doctrine, becauſe they deny the
Kings ſupremacy in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, and allow Subjects
to reſiſt, nay and depoſe their King, if he be a Tyrant. Surely
<hi>Ahab</hi> could ſay little for himſelfe, if he could not lay his
owne crimes upon <hi>Elijah;</hi> but ſee here by what art of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
all <hi>Scots</hi> are called Puritans and all Puritans rebels.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> ſpoke not ſo confuſedly as if Puritaniſme were
a Religion; and all that diſliked Biſhops and Ceremonies
were of that Religion; and all of that Religion were enemies
to Kings. If a Biſhop needed any proofe, if his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:111926:23"/>
were not unqueſtionable, I would deſire him to prove all
Covenanters Puritans, and all Puritans, denyers of the Kings
ſupremacy: or to inſtance in any Kings which have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
or murdred by Presbyteriall authority. How far Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
have incroached upon Kings, is known to al the world:
our Proteſtant Biſhops lately have by Oath and Canon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
together to bind the Kings hands though hee be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
that he ſhall not governe our Church but by Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Biſhops, Arch-deacons, &amp;c. and yet theſe troublers
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have the face to taxe <hi>Elijah</hi> of their owne ſin.</p>
            <p>Presbytery indeed has heretofore paſſed her bounds, yet
not of late, but Epiſcopacy has ever from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> claimed
an independence of Divine right, till this inſtant. I conceive
there are not in all the Kings Dominions, three men, except
Papiſts and Anabaptiſts, which hold it lawfull to depoſe, or
by any force to violate the perſons of Kings, how ill ſoever.
The <hi>Scotch</hi> Divines indeed maintaine that a great body of
men may defend themſelves againſt the unjuſt Sword of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Kings, becauſe they cannot flye, or otherwiſe ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and this they take now to be their owne caſe; whereas
our Court Divines in <hi>England</hi> hold, that in ſuch caſe, wee
ought all to yeeld our throats without defence. This ſeemes
unnaturall, and truth was never unnaturall, but I forbeare
to diſpute a point ſo horrid to mans imagination: The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
next inſtances in the rebellious practices of Puritans, and
reckons up ſome facts in <hi>Scotland</hi> appointed by the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
without King <hi>James</hi> his privity, and ſome other ſeditious
Sermons, and actions whereby he was much annoyed. But
what? did not King <hi>James</hi> know his owne enemies, or how
to blame them? did he condemne all <hi>Scots</hi> alike, or all Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haters
alike, or joyne the Engliſh in like condemnation? we
know well enough, that King <hi>James</hi> called rebellious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians
Puritans, but he never called all Puritans rebellious
preciſians: He never uſed thoſe termes as convertible, but
declared his contrary meaning by a manifeſt difference taken
betweene them. But the Biſhops maine inſtance is in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>Scotch</hi> inſurrection; this he cals a rebellion of Puritans,
and far greater then the Powder-treaſon: For (ſayes he) that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111926:24"/>
plot was but the act of a few diſcontented Gentlemen, but
in this rebellion of the Puritans they have ingaged a great
part of the Kingdome, ſo that this may bee ſaid to be the
common ſin of that ſect. What could have beene raked out
of Hell more ſlanderous to our Religion, more Apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
for Popery.</p>
            <p>The Powder-Traytors are here prefer'd before the whole
ſect of Puritans: The ſinne of the Power-Traytors was,
that they being but an inconſiderable party, ſought the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of their King and his iſſue, and the flower of the
Nobility, Gentry, Commonalty, and the extirpation of the
true Religion, by a moſt diabolicall bloudy practice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.
And it ought not to be charged upon the meere act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
as a ſymptome of diſcontent, onely we know how farre
the Romiſh Religion it ſelfe favours and gives ground to
ſuch damned feats, and how farre it has owned ſome having
proved proſperous, and juſtified the doing thereof in nature
as impious, though perhaps in degree not ſo hainous as this.
For take this as it was conſpired, and queſtionleſſe, ſince the
crucifying of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the light never diſcovered any
treaſon more ugly, and horrible.</p>
            <p>Now to outmatch this deed of darkneſſe, the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation
by a ſtrange generall unanimity have armed themſelves to
oppoſe the ill government of Biſhops, and other alterations
in the ſervice of God, and the adminiſtration of juſtice, and
being invaded therefore by another Nation, have uſed force
to defend their lives; and ſeeing that defence not ſafe in their
owne Countrey, they have ſince purſued it further by way
of prevention in the Countrey of their Invaders. That is
the greateſt act of rebellion whereby the common peace and
ſafety of a Kingdome is moſt diſturbed and impeached; but
by the common act of a whole Kingdome, that miſchiefe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be effected, therefore the Biſhop failes in his politiques
when he thinks that the <hi>Major</hi> part diſturbing the <hi>Minor,</hi> is
more trayterous, than the contrary. The unanimous act of a
whole Kingdome ought to be preſumed to be leſſe injurious,
and more wiſe then the act of any ſmall inconſiderable party,
for it hath ſcarce ever beene ſeene that a whole Kingdome, or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:111926:24"/>
the majority thereof hath over been treaſonable to its ſelfe in
procuring its owne ruine.</p>
            <p>Many States have periſht by the machinations of a few ill
affected, ill adviſed Counſellors, (ſcarce ever any periſht
otherwiſe) but the totall body and collection, has never been
guilty of its owne ruine: and if it were, ſuch Treaſon could
not be ſo great as that which is plotted by a few. Whilſt the
<hi>Scots</hi> contained themſelves within their owne territories,
and were conſidered as a kingdome within themſelves, as
they were when the Biſhop paſt his cenſure, they were not
rightly ſo cenſured: neither was he then privy to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſions,
that they would infeſt our kingdome with the ſame
combuſtion, and ſo prove a diſturbance to the greater part of
our Britiſh Monarchy, whereof they themſelves are but a
member of leſſe bulke and value. Curſed therefore are thoſe
uncharitable exaſperating cenſures, whereby the King is too
far incenſed, and by whoſe raſh inſtigations the commotions
themſelves become the harder to be appeaſed.</p>
            <p>Great inſurrections are like great fires, wherein delay is
miſchievous, and ſmall remedies rather turne to fuell, then
extinguiſh: and violent counſell againſt an inraged multitude
is like oyle, or pitch caſt into the flame. The wiſe politician
proportions his remedy according to the miſchiefe, if water
will not prevaile, he uſeth milke; if a little quantity will not
ſuffice, he powres as the combuſtion it ſelfe requires. Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<hi>Rehoboam</hi> ſtands as a Seamarke to warne all Princes
how to ſhun this rocke of violent counſell againſt a people
violently inraged and aggrieved. Some men have interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the deſignes of the <hi>Scots</hi> to have beene treaſonable from
the beginning, and wholly bent upon the ſpoyle and havocke
of the Engliſh Nation from their firſt ſtirring: Others have
wholly juſtified their intentions and proceedings hitherto as
defenſive onely, and inforced by neceſſity: both theſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
are too raſh and head-long in their gueſſes. In ſo great
a body of men, there muſt needs be variety of opinions, and
its likely contrariety of affections; and therefore it behooves
the King to be the more tender, moderate, and circumſpect in
his deliberations, as wel for the one ſide as the other, eſpecially
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:111926:25"/>
ſince the <hi>Scots</hi> have not evidently and univerſally as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themſelves for the worſe. We may at once be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
in hoping the beſt, and wiſe withall in preventing the
worſt; nay, a charitable and ſweet demeanor, if it be not too
fond, may prove a great part of our prevention: doubtleſſe
<hi>Rehoboam</hi> himſelfe, had hee not beene wilfully devoted to
young, raſh, and violent Counſellors, might have eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
within his obedience many of his well-meaning Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and reclaymed others of more moderation; and by that
meanes have divided and diſſipated the moſt obſtinate, head-ſtrong,
and furious of all the rebellious party. Some Princes
thinke themſelves bound in Honour to doe unwiſe things,
and this was the errour of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> his aged Counſellours
adviſed him to that which was moſt politick, concluding that
to be moſt honourable; but his <hi>Genius</hi> rather led him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the adviſe of his young Gallants, to conclude that
moſt politick, which to his haughty ſtomack ſeemed moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable:
but what was the event? to avoid the ſcorne of
young men, he incurred the ſcorne of old men; to avoid the
unjuſt cenſure of fooles, he incurred the juſt cenſure of wiſe
men; to gaine the honour of appearing ſtout, he purchaſed
the diſhonour of being raſh; to ſhew a contempt of danger,
he made himſelf a prey to it; rather then to decline a blow by
a gentle bowing of his body, he yeelded himſelfe to be inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
oppreſſed by it.</p>
            <p>At this time of revolt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not ſo wicked, as
their revolt after made them; it may be ſo with the <hi>Scots,</hi> they
are yet <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and perhaps may be retained ſo: and who
can thinke of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that ſo great a body of them, can at
one fall ſo deſperately tumble into the depth of miſchiefe, as
to make Faſting, Praying, Oaths and Sacraments, meere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
and traynes to commit murther, theft, ſacriledge,
treaſon, and the moſt unnaturall of all crying crimes? But to
returne to our owne Nation, and what we ſuffer by our owne
Divines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manwarings</hi> Doctrine is common at Court, and 'tis not
long ſince a Biſhops Chaplaine in Terme-time, challenged a
Judge of Treaſon, for delivering Law according to conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111926:25"/>
And this is now no prodigie, for Pulpits are not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
enough to preach an unlimitable prerogative in; 'tis fit
our learned Doctors ſhould mount the Benches of Juſtice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
there to advance Logick inſtead of Law; for Law is
growne injurious to Princes, and ſmels ranke of <hi>Puritaniſme.</hi>
Divines themſelves will loſe nothing to Princes, but all
other men ſhall, that they may gaine the more: and neither
Lawyers nor Stateſ-men muſt direct them in any thing, but
both Lawyers and Stateſ-men muſt be directed by them in all
things: but let us a little examine how the conditionate and
abſolute formes of government come within the circle of
Theologie. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were governed by Monarchs, but
not all alike abſolute. The Patriarchs were not ſo abſolute
as the Judges, nor the Judges as the Kings, nor the Kings as
thoſe Heathen Emperours, which at laſt made them tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.
The due of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the due of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the due
of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the due of <hi>Jacob,</hi> was not the ſame as to all
points of State, or all degrees of Royalty, and yet the nation
was the ſame, and the forme of government ſtill remained
the ſame.</p>
            <p>It ſhould ſeeme that God approved that degree of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
beſt, which was by himſelfe ſetled in the perſon of
<hi>Moſes;</hi> for when that people afterwards deſired a King, of a
more awfull and large prerogative, in imitation of other
Nations, the thing diſpleaſed God. <hi>Samuel</hi> alſo wrote a
booke of this ſubject, ſhewing the juſt conditions of Regall
power; (the loſſe whereof is much to be lamented) for if it
had beene Gods will that all Kings ſhould be equally abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in all reſpects, and free from all limitations and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
alike, <hi>Samuel</hi> needed to have written little thereof; one
word had determined all. But in Scripture, as it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
<hi>Samuels</hi> booke being not extant, our chiefeſt light
and guide now is by example, not rule; and example wee
finde very various.</p>
            <p>The State and Soveraignty of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kings in generall,
we finde milde, and gratious; but much differing in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
<hi>Solomon</hi> was heavy over his Subjects, and under his Son
they would not beare the like; yet <hi>Solomons</hi> preſſure was not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111926:26"/>
upon the eſtates of his Subjects by taxes, and impoſitions, for
He made ſilver in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as ſtones for plenty; nor did He
vex their perſons by Military hazards and ſervices, for He
was at peace with all the world: Neither did He any way let
fall, or leſſen their honour amongſt other Nations; He made
them rather a ſpectacle of glory and proſperity to the world.
<hi>Solomons</hi> harſhneſſe was onely in imploying ſo great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
for his owne pompous attendance, and for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of ſuch publike workes, and ſtructures, as did tend
to the Magnificence and beauty of the State. Beſides, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does not ſatisfie us, neither by rule, nor example, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kings ought to bee ſucceſſive alwayes, or elective; or
whether primogeniture of Males, or unigeniture of Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ought to take place: many things are left ſo uncertain,
that it is not alwayes ſafe for Kings wholly to rely upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
and for the rule of obedience, it is generall, and no
more advantagious for free Monarchs, then conditionate Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates;
no more for ſupreame, then ſubordinate comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>The Law of Nature beſt determines, that all Princes being
publike Miniſters for the common good, that their authority
ought to be of ſufficient latitude for that common good;
and ſince Scripture is not expreſſe concerning that latitude,
as to all people, the ſame not being to all alike neceſſary, the
ſeverall Lawes of ſeverall Countries beſt teach that certaine
latitude. I could wiſh therefore that Princes herein would
not ſo much conſult with Divines, as Lawyers; or rather with
Parliaments, which are the Grand Courts and Counſels of
Kingdomes; for (as <hi>Cotton</hi> ſayes) Every man in particular
may deceive, and be deceived; but no man can deceive all, nor
can all deceive one. Ancient times are not precedentary to
ours by any neceſſity, for Lawes are now more learned, exact,
and particular; and Courts, and Tables of Juſtice, and Policie,
are more wiſely and methodically compoſed and elected, then
they were; and therefore there needs not that vocall power, or
indiſputable force to remaine in the breaſts of Princes, as was
of old.</p>
            <p>The Courts of Parliament, and their unqueſtionable Acts,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111926:26"/>
and Ordinances, and their infallible aviſoes, are now in all
well-governed Countries; the very Oracles of all Policy, and
Law, they are the fountaines of civill bloud, ſpirits, and life;
and the ſoveraigne antidotes of publike miſcheifes. That
Prince was never yet deceived which relyed upon them, nor
can He chuſe but be deceived, which thinkes he can be aſſiſted
with any more wiſe or faithfull advertiſement, then that
which is given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by his whole Realme united, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in a leſſe circumference. What end can all the flower
of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty of a Nation, being
wiſe and religious, have in ſeducing their Soveraigne, or in
limiting that Soveraignty by which alone they are prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted?
Or what one party of particular men can better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the true limits of ſufficient Soveraignty, and the profit
thereof; then this collective univerſality, whoſe rayes like
the Suns, are every where diſperſed; and yet whoſe body of
light is here as in a refulgent Globe concentred?</p>
            <p>Individuals may have many particular ends, ſeverd from the
Princes or the States, but Communities can ayme at nothing
but the common good; as the leſſer fountaines ſcatter their
branching ſtreames up and down in various Maeanders, whilſt
the Sea containes it ſelfe in an intire body, within its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
bounds. Individuals alſo have but their own particular
ſet limits of perfection, and have judgements beſides apt to
bee darkned by their owne ſeverall intereſts and paſſions;
whereas the common body injoyes a confluence of ſeverall
perfections, and hath the leſſe force from abroad to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloud
them. Of all men therefore it will moſt concerne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to ſuſpect them which are enemies to publick aſſemblies,
and to confide in them moſt, whoſe ends are not divided from
the generalities; and as they tender their owne happineſſe,
to expect it chiefly from that generality, by which they are
Kings, to which they are Gods, from which their very Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dems
receive honour and ſanctity, to which their very Royall
Order imparts life, and breath, and neceſſary ſubſiſtence. I
come now to my Ethicall <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The name of <hi>Puritan</hi> muſt not reſt here, for there may be
ſome moderate, well inclined, facile men, whoſe education
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111926:27"/>
may be ſuch that they are not much vers'd or inſighted either in
matters of Religion, or matters of State; they may be ſuch as
are no wayes buſie but in their owne particular affaires, and
yet it behooves, that theſe men too be brought in within the
opprobrious compaſſe of Puritaniſme. To the Religious,
Eccleſiaſticall, and Political Puritan, there muſt be joyned
alſo an Ethicall Puritan.</p>
            <p>This deteſted odious name of Puritan firſt began in the
Church preſently after the Reformation, but now it extends it
ſelfe further, and gaining ſtrength as it goes, it diffuſes its
poyſonous ignominy further, and being not contented to
Gangrene Religion, Eccleſiaſticall and Civill policy, it now
threatens deſtruction to all morality alſo. The honeſt ſtrict
demeanour, and civill converſation which is ſo eminent in
ſome men does, ſo upbraid and convince the Antipuritan, that
even honeſty, ſtrictneſſe, and civility it ſelfe muſt become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull,
or elſe they which are contrary cannot remaine in
grace: But becauſe it is too groſſe to deride vertue under the
name of vertue; therefore other colours are invented, and
ſo the ſame thing undergoes deriſion under an other name.
The zealous man is deſpiſed under the name of zealot, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
honeſt man has the vizard of an hypocrite and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
put upon him to make him odious.</p>
            <p>Puritans by ſome are parallelled to Jeſuites, Jeſuites are
called Popiſh Puritans, and Puritans, Proteſtant Jeſuites; yet
this is not indeed diſparageable to them: For doubtleſſe fiery
zeale and rigour were not blameable in Jeſuites, were not
their very Religion falſe; as celerity and expedition in a
Traveller is not in it ſelfe faulty, but commendable, though
the Traveller being in a wrong path, it cauſes him to ſtray
the further from his journeys end.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Downe</hi> profeſſes that the firſt thing which
made him diſteſt the Religion of Puritans (beſides their groſſe
hypocriſie) was ſedition: So groſſe hypocriſie, it ſeemes,
was the firſt. What is groſſe or viſible hypocriſie to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
I know not, for I can ſee no windowes or caſements in
mens breaſts, neither doe I think him indued with Saint
<hi>Peters</hi> propheticall ſpirit whereby to perceive and ſearch
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111926:27"/>
into the reines, and hearts of hypocrites; but let him proceed.
It is a plauſible matter (ſayes he) with the people to heare
men in authority depraved, and to underſtand of any liberty
and power appertaining to themſelves. The profeſſion alſo
of extraordinary zeale, and as it were contempt of the world
workes with the multitude. When they ſee men goe ſimply
in the Streets, and bow downe their heads like a Bull-ruſh,
their inward parts burning with deceit, wringing their necks
awry, ſhaking their heads as if they were in ſome preſent
griefe, lifting up the white of their eyes at the ſight of ſome
vanity, giving great groanes, crying out againſt this ſin and
that ſinne in their ſuperiours, under colour of long prayers,
devouring widowes, and married wives houſes; when the
multitude heares and ſees ſuch men, they are carryed away
with a great conceit of them, but if they ſhould judge of
theſe men by their fruits, not by outward appearance, they
ſhould find them to be very farre from the true Religion. See
here the froth of a ſcurrilous libeller, whereby it is concluded
that he that is of ſevere life, and averſe from the common
vanities of the time, is an hypocrite: If theſe deſcriptions of
outward auſterity ſhall not onely ſhew what is an hypocrite,
but point out alſo who is an hypocrite, our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
wil hardly eſcape this deſcription; doubtles our Saviour,
and many of his devouteſt followers did groane, ſhake their
heads, and lift up their eyes at the ſight of ſome publick ſins,
and vanities, and did not ſpare to taxe the vices of Superiours,
and to preach too, and admoniſh the meaner ſort of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
yet who but an <hi>Annas</hi> or <hi>Caiphas</hi> will infer from hence
that therefore their inward parts burne with deceit, and that
their end is meerely to carry away the multitude; ſuch as
judge onely by outward appearance, and have not their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
exerciſed to diſcerne betwixt good and evill? It is likely
the High Prieſts and Phariſees did thus blaſpheme in thoſe
dayes, and that the rather, becauſe from their owne fayned
ſanctity, they were the more apt to ſuſpect the ſame in others:
But what? muſt we needs follow them, or this Biſhop in this?
But to proceed with this Biſhop, Saint <hi>James</hi> (ſayes he) gives
us a full deſcription of true Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:111926:28"/>
Wiſedome from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle,
and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
judging, and hypocriſie. None of theſe properties will
agree with the Religion of Puritans. It is not pure, for it
allowes Vſury, Sacriledge, Diſobedience, Rebellion, &amp;c. It
is not peaceable, for theſe men are the incendiaryes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.
It is not gentle, nor eaſie to be intreated, for they
are more auſtere then <hi>Cato,</hi> and not to be moved by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or command. It is not full of mercy and good fruits, for
they are all for ſacrifice, nothing for mercy; for the firſt Table,
not the ſecond; for faith, not charity; they pull down Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
but build no Hoſpitals. It is not without judging, for
they are known to be moſt rigid cenſurers. And he is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
which ſpyes a moate in his brothers eyes, and not a
beame in his owne.</p>
            <p>Here is a confuſed proofe, that ſuch Puritans are hypocrits,
but no proofe at all, that this man is ſuch a Puritan. If my
Lord <hi>Say</hi> be ſuch a Puritan, this denotes him an hypocrite, but
this does not prove that my Lord <hi>Say</hi> or <hi>Brooke,</hi> or <hi>Dod,</hi> or
<hi>Clever,</hi> &amp;c. or any the moſt famous Puritan living is guilty
of Vſury, Sacriledge, Rebellion, pulling downe of Churches,
ſetting the World on fire, or of renouncing the ſecond Table
and all workes of juſtice and charity, or of cenſuring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
malignantly other men: If theſe things were true
of particular men, calumny were needleſſe; Accuſation would
better ſuppreſſe them. And ſure it is not out of favour that
Law proceeds not, for malice has often enough ſhewed her
teeth, and would have bitten if ſhe could, neither would ſhe
now calumniate if ſhe could accuſe.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop expects not to be beleeved, if he puzzell, and
worke ſome into doubt, it is ſufficient: but ſince bitter cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring,
and calumnious condemning of others is ſo infallible
a ſigne of hypocriſie, how does the Biſhop wipe this off from
himſelfe? Can Puritans ſpeake worſe of any, then he doth of
Puritans? Sure they may well joyn with him upon this iſſue,
that the greateſt ſlanderer is the greateſt hypocrite; and yet
ſeeke no further for ſlanders, then this very ſpeech, wherein
he ſo eagerly inveighs againſt ſlander; but if individuals
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111926:28"/>
cannot be thus convinced by the Biſhop, how ſhall theſe
ſignes and ſymptomes be applied to whole Sects, Religions,
Kingdomes?</p>
            <p>The moſt ordinary badge of <hi>Puritans</hi> is their more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and conſcionable converſation, than that which is
ſeene in other mens: and why this ſhould make them odious
or ſuſpected of hypocriſie amongſt honeſt and charitable
men, I could never yet learne. A ſeeming religious conſiſts
in doing actions outwardly good, and the goodneſſe of thoſe
actions is apparent to man; but the falſe hypocriticall end of
them is onely diſcerned by God: and therefore with what
conſcience can I condemne that good which is viſible, for
that evill which is not viſible? <hi>Say, Brooke, Dod, Clover, &amp;c.</hi>
are knowne to me; yet no otherwiſe but as men ſingularly
devote, and as all the Prophets, and Apoſtles would, if they
were now living: and ſhall I conclude, becauſe they ſeeme
ſo, therefore they are not ſo? I am ſo far from this, that my
owne conſcience bindes me to honour them, and that in thoſe
things, wherein I have not the grace to follow them. I have
beene a diligent inquirer into <hi>Puritans,</hi> and have exactly
tryed them three wayes. Firſt, in themſelves; and ſo I finde
them zealous, at leaſt ſeeming ſo outwardly, and diſtinguiſht
principally from other men by their remarkable, and ſingular
zeal to God and the Truth: and this to me is no ground of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
cenſure. Secondly, in thoſe, which in theſe times
thinke and ſpeake charitably of them; and they are ſo many
in number, and of ſo good quality, that indeed to the Popiſh
and Epiſcopall faction, all the Kingdome almoſt ſeemes <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanicall;</hi>
but for this I cannot thinke the worſe of them. But
thirdly, when I conſider <hi>Puritans,</hi> and compare them with
their common notorious adverſaries, then their goodneſſe
ſeemes moſt evident to me, as if it were legibly ingraved in
the open wickedneſſe and ſcandall of their chiefe oppoſers.
Nothing but Truth, Holineſſe, and Goodneſſe, ſeemes to me
to be the cauſe, that Papiſts do ſo implacably abominate them:
that our proud Hierarchiſts, Ambidexters, and Neuters in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
do ſo unceſſantly purſue their ſubverſion; that Court-flatterers,
and time-ſerving Projectors, and the ravenous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111926:29"/>
of the Realme, doe ſo virulently proſecute them
with defamations and contumelies; that Stage-poets, Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels,
and the jeſting Buffoones of the age, make them the
principall ſubject of deriſion: laſtly, that all the ſhameleſſe
rout of drunkards, lechers, and ſwearing ruffians; and the
ſcum of the vulgar are ſo tickled with their reproach, and
abuſe. Certainly, nothing but an unappeaſeable antipathy
could be the cauſe of all this, and no teſtimony of goodneſſe
can be more ſure, un-erring, and unanſwerable then ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy.</p>
            <p>Amongſt wicked men there may be particular hatred, but
not a generall antipathy: One wicked man hates not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as wicked, but rather loves him therefore, or elſe the
World did not obſerve a decorum in loving her own, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſtrangers. As there cannot be diviſion in Satans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
ſo there cannot be communion or compatibility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Chriſts and Satans Subjects But 'tis a miſerable thing
to ſee how farre this word <hi>Puritan</hi> in an Ethical ſenſe dilates
it ſelfe. Heretofore it was Puritanicall to abſtaine from ſmall
ſinnes; but now 'tis ſo to abſtaine from groſſe open ſinnes. In
the mouth of a drunkard, He is a <hi>Puritane</hi> which refuſeth
his cups; In the mouth of a ſwearer, He which feares an oath;
In the mouth of a Libertine, He which makes any ſcruple of
common ſinnes; In the mouth of a rude Souldier, He which
wiſheth the <hi>Scotch</hi> warre at an end without blood. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
that ſuch men thinke themſelves tacitly checked and
affronted by the unblameable converſation of <hi>Puritans.</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Lake</hi> that good and godly man moved at the declining
ſtate of his time is ſaid to have expreſſed his regret thus: We
feare, ſaith he, a relapſe into Popiſh error, and ſuperſtition; but
my heart miſgives me worſe than ſo: Vtter irreligion and
Atheiſme, me thinkes, begins to prevaile ſtrangely amongſt
us: we are not ſo likely to loſe the light of truth, as the heate
of zeale; and what benefit is in Religion, where the name of
it is honoured, but the power of it is not at all ſeene? where
Gods will is truely underſtood, but his commands are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſlighted? where men know like Chriſtians, but live like
Heathens? The ſoule of Religion is hearty devotion, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111926:29"/>
that growes dayly more and more ridiculous amongſt us;
and yet Religion without the ſoule of it, is rather a curſe than
a bleſſing to us. No impiety is ſo hainous in an ignorant So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domite,
as want of piety is in a right inſtructed Iſraelite. In
this wiſe I have heard that good Prelate did complaine; and
this makes me think, that he had in his complaint ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to this word <hi>Puritan,</hi> then which, certainly the Divell
hath not a more fatall engine whereby to confound Religion,
and to ſubvert all true zeale, goodneſſe, and devotion. Thus
farre it appeares what a vaſt circumference this word <hi>Puritans</hi>
has, and how by its large acception it is uſed to caſt durt in the
face of all goodneſſe, Theologicall, Civill, or Morall: ſo that
ſcarce any moderate man can avoid its imputation. And thus
it does miſchiefe to men, not commonly noted for <hi>Puritans,</hi>
but if a man be ſo noted, though perhaps irregularly, then it
is farther otherwiſe abuſed: for all ſuch a mans evill ſhall be
charged upon his <hi>Puritaniſme,</hi> and all his good defaced for his
<hi>Puritaniſme.</hi> Such a man is condemned for murther, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery;
and at his death gives ſtrong aſſurances of unfaigned
repentance, and contrition of heart. He was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi>
a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> a <hi>Puritan;</hi> yet this crime is recorded and
blowne abroad, not for the ſhame of <hi>Chriſtians, Proteſtants,
Miniſters,</hi> but of <hi>Puritans.</hi> And as for his atteſtation of deep
humiliation, how excellent ſoever, the honour of them, if any
be acknowledged, ſhall redound to the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi>
the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> to any thing elſe except the <hi>Puritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howſoever in the firſt place it ought to be obſerved, that
an uncleane ſtreame does not alwayes receive it's unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
from the filth of the Fountaine, but in the ſecond place
a pure ſtreame neceſſarily infers a pure Source. 'Tis true,
Trees are knowne by their fruits, and ſo are Men generally by
their workes; but this ſimilitude holdes not in all men, at all
times: for good men ſometimes commit foule ſinnes, and bad
men performe laudable ſervices. <hi>David</hi> defiles <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> wife,
and to conceale it from the world, makes drunke and murders
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> and together with him caſts away the lives of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faithfull Souldiers: yet nothing moved at this his owne
miſ-doing, at the ſame time He ſentences to death a Subject of
his for damnifying a neighbour, to the value of a poor Lamb.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111926:30"/>
What might <hi>Joab,</hi> &amp; the other privy <hi>Miniſters</hi> of theſe his foul
deeds, cenſure all this while of this his externally profeſſed
ſanctity, and purity, and ſtrictnes in point of juſtice to other
men; or of his ſo great indignation againſt petty offenders?
What might they judge of the root, from whence theſe fruits
ſprung? did they conclude theſe fruits good? or did they
conceive that ſuch fruits might grow upon a good ſtocke?
It's ſtrange, that He which would be ſo rigid to a petty Fellon,
ſhould himſelfe finde no remorſe at his owne murther and
oppreſſion, in ſpoiling ſo gallant a Commander, of his wife, of
his ſobriety, of his life, and to continue ſo long a time without
regard either what himſelfe had done, or what <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> had
ſuffered. But it's well, <hi>David</hi> lived in thoſe times when the
name of <hi>Puritaniſme</hi> was not invented to blaſt all goodneſſe:
had he lived amongſt us, he had beene accounted a <hi>Puritane,</hi>
and being a <hi>Puritane,</hi> God might have forgiven him, but the
world never would: but it ſeemes the world was not then
poyſoned with the ſame baſe word, though I beleeve under
ſome other nicke-name goodneſſe was alwaies odious: for
we reade, that for that very ſinne of <hi>David,</hi> Gods name was
evill ſpoken of amongſt the wicked. So <hi>Solomon</hi> the Sonne
of ſeduced <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> if we cenſure him by many of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
perhaps <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſinne,
were not perſonally addicted to ſo much exceſſe of bodily
luſt, and pollution, nay perhaps many Heathens and <hi>Turkes</hi>
have deteſted his enormous lubricities.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not this to countenance ſin, but to diſcountenance
raſh cenſures of ſinners, wiſhing all that thinke themſelves
fraile and mortall, to turne their eyes inwards, and to lay
their hands upon their own mouths, forbearing to cenſure all
ſins, but moſt eſpecially the moſt latent and obſcure of all
ſinnes, hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solyman</hi> the magnificent is held the honeſteſt of all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which raigned in his time, not excepting Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
nay not excepting the great Father of them all, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick
man of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet this is no ſhame to Chriſtianity, but
to Chriſtians rather; nay I wiſh it might be accounted rather
a rebuke, then a ſhame; rather a rebuke to humble them, then
a ſhame to confute them. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> tels us that many times
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:111926:30"/>
the firſt are laſt, and laſt firſt, God ſees not as man ſees, and
yet he that will judge uprightly ought to ſee as God ſees, and
not as Man. So much of the extenſive infamy of this word
<hi>Puritan,</hi> now of its intenſive malignancy: but little more
needs to be ſpoken hereof, for hee which tels you who is a
Puritan, for the moſt part tels what is a Puritan.</p>
            <p>The Papiſt we ſee hates one kind of Puritans, the Hierarchiſt
another, the Court Sycophant another, the ſenſuall Libertine
another; yet all hate a Puritan, and under the ſame name ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times hate the ſame thing. He which is an enemy to our
Religion which is the truth, hates the Puritan as an enemy to
Truth; Hee which is an enemy to Piety, Policy, Morality,
charges the Puritan of being the ſame: Wherefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is hated by the perverted and diſaffected in Religion,
Piety, Policy, Morality, is a Puritan, and whoſoever is a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,
is cenſured, hated, and ſlandered as a man perverted and
diſaffected in Religion, Piety, Policy, and Morality.</p>
            <p>This ſufficiently appeares by the common ſlanders of all
goodneſſe in theſe dayes, and particularly by the Biſhop of
<hi>Downe,</hi> for as he juſtifies Jeſuites, Anabaptiſts, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Traytors
before Puritans; ſo he deſcribes, and proſcribes
whole Religions, Sects, and Kingdomes for Puritans.</p>
            <p>In the yeare of grace 1588, when the <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> had
miſcarried, notwithſtanding that his holineſſe of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſo
peremptorily chriſtened it, and as it were conjured for it, One
of that Religion was ſtrangely diſtemper'd at it, &amp; his ſpeech
was as 'tis reported, God himſelfe was turned <hi>Lutheran:</hi> By
which, for certaine, he meant Hereticall. 'Tis much therefore
that my Lord of <hi>Downe,</hi> now that Epiſcopacy is ſo foyled in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> has not raged in the like manner, and charged God of
turning Puritan: but ſurely, if he has ſpared God, he has not
ſpared any thing elſe that is good; and if he has ſpared to call
God Puritan, he has not ſpared to call Puritan Devill: but to
conclude, if the confuſed miſapplication of this foule word
Puritan be not reformed in <hi>England,</hi> and that with ſpeed, we
can expect nothing but a ſuddaine univerſall downfall of all
goodneſſe whatſoever. <hi>Aelius Adrianus</hi> the Emperour, about
an hundred yeares after our Saviour, having been certified by
<hi>Serenius Granianus, Proconſul</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that the Chriſtians in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:111926:31"/>
thoſe parts were illegally oppreſſed by the malice of unjuſt
Sycophants, ſends this his imperiall edict to the next ſucceſſor
<hi>Minutius Fundanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Provincials can prove ought againſt the Chriſtians,
whereof they charge them, and can at the bar of juſtice make
good the ſame, let them proceed in a judiciall courſe: but let
them not appeach the Chriſtians meerely for the name, by cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring,
and rayling ſcandals againſt them: For it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
if any be diſpoſed to accuſe, that the accuſation be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known, and judicially tryed by you; therefore if any accuſe
the Chriſtians that they tranſgreſſe the Lawes, ſee that you
judge and puniſh according to the quality of the offence, but if
any upon ſpite or malice by way of calumny complain againſt
them, ſee you chaſtiſe ſuch for their malice, and repay them
with condigne puniſhment. I began with a <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> I end
with an <hi>Emperour:</hi> both read the ſame lecture, both teach us
a difference betwixt privy malicious calumny and open judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
accuſing, or impleading; God ſend us to hearken to both,
as much as the neceſſity of our caſe requires it.</p>
