            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if we mynd to benefitte any man, we ought before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue this good opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, that with hys good wil we shall at his handes receiue asmuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity again if we néede, as we present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doo vnto him. Whych hope conceiued though we hap to faile to find it satisfied yet is it a most dishonest and vyle part to make complaint therof. For why, in him that is to discharge suche credit concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it is not welthe ne substaunce that are to be required, but onely a mindful and thankfull hart.

the plesures that haue bene shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so riseth there oftentymes on our parts no small cause of this their Ingratitude. For as wée finde diuers that are of their owne natures vnthankfull, so doo wee our selues make many Ingrat whyche otherwise parhaps would not haue bene so. For sometime we cast in their tethe and vpbraid vnto them what wee haue done for them: and otherwhile we exact importunatly at theyr handes, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense for suche benefites as wee before haue done vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Otherwhiles again we shew our selues to be so inconstant of minde that forthwith it repenteth vs of the plesure that we erst dyd. And thus complaininge our case and chaungyng our mindes in the torning of a hand, we doo not onely disgrace the pleasour wee before shewed, and loose the thankes which otherwyse should haue bene dew for the same, but also we agreue gretly the party to whom we dyd the same.

But of his owne accord séeketh to find and take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to proffit and plesour me. On tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther syde (as I haue sayde before) these thinges are neyther plesant nor accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whiche though of themselues they séeme to be of great valew and pryce, yet they are not without great entreaty, and importunate seute and request obtained at the hands of the grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, or els whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by chaunce and vnaduisedlye escape them.

For why, in suche case thus may I saye. Truthe it is: that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4056:23"/>
whiche this man hath geuen me is but a small thing, but wayeng his abilitie, he is muche to be commended, for he gaue it me with a very good wil: and besides, his welthe coulde not extend to geue me any thing of gretter valew. Againe, the present of that other. I confesse was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry muche and of great pryce, but with what distrust did he it and longe delaye, and how muche did he repent him after that he had done it? He dyd it for vaine glory onely, and to thend he might triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe ouer me, and reporte to others howe much he had plesoured me, and in what necessity I stode of his help. So that good cause I haue to perswade myself that he dyd it not for good will, and earnest loue, or affection he bare to me, but to blase abrode his own name and take occasion so to doo at my necessitie. Who that to this end bestoweth his benefytes, I saye he doth not onely deserue notes to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted liberall, but rather an euill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured niggard.</p>
