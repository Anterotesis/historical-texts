            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107974:2"/>
which being without a Cover, they ſoon diſcovered two or three ſmall Pieces of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Silver: Thus, having view'd all Parts within, they began to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the Shape, Faſhion, and Workmanſhip of the <hi>Tomb:</hi> And <hi>Firſt,</hi> a the Head of the <hi>Tomb,</hi> they obſerved ſome kind of Emboſſed-or Carved-Work which curiouſly examined (though Time's Iron Teeth had made a little Bold with it) they plainly diſcovered ſome Marine Trophies, as <hi>Rudders, Anchors</hi> and the like, not in the manner of our Modern Trophies, as Regular <hi>Inſignia</hi> or <hi>Regalia,</hi> but on the contrary all ſhatter'd and broken, under (as it were ſome Infamy or Diſgrace, with ſome Fragments of <hi>Maſts</hi> and <hi>Hulks</hi> of <hi>Veſſels</hi> and altogether expreſſing ſome Naval Ruines.</p>
            <p>Over this Sculp-work was delineated 3 <hi>Flower-de-Luces,</hi> not in the order of thoſe in the <hi>French</hi> Arms, but inverted, <hi>viz.</hi> with their Heads downwards, and over all theſe was very elaborately Carved a Figure exactly imitating our Cypher, <hi>W</hi> and <hi>M</hi> entwiſted, bearing three Crowns Imperial: The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Work on the right ſide of the Tomb was a little of a Piece with this Front-work of it, for here it repreſented a troubled Sea, in one part of which ſate a <hi>Neptune</hi> in his Sea Chariot with his <hi>Trident</hi> in his Hand, with a large <hi>Eſutcheon</hi> behind his Seat, bearing a modern <hi>Belgick Lyon,</hi> whilſt at ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him lay a large <hi>Dolphin,</hi> ſuppoſed by the Violence of the Stormy Sea to have been caſt on Shore, and there languiſhing and gaſping for Life.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of the Tomb, were carved ſeveral diſmounted Cannon with their Carriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhattered and broken, with the Image of a <hi>Victoria</hi> and on her Shield a large <hi>Louidore</hi> with this Motto, <hi>Ratio ultima Galliae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the Feet of the <hi>Tomb</hi> was carved a <hi>Deluge Piece</hi> with the Ark reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Mountain, in imitation of the Scriptural Deſcription, with a Dove flying towards the Ark with the Olive-Branch in her Bill; and what was moſt of all Remarkable, over the Ark was written <hi>Europa,</hi> and over the Dove <hi>Britania.</hi>
