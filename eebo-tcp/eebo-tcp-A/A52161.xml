            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is ſo high a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in me to beg Your Majeſty's Acceptance of the enſuing Tranſlation, that were not Your Royal Clemency as extenſive as Your Power, I could not hope for Pardon. There
<pb facs="tcp:60048:3"/>are but few Authors, whoſe Writings can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arrogance intrude upon thoſe ſmall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Time, which the weighty Cares of Your Royal Station permit Your Majeſty to call Your own. Nevertheleſs the conſideration of Your Majeſty's Indulgence to all Your Subjects induced me to think that, as the Almighty Being, whoſe Vice-gerent You are, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not ſo much the value of the Sacrifice, as
<pb facs="tcp:60048:3"/>the ſincerity of him that offers it, ſo Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty will be graciouſly pleas'd to forgive this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious ſubmiſſion of one, who hath nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend himſelf, or what he Addreſſes to Your Great Name but an unfeign'd Loyalty.</p>
            <p>The ſame Motive that firſt incourag'd me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Tranſlating this Hiſtorical Tract, inſpir'd me likewiſe, in a great meaſure, with the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of laying it at Your

The Parallel, I muſt confeſs, agrees not in all particulars. <hi>Genoua</hi> bears no proportion to <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>Doria</hi> to His preſent Majeſty, whether we conſider his Character
<pb facs="tcp:60048:6"/>or the Actions he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.

Their Civil Liberties were for a while under an Eclipſe, &amp; their Conſtitution was very much alter'd by that Faction that ſided with the <hi>French:</hi> but their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſtill the ſame with that of their Oppreſſors; nor had they the diſmal
<pb facs="tcp:60048:7"/>Proſpect, that we had continually before our Eyes, of the ſad Choice of being either Martyrs or Apoſtates. And our Ingratitude, as well as Folly, is far worſe than that of thoſe <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> who were ſo fatally blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Avarice, Ambition, or Revenge, as to miſtake the Traytor for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot, and lend <hi>Fieſchi</hi> their Aſſiſtance to deſtroy <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and enſlave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But herein our ſide of the Parallel falls very
<pb facs="tcp:60048:7"/>ſhort of that Conſpiracy. For, to our great Comfort, the Enemies of Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Government are not likely to bring their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to ſo dangerous an Iſſue: They have not a <hi>Fieſchi</hi> to lead them, nor a <hi>French</hi> Army ſo near at hand to ſecond them, nor are they in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo numerous and powerful.</p>

            <p>I have reſolv'd to give the World an Hiſtorical Account of the Affairs and Tranſactions of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in the laſt Century; what my Reaſons are for ſetting my ſelf ſuch a Task, thou art not to expect I ſhou'd at preſent impart to thee. How able I am to perform the Work I have undertaken, muſt be leſt to thy Judgment: But as to the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Sincerity which are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably requiſite to a Good Hiſtorian, thoſe, I promiſe thee, ſhall be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and diligently obſerv'd. Truth, free from the Blemiſhes of irregular
<pb facs="tcp:60048:12"/>Paſſions, is the darling Object of my Pen, and ſhall be my firſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Care. Hatred, I know, too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally attends it, becauſe Vitious Perſons dread an Enterview with this Beautiful Virgin, no leſs than weak Eyes avoid the Sun ſhine. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Wiſe Men, and Princes eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, (who are much the properer Judges) would not have the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick impos'd upon, nor Poſterity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the Artificial Lyes of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary or byaſs'd Hiſtorian. And if any of their Anceſtors, or Kindred's Faults are tranſmitted to After Ages, 'tis not the Writer that Records them, but the Perſons who commit them, that are to be blam'd: And let thoſe, who have any hard thoughts of ſuch a Writer, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the Evangeliſts who were guided by an infallible Spirit, and who are the beſt Patterns we can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, have not concealed from us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denial of his Maſter, or the Unbelief of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> tho' they were both of them Apoſtles.

For having never yet ſet my ſelf to write Hiſtory I ſhou'd be very unwilling to be guilty either in my Stile, or Method, of any thing that might diſtaſt the Reader, and ſo render my Pains uſeleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. 'Tis true, this ſhort Eſſay in Hiſtory, though now Publiſh'd, was never deſign'd for the Preſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun by Chance, and writ in haſte: And conſequently not ſo free from Errors as I could wiſh it. I took it in hand more for my own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, than the Publick View, and
<pb facs="tcp:60048:13"/>therefore the Criticks muſt excuſe it, if it falls ſhort of an Exact Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>But the Work I am a bout is of a larger Extent: 'Tis deſign'd for the Publick Good: Its end is to inſtruct as well as delight the Readers: It preſerves the Memories of Brave Men from Oblivion: And is an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Record of paſt Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Therefore it muſt be manag'd in all its parts with Judgment and Diſcretion. However, as I am not ſo vain as to deſpiſe the Cenſures of ſo Learn'd an Age as is the preſent; ſo neither ſhall I be ſo inconſiderate as to Publiſh my own Compoſures till they have undergone the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, whoſe Opinions I can more ſafely relie on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Conſpiracy now appears in Publick: And as <hi>Apelles</hi> ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his Picture, Anxiouſly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Sentence ſhould be paſt on it by the Judges of Painting, ſo am I
<pb facs="tcp:60048:13"/>no leſs deſirous to know what the Learned World thinks of this Eſſay of mine. And I plainly and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly declare, That I ſhall not only think my ſelf extremely oblig'd to any Perſon who will impart freely to me his real Sentiments of this Tract; but alſo that whoſoever finds any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Error either in my Stile or Method, and does not communicate to me his Animadverſions on it, will be very unkind to the Publick: For after ſuch a Friendly Challenge, if the Hiſtory I am about be tainted with thoſe Blemiſhes, the World, I hope, will be ſo Juſt as to impute them to my want of due informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not my unwillingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps will be of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſo ſmall a part of an intire Hiſtory ſhou'd not have been Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by its ſelf. To theſe, I Anſwer, that <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Conſpiracy, as I have related it, is to be look'd on as an Hiſtorical Tract not at all depending

Nor do I herein proceed without the Authority of very great Examples. I ſhall not inſiſt on the Ancients, eſpecially <hi>Saluſt,</hi> ſince the preſent Age aſſords me a Pattern of equal Value. His Eminency Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> hath writ ſome Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Tracts in our Tongue with ſo much Eloquence and ſo Judicious an Exactneſs, that I deſire no better a Precedent: His Stile is always ſtrong and noble, and yet it wants not a
<pb facs="tcp:60048:15"/>Copious and Harmonious Fluency: His Thoughts are always well link'd together, and properly adapted to the Subject: His Obſervations ſhew how throughly he Conſider'd what he writ, and how clear a View he had of the Conſequences of Things: His Sentences, whether Moral, or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, are ſo weighty in themſelves, and ſo ſeaſonably brought in, that they are always welcome to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: His Speeches are full of Life and Energy: In a word, whatever he has writ, ſhews us 'tis poſſible, that a Poetical Fancy, a Rhetorical Vein, and a Solid Judgment, may meet in one Perſon. In imitation of his Works, eſpecially his Hiſtorical Eſſays, I have endeavour'd to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Conſpiracy; though I muſt acknowledge after all, that my Writings are but a faint and ill drawn Copy of ſo Excellent and Perfect an Original.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome may think the Speeches in this ſmall Tract are too long and too many: To theſe, I

Let it ſuffice, if I repeat, what I have already told my Reader, that being deſirous in this ſhort Eſſay to touch upon all the parts of a Compleat Hiſtory, I was forc'd to Embrace thoſe Occaſions of enlarging, eſpecially in the Speeches, which otherwiſe I ſhould have let ſlip. Beſides, let it be Conſider'd, that when an Affair of this Moment comes to be debated, when the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are to deliberate on it are of different Opinions, and when all the Reaſons <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> are to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and maturely weigh'd, 'twill not be found ſo eaſie, as ſome may imagine, to end the diſpute in Six Words. Nevertheleſs I ſubmiſſively
<pb facs="tcp:60048:16"/>referr my ſelf to the Judgment of the ingenious Reader: Which I ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly expect to be inform'd of. As likewiſe I muſt earneſtly intreat all Perſons who are willing to forward the deſign I have in hand, to furniſh me with ſuch Memoirs as they are Maſters of, and they may think I have not ſeen. For theſe will alſo be extreamly uſeful to me. And the more exact and particular the Notices are which I ſhall receive, ſo much the leſs will the Reader be diſappointed in the Matter and Method of my Hiſtory. But if the Learned World, who I think have no ſmall Intereſt in Works of this Nature, ſhall neglect to give me the Aſſiſtance I have begg'd of them, they muſt blame themſelves, and not me, if my Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry falls ſhort of their Expectation.</p>

After this he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Merits were quickly taken notice of, and rewarded with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Applauſe due to a Perſon of ſo extraordinary Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Put ſome unlucky Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb facs="tcp:60048:18"/>in his Affairs forcing him to remove to <hi>Genoua,</hi> he had there an opportunity to diſplay his Eloquence in that famous Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy; which he did to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſatisfaction of the Learn'd Nobility of that City, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Diſcourſes on <hi>Cebes</hi>'s Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. From hence after a while he came back to <hi>Rome,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entertain'd in the Palace of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> he writ on the occaſion of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>'s Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a deſcription of the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Panegyrical Diſcourſe on that Pope, Entituled, <hi>The Pomps of the Campidoglio,</hi> when His Holineſs Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> took Poſſeſſion of the Church of St. <hi>John Lateran.</hi> This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb facs="tcp:60048:19"/>was ſo full of fine thoughts elegantly expreſt, that all <hi>Italy</hi> admir'd it, and <hi>Maſcardi</hi>'s Fame receiv'd from it ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, that he was rank'd among the beſt Writers of the Age. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Pope advanc'd him to the Dignity of Gentleman of his Bed-Chamber, and he likewiſe was made Rhetorick Profeſſor in the Publick Schools of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe Employments were indeed of no inconſiderable value, but yet below his great Merit, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune always declaring her ſelf an Enemy to Worth and Vertue. Some few Years after this <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardi</hi> came to <hi>Venice,</hi> to take care of the Impreſſion of his Works, and honour'd our Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo far as to be admitted a
<pb facs="tcp:60048:19"/>Member of it. But after a ſhort ſtay with us, his Employments call'd him back to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Ingenuity and Learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain exerted it ſelf, no leſs to his own immortal honour, than to the enriching and beautifying our Language: For in all his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings he ſhew'd himſelf a Man well skill'd in all uſeful and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel ſorts of Learning, of a ſound Judgment, pure Eloquence, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fancy, and a noble way of Expreſſion peculiar to himſelf. The Conſpiracy of <hi>John Lewis</hi> Count <hi>de Fieſchi</hi> is a clear proof how well he would have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his deſign of Writing a general Hiſtory of the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Italy</hi> in the laſt Century; ſince by this he hath made it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
<pb facs="tcp:60048:20"/>vident, that he was Maſter in the higheſt degree of all thoſe perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, without the concurrence of which, as he proves in his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Tract of the Art of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Hiſtory, no Man deſerves the Name of a Compleat Hiſtorian.

But after I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd the Two former Verſions of it, I
<pb facs="tcp:60048:22"/>found my ſelf, out of Juſtice to my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, rather oblig'd to proceed in the Publication of theſe Papers, then to deſiſt from it. The Firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of this piece of <hi>Maſcardi</hi>'s, that I know of, makes up the Fifth part of the Third Book of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> or the Illuſtrious Baſſa, a Romance written by Monſieur <hi>Scudery,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh'd</hi> in the Year <hi>1674. Scudery</hi> is indeed ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuons as to acknowledg that he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to <hi>Maſcardi</hi> for that part of his Story; and it were to be wiſh'd that he had been ſo juſt to our Author, as to have given us only a Tranſlation of him. But inſtead of that he hath foiſted in ſo many Fictions of his own, as degrade <hi>Maſcardi</hi> from the Majeſty of an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and bring him down to his own Level of a tedious Romancer. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, <hi>Maſcardi</hi> hath been much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd by the Tranſlator of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who expoſes himſelf in almoſt every Page to his juſt Cenſure, That he was neither Maſter of his own Language, nor of the <hi>French;</hi> and conſequently might have employ'd his time much better, then in
<pb facs="tcp:60048:23"/>troubling the World with an ill Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Book tedious by its length, uſeleſe in its deſign, and therefore on very good grounds diſlik'd (as ſuch Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers generally are) by the preſent Age. Nay even the Fair Sex have now left theſe vain Amuſements, of which they formerly were Zealous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers for the more delightful and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Study of True Hiſtory: Being juſtly ſenſible that one of the ſtrongeſt Motives to Virtue muſt be drawn from the Real Examples of it. And theſe a good Hiſtorian never fails to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in their true Light, with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conſequences and great Rewards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. Whereas the Subject of our Modern Romancers is generally the blameable exceſs of all Humane Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Deſires, as an ungovernable Anger, an exorbitant and boundleſs Ambition, and inſatiable Revenge, an inconſiderate and blind Raſhneſs, and a fooliſh and irregular Love. Theſe, and ſuch like are the ſhining Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Fictitious Heroes and Heroines: And 'tis no wonder that
<pb facs="tcp:60048:23"/>when an Author of Wit and Fancy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys all his Art in repreſenting Vice in ſo lovely a Dreſs, the unwary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are taken with its borrow'd Charms, and are ſeduced into theſe fatal, tho' pleaſing, Errors.</p>
            <p>As for the other Taanſlation of <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>'s Conſpiracy, which I ſaw not till after the firſt Sheet of mine was Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it came out in the Year <hi>1678,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ſelect Diſcourſes Tranſlated from thoſe Celebrated Wits of <hi>France, Peliſſon, Saraſin,</hi> and <hi>Voiture.</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this to have found the faults of the former Tranſlation, ſo well mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Publiſhing of mine, would rather injure <hi>Maſcardi</hi>'s Reputation, than, in any meaſure, do him Juſtice. But upon peruſing this Verſion, and comparing it with the Original, I found that beſides the roughneſs of his <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Stile, and ſevaral very obvious Errors, the Gentleman had allow'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the extravagant Liberty of Omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, where he pleas'd, ſeveral mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial paſſages of it: Whereby thoſe Beauties that ſbine through a regular
<pb facs="tcp:60048:24"/>and well connected Hiſtory are quite loſt; and <hi>Maſcardi</hi> hath ſuffer'd no leſs by the Injudicious and Arbitrary Abbreviatures of this Tranſlator, than by that barren ſuperfluity, for which <hi>Scudery</hi> is ſo juſtly cenſur'd by Monſieur <note n="(e)" place="margin">Abon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance Sterile <hi>Boileau</hi> L' Art Poetiqae Chant. premier.</note>

            <p>Theſe Conſiderations induced me to believe, that this Third Tranſlation wou'd not be unacceptable to the World, nor much derogatory to the Fame of ſo Great an Author. How I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd my Part in it, I freely leave to the Judgment of thoſe who underſtand the Idioms of both Languages: Which though not ſo different from each other, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> is from the <hi>French,</hi> yet are not ſo nearly alike, as to admit of a Tranſlation too nicely and exactly Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon I have all along chang'd <hi>Maſcardi</hi>'s Expreſſions where I found them not ſutable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dialect: And where, I thought the turn of that requir'd it, I have in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:60048:24"/>places abridg'd the length of his Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, in others I have enlarg'd upon his thoughts, as I believe he himſelf would have done, had he been to write in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But I have not at all, (as I know of) by either of theſe Methods, varied from my Author's Senſe, or gone beyond the Liberty which he <note n="(f)" place="margin">

            <p>Having ſaid thus much concerning the enſuing Tract, and the ſeveral Tranſlations of it, it will not I ſuppoſe be improper to take ſome notice of the ſubject it treats of. <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was a Tranſaction as remarkable as any that happen'd in the laſt Century: Whether we Conſider the crafty and well diſpos'd Methods by which it was carried on, the Foreign Force that was
<pb facs="tcp:60048:25"/>to have ſeconded the Attempt, or the Wonderful Providence of God in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating ſo Egregious a Villany, juſt as it was upon the point of being put in execution. The Copiouſneſs of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might perhaps be ſome inducement to <hi>Maſcardi</hi> to chuſe it for his firſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Eſſay; but I ſuppoſe his main deſign in it was to encourage the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noueſes</hi> in a vigorous and reſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Liberties, by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good ſucceſs that had in the laſt Age attended the ſupporters of that Noble Cauſe, and the ſhameful defeats and diſappointments that blaſted all the Projects of the Enemies of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. And if we reflect on the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe times, it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeaſonable and neceſſary piece of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice not only to <hi>Genoua,</hi> but alſo to all <hi>Italy.</hi>

The Irruption therefore of the <hi>French</hi>

And 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great pity that this excellent Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Tract is not again Reprinted in its Original Language, for the better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of thoſe <hi>Genoueſes</hi> who may be apt to be wheedled by Monſieur <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benac</hi>'s ſmooth Harangues into a vain Opinion, that the <hi>French</hi> King really deſigns their Repoſe and Proſperity; and therefore deſires their Friendſhip and Alliance, whom about Eight Years ago he treated like the Vileſt and moſt Deſpicable Slaves. But the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Affairs are not a little changed from what they were: And <hi>Louis</hi> the <hi>XIVth</hi> who then laid his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Commands on this Republick, to Reſtore the <hi>Fieſchi's</hi> to thoſe Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Poſſeſſions that their Anceſtors had juſtly forfeited by this Execrable Conſpiracy, and upon their Wiſe Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
<pb facs="tcp:60048:26"/>expreſt his Reſentments of it, (as all <hi>Europe</hi> knows) with an unheard of Inſolence, is now fain to ſue to them for a Neutrality: And that in Terms but little ſutable to thoſe Pompous and Swelling Titles his Flatterers have forged for him.</p>
            <p>It would be no difficult matter to draw a Parallel between the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> of <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Party in the laſt Age, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Male-Contents in this. Their Forgetfulneſs of their late Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Servitude, their Ingratitude to <hi>Doria</hi> the Reſtorer of their Liberty, their Fondneſs of a <hi>French</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Fickleneſs and Inſtability of their Reſolutions, their eaſie Credulity in being more than once deluded by the ſame fair Pretences and ſpecious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and the wonderful Defeat of all their Deſigns, ſhould methinks make the Application Obvious enough to the moſt Bigotted Enemy of our preſent Settlement, But perhaps this Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sect will be as regardleſs of the Examples drawn from Hiſtory, as they have hitherto been of all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:60048:27"/>that have been urg'd from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to Convince them of their Error: However, let them conſult their own Experience, and that may ſufficiently inform them, that Providence ſeldom (I might ſay, never) fails even at the laſt Critical Inſtant, to reſcue an Eſtabliſh'd and well Adminiſtred Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from the Tyrannical Yoke of a Foreign Invader, or a Rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. They might likewiſe for their farther diſcouragement remember what a conſtant Series of ill Succeſs has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended all their Projects; that their Plots have been ſtill diſappointed, their moſt Cunning Deſigns unravell'd; and that after their inceſſant and reſtleſs Endeavours for almoſt Four Years, Their Majeſties Sacred Perſons are yet ſafe, and their Government ſtands ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. So that unleſs this diſcontented Party continue under the ſame change, Infatuation that hath ſo long poſſeſt them, they muſt certainly now deſpair of ever ſeeing Popery and Arbitrary Power again Triumphant in <hi>England.</hi> And this, if any thing, will perhaps
<pb facs="tcp:60048:27"/>induce them out of a tender regard to their own ſafety to deſiſt from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Conſpiracies and Barbarous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt the Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Providence of God hath fix'd on ſo firm a Baſis, that, I doubt not but, the final Conſequence of all their Malicious Projects, how ſubtilly ſoever they may be contriv'd and carri'd on, will be the deſtruction of their Cauſe, and their own unpitied Ruine.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60048:29"/>the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France; Andrew Doria,</hi> a General very Famous both for Courage and Skill in Maritime Affairs, fought under the <hi>French</hi> Colours; his conduct wonderfully kept up the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and promoted the Intereſts of that Crown: While at the ſame time that he faithfully diſcharged the Truſt repoſed in him he took a ſevere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for thoſe Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties they exerciſed at the ſacking of <hi>Genoua</hi> in the Year 1522.</p>
            <p>But Princes are very often ſo ſatally unhappy as to diſeſteem their braveſt Subjects, while they are ready and willing to ſerve them with Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diligence.

The King was ſo well ſatisfied of the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Petition, that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ſhou'd be granted: But when he had balanc'd in his Mind on the one ſide the Obligations he was under to be Juſt to his Word, and on the other ſide the hopes of improving his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he roſolved (contrary to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,) to keep the City in his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

               </gap>ave at his command a convenient
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60048:31"/>Port, he made choice of <hi>Savona,</hi> and gave the charge of it to Monſeigneur <hi>de Montmorancy.</hi> By this ſtratagem the King aſſured himſelf, that he had both put a check to the inconſtancy of the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> and made his own undertakings more eaſie to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: For the City of <hi>Savona</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to <hi>Piedmont, Montferrat</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> was by its ſituation no leſs proper for War, than for Commerce; which gave the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> occaſion to fear, that its increaſe in Wealth and Reputation wou'd in a few Years ſpoil the Traffick of the Port of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and thereby enable <hi>Savona</hi> to claim an equal ſhare with them in the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the adjacent Seas. All theſe matters had been frequently repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King, but without any good effect, ſo that at laſt <hi>Doria</hi> was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated out of his ſincere Love to his Country to abandon the <hi>French</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts. He being now throughly exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the many Contempts before related, grew every day leſs and leſs exact in the furthering the King's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60048:31"/>and it happening luckily about this time, (1528,) that the City of <hi>Naples</hi> was beſieged by the <hi>French</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>Lautrech</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Milan, Philippin Doria</hi> in purſuance of the directions given him by <hi>Andrew,</hi> did by his voluntary neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ſuffer the <hi>French</hi> King's Affairs to receive an irreparable damage. For he, who but a little before had with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Valor, obtained a remarkable Victory over the Emperor's Fleet in the Gulph of <hi>Salernum,</hi> (in which Fight the Imperaliſts loſt <hi>Don Hugh de Moncada</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Sicily,</hi> their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,) was now pleaſed to permit, without any oppoſition, ſome ſmall Veſſels laden with Proviſions, to ſail by his Fleet into <hi>Naples:</hi> And this Relief coming ſo ſeaſonably to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, proved the ruin of this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. As ſoon as Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh had received notice that <hi>Doria</hi> began to fall off from the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> he diſpatch'd orders to Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Salviati</hi> his Nuncio in that Court, to repreſent to the King, how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60048:32"/>it was for him by juſt and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Conceſſions, to regain to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Crown a Perſon of ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Courage and Skill in Maritime Affairs; ſince it was highly probable, that <hi>Doria,</hi> if he were throughly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperated, would ſhelter himſelf, and the Intereſts of the Republick, under the Emperor's Protection; which cou'd not fail to defeat the Expectations the <hi>French</hi> then had of the Conqueſt of <hi>Naples.</hi> At the ſame time that theſe friendly intimations were poſted away to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> the Pope diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd <hi>Sanga</hi> his Secretary to Cajole <hi>Doria</hi> into his Service, with the offer of a large Penſion. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was at that time juſtly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, that <hi>Doria</hi>'s Intereſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation might probably over-balance the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> to the advantage of the Emperor, if he ſhou'd be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to comply with the honourable propoſals offer'd him by his Imperial Majeſty: Therefore that this foreſeen accident might be effectually provided againſt, and not (as was falſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60048:32"/>for any occaſion the Pope then had of <hi>Doria</hi>'s commanding his Fleet, this Crafty Embaſſy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on as the moſt likely method to prevail. When this important affair came to be debated in the <hi>French</hi> King's Privy Council, ſome that were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to <hi>Doria,</hi> took this occaſion to repreſent him as a Perſon ſo exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haughty in the exerciſe of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſo throughly diſguſted at the King's Uſage of him, that it wou'd be impoſſible ever to regain him to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſts; therefore that a ſudden ſtroke might fruſtrate thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which cou'd not without vaſt difficulties (if at all) be diverted by an amicable accommodation; and that the Emperor might want ſo neceſſary an Aſſiſtant in this juncture of Affairs, it was thought adviſable that <hi>Doria</hi> ſhould be Aſſaſſinated. This advice was not rejected, but in purſuance of it, (as was generally reported,) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Inſtructions were privately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Monſieur <hi>de Barbezieux</hi> who was then Sailing for <hi>Italy,</hi> with the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60048:33"/>
               <hi>French</hi> Fleet, of which he had been created Admiral a little before. <hi>Doria</hi> in the mean time received private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of theſe deſigns; and being throughly exaſperated with ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and perfidious a return for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Services, he immediately entred into a cloſe correſpondence with the Marqueſs <hi>del Vaſto</hi> his Priſoner of War, by whom he offer'd his Service to the Emperor, which was very readily and kindly accepted. And now <hi>Doria</hi> made a publick Renunciation of his Friendſhip with the <hi>French</hi> King, by ſending him back the Collar and the Inſtrument of his Admiſſion to the Order of St. <hi>Michael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Articles that <hi>Doria</hi> made with the Emperor when he firſt entred into his Service, were ſuch as the Republick might reaſonably promiſe themſelves from a ſincere Patriot. He wholly neglected this advantageous occaſion of increaſing the Honours and Revenues of his Family, contenting himſelf that he had effectually ſecured the Liberty of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and reſtored to them their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60048:33"/>over <hi>Savona,</hi> by the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſſiſtance of his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. This Reſolution of <hi>Doria</hi> ſo throughly awakened the <hi>French</hi> King out of the ſlumber into which the falſe Policy of his Miniſters had caſt him, that being deſirous to repair his paſt negligence, by his preſent ſedulity, he thought it adviſable to endeavour to regain <hi>Doria</hi> to his Intereſts by honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and advantageous Propoſals: But the King's Repentance began ſo late that it proved abſolutely fruitleſs. For <hi>Doria</hi> being now throughly bent upon the delivering his Country from the power of Foreigners, wou'd not admit of any offers that might delay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of theſe his generous deſigns. Nevertheleſs the <hi>French</hi> King who had been ſo careleſs to keep in the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Doria,</hi> became now ſo eagerly impatient to recover that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how great reſpect was due to a Crowned Head, he ſtoop'd ſo low as voluntarily to offer a full ſatisfaction in all thoſe particulars, which <hi>Doria</hi> had often Petitioned for, and had been
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60048:34"/>as often denied: Nay, with ſo great indiſcretion was this affair managed, that, by making theſe Propoſals to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> before ſome other perſon had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſounded his Intentions in it, the King expoſed his Royal Dignity to the diſgrace, and himſelf to the ſhame and vexation, of receiving a peremptory repulſe. Accidents of this nature are often obſerved to happen in the Courts of Princes; who being puffed up with inſolent thoughts of their own power, believe that their Fortune needs not the aſſiſtance of any one to eſtabliſh or ſupport it. And ſometimes brave Men, who are conſtantly in the Camp, or at Court, miſs of that eſteem which is due to their Merits, and which is daily beſtowed on far leſs deſerving perſons, if they have but the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Character of being Foreigners: It being too Natural to Princes, as well as the reſt of Mankind, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value their preſent Enjoyments, and hanker after unexperienced Novelties, no leſs in the Publick, than in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, Circumſtances of their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60048:34"/>
               <hi>Doria</hi> having for theſe reaſons, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled himſelf, and the Twelve Gallies under his Command, in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Service, he preſently applied his Mind to the deliverance of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the Dominion of <hi>France;</hi> for, like a true Patriot, the Liberty of his Country had always been the only Object of his Thoughts. The Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick was at this time overpowered by a Popular Faction, who under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the publick ſafety, fomented with Arms and Tumults the unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Paſſions of Private Families; not making a due difference between the Liberty of the Common-Wealth, and the Licentiouſneſs of ſome of the Members of it. Hence it came to paſs, that whenever any Faction found that their own Forces were too weak to deſend them in their Irregularities, they reinforced themſelves with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Auxiliaries, and thereby brought into the City a new Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. One while the Faction of the <hi>Adorni</hi> Expelled that of the <hi>Fregoſi;</hi> a while after the <hi>Fregoſi</hi> overpower'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60048:35"/>the <hi>Adorni:</hi> Sometimes they gave themſelves into the Protection of the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> then again they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Governors he ſent them Next they choſe to be under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>French,</hi> by and by they ſhook off that Yoke, and then were again willing to receive it. So that by the frequent change of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations the dangerous wounds that had ſo long afflicted the Republick, (and that ought to have been once for all throughly healed by a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,) were ſtill kept open: All this <hi>Doria</hi> was ſenſible of, and therefore, that he might encourage the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of thoſe perſons who joined with him in their earneſt Wiſhes for the Publick Safety, he approach'd with his Gallies near the City of <hi>Genoua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was a proſperous ſucceſs want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe his generous deſigns. For many of the Citizens, being throughly wearied out with the Calamities of their paſt Diſſentions, and being affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Plague, returned to more ſober Thoughts, and heartily
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60048:35"/>Prayed for a ſafe and laſting Concord. At this time the City was Governed in the <hi>French</hi> King's Name by Monſieur <hi>Theodore de Trivalce,</hi> a perſon whoſe ſignal behaviour in thoſe Martial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments wherewith he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, had acquired him the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a Prudent as well as a Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Commander. Nevertheleſs his Conduct was at this time ſuch as was greatly wondred at by thoſe that knew him, and the rather becauſe it did not ſeem to anſwer thoſe former Actions by which he had ſo deſervedly eſtabliſh'd his Reputation. For although he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knew that the diſcourſe and the deſigns of the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> tended ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a mutual agreement among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet he was very negligent in the thwarting theſe their Inclinations: Either becauſe he thought, the end of it wou'd only be a Reconciliation of the private Animoſities between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Nobility and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty: Or becauſe, he cou'd hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think it poſſible that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Genoun,</hi> which was put in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60048:36"/>
               <hi>French</hi> King's Hands meerly by their inteſtine diviſions, cou'd be taken from him by the united ſtrength of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; he preſumptuouſly conceited that to be much too weak to reſiſt the King's Forces, when headed by ſo Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant a Leader as himſelf: <hi>Doria</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Citizens ſo well diſpoſed, and being throughly apprehenſive of the vaſt Advantages ſo unexpectedly given him by Monſieur <hi>de Trivulce</hi>'s over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, immediately applied himſelf to the bringing this his Enterprize to a concluſion; which ſucceeded ſo well, that without the ſhedding of any blood he took the City, and drave out of it the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon. The <hi>Genoueſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with all the marks of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Joy, and many of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to accept of the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Liguria,</hi> now that Fortune had ſo kindly offered it him: But he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly refuſed it, his Mind being far above the dazling ſplendor of a Crown. The next thing he did was to exhort the Citizens in a well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Speech, (fitly becoming the Father
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60048:36"/>of his Country,) to repent of their paſt Errors, to know their true Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and for the future to maintain their Liberty, (which he now freely preſented to them,) by laying aſide all thoſe Diſſentions, which had for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years kept their Country in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Miſeries. The City being thus reſtor'd to its Ancient Liberty, it prov'd no difficult matter for them, either to gain the Caſtle, into which Monſieur <hi>de Trivulce</hi> preſently retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by force of Arms to Conquer <hi>Savona:</hi> As a puniſhment of whoſe Rebellion, its Harbour was made uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Two Veſſels of the largeſt ſize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſunk juſt at the mouth of it to choak the paſſage. The City of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> being thus vaſtly oblig'd to <hi>Doria</hi> for ſo many ſignal Kindneſſes to them, they were deſirous to give effectual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of their Real Gratitude to himſelf and his Family; hereupon they granted to him and to his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents very large and noble Privileges, and erected to his Immortal Memory a Statue of <hi>Lunigian</hi> Marble, in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60048:37"/>baſe whereof an Inſcription was Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which declar'd him to be the Author of the Publick Liberty. Then, for their better ſecurity, the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> with the advice of <hi>Doria</hi> their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, Conſtituted a Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwerable to a Free State, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which their Ancient Splendor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to revive: And this renown'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot having Atchiev'd many Glorious Enterprizes, and growing decrepit with the Infirmities of Old Age, retir'd from the hurry of the World to a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Repoſe in his own Country, them enjoying in his own Mind the fruit of thoſe Victories, and that Quiet, which he had been the happy Inſtrument of He kept with him in his Family <hi>Janne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Doria,</hi> the Son of <hi>Thomas,</hi> his Couſin-German: This <hi>Jannetin</hi> was a young Man of a very ready Wit, and of approv'd Courage; of which he had given ſo many ſignal demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in thoſe Employments which he manag'd under <hi>Andrew,</hi> that he was deſervedly adopted for his Son, and by the Emperor's conſent deſign'd to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60048:37"/>ſucceed him in his ſupreme Command of the Maritime Affairs. Hence it came to paſs that <hi>Doria,</hi> being highly eſteem'd by all the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> for his excellent Endowments, being reverenc'd by the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> as their common Benefactor, and having gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large Stock both of Reputation and Wealth, his Houſe was frequented more like the Palace of a Prince, than the Reſidence of a private Citizen. Theſe things, (which I have here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in as few words as the matter will allow,) were the true occaſion of the Conſpiracy ſo cunningly and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately contrived by <hi>John Lewis</hi> Count <hi>de Fieſchi:</hi> And by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Example all free Cities may perceive, how vaſtly prejudicial it is to their Publick Affairs, to advance any of their Members, (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Eminent for Vertue, Valour and Conduct,) to a great degree of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Riches, or Power, above their Fellow-Subjects: The neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting which dangers, induc'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> wiſely to Publiſh their Law of <hi>Oſtraciſm.</hi>

Beſides this, <hi>Paul</hi> the Third had an Animoſity againſt him upon another account: And this made the more laſting Impreſſion upon his Mind, becauſe it was occaſion'd by ſome private Injuries which had mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally paſt between them; the Original whereof I think it neceſſary to relate, as ſerving to my preſent purpoſe.</p>

               </gap>ow in the World. But the Pope's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, pretending that the Inheritance of this Eſtate was wholly devolv'd to the Apoſtolick See by the Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Church, took poſſeſſion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60048:39"/>of it immediately; and executed their Commiſſion with ſo much inſolence and extortion, that they ſeem'd rather to be common High-way-men, than Collectors deputed to enter upon the Lands and receive the Rents. <hi>Doria</hi> repreſented to the Pope the ill uſage he had ſuffer'd from his Officers, and made out his claim to the Eſtate; which, though it was not allowed by the Officers of the Pope's Exchequer, yet it proved an inducement to Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Alexander Farneſe</hi> the Pope's Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, to offer him civilly to reſign his pretended intereſt in it, on condition he would receive it as his free gift. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> being irritated with Scorn and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the Cardinal's unſeaſonable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, in giving him what was his own, (though the Cardinal's covetous temper did ſeldom permit him to be guilty even of that ſeeming Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) and thinking the uſage he had met with to be directly contrary to the meaſures of Juſtice, as well as unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable affronts offer'd to a Perſon of his Rank, he reſolv'd, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60048:39"/>apparent dangers of ſuch an Enterprize, to lay aſide for a while his wonted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Roman See, and the uſual calmneſs of his Temper, that he might gain Satisfaction by thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, which beſt become a Soldier, ſenſible of injuries and deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them. Hereupon he imparted his Intentions to <hi>Jannetin Doria</hi> his Couſin, and gave him orders to ſeize the Pope's Galleys and bring them into the Port of <hi>Genoua,</hi> which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done. After he had detain'd them for ſome days, he releaſed them of his own accord; being very well pleas'd to let the World ſee, that tho he wanted neither Power nor Courage to ſhew his reſentments of the Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities put upon him, yet he had ſo much reſpect for the head of the Church, as to reſtrain himſelf, (tho he had theſe great advantages) from taking a compleate Revenge. The moſt judicious Politicians commended <hi>Doria</hi>'s Prudence in this Action for theſe two Reaſons: Firſt, that he did it at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> upon whom
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60048:40"/>the Pope had taken reprizals in his own Territories, uſing them withall very ill, ſince the Seiſure of his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: And next (which they ſuppos'd the chief reaſon) that enjoying ſo high a Command under the Emperor, he would not make uſe of his Princes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to revenge his own private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; knowing better how to make the due diſtinction between Publick and Private concerns, whereby he preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Flame from burſting out, which though kindled at firſt upon a triſling Quarrel, might not perhaps have been extinguiſht without much Bloodſhed.</p>
            <p>The Pope and the <hi>French</hi> King being throughly vext to find their Affairs both Publick and Private in ſo ill a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, appli'd their minds with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt intention, to cauſe ſuch alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Genoua,</hi> as might give them a fair opportunity to open the Scene they had laid for the Execution of their Deſigns.

            <p>
               <hi>John Lewis de Fieſchi</hi> a young Man of a Haughty and Turbulent Spirit, was about this time almoſt diſtracted with ambitious Thoughts, how he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Title and Reputation. He deſcended from the noble Family of the Lords of the Territory of <hi>Lavagna,</hi> and as his Eſtate was large, ſo his Intereſt was very great, being attended by his Friends and Adherents, (who were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60048:41"/>Men) and ſerved in great Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor by many of his own Vaſſals. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he was not contented with theſe happy and honourable Circumſtances, deriv'd to him by Inheritance from his Anceſtors; but ſuffer'd himſelf to be carried away by the impetuous heat of his Youth, and the pernicious dictates of Ambition (the too common Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of noble Perſons) to aſpire at a height of Power and Dignity, no leſs dangerous to be obtain'd than difficult to be kept. Even from his very Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood there was obſerv'd in ſeveral of his Actions a Fierceneſs and Arrogance hardly to be found in any of ſo tender an Age: From whence ſeveral conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſons were induced to ſuſpect, that his riper Years might puſh him on to endeavour the Diſturbance of his Country's Peace. Theſe his natural inclinations (pernicious enough of themſelves) grew more prevalent by an ill Education, that peſtilent diſtemper which too often infects young Men beyond a poſſibility of cure. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho <hi>Paul Panſa</hi> a Man of Eminent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60048:41"/>Learning and Vertue, was appointed to inſtruct him in the Liberal Arts, yet thoſe with whom he moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately convers'd, being very lewd and profligate Fellows, made it their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cheriſh and propagate, in the mind of the young Count, the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſubverting the Republick, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding theſe propos'd Enterprizes as worthy of the moſt noble and generous Spirits. To this new kindl'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Flame his Mother continually added a ſupply of Fuel: For being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ambitious, and not having Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to foreſee the diſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of her Proceedings, ſhe often excited her Son, who was of an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Temper with ſharp reproofs; as if by enjoying his own Eſtate and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon it, he ſunk into the deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character of a private Country Gentleman, and degenerated from the Reputation of his Anceſtors, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways maintain'd a conſiderable intereſt both in their own Country and in the Courts of Foreign Princes. And that nothing might be wanting to force this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60048:42"/>falling weight to the bottom of the precipice from whence he had ſlipt by his wild Ambition, his Friends advis'd to peruſe diligently the life of <hi>Nero,</hi> the Hiſtory of <hi>Cataline</hi>'s Conſpiracy, and <hi>Nicholas Machiavell</hi>'s little Book, <hi>Entitul'd the Prince:</hi> By reading theſe Authors, his mind was by degrees tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd with Cruelty, Perfidiouſneſs, and a love ſo great to his private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, as to baniſh all Apprehenſions of Divine and Humane Laws. Theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he firſt admir'd, and though the innate Senſe of good and evil was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo prevalent, as to ſuggeſt to him that he ought to deteſt and abhor ſuch Practices as unworthy of a Man of Honour, yet at length yielding to his corrupt Inclinations, he excus'd them by the Actions of theſe great Men, recorded by Hiſtorians, and too much imitated by the moſt Politick Stateſmen. So powerſully are the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our lives inſluenc'd either to Vertue or Vice, and our wills inſenſibly chang'd by reading the Works of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Authors; whoſe charming way
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60048:42"/>of Writing ſeldom fails to over-balance the ſober Dictates of our own Reaſon, which rather ought to be our Guide.</p>
            <p>Theſe qualifications of the young Count were quickly found out by thoſe who diligently watcht for all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of raiſing their own Fortunes by the Ruin of <hi>Genoua.</hi> Upon ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts they thought him the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Inſtrument that cou'd be, to carry on this their important Deſign; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fail'd not very often to excite him to it, by propoſing to him very great Honours and Advantages. The firſt who by the <hi>French</hi> King's Order held a correſpondence with him to this end, where <hi>Caeſar Fregoſe</hi> and <hi>Cagnino Conzaga,</hi> as was diſcover'd not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by ſome Papers, which fell into the hands of the Marqueſs <hi>del Vaſto,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Milan</hi> by the Emperors Commiſſion. He being deſirous by a provident Caution to prevent the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which might hereby interrupt the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> acquainted <hi>Doria</hi> with his Suſpicions: But the good old Man gave no credit to them, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60048:43"/>by the Affection he bore to the Count, and by the Obſervations he had made of the indiſcretion of altering his meaſures upon a bare conjecture. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>William Bellay</hi> the King's Principal Miniſter of State, manag'd this buſineſs by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Peter Luke Fieſchi;</hi> and as the report went, the Pope was as zealous in it as the French King. For the Count having taken a journey to <hi>Piacenza,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of <hi>Peter Lewis Farneſe,</hi> the Pope's Natural Son, who aſſum'd the Title of Duke of that State; he bought of him four Gallies at a moderate Price, on this expreſs Condition that the Count ſhould receive out of the Pope's Exchequer a ſufficient allowance for the Manning, Arming, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of them. For the Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Bargain, the Count <hi>de Fieſchi</hi> continu'd his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was receiv'd by the Pope, with all the ſigns of an extraordinary love and an entire confidence; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of him without any difficulty the incouragement he had ſo earneſtly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60048:43"/>wiſht for. It was the conjecture of ſome Perſons that the Story of the Count's buying the Gallies of the Duke of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> was invented to ſave the Pope's credit, he being unwilling to afford his aſſiſtance to <hi>Fieſchi's</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize in ſo publick a manner, as it muſt have been, had he declar'd that they were fitted out by his Order. I know that ſome Writers are very ſollicitous to acquit the Pope and his Son from the ſcandal of having ſtirr'd up the Count to ſo black a deſign againſt his Country, by the Teſtimony of <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi> the Duke's Secretary and intimate Friend; who being kept Priſoner at <hi>Milan,</hi> and being put to the Torture to force from him a ſatisfactory anſwer to this Queſtion propos'd by <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante Gonzaga,</hi> did even in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his Suffering, conſtantly deny that either the Duke or the Pope had any hand in <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Conſpiracy. Nor do I think it worth my while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them herein, but ſhall leave theſe conjectures on both ſides to be ſifted by thoſe whoſe copious Writings
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60048:44"/>may adinit of a longer digreſſion. This is beyond diſpute, that the general Opinion at that time was that the Count's final reſolutions were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the advice and incouragements he receiv'd from <hi>Rome:</hi> And the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Miniſters of State thought it was ſo manifeſt, that when the Pope ſent <hi>Camillo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſino</hi> to the Emperor, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Duke's death, to deſire the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> they very freely and ſharply reproacht his Maſter the Pope, with the favouring and forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo infamous a deſign. That this was likewiſe the Opinion of <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> may appear by the following Circumſtance. The Pope ſent him a Letter of Condoleance upon the <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Janu.</hi> 2. 1547.</note> death of his Couſin <hi>Jannetin,</hi> to which he return'd no anſwer, ſlighting it as a piece of ill tim'd Ceremony: But a while after when the Duke of <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza</hi> was <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sep.</hi> 28. 1547.</note> killed by ſeveral Conſpirators, <hi>Doria</hi> took the Pope's Letter, and having alter'd ſome expreſſions in it as he thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60048:44"/>he ſent it back to the Pope by vay of Condoleance for the Duke's Death Beſides this, it is moſt certain that while the Count <hi>de Fieſchi</hi> ſtaid in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Miniſters did again ſollicite him to put thoſe deſigns in Execution, to which they perceiv'd him very much inclin'd. To this end Cardinal <hi>Auguſtine Trivulce</hi> Protector of the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> being ſenſible how much diligence had been uſed by the other Miniſters of that Crown, and particularly a little before by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tter Strozzi</hi> when he paſs'd over the <hi>Alpes</hi> with his Army into <hi>Piedmont</hi>) reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to be behind any of them, in manifeſting his zeal for the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. Therefore he fixt a time for meeting the Count, and knowing him to be exceſſively ambitious of Fame and Glory, he appli'd himſelf to him in this manner.</p>
            <p>Were Fortune propitious to your vertue (moſt noble Youth) I ſhould then have juſt occaſion to rejoice with you, whom I ſhould now behold exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted far above that middle State of life
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60048:45"/>enjoy'd by trading Citizens. But ſince the Iniquity of the times denies you a reward ſuitable to your Merit, I deſire you kindly to accept my affection, by which I Sympathize with you in your Misfortunes, and from my heart wiſh you (as all good Men do) a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of more happy Events. Your Birth is ſo noble, and your Endowments are ſo Rare, that the general voice of the World calls you to a higher Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you may be the better able to promote their common good. Among the reſt of your Admirers, I, who upon the account of my Employments have a nearer view of Publick Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, do heartily wiſh to ſee your Valour diſplay'd to the eyes of <hi>Europe,</hi> on a Theatre more ſtately than that whereon you now ſo well act your part. You were born in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy juncture of time, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſtitution of your own Country makes it unlawful and dangerous for you to aſpire to any very eminent Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> having diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Obedience to the King of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60048:45"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> and brought all to a common equality, will by no means permit you to enjoy any Character above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary level of a Citizen. Beſides this, <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> and his Couſin <hi>Jannetin,</hi> under the ſpecious pretence of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>Genoua</hi> its ancient Liberty, have ſo firmly eſtabliſht their own Power, that the moſt univerſal Concord of the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> conſiſts in their being willing to enſlave themſelves to the Arbitrary commands of that Family. Thus by a ſervile Subjection to the Tyranny of two private Perſons, do this fooliſh People ſufficiently puniſh themſelves, for having raſhly executed their blind Reſolution of withdrawing themſelves from the Protection of a moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince. Theſe <hi>Doria's</hi> being thus Bolſter'd up by the aſſiſtance of the Emperor's Army, (to whoſe affairs the late turn in <hi>Genoua</hi> has been very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous) and growing more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable by their numerous Fleet which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fills the Port, you may be ſure will never permit any noble and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute mind to exert its ſelf: For if any

Hence it is that any ſo well Born and Accompliſht as your ſelf, cannot fail while their Power is ſo great to be continually diſturb'd with Injuries, beſides the danger that their lives are daily expos'd to. 'Tis true, none of the Diſorders I have hinted at have hitherto appear'd; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that is to be aſcrib'd partly to the diſtruſt, the <hi>Doria's</hi> have of their new gotten and yet unſettled Power, and in a great meaſure to the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Andrew,</hi> who curbs <hi>Jannetin</hi> in his raſh and ill advis'd Deſigns. Can you think that this Young Man, whoſe haughty Temper, and impetuous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60048:47"/>know no limits, will be hindr'd by any conſideration of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Action, from executing thoſe deſigns his Fancy may prompt him to? Since he finds himſelf guarded by Soldiers whom he can truſt, and is upon the account of the important office he bears, every day addreſs'd to with vaſt reſpect by the young Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the City? Can you think that ſo high a Spirit will ſuffer it ſelf to be confin'd within the bounds of a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Power? Or that his thirſt of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which encreaſes daily by the near view he has of it, will be ſatisfi'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Blood of many innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Can you think that that additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Honour and Authority which Fortune partial in his Favour, and the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> blinded with an exceſſive love to <hi>Andrew</hi> have fixt upon him, will content him? Or can you believe that he does not aſpire after the acquiſition of a more pompous Title, than that of <hi>Jannetin Doria?</hi> As for my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give credit to a ſuppoſition ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable. For he has not Moderation
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60048:48"/>enough, either to know how, or to be willing to give a check to ſo fierce torrent of extraordinary Felicity. Theſe his Projects are for a while retarded (as far as I can gueſs) by his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Death, which cannot be very far off; and then you will ſee him aſſume to himſelf an abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Altho' by ſo villainous an Invaſion he caſts indelible ſtain on all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits done by <hi>Andrew</hi> to his Country To this end being already poſſeſt of the hearts of the Nobility and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, he encourages the one in Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Luxury, and takes care to give the other full imployment by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Merchandiſe, that being diſus'd to any bold Enterprizes; nay, even to the handling their Weapons, neither of them may dare to make any Oppoſition to his Deſigns. Thus under the appearance of a ſettled Peace, he cunningly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals his intended Parricide. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the Divine Providence, (which has hitherto preſerv'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick) ſhould cut off all poſſibility of his ſucceeding in theſe his attempts:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60048:48"/>How great a reproach to their Birth ought the reſt of the Citizens who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from as noble a Parentage, to think it, that <hi>Jannetin Doria</hi> their equal, continues in the ſecure enjoyment of a Power and Dignity ſo far above theirs? What colour of Reaſon can be alledg'd for it, that in a Free State (where ſo many no ways inferior to him, either for Birth or Valour, are contented to live privately) he only ſhould keep up the magnificent Port of a Sovereign Prince, treating the reſt of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as if they depended upon him like his Menial Servants? By what Law of any well conſtituted Republick? By what cuſtom of any Nation not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Barbarous? In what Hiſtory of any civiliz'd People is ſuch a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be met with? And if you have not hitherto been ſenſible of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous behaviour of this inſolent Man towards your own Perſon, it muſt rather be abſcrib'd to the inadvertency of your tender Years, than to <hi>Janne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s Affability.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60048:49"/>However, you will be greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, if hereafter you expect to be exempted from the common Miſeries that attend your Country. You muſt, believe me, Sir, you muſt join with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Nobility, in offering him your Attendance and your Service: And <hi>Jannetin</hi> may then reekon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the chief Trophies of his inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Arrogance, that he is careſs'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd, and humbly bow'd to by <hi>John Lewis de Fieſchi,</hi> Count of <hi>Lavag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the Proprietor of a large and well peopled Territory. How much more eligible therefore would it be for you to awaken your mind to ſuch Reſolutions as are worthy of your Country, your Family, and your own Perſonal Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And immediately to apply your utmoſt endeavours to free your ſelf and your Country-Men from ſo fordid an Infamy? Perhaps you may object, that tho' you ſhould be willing to undertake this Enterpriſe, yet you want a ſufficient force and ſeaſonable Opportunities to bring it to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But I hope theſe difficulties will
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60048:49"/>be clear'd, when I aſſure you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> you ſhall receive all neceſſary Inſtructions and Succors for the furthering this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; in which, when it is ripe for Execution, I am impower'd by my Maſter the King of <hi>France</hi> to promiſe you the aſſiſtance of his Forces. You will likewiſe find theſe further incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements even in <hi>Genoua</hi> it ſelf. The Populace (urged by their irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred to the Nobility,) will not only be as a Sword to fight for you, but as a Shield to defend you. <hi>Janne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s proſperous Fortune will enchant him to ſo great a degree of Stupidity, that he will fall an caſie Prey to your Artifices. Your own Subjects and thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Piacenza</hi> will be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful enough to guard you from the attacks of any that ſhall dare to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you. In a word, all things invite you to a certain Victory: Nothing is now wanting but your own final Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, not to Fight, but to Conquer and Triumph. Therefore conſider well the neceſſity that lies upon you,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60048:50"/>either to be a Prince or a Slave, either to make your ſelf formidable to your Enemies, or to live under continual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of their Malice.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Trivulce</hi> could not have toucht <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Soul in a more ſenſible part: For his envy was excited to ſo high a degree by this repreſentation of <hi>Doria</hi>'s Grandeur, that he lookt upon it as a continual Reproach to himſelf; as if he were inferior to <hi>Jannetin</hi> in any ſort of Accompliſhments. Thus <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>'s inclinations being ſo ſtrongly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd towards this deſperate Deſign, it was no difficult matter for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to kindle the Flame, when he made uſe of ſo proper an incentive, as fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Arguments eloquently expreſs'd. And the Count hereupon grew very deſirous to know what Propoſals the King had empower'd Cardinal <hi>Trivulce</hi> to offer him; and when the Cardinal had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly inform'd him, he thought the Conditions were too valuable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd. The Particulars of them are as follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60048:50"/>That he ſhould forthwith enter into the King's Pay, and receive a ſufficient Allowance for the Maintenance of ſix Gallies. That there ſhould be ſecured to him the full Pay for 200 Men to be put in Garriſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tobbio.</hi> That he ſhould be declared Captain of the Horſe, and that 12000 Crowns a year ſhould be aſſigned him for his own Allowance. Theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were quickly after ratifi'd on the King's part at a little diſtance from <hi>Naples,</hi> by <hi>John Caracciolo</hi> Prince of <hi>Melſi; Fieſchi</hi> nevertheleſs deferr'd his final Reſolution in this matter, till his return to <hi>Genoua;</hi> having ſatisfi'd the Cardinal both by the Alteration of his Countenance, and by ſome Words that dropt from him, after this Interview that he would follow the Meaſures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> This his delay it is thought proceeded from one of theſe Reaſons, either becauſe he was not yet fully ſatisfied in his mind of the juſtice or the feaſibleneſs of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; or becauſe he deſir'd to have leiſure for a free Conference with his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60048:51"/>friends by whoſe advice he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know what Methods to follow in the deſign he had undertaken. When he came to <hi>Genoua,</hi> he made it his Buſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to obſerve <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s conduct with more than uſual Diligence: For altho' the ſpendor of the <hi>Doria's</hi> Family was principally deriv'd from <hi>Andrew,</hi> yet it being too generally the Practice of the World to worſhip the riſing Sun, the Citizens of <hi>Genoua</hi> follow'd that Maxim, and paid their Court to <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netin,</hi> as the chief object of their hopes. <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s Temper was naturally haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which added to his Military Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the reſpect that was paid him as the Commander of 20 Gallies, and as deſign'd by the Emperor to be his Uncle's Succeſſor in the office of Admiral, increas'd his Pride to a high degree. He was likewiſe ſo far exalted in his own Opinion, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome ſignal Proofs he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of his Valour, that his Spirit ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aim at a higher Condition, than the equality of the Subjects of a Free State could allow of. This made him
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60048:51"/>neglect to gain by affability the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of thoſe Perſons whom he thought would be oblig'd to adhere to him, for the ſake of their own Intereſt; ſeeming to think himſelf ſafer and greater in a vain oſtentation of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than in being really belov'd and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by his Country. For theſe cauſes he was hated by the popular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: But the young Nobility who attended him, had a greater regard to the profitable Employments they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to receive from him, than to the imperious manner in which he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd himſelf towards all. Sometimes he treated the Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> with haughty and arrogant Language; at which he was ſo exaſperated, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of endeavouring to gain his Friendſhip by the ſervile Submiſſions then generally practis'd, he rather wanted Caution and Temper to hide his Reſentments; but gave him plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to underſtand by his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how little he car'd to ſee him.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>Jannetin</hi> might want no Demonſtrations, that <hi>Fieſchi</hi> reſolv'd
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60048:52"/>to have no dependance on him, even in the maritime concerns, which made him ſo much reſpected, he bought of the Duke of <hi>Piacenza</hi> the 4 Gallies, (as I before related) to the infinite diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of <hi>Jannetin.</hi> In the mean time Cardinal <hi>Trivulce</hi> fearing leaſt if he ſhou'd abate of his former Diligence, his hopes of fixing <hi>Fieſchi</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſts might be diſappointed, and well knowing that in all Reſolutions of importance, Young Men muſt be brought to a Determination while their Temper and Fancy are warm with the Project, to prevent any Luke-warmneſs which ſerious thoughts might ſuggeſt; he diſpatcht <hi>Nicholas Foderato,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Savona,</hi> one of the Count's Relations, to him at <hi>Genoua.</hi> This Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by frequently repreſenting the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Demands, and vaſtly magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Promiſes, at laſt brought the Count to an expreſs Declaration that he wou'd aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> Forces in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Republick to its former ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; on condition that the King wou'd fully make good the offers that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60048:52"/>had been formerly propos'd to him to encreaſe his Grandeur and inlarge his Power. Hereupon <hi>Foderato</hi> rid Poſt for <hi>Rome,</hi> to get the Capitulation rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd by the ſubſcriptions of thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whom the King had Authoriz'd for that purpoſe: As ſoon as <hi>Foderato</hi> had begun his Journey, Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> imparted the whole Affair, to ſome few of his confidents, and having ask'd their Advice concerning it, they very freely blam'd him, not for the deſign it ſelf, but for the Methods he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take for the putting it in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon he ſent in all haſt to recall <hi>Foderato;</hi> from whom having receiv'd the Packet of Letters, and diſpatches he had entruſted him with-all, he propos'd in a few words his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to be deliberately canvaſſed by his Friends. The Perſons whom he thought worthy to be of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conſult, were theſe three: <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Calcagno</hi> of <hi>Vareſe,</hi> a Servant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely faithful to Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> who ſincerely endeavour'd to preſerve his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60048:53"/>Maſter's Life and Honour: <hi>Raphael Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> a Lawyer of <hi>Savona,</hi> whom <hi>Fieſchi</hi> made uſe of as the Judge and Auditor of the concerns of his Territory: And <hi>John Baptiſt Verrina</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua: Verrina</hi> having the advantage of living very near <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Palace, he by degrees inſinuated himſelf into the Count's Familiarity, cunningly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a great zeal for his Intereſts that he might by <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s aſſiſtance prop up his own decaying Fortunes; and herein the ſly Hypocrite ſucceeded ſo well, that he ſoon gain'd the Aſcendant over him, having engag'd him to lend him ſeveral Summs of Money, and (which is far more conſiderable) to communicate to him his moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Secrets.</p>
            <p>His Ambition was large, and promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to form great Deſigns; for the effecting whereof, his natural Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty never fail'd to ſuggeſt to him, the likelieſt Methods: His inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the Nobility, procceded partly from the reſentment of private Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and partly from a Factious diſlike
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60048:53"/>of the preſent Conſtitution; wherein, by <hi>Andrew Doria</hi>'s Advice, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity were reſtor'd to the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affairs which they had formerly enjoyed, and from which they had been ſo long unjuſtly excluded. This fruſtrated <hi>Verrina</hi>'s Expectations, of having any ſhare in the management of the Government: Which, together with the uneaſie conſideration of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Poverty, (his Debts every day increaſing, and his Eſtate decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) prov'd an irreſiſtible incitement to him (his mind being exaſperated with the diſappointment of Honour and Wealth) as it generally does to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons involv'd in the like Difficulties, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſperately to engage in this raſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ign; hoping it might give him ſome proſpect of being deliver'd from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of his preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and of being reinſtated in that happineſs and thoſe advantages, which his diſturbing Memory told him he formerly poſſeſs'd.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Verrina</hi> being ſenſible, that he you'd no longer conceal his Misfortunes,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60048:54"/>while the Publick Tranquility laſted, made it his endeavour to bury the remembrance of them under the ruins of his native Country. For if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Villainy prov'd ſucceſsful, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd himſelf, that his Circumſtances wou'd be every way vaſtly improv'd; but if it ſhould not (as was a very great hazard) he buoy'd up his mind againſt all ominous fears of future Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, with the proſpect he had that his name ſhould live, tho' under a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter remarkably infamous; for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be cruſht under the weight of ſo bold an attempt, and to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a deſtruction almoſt certain, for the gratifying his Revenge, by invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Enemies under the ſame fate So ſtupid and heedleſs are Men anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Ambition, that, tho' it is their chief aim to advance and eterni<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60048:54"/>having been long accuſtom'd to the delights and the plenty of a wealthy Family, abhorr'd the very thoughts of thoſe Dangers into which he foreſaw the Count wou'd precipitate himſelf: But, beſides this, he acted upon the generous Principles of Sincerity and Gratitude: For having been bred up in the <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Family from his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he had a real affection for the Count's Perſon, without any ſelfiſh regard to the advantages he might reap from his Eſtate; whereby thoſe who have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Intereſts of their own to purſue are (too generally) influenc'd to expoſe their Patrons to the utmoſt hazards, that they may accompliſh their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Deſigns.—<hi>Sacco</hi> perceiving that the proſecution of this affair wou'd be liable to great Hazards, ſtood Neuter, that he might have the better opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to declare his Sentiments in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of thoſe meaſures that <hi>Fieſchi</hi> ſhould reſolve to follow. The Count imparted his mind to them, in a ſhort but very pathetick Speech: Telling them that he was poſitively reſolv'd to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60048:55"/>endeavour ſome conſiderable Alteration in the preſent Conſtitution of <hi>Genona,</hi> and that he therefore deſir'd them to give their Opinions what Methods would be the likelieſt to accompliſh it. Nevertheleſs <hi>Calcagno,</hi> whoſe cordial Affection to his Patron, and many years Domeſtick dependance on him had inſpir'd him with the greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, took the freedom to ſpeak to him to this purpoſe,</p>
            <p>If (Sir) you are ſo unalterably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to proceed in your attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government of <hi>Genoua,</hi> as your expreſſions ſeem to declare to us; it will then be in vain for me to think that my contradicting you in it can produce any good Effect, or prevent thoſe common Calamities which I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deplore: But if the dictates of Prudence, and your good <hi>Genius</hi> can induce you to admit of ſecond thoughts, (which uſually are the wiſeſt and the ſafeſt) I ſhall on this occaſion give you as great a proof of my Fidelity, by my freedom in ſpeaking, as I have done all the reſt of my life by my diligent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60048:55"/>and induſtrious management of your concerns. You have hitherto enjoyed a conſtant courſe of Felicity; Fortune hath never yet made you the object of her frowns: Hence it comes to paſs that your mind is not accuſtom'd to entertain any impreſſions but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent all your deſigns crown'd with Victory, your Dignity advanc'd, and your Dominions enlarg'd. Theſe (Sir) are generally the Dreams of thoſe who have long been the Favourites of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But I am very apprehenſive that ſome croſs accident will diſſipate theſe pleaſing Shadows, and then your diſappointment will be much more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to you, becauſe you did not in the leaſt foreſee or expect it. To ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an alteration of the Government of the Republick, is at this time a work liable to ſo many difficulties, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ſo evident dangers, that ſhou'd I repreſent it to you ſafe and eaſie, I ſhou'd offer the greateſt violence to my own Reaſon. For you can propoſe to your ſelf but theſe two Methods to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh your deſign; either to make
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60048:56"/>uſe of a Foreign Force, or to preva<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by a ſecret correſpondence with ſome of the Citizens: As for the former, do not yet ſee any Preparations made towards it; and if there were, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that an Army can March either ſo faſt or ſo privately, but that it muſt give an Alarm to the Emperor, to <hi>Doria,</hi> and to the <hi>Genoueſes.</hi> All <hi>Italy</hi> is at this time to our great Misfortune in ſuch a Ferment, that the eyes of <hi>Europe</hi> are vigilant in watching our Motions; and <hi>Genoua,</hi> being the only Maritime Frontier of this Province, is you know ſuſpected, and therefore ſtrongly guarded and jealouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd. And ſince the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> is already become the Seat of the War, and is deſtin'd to be at laſt a Prey ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Italians</hi> or the <hi>French</hi> Forces, you muſt needs think that, in common Policy the Emperor will take the greater care of <hi>Genoua,</hi> which he eſteems as the main Bulwark of his Power in <hi>Italy: Doria</hi> will herein, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him not only with his twenty Gallies, but alſo (which is much more
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60048:56"/>conſiderable) with the ſincere affection of the Citizens (whom he has ſo much befriended) and with the aſſiſtance of the whole Fleet bound for the <hi>Levant,</hi> which is entirely devoted to his Service. The City of <hi>Genoua</hi> is now ſo exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated at the Tyrannical proceedings of the Dukes of <hi>Milan</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Kings, that the very mention of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Force is become odious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable to them. Therefore unleſs your Army is very numerous, you can only diſcover your Intentions, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring them to any effect; and that you may be ſenſible how irreparable a damage this would prove to you, you muſt conſider that nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion unexpectedly ſucceſsful can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain applauſe, or even, juſtifie an undertaking of this Nature. And how or from whom you can expect to be ſuppli'd with ſuch an Army I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine; for ſuppoſing that the <hi>French</hi> King (on whoſe Protection you ſo much rely) is deſirous to raiſe new Tumults in <hi>Italy,</hi> yet his own preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60048:57"/>Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> will keep the beſt part of his Army (whoſe preſent Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to ſecure their own Frontiers) ſo fully employ'd, that the Auxiliaries he ſends you, muſt be very few and inconſiderable. Or if I could ſo far im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on my own Reaſon, as to believe that either he or any other Potentate would ſupply you with Forces propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to your deſign, yet ev'n then you muſt expect to be oppos'd with perhaps a greater, to be ſure an equal force, by his Imperial Majeſty who has taken the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> into his Protection. So that at laſt your Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery will entirely depend on ſo great a hazard, as the uncertain event of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel: And whether it goes againſt or for you, you muſt be contented to accept of ſuch Terms as the Conqueror ſhall Preſcribe, and the only reward firmly entail'd on you will be the indelible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, of having ungratefully robb'd your Country of her Liberty, and put her under the Yoke of a Barbarous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Perhaps you may expect to receive a nearer and ſpeedier aſſiſtance
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60048:57"/>from thoſe Citizens who are of your Faction; but I am ſure if I am at all acquainted with the Temper and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> you build your hopes on a very crazie and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Foundation. From which order of them, pray, Sir, is it that you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect theſe Succors? Is it from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; Theſe you know are already of <hi>Doria</hi>'s Party, to whom they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd by many Obligations, and to whom they owe their ſhare in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Government, and the happineſs of an honourable Peace: And how can you think that they, who run the risk of worſting their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes by every ſlight alteration, ſhould now, out of Complaiſance to you, help forward a turbulent Revolution, which muſt precipitate them into greater and more inextricable difficulties than they have yet been involv'd in? Will they to comply with your Ambition forget all the Obligations they lie under to their Country, their Liberty, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and their Eſtates? Can you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they will preferr your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60048:58"/>before <hi>Doria</hi>'s Protection, whom on many accounts both Private and Publick they have for a long time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd as their Father? Nor can you reaſonably ſuppoſe that the inclinations of the Populace are a whit more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to your deſigns; for how much the greater their Averſion is to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name of the Nobility, ſo much the leſs (you may be ſure) will they truſt you, who being the chief of them, make it your endeavour to deſtroy your own order, without a reaſonable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or Provocation. And if ſome few of the Mob ſhould give credit to your Propoſals, their Leaders will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſink their own Reputation ſo low as to accept of a Deliverance obtained for them by you. If your deſign be to ſet up your ſelf as Prince or abſolute Governour of <hi>Genoua,</hi> what Action can be leſs agreeable to the Populace than this? What can be farther from meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a general Applauſe? But perhaps you will tell me, your intentious are only to re-eſtabliſh the Ancient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratick Conſtitution, which <hi>Genoua</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60048:58"/>till <hi>Doria</hi> ſubverted it by force of Arms; and ſuch a Declaration as this you think will ſo charm the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, that they will preſently take up Arms in your Favour. For my part I am ſo far from obſtinately maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary Opinion, that I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, thoſe who are diſſatisfied at the preſent State of Affairs, will gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily embrace ſo fair an occaſion of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over again their former Tragedies. The more readineſs and vigour they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert in Proſecuting this Cauſe, ſo much the more do they advance their own Intereſt, and this conſideration will not ſuffer them to be Idle; but you will find when the Spoils come to be divided, your ſhare will only be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of having begun the Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; unleſs you can be ſo credulous as to ſuppoſe that the Families of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorni</hi> and the <hi>Fregoſi,</hi> will reſign to a Nobleman that Power and Pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, in the management of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, for which they have for ſo many years had mutual conteſts. They will give to your Raſhneſs the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60048:59"/>Character of Valour; they will follow your Standards, becauſe they ſhall be thereby free'd from their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; they will rejoyce to ſee the Nobility pull'd down by a Nobleman; to ſee the Bowels of your Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try pierc'd by your Weapons; the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranquillity diſturb'd by your Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and their own Tyranny once more ſet up by your folly: And while they preſerve in a great meaſure their Reputation from being tainted with the infamy of promoting your wicked deſigns, (Pardon me, Sir, that I am ſo free as to call every thing by its true name) they will only wait at a due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance till the times invite them to ſhare with you in the reward of your Labours, the glory of your Boldneſs, and the Triumphs of your Victory. And how deplorable would your cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances then be? Or to what Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could you without ſhame and bluſhes apply your ſelf? The Nobility will hate you for betraying them: The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace will deride you, and laugh at thoſe Policies, whereby they only reap
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60048:59"/>ſo great advantages; your Country will deteſt you for having been the occaſion of the loſs of her Liberty: The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who has taken the Republick into his Protection, will be your declar'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Nor can you with a ſecure confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence rely on the Friendſhip of the <hi>French</hi> King, who has himſelf aim'd at an abſolute command over <hi>Genoua.</hi> In a word, you will be odious to the whole World; for all Mankind do on very reaſonable grounds deteſt treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Practices. I am indeed very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſpeak, what it is abſolutely neceſſary you ſhould hearken to and ſeriouſly conſider; but the conſtant fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity I have always ſhew'd in your Service, and the ſincere affection I bear to your Perſon, inſpire me with a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuitable to this occaſion. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid (may Heaven avert the ill Omens my mind portends,) I tell you, Sir, I am more than ordinarily apprehenſive, that theſe turbulent and unquiet thoughts are ſuggeſted by your evil Genius, which has deſtin'd you to the loſs of your Reputation, your Life, and your
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60048:60"/>Eſtate. You are ſenſible that <hi>Jannetin Doria</hi> looks on you with an envious Eye, and you have ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd to me, that you did not think your ſelf ſecure from his treacherous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: Why then, (Sir) will you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with Arms to deſtroy you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Rules of Juſtice? How gladly will he embrace this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of gratifying his private Revenge, under the colour of preſerving his Country from Ruine and Confuſion? How greatly will he rejoyce within himſelf, when he ſhall hear that you have precipitately engag'd your ſelf in ſuch Reſolutions, as will on very good grounds juſtifie him and his Party in the forcible oppoſition he will openly make you? You will be declar'd the Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Publick Peace, an Enemy to the common Liberty, the betrayer of your Country, a rebel to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and (in a word) the <hi>Catiline</hi> of <hi>Genoua.</hi> I am ſtruck with ſo much horror at the thoughts of it, that I have not the power to repreſent to you, how many Enemies, this odious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60048:60"/>publickly given of you, will arm for your deſtruction; and theſe not only the Nobility, the Tradeſmen, the Labourers, and the Mob of <hi>Genoua,</hi> (whoſe reſiſtance perhaps you may think deſpicable) but alſo Foreign Princes and their Subjects, will oppoſe you with ſo unanimous a vigour, that the ſad concluſion of the whole will be your ſinking under the violence of this part of the World join'd together in a Confederacy, to puniſh your dangerous attempts by the infamous death of a Malefactor. Your territories will be forfeited to the Publick Bank: Your memory will be Scandalous and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable in the Annals of <hi>Genoua: Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netin</hi> will be acknowledg'd as the ſecond deliverer of his Country, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of her Liberties, and all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be built upon your Ruines? Perhaps the gratitude of the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> will induce them to ſet up near <hi>Andrew Doria</hi>'s Statue, another equally mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, to the Honour of <hi>Jannetin,</hi> in the Pedeſtal whereof ſhall be inſcrib'd: <hi>John Lewis de 'Fieſchi the Publick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60048:61"/>my ſubdu'd by</hi> Jannetin Doria, <hi>the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Benefactor.</hi> Therefore let not the impetuous raſhneſs of your age, and the violence of your reſentments, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you into deſigns of ſo hazardous a Conſequence; but let the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Self, your Family, and your Vaſſals, lay ſome reſtraint on theſe blind and unruly Paſſions: Remember (Sir) what you owe to God, to your Country, to your Reputation, and to your Birth: Reflect with a generous compaſſion on the Miſeries in which you will involve your Mother and your Wife: And by abandoning your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoughts, free the minds of all that love you, from theſe juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary apprehenſions. Your blooming Youth, and your early Valour are too rich a treaſure, to be ſo prodigally Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd to the Mercy of Fortune. Therefore (your faithful Servant once more intreats you) enjoy with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented mind the affluent Patrimony your Anceſtors have left you, for you are yet in a ſtation every way ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that you may (if you pleaſe) live

            <p>This diſcourſe of <hi>Calcagno,</hi> founded on ſo many powerful reaſons, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from a Perſon who had given ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny undoubted Teſtimonies of his zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous affection, made ſo good an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s mind, that his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeem'd to be pretty well inclin'd to the ſafer ſide: But <hi>Verrina,</hi> foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the whole deſign might yet be left unattempted, if he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Count calmly to conſider of what had been alledg'd, he made this deteſtably impious, tho' plauſible op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to the ſolid Arguments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Calcagno.</hi>

But Deſtiny, the cruel Enemy of your Repoſe, hath ſo entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the affairs of the Republick, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hazardous deſign, you muſt inevitably Periſh. <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> who for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years has gratifi'd his ambition thoughts, with the expectation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſter of <hi>Genoua,</hi> cannot endure you who are ſo able to cope with him, and to ruin theſe his vaſt Projects. The implacable hatred this Proud Man beam to you, you may plainly diſcover by his imperious Looks, and his contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Behaviour: If you think theſe Teſtimonies fallible, ſurely you cannot but conclude, that ſince your purchaſe of the Gallics, you are (as a Nail ſtruck through and dencht in his heart) an inſupportable Torment to him. His Arrogance aims at the free and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60048:62"/>Dominion of the Sea, nor will he ſuffer any one to preſume to diſturb him in his poſſeſſion, or to ſhare the power of it. How then can you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſince Princes very often Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their Brethren, Children, and even Parents, to a groundleſs Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie that they weaken the ſecurity of their Empire, <hi>Jannetin</hi> ſhould ſuffer you to partake with him in his Maritime Dominion? His ſtubborn Nature, which will not bend, muſt therefore be forc'd to a compliance. And you muſt either tamely reſign your Gallies, and by a ſhameful Retirement to your own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, yield him all that his Ambition craves; or you muſt by the Arts of Policy, and an unwearied Induſtry, excite againſt your Rival a ſufficient number of Enemies to curb and reſtrain him. However if you reſolve to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe your ſafety from the dangers now imminent, with the loſs of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and to accept of your Life as granted you by <hi>Jannetin;</hi> God forbid I ſhould be too importunate an oppoſer of thoſe Dictates of Self-preſervation;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60048:63"/>tho' even his inveterate hatred cannot (I am ſure) prompt him to wiſh you in circumſtances more deſpicable and wretched. But the greatneſs of your mind checks my unworthy Suſpicions of your Conduct, and promiſes that I ſhall ſee the Vanity and Pride of this Arrogant Man pull'd down and cruſht by your Courage. Therefore (Sir) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to your ſelf, and that with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible reſolution, the undertaking this Enterpriſe, which is ſo brave, as even <hi>Jannetin</hi> himſelf will envy you for it Fortune has placed between you two, the abſolute Command of all <hi>Liguria,</hi> and it is impoſſible for either of you to acquire ſo great a Dignity, till he has (like <hi>Tullia</hi>) driven the Wheels of his Triumphant Chariot over the breaſt of his Competitour. He will be the ſureſt of the Victory, who can by the moſt expedite Methods diſpatch his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy out of the World. There is an equal neceſſity lies on both of you, to take care of your ſafety; therefore he will be the wiſeſt of you, who by a ſwift and reſolute Stroke, ſhall ruin his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60048:63"/>Adverſaries ſlow Projects before they are half ripe. You muſt either be the Aggreſſor, or you muſt expect to be Attack'd; you muſt either fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Enemies Snares, or catch him in yours; in a word you muſt either Kill or be Kill'd.</p>
            <p>Perhaps <hi>Calcagno</hi> may think my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are too ſharp; but Neceſſity, which in deſperate Caſes gives an edge to Fortitude, in Villainous Attempts ſhields the Innocent from Danger and Infamy. Therefore let him blame <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netin</hi>'s Folly, your Countrey's Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and the Injuſtice of your Partial Deſtiny, which have plung'd you in theſe inevitable Difficulties. While you ſtand upon your own defence, you injure none, but only obey the Dictates of Nature. And when you ſee a Tempeſt of ill Accidents threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your Ruin, Prudence will direct you, to throw them (if you can) on your Enemy's Head: If this carries along with it ſome colour of Injuſtice, who can blame you for it, when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has left you no other means to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60048:64"/>ſecure your own Life, but by the death of your Rival, nor permits you to defend your Innocence and exerts your Courage in any other Methods, but thoſe of Villainy? But why do <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

But the preſent poſture of affairs is ſuch, that <hi>Genoua</hi> muſt be yours if you are not wanting to your ſelf: For though there are (as <hi>Calcagno</hi> thinks) ſome obſtacles in your way, yet how eaſily may they be ſurmounted by your Forces, which are ſo much ſuperior to them? And ſuppoſe there were ſuch Hazards and Difficulties in this Enterpriſe as have been repreſented, 'tis no more than has been the Fate of all Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60048:65"/>Hero's, as Hiſtory will inform you. Great Undertakings are always accompanied with great Dangers; as (you ſee) the higheſt Hills border on the ſteepeſt Precipices. And what Man of a daring Spirit, and aſpiring Thoughts, wou'd ever, for the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fear of ſome eminent Misfortunes, yield himſelf a willing Prey to Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that muſt unavoidably fall upon him? 'Tis indeed the beſt Counſel can be given to private Men, to reſt ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a competent Fortune; but in affairs of State theſe trimming Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are pernicious, eſpecially where the execution of the grand deſign opens the Scene: For then 'tis ſo far out of our power, either to retrieve paſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or politickly to regulate each ſtep of future proceedings, that we muſt either gain the utmoſt point we aim at, or meet our Ruin in the proſecution of it. But let us not ſuppoſe ſo ſad an Event of our Undertaking: 'Tis a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary piece of Sagacity to have a proſpect of diſtant Misfortunes; not that we ſhou'd torment our ſelves with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60048:66"/>the daily expectation of them, but that prudent Conſiderations may pull out their ſting, and make them more tolerable; 'tis fit, indeed, that we ſhou'd proceed cautiouſly, but then we muſt take care that an exceſs of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do not abate our Courage, or ſlacken our Reſolution. Something after all, muſt be left to the diſpoſal of Providence, and the direction of your good <hi>Genius,</hi> which having choſen you to be the Deliver of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and the Reſtorer of the Ancient Renown of <hi>Italy,</hi> will certainly find a way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate you out of all your Difficulties: Therefore why ſhou'd you refuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Monopoly of theſe Favours which Fortune liberally offers you? To what end ſhou'd you call in the <hi>French</hi> to ſhare with you both your Fame and your Conqueſt? They have loſt their own Reputation, as well as their Territories on this ſide of the <hi>Alpes;</hi> and their Spirits are no leſs ſunk than their Credit, ſince King <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>'s Impriſonment, ſo that they are hardly able to ſecure their own Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60048:66"/>from the Emperor's Forces, whoſe Triumphs have already reach'd to the bordering parts of <hi>Germany.</hi> Beſides this, I beg you wou'd look back on their inveterate Hatred to the <hi>Italian</hi> Nation; and let their Uſage of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Doria,</hi> be a warning to you; who after he had ſerv'd that Crown, with ſo much Honour and Succeſs, met with ſuch unworthy Treatment, by the influence of the Nobility (for they cou'd not allow even him ſo high a place in the King's Favour, till his Gold had purchas'd their Interceſſion in order to it,) that he was fore'd to accept the Emperor's Protection, and to ſerve under him. 'Tis true, the <hi>French</hi> King has many Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments truly Royal, but yet he ſuffers (as almoſt all great Princes do) the Inconveniences of being impos'd upon by his Miniſters of State; of whoſe worth and integrity he has ſo exceſſive an eſteem deeply impreſs'd on his Mind, that there is no Prince more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be enſnar'd by the Artifices of his Courtiers, nor any leſs ſenſible of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60048:67"/>his Infirmity, and of the ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it. You muſt either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a Slave to theſe Ambitious and Covetous Men, or elſe you may aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly expect to loſe (as <hi>Doria</hi> has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done,) both the King's Favour, and the uncertain Rewards of your paſt Services. But what Recompence can the <hi>French</hi> make you, ſuitable to the Hazards and Fatigues you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, for them? Perhaps they will entruſt you with the Government of <hi>Genoua,</hi> encumbred with the vile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences I told you of: But this wou'd be to abaſe your ſelf to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior quality of a mercenary Officer in that Country, wherein Nature has already given you ſo large a ſhare of Power, and ſeems to promiſe you the abſolute Command. And if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or the City, ſhould make a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous oppoſition to your deſigns, with what Succours can the <hi>French</hi> aſſiſt you, whoſe Territories are at ſo vaſt a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and who are themſelves ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſorder'd by inteſtine Jealouſies and Animoſities? 'Tis undoubtedly certain
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60048:67"/>that you muſt rely on the Loyalty of your own Subjects and the ſincerity of your Friends and Allies; and why ſhou'd you not make uſe of theſe Forces (ſo properly your own) to ſet on your own head a Crown ſo fit for you, and which you ſo juſtly deſerve? Then, when your Power over <hi>Genoua</hi> is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled, and you have in your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion the Keys of the Maritime Gate into <hi>Italy,</hi> the greateſt Kings in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom will be Ambitious to be your Friends and Confederates. Then the Envy of your Competitors being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd, we ſhall ſee the Family of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi</hi> rais'd to a higher Dignity than any Family of <hi>Genoua</hi> ever yet arriv'd to. Then your Enemies, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd and ridicul'd your Youth, being cruſh'd under your Feet, you will have it in your power to ſatiate your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in their Blood. <hi>Jannetin,</hi> even <hi>Jannetin Doria</hi> himſelf, your Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy, in ſpight of his Pride, and notwithſtanding his Nobility, the ſtation he ſo much boaſts of, will fall a ſuppliant at your Feet, will Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60048:68"/>you as his Lord, and Obey you as his Prince; by your Nods he will Regulate his Actions, your Will ſhall give Law to his Deſires, and he ſhall acknowledg that he holds his Life only during your pleaſure. Therefore let the <hi>French</hi> keep at home, and there let them hear the Echoes of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding Triumphs.</p>
            <p>It is your part (Sir) Vigorouſly to oppoſe and ſurmount all Obſtacles, which may make the Execution of your Project ſeem difficult: Perform it (I beſeech you) with a Courage and Boldneſs worthy of your Birth. Let the Merit of your own Exploits pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that Renown which Heaven has decreed you: Let the World ſee that you owe your Advancement only to your ſelf: And though the hopes I have entertain'd of you are vaſtly large, yet let your Actions exceed them: In ſhort, do not ſheath your Sword till you have entail'd this Princely Dignity on your Family, and thereby ſecur'd to your own Name an <hi>Immortal Reputation.</hi>

               <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> till now, never thought of acquiring the Principality of <hi>Genoua</hi> for himſelf, but for the <hi>French</hi> King; being content to reduce the exceſſive Power of the <hi>Doria's</hi> into narrower Limits, and to better his own Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by calling in the <hi>French:</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous of Glory, and naturally inclin'd to attempt hazardous Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, it prov'd no difficult matter for <hi>Verriua</hi> to diſſwade him from his Affection to the <hi>French,</hi> by propoſing to him theſe methods of ſetting up himſelf: Which having over-balanc'd the weight of <hi>Calcagne</hi>'s Reaſons, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him on to the execution of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject both Villainous and Dangerous in the higheſt degree. However he was much ſhock'd at the apprehenſion of the difficulties which wou'd attend his deſign, without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> Forces: And <hi>Raphael Sacco</hi> made it his endeavour to confirm him in theſe Perplexities, out of a partial Affection to <hi>France</hi> his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: he advis'd him to accept of the Conditions propos'd to him in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60048:69"/>King's Name by Cardinal <hi>Trivulce,</hi> and to Act by that Model, till a ſilent and leiſurely progreſs, ſhou'd open a Path towards the compleating his grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Verrina,</hi> who look'd upon all Moderation extreamly prejudicial in an affair which required an inflexible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, appli'd himſelf to remove thoſe difficultics which made <hi>Fieſchi</hi> grow luke-warm in it. He repli'd with great vehemence, that to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd with Fantaſms, was below the Spirit of a Nobleman: That the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in <hi>Genoua</hi> conſiſted not of above Two Hundred Men: That <hi>Doria</hi>'s Gallies, though many in number, were not now in a poſture of defence; the Seaſon of the Year obliging them to be laid up in their Harbours; that <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Jannetin</hi> were ſo far from ſuſpecting any Violence, that both their Perſons and their Houſes were without a Guard: That the Count might quickly bring in a good number of the likelieſt Men that the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countrey and Villages wou'd
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60048:69"/>afford, and that theſe ſhou'd Kill the Two <hi>Doria's</hi> in their own Houſe: That it wou'd be eaſie at the ſame time to ſend another party of Men by Sea to ſeize <hi>Doria</hi>'s Gallies: That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the deſign wou'd ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it ſelf, the Populace bearing ſuch an Inveterate hatred to the Nobility, that a ſlender invitation wou'd be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make them eſpouſe his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: And that he himſelf had already diſpos'd their Minds for it, and wou'd take care they ſhou'd not fail to riſe when their Aſſiſtance ſhou'd be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſeveral other things ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly aggravated by <hi>Verrina,</hi> who knew how great an influence he had over <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi,</hi> diſſipated all his Doubts, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Reſolution to proceed according as <hi>Verrina</hi> had perſwaded him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſet his thoughts to deviſe a Method how to bring this affair to a happy concluſion. The firſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animous Reſolution of all the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors was, That ſince the ſafety of the preſent Government depended ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60048:70"/>on the lives of the <hi>Doria's,</hi> 'twas abſolutely neceſſary in order to a change of the conſtitution, that they two ſhould be kill'd: And to make ſure of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Revenge, it was likewiſe reſolv'd that <hi>Adam Centurio</hi> Father-in-Law to <hi>Jannetin,</hi> and ſeveral of the Prime of the Nobility ſhould be us'd in the ſame manner. As ſoon as Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to entertain thoughts of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and after he had bought the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, he retir'd into his own Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; where he ſpent his time chiefly in training and reviewing the Militia of thoſe Countries, pretending that he apprehended an Invaſion from his Neighbour the Duke of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> whereas his real deſign was to make his Subjects capable of ſerving him in his undertaking againſt the Republick towards the latter end of the Autumn he return'd to <hi>Genoua,</hi> where he us'd great Artifice to obtain the Friendſhip of thoſe Senators who were of the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Faction: He inſinuated himſelf into their acquaintance with a wonderful Affability: To ſome of them he made
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60048:70"/>liberal Preſents: Others he aſſiſted both in paying their Debts, and in making a party for them to gain the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they deſir'd: To every one of them he appli'd himſelf with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtrations of a ſincere Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And being of a very quick wit, and naturally very eaſie and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, 'tis hardly credible how ſoon he gain'd an entire Conſidence with them, and thereby ſecur'd himſelf of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of their dependents. When he ſound that he had won their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and could relie upon their Secrecy, he began as opportunities were offer'd, to ſpeak of the Tyrannical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nobility, ſometimes ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Speeches (which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten interrupted by diſſembled ſighs) how much he piti'd the ſad Eſtare of the Populace; ſometimes hinting that, if they would not be wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſome effectual remedy might be found out, to repreſs the Arrogance of the Nobility; at other times he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd them with the ſharpeſt Ironies to Paſſive Obedience under their Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60048:71"/>leaving always in their minds a greater Propenſion to Diſcontents, by his perplex'd and dubious Expreſſions: But above all, if any accident hapen'd which croſs'd the Inclinations of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Faction, he took occaſion from thence to diſcourſe largely to them of the Male-Adminiſtration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, under the preſent Government. Nor did he diſdain to ſeek with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence the good opinion of the meaneſt <hi>Plebeians,</hi> but was always ready to court them, with ſmiles and affable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and he took care to pleaſe their eyes with the dazling ſplendor of his Cloaths. Theſe Artificial Advantages were much ſet off by a graceful Perſon and a face adorn'd with all the charms of a healthy Youth: <note place="margin">Youth, Beauty, graceful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeldom fail.</note> His Air and his Behaviour were ſo extremely genteel and eaſie, that he fail'd not to gain the Peoples affections as ſoon as he ſhew'd himſelf in Publick to them; <note place="margin">Dryden's Miſc.

               </note> which he often did for the ends, and according to the Methods <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Beſides this he delighted frequently to exerciſe his skill in Martial Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Horſemanſhip, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent performance of both which, his body was ſo proportionably fram'd, that in this poſture eſpecially he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear'd a moſt lovely object to the Spectators.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the reputation of Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is the certainſt Snare to entangle the Mobile, Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> (as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) called to him one day <note n="*" place="margin">il Conſole.</note> the Warden of the Silk-weavers Company, of whom there is in <hi>Genoua</hi> a very great number. He askt him very civilly concerning the circumſtances of his Aſſociates, and underſtanding that they were reduc'd to extreme want (their Trade in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> being much decay'd by the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive increaſe of it in other Places) he expreſs'd a moſt tender compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the poor Sufferers, ſaying, he would not abandon them at a time of ſo great neceſſity; and therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that thoſe whoſe Poverty was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60048:72"/>known to be moſt preſſing, ſhould be ſecretly ſent to his Houſe to be reliev'd. The next day a great number of theſe Wretches flockt together to viſit their Benefactor; who to ſignalize his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, caus'd a large quantity of Corn to be divided among them, telling them, that as the relieving the needy and the afflicted, had always been the Character of his Family, ſo he would never by any means degenerate from his Anceſtors, therefore whenever they wanted ſuſtenance for their Families, they might confidently expect it from him, and (tho' their modeſty ſhould reſtrain them from the importunity of Beggars) they might at any time find at his Houſe all neceſſaries ready pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them. Thus did he add a greater luſtre to his Bounty, by ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to conceal from the view of the World, both that and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the perſons reliev'd: Who went home no leſs chear'd by the aſſiſtance, than aſtoniſh'd at the liberality of Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> who they thought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd as a reward from Heaven, the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60048:72"/>higheſt dignities and the happieſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>However being apprehenſive that the Nobility would ſuſpect his deſigns, if he made it his whole buſineſs to gain the affections of the Mobile, his next ſtudy was how to poize the Balance ſo even, as to ſecure himſelf of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and friendſhip with both. To this end he perfected himſelf in the art of Diſſimulation: He went oftner than uſual to viſit the <hi>Doria's,</hi> and not only made many profeſſions of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate eſteem for <hi>Andrew,</hi> (to whom he openly declar'd himſelf to be under many obligations) but alſo diſguiſing the inveterate hatred he bore to <hi>Janne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> he treated him with the intimacy of a Friend, asking his advice and praying his aſſiſtance in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his concerns. And becauſe there had formerly been ſome quarrels between them, which had imbitter'd their Spirits towards one another, he begg'd of <hi>Jannetin,</hi> with the promiſes of a ſincere kindneſs for the future, that he would abſolutely forget what was paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60048:73"/>By the ſecret League between the Duke of <hi>Piacenza</hi> and Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> the Duke agreed to ſend him two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, which, with two thouſand more rais'd in the Count's Territories, were thought ſufficient to quell the riſings of the Citizens if any ſhould oppoſe him; and to this end, he ſent one of his Gallies to the coaſts of <hi>Genoua,</hi> under the pretence of fitting and manning it for a Maritime Expedition againſt the <hi>Algierines</hi> and other <hi>Infidels</hi> in their own Seas. Nor was <hi>Verrina</hi> wanting to forward theſe deſigns; for he made it his buſineſs to gain over to <hi>Fieſchi</hi> as great a party as he could; and being expert in the Artifices of Popularity, he in a little time engag'd ſome hundreds of the Populace under a promiſe, to ſtand by him in a great undertaking that was then carrying on for their advantage.</p>
            <p>By theſe preparatory Methods they thought they had laid a ſufficient Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their Project, and therefore held another conſult to determine in what manner they ſhould attempt the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60048:73"/>final Execution of it. Their firſt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was that there ſhould be notice given of the Solemnity of <note n="*" place="margin">una Meſſa nova.</note> an extraordinary Maſs to be celebrated in St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Church, unto which the two <hi>Doria's,</hi> and thoſe of the Nobility, whoſe lives they aim'd at, ſhould be invited. But this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution appear'd no leſs uncertain as to the ſucceſs of it than Inhumane and Sacrilegious; for they thought it was very probable <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his abſence on the account of his Age, and ſend in his ſtead <hi>Philippea</hi> or ſome other near Relation with his accuſtom'd offering. And it ſhockt them not a little to conſider how hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid a thing it would be, to begin their enterpriſe with ſo unparallell'd a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Church, and of the higheſt Myſteries of Religion. This propoſal therefore was abſolutely reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; altho' <hi>Verrina,</hi> as he was promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the violence of his Temper, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd them he would at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſpatch <hi>Andrew,</hi> under the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſguiſe of a friendly viſit. But as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60048:74"/>Men when once they have broke through the Reſtraints of Vertue, fall headlong into all manner of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo theſe ſlender remains of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Scrupuloſity, which checkt them in their former reſolution, a little after prov'd too weak to hinder them from projecting a more deſtable piece of Villany.</p>
            <p>For it hapning about this time, that the Marriage was to be celebrated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Julius Cibo</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> and one of <hi>Jannetin Doria's</hi> Siſter; it was reſolv'd that <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi</hi> ſhould invite the Bride and ſeveral Ladies to Supper, and with them not only the two <hi>Doria's,</hi> but alſo thoſe of the Nobility whom they thought the moſt dangerous Enemies to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, all of whom were to be Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed barbarouſly, by hir'd Ruffians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd in the Houſe for that purpoſe, <note n="*" place="margin">Inter ſacra men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae. <hi>Thuanus in Anno 1547.</hi>
               </note> againſt the ſacred Laws of Hoſpitality and Converſe. That immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the commiſſion of this unparallell'd Treachery, <hi>Fieſchi</hi> attended with his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60048:74"/>Guards ſhould ride about the Streets of <hi>Genoua,</hi> calling upon the Mob to aſſiſt him in the recovery of their Liberty: That during theſe Tumults, ſome of the Count's Party ſhould poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Town-Hall, where <hi>Verri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in a plauſible Harangue ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to the Populace, <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to change the ſtate of <hi>Genoua</hi> into an abſolute Monarchy, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them how neceſſary it was to reform the Government, which had been ſo much corrupted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and ſelfiſhneſs of the Nobility, ſhould Crown the Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> Duke of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and force the <hi>Plebians,</hi> whom they before hand brib'd to it, to ſwear Allegiance to him; and if any Man either by his Words or Actions ſhould teſtifie his diſlike, he ſhould be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kill'd.</p>
            <p>To compleat this deſign the more eaſily, it was order'd that the ableſt Soldiers the Count had, ſhou'd in the leaſt ſuſpected manner they cou'd, lodge themſelves in <hi>Genoua,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Piacenza</hi> was again ſollicited
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60048:75"/>to haſten the promiſed Succours. Theſe Tranſactions (eſpecially the raiſing of Soldiers) cou'd not be manag'd ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, but <hi>Don Ferrand Gonzaga,</hi> whom the Emperour had appointed Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> in the room of the Marqueſs <hi>del Vaſto,</hi> had very ſhrewd ſuſpicions of what was intended: For watching carefully, for the ſecurity of his own Government, over every Motion of his Neighbours, and receiving conſtant intelligence concerning the Actions of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whom he miſtruſted, by able and faithful Perſons employ'd by him in that Office, he quickly came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that there were Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men raiſing in the Dutchy of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acenza</hi> with great haſt for the Service of Count <hi>Fieſchi.</hi> And gueſſing by the ſilent Methods of their Proceedure, that there was a Private Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Fieſchi</hi> and that Duke, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſpatches a Courier to <hi>Genoua</hi> with Advice to <hi>Doria,</hi> and to <hi>Don Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez Suarez</hi> the Emperour's Reſident there, that they ſhou'd be watchful,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60048:75"/>and ſtand on their Guard, for that the young Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> was underhand contriving ſome great deſign. <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> was nevertheleſs ſo far deceiv'd by the flattering ſhews of Affection, and by the ſerenity of Countenance which he conſtantly obſerv'd in <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> and finding all things in the City in the ſame quiet poſture they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he again refus'd to give Credit to theſe likely Symptoms of the Conſpiracy. It hapned, that while <hi>Doria</hi> and the Reſident were diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this Affair, <hi>Fieſchi</hi> unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly came into the Room, with ſo pleaſing and chearful a Look, and while he ſtaid there diſcours'd with them ſo ſolidly concerning ſeveral mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that <hi>Doria</hi> being charm'd with his Converſation, whiſper'd the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and ask'd him, How he cou'd ſuppoſe, that a Mind ſo well Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, and a Perſon of ſo Angelical a Beauty wou'd attempt ſo cruel a piece of Villany? Nor did he change his Opinion when <hi>Gonzaga</hi> having from the Court of <hi>France</hi> receiv'd ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60048:76"/>of his former ſuſpicions, ſent another Meſſage to him, ſeriouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing him to ſearch to the bottom of the deſign; informing him likewiſe, that the Pope's Gallies were ready at <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Gallies in the Port of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> to ſupport and aſſiſt, if occaſion were, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Fieſchi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, did not Hiſtory men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeveral very eminent Perſons, who on light grounds were incredulous to what they heard concerning Deſigns againſt themſelves, <hi>Andrew Doria</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive good Nature wou'd deſerve a ſharp Cenſure: For that when he had ſuch aſſurances given him, that his own Life, and, through that, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Republick was aim'd at, he gave greater Credit to <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s diſſembled Looks and Actions, than to the pregnant Evidences of ſo foul a Conſpiracy; as if it were not uſual for thoſe who have ſuch deſigns in hand, to diſſemble, for a while, their intended Miſchief under a ſmooth Countenance; or as if any Care and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60048:76"/>Vigilance were too much to preſerve one's own Life in Safety, and one's Countrey from Ruin. But ſince Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hiſtories afford us ſeveral Examples of very Wiſe Men, who have ſuffer'd themſelves to be deluded by a fatal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity in matters of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, we may reaſonably affirm, that theſe Events preordain'd, or ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably permitted, by an over-ruling Providence, cou'd not be compleated, but by theſe Momentary Miſtakes of the wiſeſt Politicians, (as an Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſtemper may ſomtimes ſeize on the ſoundeſt Body) that we may not attribute too much to Worldly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when we find it ſo defective in matters of the greateſt moment. But certainly <hi>Paul Panſa</hi> was much more overſeen, who viewing <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Actions with a careful and friendly Eye, from the time that he bought the Gallies, cou'd not but ſuſpect there was ſome extraordinary deſign in hand, and yet did not then give that Check to it which his Station and Dignity allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Tranſactions which he every
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60048:77"/>Day ſaw and heard were juſt occaſion for the increaſe of theſe ſuſpicions. For <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> whoſe uſual cuſtom it had been to impart to <hi>Panſa</hi> his moſt ſecret af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and deſigns, now became very cloſe and reſerv'd to him, and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in his Conſultations with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill choſen Confidents, whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters I have before repreſented. For although, while he entertain'd his Friends, or appear'd on Horſe back in the ſtreets of <hi>Genoua,</hi> he wonderfully diſguis'd his thoughts from the publick view, by a diſſembled chearfulneſs in his countenance and behaviour, yet when he return'd home the Scene was quite chang'd, and the perplexing agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his Soul plainly diſcover'd themſelves by a profound Melancholy, and a wild diſtracted Look. His aim in concealing his deſigns from <hi>Panſa</hi>'s knowledge, was only becauſe he knew for certain, a Man ſo well principl'd in Piety and Morality, wou'd uſe his utmoſt endeavour to deterr him from ſo wicked an Enterprize: Or at leaſt he ſuſpected that <hi>Panſa,</hi> who had been
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60048:77"/>bred up at a diſtance from the warlike ſound of Drums and Trumpets, under the Peaceful Influence of the Muſes, (who always chuſe a quiet retreat from Noiſe and Tumult) wou'd examine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Circumſtance of the Project with an exceſſive Caution, and diſſwade him from proceeding in it beyond the limits of ſecurity; which in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this Nature no Man ought to flatter himſelf with, becauſe 'tis ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible.</p>
            <p>One Day, it ſo happen'd that Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> being after his return home, more than ordinarily diſturb'd with Melancholy Thoughts, and <hi>Panſa</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by the apparent uneaſineſs in his Looks and Behaviour, that his Mind was ſtrangely diſtemper'd, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd immediately to diſcourſe with him concerning it, leaſt if he ſhou'd delay any longer, the Diſeaſe might grow incurable, before any Remedy were adminiſtred. Finding him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore retired into a private Apartment, he accoſted him in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:60048:78"/>As it is very unbeſitting a well-bred Perſon to pry into the ſecrets of others, ſo it is on the other hand very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceal what is ſo imparted; and as I have not given you my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Secrecy, becauſe I hope all my Actions have ſufficiently demonſtrated my Fidelity, ſo I have hitherto forborn enquiring into your Concerns, leaſt I ſhou'd be guilty of any thing that might incur your diſpleaſure. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs your unaccuſtom'd reſervedneſs plainly declares to me, that the Project you are now deſigning, is of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt moment, ſince you take ſuch pains to hide it from your Friends. Your Looks, ſo full of diſturbance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, give me occaſion to ſhare with you in your ſollicitous Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and though I know not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet I am full of fears for your ſafety. This proceeds from no other cauſe, (Sir) but the exceſs of my Love to your Perſon, and my ſincere and ardent Wiſhes (as is my duty) for your Proſperity. For how can I perſwade my ſelf that what you aim
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60048:78"/>at is really deſirable, ſince the thoughts of it do ſo violently ſhock the uſual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of your Mind? Certainly the concluſion of that affair, which, though yet in Embryo, gives you theſe diſturbances, cannot be ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil as a wiſe Man wou'd wiſh: And this mighty Inquietude and Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Soul, is But an unhappy Omen of the unſucceſsful Event of your Enterprize. I will not pretend to dive into the Secret which you have thought fit to conceal from me: (though what Service am I able to do you, if you at all ſuſpect my Truth and Faithfulneſs?) but (pray Sir con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider) whither can their perſwaſions lead you, whoſe Converſation always leaves you oppreſs'd with a Load of Cares and Diſcontents? And (if you will allow me to probe your Wound, that it may the more eaſily be cur'd,) I do more than doubt, that theſe your ſecret Conferences with crafty and ill deſigning Perſons, will by degrees alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate your Mind from the Rules of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and True Honour. Their Piety is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60048:79"/>not ſo ſincere, nor their Moral Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſo well founded, that I can expect they ſhou'd give you any advice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with your Honour or Religion. Perhaps they impoſe on the Candour of your Nature, and the ſmall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your Years, thinking, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your Temper is inclinable to the purſuit of Glorious Actions, you will the more eaſily join with them in any raſh Project, which they ſhall diſguiſe under thoſe colours. Shut not your Eyes (I beg you Sir) againſt theſe dangers, but rather exert your utmoſt and moſt diligent Attention: For one Mad Man may puſh you into a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, from whence a Thouſand Wiſe Men with all their Arts cannot retrieve you.</p>
            <p>'Tis an eaſie matter to ſet your own, or your Neighbour's Houſe on Fire, but how much Toil and Labour and Sweat will it coſt to ſtop and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it? Therefore (pray Sir) take good heed that theſe Fellows do not make you their Property to bring about their own Ends; and by their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60048:79"/>deceiving you into an irreparable loſs, do not from thence build up their own Fortunes. There are but few Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors (too few alas!) ſo honeſt, as without the proſpect of Self-Intereſt, to promote and aim at what is Juſt and Honourable; therefore it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for you to try them by this Touch-ſtone. For my part I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that thoſe, whoſe Lives are a continued Scene of Flagitious Crimes, will ever inſtill or advance the progreſs of Vertue in any other Perſon. For although a Man's Diſcourſe and his Actions may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately conſider'd, revertheleſs, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience informs us, that a good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preaches Reformation more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually than the moſt Eloquent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; for theſe grow contemptible when the daily practice of him that gives the Advice contradicts his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations. Therefore (Sir) what unreaſonable things do your importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Confidents demand of you? Into what new and dangerous deſigns doe they endeavour to wheedle you? Your
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60048:80"/>Circumſtances cannot be better'd by any publick Confuſions, though their's may. Fortune, which has ſo long ſmil'd on your Family, may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably alter her Countenance to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Frown, ſhou'd you be ſo impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to irritate her; and (I almoſt dare aſſure you) every alteration that may happen, will be much leſs deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than your preſent Condition. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy has a long time been endeavouring to canker your Happineſs, and when your Mind and your Affairs are once in a diſorder, that unlucky Fury will quickly force her entrance, by the means of ſeveral Perſons, now much your inferiours both in Honour and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, who make it their buſineſs to find ſome reaſonable grounds, on which, to found their Calumnies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the chief delights of Youth flow from the Proſpect their large Hopes afford them: But 'tis as true, no ſtate is more dangerous than a ſecure Proſperity. Therefore, pray Sir, take care that (according to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60048:80"/>Fable of our Ancient Mythologiſt) you loſe not the real Subſtance which you now poſſeſs, by catching at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and uncertain, though perhaps, a very tempting Shadow. They (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!) who fill your Head with theſe deſigns, have nothing of their own to loſe: Tumults, Seditions, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Anarchy, aſſord ſuch Wretches, Shelter, Maintenance, and, too often, an increaſe of Honour and Riches; for thoſe whoſe Fortunes are low built, cannot fear, as the great ones do, any ſhock in their eaſie deſcent to Ruin and Beggary. But (Sir) for you it is abſolutely neceſſary to order your ſteps with Caution; for Fame expects it from you, that your Actions, if they do not exceed (as I hope they will) yet at leaſt ſhall not come behind, the performances of your Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fieſchi</hi> heard this diſcourſe with great uneaſineſs and impatience; for his reſolutions were unalterably fix'd on the deſign from which <hi>Panſa</hi> tri'd to diſſwade him; nevertheleſs with ſome marks of Confuſion in his Looks
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60048:81"/>and Geſture, he returned him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in few words, <hi>That he propos'd no Aims to himſelf but thoſe that were Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and Worthy of his Birth, which in due time he wou'd be ſure to acquaint him withal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Conſpirators were in great expectations of the Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Feaſt, (which was to be the Fourth of <hi>January,</hi>) there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd an Accident which forc'd them to haſten the execution of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though to their unſpeakble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, becauſe it deprived them of the opportunity of cutting off a great part of the Nobility, whom otherwiſe they might have ſurpriz'd all together, they being then to aſſemble for the chuſing a new Duke of that Republick. For <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> being ſeiz'd with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Fit of the Gout, which with its exceſſive Torments threw him into a dangerous Fever, he cou'd not meet according to his promiſe; and <hi>Janne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> was oblig'd by ſome urgent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to leave <hi>Genoua.</hi> So that <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> and his Confidents, conſidering that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60048:81"/>Conſpiracies have often been ruin'd, but hardly ever forwarded by unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary delays, reſolv'd that on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>January,</hi> very early in the Morning, or as ſoon as they cou'd poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly get ready the preceding Night, they wou'd put their great deſign in execution. Hereupon <hi>Fieſchi</hi> began to give out, that he wou'd ſend out one of his Gallies to moleſt the <hi>Corſaires,</hi> for the Pope allowing him but juſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to maintain Three, he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſupply his Fourth Galley with all Neceſſaries, by the Prizes ſhe ſhou'd take from the Infidels. By this ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well diſguis'd Artifice he brought in ſeveral of the Men ſent him from <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and ſome of hisown Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, pretending he wou'd chuſe out the likelieſt of them for his Expedition: And leaſt the number of thoſe that came from <hi>Piacenza</hi> ſhou'd ſeem to exceed what was requiſite for the Manning a Galley, and thereby give ſome ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a farther deſign in it, he cauſed ſome of them to be chain'd together, and ſo led like Men deſign'd for the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60048:82"/>Oar: Others he caus'd to be diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to come into the City by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Gates, and he afterwards took care to furniſh them with Arms. Then for the more eaſie deceiving of <hi>Jannetin,</hi> he firſt imparted this his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him as a Token of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, requeſting him earneſtly to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> that there might be no Obſtacle put to his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; for, as he pretended, he was under ſome apprehenſions, leaſt in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the Truce between <hi>Solyman</hi> the Grand Seignior, and the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, he might be ſtop'd in his intentions of Privateering.</p>
            <p>On the Firſt of <hi>January,</hi> (the Day preceding that Night which had like to have been Fatal to <hi>Genoua</hi>) Count <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi</hi> ſent for certain Soldiers of the City Guards to his Palace, ſome of whom were his own Subjects, others had by his means obtain'd their Freedoms of the City of <hi>Genoua;</hi> having done this, he went to <hi>Andrew Doria</hi>'s Houſe, where he ſtaid till it grew late, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the Marks of a Cordial Love
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60048:82"/>and True Reſpect for him and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: And it ſo happening, that <hi>John Adorea,</hi> and <hi>Pagano,</hi> Two Young Children of <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s, as they were playing about the Houſe met <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> he took them in his Arms and kiſs'd them ſeveral times in the preſence of their Father. Juſt as he was going, he again deſir'd <hi>Jannetin,</hi> to order his Soldiers not to ſtop his Galley, which was that Night to begin its Voyage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Aegran</hi> Sea, and earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him not to be diſturb'd if he ſhou'd hear the diſcharging of Guns, or any other Noiſe; for thoſe Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes (as he very well knew) cou'd not be manag'd without ſome ſort of Tumult. When Day was quite ſhut in, Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> caus'd all thoſe Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, whoſe aſſiſtance he thought requiſite, to come into his Palace: Thoſe, of whoſe Courage and Fidelity he had, had the greateſt experience, he poſted at all the Gates and Avenues, giving 'em ſtrict Orders to let all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that wou'd, but to ſuffer none to go out again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:60048:83"/>Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Palace was ſituated in that higher part of <hi>Genoua,</hi> which is call'd <hi>Carignan,</hi> a place, as it were, divided from the reſt of the City. For as two ſides of it are bounded by the Walls of <hi>Genoua,</hi> ſo from the Eaſt it views the delightful <hi>Villa's</hi> of <hi>Albaro,</hi> and the pleaſant Valley of <hi>Biſagne,</hi> and its front is towards the Sea. Thus by its lofty ſituation it is in a manner ſeparated from, and proudly ſeems to domineer over the City that lies at its Feet. On this Aſcent, and in an Iſland, ſtood <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Palace: So that 'twas as conveniently plac'd, as cou'd be, for carrying on ſuch a deſign; for none of the adjacent Houſes cou'd be at all Alarm'd by the Tumultuous Noiſe of Military preparations.</p>
            <p>When they came to ſet the Watch in the Caſtle of <hi>Genona, Gigante Corſo</hi> the Governour (whoſe Integrity was equal to his Valour) found ſeveral of his Soldiers miſſing: And having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd diligently at their ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he receiv'd information, that Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> had entic'd them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60048:83"/>him to <hi>Carignan.</hi> The Novelty of the thing made him ſuſpect ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deſign; ſo that he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imparted, what he had obſerv'd, to <hi>Doria,</hi> and to the Senators that kept their Reſidence in the Ducal Palace.</p>
            <p>Now began to appear the Fatal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s cautious Hypocriſie; for <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> being prepoſſeſs'd with the Count's pretended deſign of fitting out a Galley, diſſipated theſe Suſpicions, by declaring to them (what he thought was real) that <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi</hi> had recall'd theſe Soldiers, his Subjects and Dependants, to ſerve him in Privateering towards the <hi>Levant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſhort ſighted are the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of us Mortals, who too often think our ſelves ſecure, when our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath not only deſign'd, but is juſt upon the point, of compleating our Ruin.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> after he had ſtaid a while in his own Palace to give neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Orders, he went out again to viſit ſome of the Merry <hi>LeVeglie.</hi> Meetings, which in the depth of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60048:84"/>the Nobility uſe to keep by turns in their ſeveral Houſes. About Four Hours after he had began his Rounds, he came to <hi>Thomas Aſſereto</hi>'s Houſe, where he found got together, by the contrivance of <hi>Verrina,</hi> Three and Twenty Young Gentlemen who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the Popular Faction. He ſtaid there with them a while, entertaining them with great Civility, and then invited them to Sup with him at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignan;</hi> towards which he urg'd this as a great inducement, that the Night was calm, and the Moon ſhone clear. As ſoon as they came to <hi>Carignan,</hi> he carri'd them into ſome of the fartheſt Apartments, and order'd <hi>Panſa</hi> to keep his Wife <hi>Lemora</hi> at the other end of the Houſe, till he came to her, which ſhould be in a little time. This Lady was of the illuſtrious Family of <hi>Cibo,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Julius,</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Maſſa,</hi> and to <hi>Aubrey,</hi> who after he had liv'd to ſee a Century of Years compleated, and had enjoy'd a Proſperous, though decrepit, Old Age, Died in the Year 1623, being Honour'd and Lamented by all <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:60048:84"/>While theſe things were tranſacting in <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Palace, <hi>Verrina</hi> very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly went into the City as a Scout to ſpy, whether there was any motion or diſturbance in the Ducal, or at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's</hi> Palace, or in any other part of <hi>Genoua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Gueſts look'd on one another, being mightily Amaz'd to ſee the Houſe more than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually full of Arms and Arm'd Men: But at laſt the Count himſelf, whoſe Countenance was quite chang'd, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Apprehenſions of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide he was juſt going to commit, or by the exceſs of his Rage and Malice againſt <hi>Jannetin,</hi> which having been hitherto ſtifled within his Breaſt, began now plainly to ſhew it ſelf in his Looks and Words, leaning upon the Table, and having ſtruck it with great Vehemence, ſpoke to them in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matters are now come to that paſs, that no one who has a drop of noble Blood in his Veins, can any longer
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60048:85"/>tamely bear theſe Oppreſſions. My patience and conſtancy have long ſince been ſhockt, by the dreadful proſpect of my Country's Ruine, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen's falling under the Tyranny deſign'd for them by an ungrateful Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain. Were it poſſible that theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diſtempers, which have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attackt the vitals of the Republick, could receive any remedy by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, I for my part would be very willing to conſent to any Truce which might ſecure our common Safety: But ſince our affairs are driven to the laſt Extremity, there lies a neceſſity upon us to exert our utmoſt force for the preſervation of our Country from Ruin. Dangers, ſuch as ours are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by a bold Reſiſtance, for nothing increaſes the weight of them more than a lazy expectation of Events. <hi>Janne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Doria</hi> hath long ſince been ſurfeited with a ſeries of proſperous ſucceſſes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him: Now he is become a Vaſſal to Ambition, that tormenting extravagancy of the Mind, and is got ſo near to the concluſion of his wicked
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60048:85"/>deſigns, that neither fear nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty reſtrain him from threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (more by Actions than by words) <hi>Genoua</hi> with Servitude, and me with Death. Was it not enough for this Villain to, behold the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, who but a little while agoe poſſeſt the Sovereignty of all <hi>Ligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> now depriv'd of that power and dignity, and ſubjected to the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſcorn of the Nobility; but muſt he aim at enſlaving us to an abſolute Monarchy, wherewith he is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inveſt himſelf? To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he grows uneaſie at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, and in his own Country (which yet enjoys the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of being a free State) he puts on the barbarity of a Foreign Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; his Pride and Stubbornneſs are ſo great, that they cannot be molliſied by our humble and modeſt compliance, nor can we by any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, how cautious ſoever, eſcape the fatal conſequences of being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and hated by him. You ſee how ſtrongly he has environed our
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60048:86"/>Maritime Coaſts, with his twenty Gallies; you ſee how proudly he paſſes through the City, attended by ſuch of the Nobility, who having by the means of <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that Dignity which was lately yours, now pay <hi>Jannetin</hi> for it the price of a ſervile obſequiouſneſs; but that which moſt ſenſibly affects me is the invincible reaſons I have to think, that he deſigns to oppreſs the publick Liberty by the aſſiſtance of the Emperour his too powerful Patron. And becauſe I alone, out of a ſenſe of the duty I owe to my Country, and of the particular obligations I have to your Party, would never conſent (as ſeveral others of the Nobility have done) to the unjuſt depredations that have been made on the rights of the People, <hi>Jannetin</hi> is employing all his Engines for my deſtruction. Why therefore, Gentlemen, do we yet continue care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and cowardly Spectators of our approaching Calamities? For what enterpriſe do we reſerve our Strength
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60048:86"/>and Courage, if we now unhappily abandon our own and our Countries ſafety, when there is need of our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt force to preſeve it from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation? 'Tis now the time for us to puniſh, if we can, theſe Villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſpiracies, and not to lament and deplore them: Tears, Sighs, and querulous Language, are Weapons proper only for Women, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever deſerves the nobler Character of a Man, ought to revenge his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries in ſuch vigorous Methods as are worthy that Sex, which Nature has honour'd with ſo large Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. We have all of us too long patiently endur'd the inſolence of thoſe, who impute this our good Nature, to a ſervile and baſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And the impunity with which their former Crimes have eſcap'd, do only encourage theſe oppreſſors to increaſe the grievances which we have till now diſguis'd under a forc'd ſilence and a diſſembled contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And what further are we yet to expect from theſe Villaine? Perhaps
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60048:87"/>when you are wholly depriv'd of the ſmall ſhare you now have in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of affairs, their cruel mercy may induce them to ſpare ſome of your lives; but how much wiſh'd for will Death be by thoſe who will daily be entertain'd with the diſmal proſpect of the ruin of Eſtates, the deſtruction of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Murthers treacherouſly perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated under the pretence of Law and Juſtice, Matrons and Virgins raviſh'd, and many more Villainies committed, by <hi>Jannetin Doria's</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and by his approbation? Theſe and many more Calamities are the unavoidable conſequences of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which owes its Birth to the ruin of a flouriſhing State, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eſtabliſh'd but by the Death of all brave and worthy Patriots.</p>
            <p>Therefore (my Friends; are our Souls ſo degenerated? Is our Blood ſo ſpiritleſs and chill? Are our Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons ſo very dull and blunted, that we cannot exert a vigorous Revenge, and put an end to the infamous life
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60048:87"/>of him, who glories in that he hath reduc'd us to this unfortunate and deſpicable condition? Shall we not pierce every fibre of that Heart that hath harbour'd projects ſo villainous and cruel? Shall we ſuffer one, who at the beſt, is but our equal, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to trample upon us, and to have the ſame abſolute power of Life and Death over us, as if we had been born his Slaves? For my own part I declare, I had much rather purchaſe my liberty with the utmoſt toil and hazard, than to ſlide with eaſe and ſloth into the ſtate of Servitude; and as I may (without arrogance) believe that our common Enemies, deſign my death as well as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Republick, ſo do I with the moſt chearful willingneſs Sacrifice my life for the preſervation of our National Liberty, which if I ſhould not much preferr before the ſafety of my own Perſon, I were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to live a moment longer. But however, I would fain ſee in you, thoſe vigorous Emotions of mind,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60048:88"/>which not only your Quality and Educattion, but even thoſe great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which at this time threaten your ruin, require from you. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would have me act the part of your Leader, or of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldier in ſo juſt a cauſe, I am ready according to your Orders, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Command, or to obey. I here conſign my ſelf to you with an aſſurance, that as my Perſon ſhall be always in your Power, ſo my Soul ſhall be undaunted, and unſhaken under whatſoever event may attend our undertaking.</p>
            <p>But, Gentlemen, whether your honour or your ſafety is dear to you, you muſt be of good Courage, and take up Arms with me: For this reſolution is abſolutely neceſſary to you all, to thoſe of you who are inſpir'd with a forward valour 'tis exceeding glorious, and to thoſe with whom a cautious abhorrence of War is more prevalent, ſelf-preſervation makes it indiſpenſably requiſite. Nor do I invite you to join with me in a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60048:88"/>raſh, and inconſiderate enterprize, for 'tis many Months ſince I not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly projected all the methods to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, but made it my buſineſs to provide a ſufficient number of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; who being now conveniently poſted about the City, ſeem to give us full aſſurance of an eaſie and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain victory, almoſt without the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a Battel. So that when you call to mind the contemptuous beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of our governing Nobility, and the exceſſive pride of <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> I am ſure theſe Reflections muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken in you a deſire of an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able revenge: And this will inſpire you with ſo vigorous a courage in the uſe of your Weapons, that our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will, to their loſs and ſhame, admire the courage of us whom they have ſo much deſpis'd, and on the other ſide we ſhall know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether their fortitude in War is any ways equal to their Arrogance and Luxury in times of Peace. Thus far, my Friends, I have laid before you my thoughts of the preſent ſtate
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60048:89"/>of affairs: 'Tis time now to put an end to my diſcourſe, that we may proceed in our ſucceſsful enterprize. Let us march into the City, where multitudes are ready to joyn with us in our honourable undertaking. The Gates and Avenues are in the power of ſuch Soldiers as I have brought over to my Intereſts; and when I give the ſignal, the <hi>Genouſe</hi> Gallies will fall into the poſſeſſion of ſome ſtout Seamen, who will with their lives defend their Prize, and annoy the Enemy.</p>
            <p>In the City fifteen hundred Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Artificers wait ready arm'd for our coming: By this time two thouſand of the Infantry of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and as many of my own Subjects are got into the Suburbs, and are calling upon the Populace to aſſiſt them in reſtoring the Liberty, reſettling the ancient Government of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and extirpating the inſolent Tyranny and Uſurpation of <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> and his confederate Nobility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:60048:89"/>Therefore rouſe up your Courage, and march with me; that this Night (which in Brightneſs Rivals the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Day) may put an end to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our paſt Servitude, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring to the deſpis'd Populace their Juſt Dignities and Rightful Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</p>
            <p>And if, after what I have ſaid, there is any one of you, who ſhall be ſo Obſtinate and Self-conceited, as to make any Objection or Oppoſition to an Exploit ſo Noble and Generous, as is the preſerving our Country from imminent Servitude, let him look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Dreadful Scene of Warlike Preparations, and aſſure himſelf, that where there are ſo many Swords, his Breaſt ſhall not eſcape unpierc'd. I muſt freely and plainly declare to you, that 'tis abſolutely neceſſary for us all to Fight, or to Die: And his Blood who ſhall refuſe to Succour his Country in this time of Danger, ſhall be ſhed in this very place to waſh out the ſtain of his Ingratitude and Perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs: And this Hand of mine
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60048:90"/>ſhall Slay the firſt Victim, which Conſecrates this Night to the Love of our Country, if any one dares be ſo untimely ſcrupulous as to make any Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>This Threatning Speech, together with ſuch a number of Arm'd Men appearing in their view ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute theſe Menaces, ſo much Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the Impriſon'd Gueſts, that for ſome time they remain'd ſilent: But at laſt being more affected with the Apprehenſions of their preſent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, (being on all ſides hem'd in by Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Soldiers) then with the Horrour of the Impious Action they were going about, expreſs'd their readineſs to Obey the Count's Orders, and to ſollow him as their Leader. Two only of the whole Company diſſembling a Cowardiſe, (Honourable on ſuch an occaſion) Petition'd <hi>Fieſchi</hi> not to engage them in an Affair ſo far diſtant from their Profeſſion; leaſt (being ſurpriz'd with exceſſive Fear in the heat of the Fight) they ſhou'd rather be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60048:90"/>than a help to his Enterprize. And ſo exquiſitely did they feign this unuſual Torrour, that the Count, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had a while diſcours'd with them, ſuppoſing as they pretended, their Company might be prejudicial to him, was well ſatisfi'd that they ſhou'd continue in an Apartment of his Palace confin'd under a ſtrong Guard. Theſe were <hi>John Baptiſt Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneo Bava,</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> the Son of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban;</hi> who volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily Acting the Cowards at ſuch a ſeaſonable Juncture, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from being the Infamous parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in this Publick Parricide, deſerve for it much greater Praiſe, than <hi>Junius Brutus</hi> for counterfeiting the Madman: For by that diſſimulation he only ſecur'd himſelf from the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of the Proud Tyrant <hi>Tarquin,</hi> but theſe Worthies by their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Timorouſneſs, did what in them lay, for the common ſafety of the Republick.</p>
            <p>

This Lady being ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd at the horridneſs of the Fact, and the conſideration of the Dangers her Husband expos'd himſelf to in the proſecution of it, fell at his Feet in the manner of a Suppliant, and accompanying her Words with Sighs and Tears, and all the Marks of a real and intenſe Sorrow, ſpake to him to this effect.</p>
            <p>I beg you (my Deareſt Lord) by the ſincere and ardent Love I bear you, and by whatever in the World you value at the higheſt Rate, take care of your Life, and do not by ſo baſe an Act Blemiſh the Honour of your Family. By theſe Tears I ſhed, and by theſe Knees of yours which I now embrace, do not, I intreat you,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60048:93"/>ſo far forget the Duty you owe to God, to your Countrey, to me, and to your ſelf: Why will my <hi>Fieſchi</hi> precipitate himſelf and me into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which he may ſo eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void? How ſhall I be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the weight, of expecting every Minute, (with the Ominous Preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a Trembling Heart) the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing News of your Death; which will be but the beginning of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate and Diſgraceful Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; for how can I expect better Uſage (though the Calamities of that State ſeldom fail to move Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion) than to be pointed at, and taken notice of, as the Partner of your Bed, and the Concealer, if not Sharer, of your Treaſon. Can you be ſo Cruel as to abandon me for a Prey to the Luſt of the Soldiers, and the Fury of the Populace, who (I fear) will e're it be long come to pillage and deſtroy this Houſe, as part of the Juſt Puniſhment due for your Rebellion; and in that Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Outrage how can I expect to be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60048:94"/>free from their Violence and Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Therefore, my Dear Lord, alter yet your Reſolutions, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further in this.</p>
            <p>She wou'd have proceeded, but her Grief interrupted her, and <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> perceiving that <hi>Panla</hi> was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſecond the Counteſſes Requeſt with Arguments to diſſwade him from ſo Flagitious an Enterprize, put an end to their intended Debate by this Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Let not my <hi>Leonora</hi> preſage ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy a concluſion to my Enterprize, but rather entertain her Mind, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my abſence, with the pleaſing hopes of a Fortunate Event. My Deſtiny has engag'd me in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and my Affairs are now in that poſture, that whether I will or no, I muſt proceed; therefore (my Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) compoſe your Mind to that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as not to be ſurpriz'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Joy at my good Succeſs, nor with too intenſe a Grief, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhould happen. Within a ſew Hours you will hear either of my
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60048:94"/>Death or Victory. And ſo Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Verrina</hi> return'd to the Palace, and aſſur'd Count <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi,</hi> that there was no reaſon for him to apprehend any manner of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in any part of the City: that his Galley well Mann'd and Arm'd ſtood ready for a Signal to block up the entrance of the <hi>Darſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> and ſhut up (as it were) <hi>Doria</hi>'s Veſſels which were then in that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Fieſchi</hi> upon this diſtributes Arms to thoſe whom he had got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and about Ten at Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Expedition, having Marſhal'd his Men in this order. His Van-Guard conſiſted of One Hundred and Fifty Choſen Men, whoſe Courage and Skill in theſe Affairs he had frequent Experience of. Next March'd the Count himſelf (attended by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Party,) and, as it became a careful General, he made it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to ſee that his Soldiers obſerv'd the neceſſary Diſcipline of keeping in their Ranks and Files. When they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60048:95"/>were come near to the Suburbs, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi</hi> diſpatch'd his Natural Brother <hi>Cornelius</hi> to ſeize the Gate <hi>del Arco;</hi> which he took without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Garriſon-Soldiers who were but few, not expecting to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a time of Peace to be ſo fiercely Attack'd from without, and at the ſame time betray'd from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Walls by the Treachery of <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Adherents. The Count be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fluſhed with this good Succeſs, ſends away preſently his Two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Ottobuoni,</hi> together with <hi>Vincentio Calcagno,</hi> to poſſeſs themſelves of the Gate of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> Juſt at this time the Galley diſcharg'd their Cannon, which was the Signal agreed on to give them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of its arrival to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. As ſoon as <hi>Fieſchi</hi> heard this, he and the Soldiers that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him haſten'd their March to the Bridge of <hi>Cattani,</hi> having in their way thither paſs'd through St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Arch to St. <hi>Donate</hi>'s, and from thence all along the Street call'd <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60048:95"/>de i Salvaghi.</hi> When they came to the Bridge of <hi>Cattani, Verrina</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got on board the Galley, <hi>Thomas Aſſereto</hi> endeavour'd to make ſure of the entrance into the <hi>Darſenne;</hi> who at firſt had a free admittance granted him by thoſe who guarded this Port, becauſe when he told them his Name they knew him to be a Servant of <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s; but as ſoon as they ſaw how many Soldiers follow'd him, they ſuſpected his deſign, and by main force thruſt him out again, and put themſelves vigorouſly on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. So that this Stratagem fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it being very neceſſary that ſome Body ſhou'd get in at that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and open the Gate for <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s entrance, it was reſolv'd that <hi>Scipio Borgognoni,</hi> one of the Count's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, fam'd for his Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſhou'd Arm and Man ſome of the ſmalleſt Veſſels, with which, thus provided againſt all Exigences, he ſhou'd by Sea force his paſſage into the <hi>Darſenne,</hi> and open a way for the Conſpirators Irruption at the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60048:96"/>place, where the Impoſts upon Wines are aſſeſſed and paid. And thus was the deſign ſucceſsfully executed: For although there were ſome Contraſts before the Soldiers in Garriſon wou'd quit their Poſt; yet the Aſſailants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more in number, and of a more daring Courage, than the Beſieged, they quickly forc'd them to abandon their Fort.</p>
            <p>By this time <hi>Fieſchi</hi> arriv'd by Land to the <hi>Darſenne,</hi> and waited e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Moment for the Signal which was to give notice that his Galley was got ſafely thither: But it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that ſhe came ſome time later than had been agreed on; for, the Water being ſhallow, ſhe ran aground, and it coſt them full half an Hour to Lanch her out again into the Deep.</p>
            <p>Theſe tumultuous motions by this time had rais'd a Hurly Burly in the <hi>Darſenne;</hi> but before the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> could be throughly <hi>alarm'd</hi> with it, Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> hearing the Signal gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, order'd his Soldiers to fall upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60048:96"/>
               <hi>Doria</hi>'s Gallies with all imaginable vigour and fury, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly executed, he himſelf perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his part in this Aſſault. This unexpected violence, and the ſight of ſuch a number of arm'd Men in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Port, quickly alarm'd both the Seamen and the Galley Slaves; and now the Air was fill'd with a confus'd and dreadful noiſe, the Slaves joining together in the common cry of Liberty, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to burſt their Chains, the deteſtable Badges of their Villainy and Servitude. But Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> never intended (nor would it have much forwarded his deſign) to be Maſter only of ſo many empty Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; therefore to prevent the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that would accrue to him by the flight of theſe Slaves; he made all poſſible haſt to get on Board the Admiral Galley which made no great haſt either to eſcape or to return the violence the Enemies had offer'd its Commander and Soldiers,<note place="margin">La Capitana</note> being ſtartled at theſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60048:97"/>unexpected diſorders. <hi>Fieſchi</hi> being eager to accompliſh this deſign, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a plank to be laid for his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, one end of it reſting on the ſhore, and the other on the ladder in the poup of the Veſſel; this move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bridge prov'd the ruin of the whole Project; for neither end of it being faſten'd, and the Galley hapning, by ſome accident or other, to thruſt farther from the ſhore, <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi</hi> and the Bridge he ſo raſhly tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with his life, were of a ſudden plung'd in the Waves.</p>
            <p>He was arm'd at all points, and with the weight of this he was ſo oppreſt, that he could not ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſwimming back to the Shore; and the darkneſs of the Night, and the tumultuous Noiſes of ſo great a concourſe of People, hindred his Friends from perceiving the fatal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, or hearing the cries and ſhrieks of their Leader in this deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Extremity, which quickly put an end to his life; he being rather ſtifled in a puddle of Muddy Water,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60048:97"/>than drown'd in the clear Ocean, and being clogg'd and weigh'd down by that Armour, in which he had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c'd his greateſt ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Thus the Almighty by his uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Providence derides and fruſtrates thoſe Cobweb Policies and vain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, wherewith unhappy ſhort-ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mortals amuſe themſelves, for this formidable Conſpiracy, which had been fram'd and carried on at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſo much time, and ſo many cunning Artifices, which was now ſecur'd and ſtrengthen'd by a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Army, and was juſt ripe for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, was at this very inſtant ſhatter'd and deſtroy'd, by an event ſudden, unexpected, and in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance purely caſual: Divine Juſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving the Conſpirators in thoſe dreadful Calamities, to which their Treacherous cruelty had deſign'd to ſacrifice their Native Countrey.</p>
            <p>In the mean time (notwithſtanding this Accident) the Conſpirators boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Doria</hi>'s Gallies, and maun'd them with a ſufficient number of their own
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60048:98"/>Soldiers, of whoſe fidelity they had had the greateſt experience.</p>
            <p>Nor were <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s two Brothers <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Ottobuoni</hi> any ways wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Execution of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; for as ſoon as they heard the Cannon diſcharg'd, (which was the ſignal agreed on) they attackt the Gate of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> with 600 Men; intending when this was in their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to march from hence directly to <hi>Doria</hi>'s Palace (which was ſituated without the City Walls, and at a ſmall diſtance from this Gate) and there barbarouſly to aſſaſſinate <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Doria</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Jannetin.</hi> The Garriſon that was poſted at this Gate, made an honourable reſiſtance for ſome time, and had not <hi>Fieſchi</hi> corrupted ſome of the Soldiers with Bribes, it is not a little probable that this attempt had prov'd unſucceſsful. For <hi>Sebaſtiani Lerearo</hi> and his Brother, one of them being Captain, and the other Enſign of that party, coming in at that inſtance to their aſſiſtance, held the Conſpirators to a ſharp and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60048:98"/>bloody Combate, till at laſt the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain being taken Priſoner and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign kill'd in the Skirmiſh, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants being betray'd by ſome of their fellow Soldiers, and briskly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by their Enemies, were at laſt put to flight, and ſo loſt that Gate they had ſo well defended; and which the Conſpirators rather bought with their Money than acquir'd by their valour. The Shouts of the Soldiers, the Claſhing of Weapons, and the Noiſe of the tumult grew ſo loud that it was heard to <hi>Doria</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. The old Man was at this time confin'd to his Bed by a violent fit of the Gout; but however was mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarm'd at theſe unaccountable Confuſions; as was alſo <hi>Jannetin</hi>'s Wife, who being wak'd by them preſently, told her Husband ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the Galley Slaves were in a Mutiny. He preſently got up, and perſwading himſelf that he ſhould on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find his own Seamen engag'd in ſome <note n="*" place="margin">una riſſa ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſa per cagione dignoco.</note> jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar quarrel, or ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60048:99"/>ſquabble eaſily reconcilable, he marcht towards the Gate of St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> And as if ſate had hurried him on to his certain deſtruction, he took no Arms with him but a Sword, nor any attendants but one Servant, and a Page, who carri'd a Torch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; although his Uncle, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conſidering that the danger might be greater than it at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, had advis'd him to take with him a ſufficient number of Men and Arms to defend himſelf againſt any Violence that might be offer'd him; and his Wife had with the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and affectionate Entreaties endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to perſwade him not to ſtir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad till Morning: But he was deaf to her Prayers, and regardleſs of his Uncle's Advice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jannetin,</hi> when he came to the Gate, ſuppoſing it was ſtill Guarded by thoſe Soldiers of his own Party, whoſe Charge it us'd to be, being vex'd at this unſeaſonable Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and not finding ſo ready an admittance as he expected, call'd out
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60048:99"/>to them aloud <note n="*" place="margin">con Puſata alterezza.</note> in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious manner (as was his cuſtom) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to open the Gate to him; which the Conſpirators very joyfully did, as ſoon as they knew by his voice, that it was <hi>Jannetin Doria,</hi> whom they hated and fear'd as one of the greateſt Obſtacles to their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſigns.</p>
            <p>Having thus a fair opportunity for executing their Malice, they loſt no time; but as ſoon as ever <hi>Jannet in</hi> had put his head within the Wicket, they fell upon him with all the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons they had at command, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly Murther'd him leaving hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any part of his body free from the bloody Characters of their Cruelty. But Divine Juſtice ſignaliz'd it ſelf in the revenge of this Murther, for at the ſame inſtant that unhappy <hi>Doria</hi> ſell a Sacrifice to the fury of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> (as ſome Writers obſerve) who was the chief contriver of this Murther, and by whoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular order his Soldiers perpetrated
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60048:100"/>it, ended his life in the wretch'd man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner above related.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jannetin Doria</hi> was a Perſon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a longer life, for he was a true lover of his Country, and a Scourge and Terror to the Corſaires of <hi>Barbary</hi> and other Pirates, who cruis'd about the Coaſts of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and interrupted the freedom of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: Therefore (if <hi>Genoua</hi> muſt have loſt him in the Flower of his Age) his Death would have been much more glorious, had he expir'd in the heat of Battel, fighting againſt the common Enemy, than to periſh (as he did) by the inhumane Malice of Seditious Aſſaſſines and Traitors, who had ſet their Country in a Flame and were juſt upon the point of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting its ruine.</p>
            <p>It was a thing to be wonder'd at that thoſe who murther'd <hi>Jannetin</hi> did not, as was at firſt reſolv'd, run preſently to <hi>Andrew Doria</hi>'s Palace, and at the ſame time (as would have been no difficult matter) have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves (by acting the ſame
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60048:100"/>Villainy on the Uncle which they had lately done on the Nephew) from the poſſibility of another Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, under the Conduct of that Patriot, who had once before, and might again reſtore the liberty of <hi>Genuoa.</hi> Nor had they reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any thing at his hands in caſe he ſhould furvive their Malice and overthrow their Deſigns, but to be made memorable examples of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Juſtice, both for their bold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and their many Murthers, eſpecially that of <hi>Jannetin</hi> which they might be ſure would moſt nearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect him. But this Flagitious Act they forbore; whether it were that the horrour of what they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done rais'd ſuch a tumult in their minds, as is uſual with wicked Men that they knew not for a while, what to reſolve on next. Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were ſtopt in the violence of their Carcer by <hi>Jerome Fieſchi</hi> the Count's Brother, who had no great apprehenſions of any ill Conſequences from the life of <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> a Man
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60048:101"/>of Fourſcore years Old, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm in his Body, left without guards and very thinly attended; now that he had diſpatcht <hi>Jannetin</hi> a bold and reſolute Young Man, and that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>'s Gallies and thoſe of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick were (as he believ'd) in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his own adherents, and that he had ſubdu'd his Enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City, and taken their moſt conſiderable Fortreſſes, ſo that he thought himſelf ſecure of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: Or laſtly, whether he fear'd that while the Soldiers greedy of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine where wholly intent upon the Plunder of ſo rich a Palace as <hi>Doria</hi>'s, their Enemies might ſurprize them and cut them in pieces; or were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous (as is probable enough) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that magnificent furniture, (which the rudeneſs of the Soldiers would not have ſpar'd) whole and entire, as it then ſtood, to grace the Triumphs of his Brother at his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Entry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60048:101"/>In the mean time the Noiſe and Tumults increaſing, and <hi>Andrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> not knowing the occaſion of them, enquir'd often what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Jannetin,</hi> but cou'd hear no Tidings at all of him, nor receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſatisfactory Information about the Dreadful Confuſions that reign'd in all Quarters of the City: At laſt he ſent <hi>Louis Julia,</hi> one of his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, into the City to learn the cauſe of theſe Diſorders, who brought him word in a very little time, that Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> was become Maſter of the City; that the Circumſtances of the Republick were extreamly dangerous; that the Galleys were in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Conſpirators; that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace were in ſo high a Sedition, as to declare openly for Liberty, and to wiſh Succeſs to the Arms of <hi>Fieſchi</hi> whom they look'd upon as their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer; that Arm'd Men outragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Violent were to be met with in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Street, who like Mad Men threatned Deſtruction, and a general Plunder to all the Houſes of Rich
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60048:102"/>Men; that there was nothing to be ſeen but Quarrels, Bloodſhed, and Murther; and that in all parts Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious and Reproachful Language, with the bittereſt Curſes and Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Nobility were to be heard; and laſtly, that himſelf was in a particular manner deſtin'd a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their Rage and Malice.</p>
            <p>This News, though it did not at all affrighten the good Old Man, yet it touch'd his Soul with ſo ſenſible a Grief, to ſee his Countrey, which he had always lov'd with the tendereſt Affection, juſt upon the brink of Ruin, that he reſolv'd without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any reſiſtance to yield himſelf a Prey to the Impetuous Fury of the Conſpirators: Saying, that he ought not to live after the Subverſion of the Republick; and that he was now willing and deſirous that the ſmall and unhappy remainder of his Life, ſhou'd have the ſame Period with the expiring Liberty of <hi>Genoua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:60048:102"/>But the earneſt Requeſts and Tears of his Wife, together with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Violence of his Servants, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled his former Reſolutions, and prevail'd with him to haſten his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; which, they told him, was now become neceſſary: Repreſenting to him withall, that ſince the Annals of his Life were full of ſo many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and publick ſpirited Actions, he ought to reſerve the cloſe of it for the Common Good of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: That therefore he ought to be willing to Live, that he might ſee his own Glory and Reputation redoubl'd, by reſtoring <hi>Genoua</hi> once more to her Liberty, and repelling that Tyranny which was now imminent, but under his Auſpicious Conduct might yet be Cruſh'd: That now was the time for him to render his former Conduct the more illuſtrious, by ſupporting theſe Misfortunes with a calm Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and by conſulting the Dictates of his own Mind, which he us'd to preſerve ſerene and free from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of ſudden Accidents, or the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60048:103"/>of Deſpair: That <hi>Genoua</hi> had now nothing to rely on for her Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but the ſafety of his Perſon: That though the Republick were for a while Oppreſs'd by the Arbitrary Sway of the moſt Egregious Villains, yet ſhe could not deſpair of a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to her former Glorious State, while ſhe knew her Deliverer to be ſafe: That on all theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he ſhould retire to ſome more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure place, and there prepare thoſe Remedies for the Publick Diſtempers, which the preſent ſtate of affairs made it impoſſible for him to do while he continued in the City, (beſides the extreme danger his Life was in every Minute) that he muſt not look upon his Retreat, as a timorous flight from the Perils and Diſorders of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but as an Embaſſy in which at this Exigency Afflicted <hi>Genoua</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd him, for her own Safety and Benefit.</p>
            <p>Thus by the united perſwaſions and entreaties of his whole Family, the good Old Man, (who bent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60048:103"/>the weight of ſo many Years, and was no leſs afflicted in his Mind with the ſad proſpect of the Miſeries of his Countrey, than in his Body with the tormenting pains of the Gout) was prevail'd with to ſuffer himſelf to be carri'd on his Servants Shoulders, and by them ſet on his Mule, which convey'd him to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone</hi> a Fortifi'd Caſtle belonging to the Family of <hi>Spinola,</hi> and Fifteen Miles diſtant from <hi>Genoua;</hi> in his way thither he ſtop'd at <hi>Seſtri,</hi> and there heard the afflicting News of his Nephew <hi>Jannet in</hi>'s Death.</p>
            <p>While ſuch a ſeries of good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs attended the Arms of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, they at laſt began to miſs Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> their Leader, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them were detach'd to make a narrow ſearch and enquiry after him. At laſt, when no news at all cou'd be heard of him, they grew ſuſpicious of the Fatal Accident that had ended his Life: However, the Governing Party among them ſmother'd theſe riſing Jealouſies as well as they could,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60048:104"/>leaſt if it ſhou'd be nois'd among the Soldiers, they ſhou'd deſert their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and through deſpair throw up a Conqueſt already ſo far advanc'd. They loft a ſtrong Guard at every Gate, <hi>Ottobuoni Fieſchi</hi> was entruſted with the Galleys, and Two Hundred of the moſt Valiant of the whole Army, under the Command of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Fieſchi,</hi> were detach'd according to their firſt Reſolutions, to March through the Streets of <hi>Genoua</hi> and excite the Mobile to take up Arms and join them. But this deſign did not ſucceed according to their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, for although a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Scum of the People fell in with the Conſpirators, when they firſt Proclaim'd a General Liberty to be obtain'd for them by the means of Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> and that under his Protection they ſhould continue in the ſecure enjoyment of it, yet not one Trades-Man of any Wealth or Reputation ſtirr'd a Finger in their behalf. Whether it were that they abhorr'd and dreaded theſe Tumults
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60048:104"/>and Confuſions, out of a ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for the continuance of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranquillity; or that they thought it a Precedent too dangerous to be allow'd of, that one of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſhou'd make uſe of the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace only as Tools, for the gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own private Ambition, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, or Vanity: Or whether they thought themſelves ſlighted by Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> in that he undertook an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of ſo publick an Importance, without communicating his deſigns and intentions to them from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt: Or laſtly, whether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thoſe exceſſive Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances under which they had been formerly Oppreſs'd, made them hate the Democratick Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the Sovereign Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plac'd in the hands of the moſt deſpicable of the Populace, Publick Affairs were manag'd without any reſpect either to Diſcretion, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and the determination of the moſt difficult matters falling to the ſhare of Fellows that had neither
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60048:105"/>Senſe, Virtue, Education, nor Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, their Reſolutions were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Indeliberate, Violent, and Dangerous.</p>
            <p>'Tis hardly to be expreſs'd what a diſorder theſe Tumultuous Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had put the whole City into. The People run about as if they had been diſtracted, without knowing wither they had beſt to go; they ask'd one another what was the cauſe of theſe Dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, but they were all ſtruck with ſuch a Panick Fear, that they had not the power to return an Anſwer. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all Qualities appear'd at their Windows, and with the moving Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Sighs and Tears, Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dangers to which their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Brothers, and Sons, were forc'd in this Exigency to expoſe themſelves for the neceſſary defence of their Countrey. The Nobility were ſo Amaz'd, that they knew not whether it were beſt for them, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in a Body at the Doge's Palace,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60048:105"/>or to ſtay at their ſeveral Houſes, and defend them, as well as they cou'd, from being Pillag'd. The Emperor's Embaſſador being ſurpriz'd at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Accident, was preparing to leave <hi>Genoua,</hi> that his Maſter's Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might not receive any Affront, or Outrage, by the Inſolence which the Enrag'd Mobile might offer to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; but being over-perſwaded by <hi>Paul Laſagna,</hi> a Man who had a great influence over the Populace, he went to his Houſe and ſtaid there. This <hi>Laſagna</hi> during theſe Diſtractions, got together a conſiderable number of his Friends and Dependants; and having an inveterate Pique and Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with the Family of <hi>Spinola</hi> on the account of their vaſt Riches and powerful Alliances, he ſtaid at home expecting the upſhot of <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; that he might accordingly take ſuch Meaſures as would beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his own Intereſts. For he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that by this Revolution there would be a way open'd for the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtating the Family of the <hi>Adorni</hi> in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60048:106"/>their Ancient Poſſeſſion of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Genoua;</hi> ſeveral of thoſe who now declar'd for <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> being ſincere and affectionate Friends to the <hi>Adorni.</hi> The Emperor's Embaſſador being reſolv'd to ſtay in <hi>Genoua,</hi> and to give what Aſſiſtance he could to a Republick ſo entirely devoted to the Intereſts of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> went with all ſpeed to the Ducal-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where he found <hi>Jerome Doria</hi> the Cardinal, <hi>Adam Centurio,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Nobility, who met the reſt of the Senate, and conſulted with them, <hi>Nicholas Franco</hi> being Preſident of the Aſſembly, for at this time there was no <note n="*" place="margin">Or Duke.</note> Doge of <hi>Genoua.</hi> The reſult of their Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, was, that <hi>Boniface Lomelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Chriſtopher Pallavicino,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Calva,</hi> with a Cornet of the Guards, and Fifty Soldiers, ſhou'd march to the defence of the Gate of St. <hi>Thomas;</hi> but in the way thither meeting with a Squadron of <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>'s Party, they Engag'd with it, and being deſerted and betray'd by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60048:106"/>of their own Men, were forc'd to retreat for ſhelter to the Palace of <hi>Adam Centurio:</hi> There having rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd themſelves with ſeveral freſh Men, and being join'd by <hi>Francis Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldi,</hi> and <hi>Dominic Doria,</hi> they went boldly by another way towards the Gate, to enquire what was become of <hi>Andrew Doria.</hi> But finding the Gate ſtrongly Guarded, and <hi>Lomelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> (who had bravely attempted to break through their Ranks) being taken Priſoner by the Conſpirators, they were again put to ſlight, and were quickly follow'd by <hi>Lomellino,</hi> who had had the good Luck to make his Eſcape.</p>
            <p>The Conſpirators had not yet heard any Tidings of Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> and <hi>Verrina,</hi> who foreſaw that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him their whole Project, though ſo far advanc'd, was in an extream hazard of being totally fruſtrated, and having in vain ſearch'd all places where he thought he might find him, began to grow deſperate, and betook himſelf to his Galley: For by ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60048:107"/>this he thought himſelf, ſafe, what Event ſoever ſhou'd happen. If <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Deſign ſucceeded well, then he ſhou'd be Maſter of the <hi>Darſenne,</hi> and preſerve the ſtrength and flower of the Count's Army for other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Services: If the Attempt ſhou'd fail, as the preſent Circumſtances of Affairs ſeem'd to Threaten, he cou'd then ſave himſelf from the danger of being taken and puniſh'd as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, by Rowing as faſt as he cou'd towards <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> Nevertheleſs his keeping at ſuch a diſtance prov'd a very great inconvenience to <hi>Jerome Fieſchi:</hi> For that Party of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators which were on Land, ſeeing themſelves, as it were, abandon'd, both by Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> their Leader, and by <hi>Verrina</hi> the Adviſer and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of this Deſign, and both of them being Inſtruments abſolutely neceſſary for the carrying of it on, they cou'd not entirely confide in the Conduct of <hi>Jerome Fieſchi.</hi> Who being very Young, had neither Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience nor Prudence, but in all his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60048:107"/>Management ſhow'd himſelf to be hurried on by an Impetuous Raſhneſs, without conſidering himſelf, or hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Reaſons that others offer'd him. Beſides this, the Soldiers cou'd not have that Eſteem and Reverence for him, which they generally bear towards Perſons of an approv'd Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and an eſtabliſh'd Reputation; which are the ſureſt Methods to gain an Aſcendant over the Hearts of the People. So that they did not only begin to fall of from their firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, but alſo took all occaſions that they cou'd to deſert the Service. Of ſo great Moment is the Eſteem Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have of their General, towards the good or bad Succeſs of any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. But one Accident, which on all accounts ſhou'd much rather have abated the Heat and Raſhneſs of <hi>Jerome Fieſchi,</hi> helped rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it, and to puff him up with that ſenſeleſs Ambition which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prov'd his Ruin. By this time the certain News of Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Death was confidently reported a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60048:108"/>his Adherents: And his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jerome</hi> looking upon himſelf as now the abſolute Maſter of all theſe Forces, and thinking that the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his Brother's Ambitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns was devolv'd to him as part of his Inheritance, he flatter'd himſelf with the Proſpect of obtaining for himſelf that Principality, for which he had hitherto Fought in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's behalf. Theſe deluding hopes, and the near view which he thought he had of their Accompliſhment, made him exert his utmoſt Vigour to compleat his Victory; for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements are vaſtly greater when we know that we our ſelves ſhall reap the Fruit of our Toil and Hazard, than when we only Act, as Engines, for the Profit and Advancement of others.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Senators, and the other Citizens, who were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd in the Palace, were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Aſſiſtance to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, now in all appearance reduc'd to the laſt Extremity; but not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60048:108"/>a ſufficient number of Forces to Cope with the Conſpirators, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ignorant of Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, they could not after all fix on any certain Reſolutions. They thought fit however to diſpatch <hi>Jerome Fieſco,</hi> and <hi>Benedict Canavale,</hi> as Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners from the Republick to Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> to demand of him what his pretences were for raiſing theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and what End he deſign'd by them. And quickly after Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Jerome Doria,</hi> a near Relation of Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> accompani'd by <hi>John Baptiſt Lercaro,</hi> and <hi>Bernard Caſtagna,</hi> two Senators, was preparing to go at the entreaty of the Senate, to deſire a Perſonal Conference with the Count himſelf; that ſo he might try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dignity of his Character, which ſometimes hath greater power than the Ties of Blood, or the Force of Eloquence, would be ſufficient to reſtrain him from making any farther progreſs in ſo dangerous an Affair. But ſeveral Wiſe Men diſſwaded the Cardinal from expoſing the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60048:109"/>of his Order to the Inſults and Affronts of the Populace, who at the beſt are Rude and Inconſiderate, but were now in a very high Ferment. Hereupon he turn'd back again, thinking it ſafer and better to deferr the interpoſing the Authority of his Office, till he ſhould have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſcourſe privately with Count <hi>Fieſchi.</hi> So that the Senate proceeded to a new Choice of ſome Gentlemen who were ſent to know the Count's demands. Their Names were, <hi>Auguſtin Lomellino, Hector Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſco, Anſald Juſtiniano, Ambroſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi> and <hi>John Balliano.</hi> Theſe ſtopt at (<hi>the Church of the</hi> Theatins) St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> and there waited for Count <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> whom they ſaw coming towards them, as they thought, with his Friends, Guards and Attendants. As ſoon as the two Parties were come pretty near to one another, <hi>Thomas Aſſereto,</hi> and others of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, drew their Weapons and begun to Aſſault the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> Commiſſioners ſo fircely, that <hi>Lomellino</hi> and <hi>Hector
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60048:109"/>Fieſco</hi> being not prepar'd for ſo rude a Treatment, got back into the City with great hazard of their Lives. When this Tumult was a little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd, <hi>Anſald Juſtiniano</hi> went up to <hi>Jerome Fieſchi,</hi> and demanded of him where he might find the Count, that he might impart to him the Meſſage wherewith the Senate had entruſted him. To this <hi>Jerome Fieſchi</hi> return'd a ſurly Anſwer, telling him, That he need not enquire any farther for Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> that he himſelf was poſſeſs'd of that Dignity, and that therefore he expected they ſhould preſently yield up to him the Senate Houſe, with all other Publick Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Fortifications which they were yet Maſters of. By this unadvis'd and ill tim'd Anſwer, the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> concluded, that <hi>John Lewis</hi> Count <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi</hi> was Dead. This inſpir'd them with a new Life; for after theſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Commiſſioners were return'd to the Senate, and had acquainted them with the certain News of the Elder <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Death, and with the Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60048:110"/>of the Younger Brother, they Order'd that Twelve of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhou'd get together as many of the Guards and the Populace, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well Arm'd, would be ſufficient either to drive <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Vanguard out of the City, or to cut them off if they ſhou'd make a ſtubborn Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But however, upon ſecond thoughts, they found it was not requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſite to run the hazard of a Battel. For thoſe of the Mobile who, at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cry of Liberty, went out and join'd with the Conſpirators, chiefly out of a deſire to plunder the Palaces of the Nobility, now finding their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fruſtrated, and repenting of the Sedition they had rais'd, fell off by little and little, and return'd to their own homes. For the Morning coming on apace, none of them were willing to be diſcover'd to be Accomplices of the Conſpiracy. And ſeveral of their own Men were inclin'd to follow this Example, thinking it better worth their while, to contrive a ſecure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for themſelves, than with the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60048:110"/>hazard of their Lives to obtain a compleat Victory, the profitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences whereof would fall only to the ſhare of their Leader. So that <hi>Jerome Fieſchi</hi> being arriv'd to St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Church, (which is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitical Church, and not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the Palace, whither he was marching in order to poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of it) and being ſtartl'd no leſs at the thinneſs of his own Troops, and their unwillingneſs to engage the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> than at the Number of Men which had been got together by the order of the Senate, he was at a plunge what courſe he ſhould take. But at laſt, out of extream caution for his own ſecurity, he went back by St. <hi>Donate</hi>'s, marching ſlowly to the Gate <hi>del Arco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide the Senators and chief Citizens of <hi>Genoua,</hi> who were aſſembled at the Palace, receiv'd new Life and Vigour by this unexpected turn of their Affairs: Inſomuch that ſome of them were of Opinion, that, ſince <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Troops were in ſuch a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60048:111"/>diſorder and conſternation, it wou'd be rather adviſable that thoſe <hi>Genoueſe</hi> Soldiers, whom they had got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhou'd make a brisk Aſſault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, than that the dignity of the Senate ſhou'd deſcend ſo low, as to Treat with their Rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on a Capitulation for Peace. But thoſe whoſe Age entituled them to the Character of Prudent and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Perſons, were againſt this Propoſal; as thinking it leſs Politick, though more ſpecious than the other: For, by avoiding a Battle, they ſhould ſave the Lives of many Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who muſt have periſh'd in it, (and how Laudable is this Avarice, if I may ſo call it, in Governours and Generals!) as alſo by the ſame caution prevent any ſudden Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that might turn the Scale of Affairs, and again involve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in thoſe Miſeries and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which, like a Ship that has eſcap'd the Perils of a Tempeſtuous Sea, and is now almoſt got within ſight of her deſir'd Haven, having
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60048:111"/>lately felt, ſhe had reaſon to be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of thoſe Methods that perhaps might again reduce her to the ſame Calamitous State. For the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already in a great Ferment, and it being in the Night time, and ſeveral Eminent Citizens being diſſatisfi'd at the preſent Conſtitution, and ſeveral others of them being already declar'd Rebels, 'twou'd have been as great an Error in Politicks for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Genoua</hi> to have truſted them with Arms, as it wou'd be ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement in a Phyſician to perplex his Patient with ſuch Medicines as wou'd ſtir the Humours of his Body, and ſet them on working, when he is ſo extreamly Weak, that nothing but a quiet and gentle courſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick can poſſibly keep him alive. The Glory therefore of healing theſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſtempers is to be attributed to the Prudent Advice of <hi>Paul Panſa,</hi> who had before try'd, but in vain, by the moſt reaſonable diſſwaſives, to prevent them, and to preſerve <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>'s Family from the ſad Fate that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60048:112"/>attends Perfidiouſneſs and Rebellion. He was call'd into their Aſſembly, where having given them a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory account of the Reaſons of his Conduct, he was order'd to go to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> now Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him from the Senate to quit the City, and to disband his Forces: Which if he would comply with, the Republick promis'd an Act of Oblivion for what was paſt, and a General Pardon to all the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Hereupon, and by <hi>Panſa</hi>'s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, and the Advice of <hi>Nicholas Doria</hi> his near Kinſman, who went with <hi>Panſa</hi> to make up this Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>Fieſchi</hi> having left the City, an Inſtrument was drawn up ſign'd by <hi>Ambroſe Senarega</hi> Secretary to the Senate, whereby the Publick Faith was given as a Security, that the Government wou'd make good what they had promis'd. So that <hi>Fieſchi</hi> quietly retreated to <hi>Montobbio</hi> with his Guards and Adherents. His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ottobuoni,</hi> with <hi>Verrina, Calcag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and <hi>Sacco,</hi> who ſecur'd themſelves
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60048:112"/>on board the late Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s beſt Galley, when they ſaw their Affairs entirely ruin'd, they ſteer'd their courſe to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> carrying with them in Chains <hi>Sebaſtian Lercaro, Manfred Centurio,</hi> and <hi>Vincent Vacca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> who were taken Priſoners at the beginning of the Tumult, between the <hi>Darſenne</hi> and the Gate of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi> But theſe Gentlemen they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards releas'd, ſetting them on ſhoar at the Mouth of the River <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.</hi> Thus <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s beſt Galley Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all poſſible haſt towards <hi>France,</hi> and the Galliots being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpers'd, the Haven of <hi>Genoua</hi> was again open, and a free paſſage left for all Veſſels to come in and go out without oppoſition. Hence it came to paſs that about Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Turkiſh Slaves, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Su loſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar dell' Alba.</note> who were Cruiſing about the Iſland <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>An Iſle of</hi> Tuſcany.</note> 
               <hi>Elba,</hi> took the opportunity offer'd them by the general Confuſion; and having Arm'd and Mann'd <hi>Doria</hi>'s Galley, call'd the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60048:113"/>
               <hi>Temperance,</hi> they preſently turn'd her Prow towards <hi>Africk,</hi> and made ſuch haſt, that, though <hi>Don Bernardin Mendozza</hi>'s Two Galleys purſu'd her with great Expedition and indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diligence, they cou'd not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take her. To this conſiderable loſs of <hi>Andrew Doria</hi>'s, we may alſo add the ſlight of the Galliots boarded by <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> which were rowed off by the Slaves that Manag'd them, and the plundering the other Galleys that remain'd, of all their Arms and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</p>
            <p>'Twas Four Days before the Body of <hi>John Lewis</hi> Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> was found: So that the Populace were inclin'd to believe he, with the others, had eſcap'd to <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> This made ſeveral Apprehenſive that the War was rather deferr'd than ended, and that after Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> had openly thrown off the Allegiance of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and beg'd the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>French,</hi> for compleating his Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſigns, he wou'd at his return proſecute the War with greater Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60048:113"/>and with a Cruelty ſuitable to his Perfidiouſneſs. But this ſuſpicion laſted not long; for in a little time <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Body was found and taken up; and after it had for a while been expos'd to the Publick View, near the place where he fell in, it was, by the order of <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> carri'd to the Main Ocean, and there Buried in the Waves, though ſome indeed falſly gave out, that it was hang'd on a Gibbet, which Ignominy, though the Perſon deceas'd had very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, yet it wou'd have look'd more like the Vain Efforts of an Impotent Malice, in Executing a Dead Man, than the Juſt Puniſhment of a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal.</p>
            <p>Now were the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> perfectly free from all Fears and Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the Morning after the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate being Aſſembled, ſent <hi>Benedict Centurio,</hi> and <hi>Dominic Doria,</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with <hi>Andrew</hi> on the loſs of his Nephew <hi>Jannetin,</hi> and to conduct him back to the City; where, all Tumults being appeas'd, <hi>Benedict
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60048:114"/>Gentile</hi> a Perſon of known Prudence and Integrity, and much belov'd for his Candid and Affable Behaviour, was choſen Duke of the Republick of <hi>Genoua.</hi> As ſoon as the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> found themſelves releas'd from thoſe exceſſive Fears which had lately poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd them, and ſaw their Publick Affairs again reſtor'd to their former Channel, of an undiſturb'd Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, they began to reflect on the greatneſs of their paſt Dangers; which appearing much more Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable now that they were calmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and conſider'd, than when the General Confuſion hindred them from thinking of any thing, but how to eſcape or ſurmount the particular Danger that at that inſtant Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, they were inclin'd to be of Opinion, that the Terms of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation lately granted by the Republick, were not only too gentle, but alſo might be unſafe and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable. This occaſion'd a long Debate in the Senate, many of them being of the contrary Opinion, but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60048:114"/>at laſt all Doubts were ſo throughly clear'd, and all Objections ſo fully anſwer'd, that it being put to the Vote, it was Reſolv'd, <hi>Nemine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente,</hi> That the Publick Faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Conſpirators ought not to retard the Executing on them the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to their Villainy. This their Reſolution was grounded on the following Reaſons: That the Pardon lately granted had paſſed in an Aſſembly, where there was not the Number of Senators requiſite by the Conſtitutions of <hi>Genoua,</hi> to give this or any other Publick Act a ſufficient Validity: That a Promiſe extorted from any Man by Fear or Neceſſity was not at all Obligatory: And what greater and juſter Fears cou'd any on ebe ſenſible of, than thoſe they had lately felt, when they ſaw the Republick in ſuch extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of an irrecoverable Ruin? That the Crime of High-Treaſon was in all reſpects ſo Hainous, that no Plea could be allow'd of for the mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Puniſhment: That 'tis
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60048:115"/>hardly poſſible to invent Tortures ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere enough for the Betrayers of their Countrey to ſuffer: And that ſo remarkable an Example of Impunity, when the Villainy had been ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and the Conſequences of it had like to have been ſo Fatal, wou'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably encourage others in the like Attempts. On theſe Grounds they declar'd their Capitulation with the Conſpirators to be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> invalid, and that being thus ſet aſide, they form'd Proceſſes againſt the chief of thoſe who were concern'd in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Rebellion. The Palaces of <hi>John Lewis</hi> Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, and by the Emperour's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent divided into ſeveral Houſes for Merchants, and other Private Men, and Leas'd out as the Senate thought moſt proper for the increaſing their Revenue: <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s <note n="(*)" place="margin">La caſa de <hi>Fieſchi</hi> all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violata.</note> Palace in the Street call'd <hi>L'Inviolata,</hi> a large, Princely, and Magnificent Stucture, was demoliſh'd and rais'd even to the very Foundations: <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Three
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60048:115"/>Brothers, and <hi>Verrina,</hi> who were look'd upon as the Prime Contrivers and Managers of the Conſpiracy, were declar'd Traytors and Rebels: As for other Perſons concern'd in it, they being adjudg'd only Acceſſaries and Abettors of the Fact, were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them by Name Condemn'd to Baniſhment for Fifty Years.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ottobuoni Fieſchi,</hi> not content with the ſecure retreat he enjoy'd at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> came back a while after to <hi>Mirandola,</hi> and by his frequent Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys from the <hi>French</hi> Army, which then lay Encamp'd thereabouts, into <hi>France,</hi> and his returns thither again, gave the Republick juſt occaſion to ſuſpect that there was ſome new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign carrying on againſt them. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Fieſchi</hi> having Lodg'd himſelf in <hi>Montobbio,</hi> and <hi>Verrina</hi> being come back to him with ſeveral others of his Adherents, he made it his buſineſs to Fortifie the Caſtle, and to lay in vaſt Stores of Ammunition and Proviſion. This gave ſo great an Alarm to the Senate, that having conſulted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60048:116"/>they were all of Opinion (as he was likewiſe) that it was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for them to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that Fort. It ſtands juſt at the back of the City, and beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural Advantages for ſtrength, its high ſituation made it formidable to the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> as being a place able to do them a great deal of Miſchief, if that Neſt of Traytors that had ſhelter'd themſelves there, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the <hi>French</hi> to make uſe of it, towards the recovery of their former Power in <hi>Genoua;</hi> which could not be compaſſed without the Ruin of their preſent Conſtitution. For theſe Reaſons therefore the Senate ſent <hi>Panſa</hi> again to Count <hi>Jerome Fieſchi,</hi> to try if he could perſwade him, and thoſe of his Family who had any Intereſt in the Reverſion, to ſell it to the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> on ſuch Terms as ſhou'd be agreed on at a Treaty between both Parties. But <hi>Fieſchi</hi> having but a ſmall ſtock of Prudence, and perhaps being puffed up with a vain Opinion of Succeſs from the Liberal Promiſes wherewith
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60048:116"/>the <hi>French</hi> had buoy'd him up, he did not only deny to comply with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate's Propoſal, but alſo, as if he had ſtudi'd to increaſe the Jealouſies they had of him, and to haſten his own Ruin, he told <hi>Pauſa,</hi> That he kept the Fort for the Service of a far greater Prince than himſelf, meaning the <hi>French</hi> King. This Anſwer ſo ſurpriz'd the <hi>Genoueſes,</hi> that after many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Meſſages ſent to <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Declarations againſt his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they reſolv'd to try if they could out him by force. In order hereunto they ſent ſeveral Companies of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with a good Train of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, under the Command of <hi>Auguſt in Spinola,</hi> an Experienc'd Captain, to beſiege the Fort, which, after having hold out for ſome time, was forc'd to Capitulate, but could obtain no better Terms, than that <hi>Jerome Fieſchi</hi> and his Adherents ſhou'd ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at diſcretion. This dedition of theirs occaſion'd many Diſputes in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> which were at firſt whiſper'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, till being debated in the Senate,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60048:117"/>both ſides of the Queſtion found its reſolute Aſſertors both in that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and in all Publick Meetings. When it was propos'd in the Senate, what ſhould be done with <hi>Jerome Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſchi,</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners, the Houſe divided upon it, ſome were for Pardoning, and others were for Execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſpirators. And, (as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens when any thing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated by Men that are bigotted to their Opinions,) every one defended his own Sentiments with ſo much Zeal, and Animoſity, that laying aſide all thoughts of Moderation between both, ſome aggravated the Fact as the moſt Execrable Parricide that ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and others repreſented it as the conſequences of Juvenile Raſhneſs and Levity, ſeverely enough puniſh'd by the Death of Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> and the other Penalties I have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, and therefore not deſerving any farther Cenſure. This Party had ſo well exerted their Eloquence, in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Clemency even to an exceſs, ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it a Quality abſolutely neceſſary
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60048:117"/>for thoſe that ſit at the Helm of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and in extenuating the Crimes of the Conſpirators, calling their deſign the effects of the late Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi>'s Ambitious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Temper, and the Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs of his Brothers who were very Young, that they had almoſt gain'd their Point, and got it reſov'd that they ſhou'd be acquitted. But <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> hearing of what Vote was like to paſs, and being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly griev'd, that the Traytors had ſo ſtrong a Party even in the Senate-Houſe, who ſeem'd rather Betrayers of their Countrey, than ſuch Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots as deſerv'd a place in that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, he came thither, and diſcours'd to them ſo excellently on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that he turn'd the Scales to the Juſter ſide: And without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, it was Reſolv'd <hi>Nemine Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicente,</hi> That <hi>Jerome Fieſchi,</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners, ſhould be put to Death: Which was accordingly Executed upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:60048:118"/>Thus the Conſpiracy of <hi>John Lewis</hi> Count <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> which had ſo much Affrighted and Diſturb'd <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> ended at laſt in the Ruin of himſelf, his Family, and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Had it prov'd Succeſsful, and Advanc'd him to the Power he ſo much aim'd at, of being abſolute Prince of <hi>Genoua,</hi> yet it is my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that he could not have long enjoy'd the Fruits of his Proſperous Villainy. For (to ſay nothing of the Intereſts of ſeveral Princes in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and particularly of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) the <hi>Genoueſes</hi> cannot bear the heavy Yoke of Servitude. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although ſome Rich Men, of the inferiour Rank of Citizens, growing Proud and Turbulent, have always had a Pique againſt the Nobility, and have been ready to join with any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Tumult, or Foreign Force, that pretended to diveſt them of their Authority; nevertheleſs the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace in general, who Enjoy the Eaſe and Tranquillity of Living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Moderate Government, cannot
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60048:118"/>hanker after ſo great Change as is that of a Free Republick, into a Deſpotick Monarchy. 'Tis true, the <hi>Plebeians</hi> of <hi>Genoua</hi> have ſometimes Revolted out of their Natural Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; ſometimes out of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Envy at the Wealth of ſome particular Men; ſometimes out of an inſatiable deſire of Revenge on ſome Perſon, Family, or Party, whom they Hated: Yet nevertheleſs I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find by their Annals, that any of theſe Revolts ever ended in the loſs and extinction of their Liberty, but only in changing their Governours, and in making ſome ſmall alterations in the Form of their Government. As for Example, the Governours whom they receiv'd from <hi>France,</hi> and from the Dukes of <hi>Milan,</hi> never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Act as Abſolute Princes, or to be Obey'd without Reſerve.

Nor did the <hi>French</hi> King's Entry into <hi>Genoua</hi> with a Victorious Army, or his Building Fortreſſes almoſt inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnable, accompliſh his Deſign of Governing the Republick after the <hi>French</hi> manner. For the innate Love of Freedom, always inſpir'd this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with an undaunted Courage and irreſiſtible Vigour, in oppoſing any Foreign Force whenever they grew Jealous of it; and beſides this, thoſe few Eminent Citizens that were Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, had ſo ſlender grounds for their Diſſatisfaction, that 'twas a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie matter, in times of common danger, to ſweeten their Tempers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Mutual Reconciliation with each other, and an entire Affection to their Fundamental Conſtitution. For although the being excluded from the Honours and Dignities of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, (whereunto nevertheleſs by a Law peculiar to <hi>Gennua,</hi> call'd <hi>The Law of Aſcription,</hi> there is a way left open for Deſerving Men,) and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60048:120"/>the being ſometimes ſubjected to the Inſolences of a Proud and Indiſcreet Senator, may ſeem a great Hardſhip and Misfortune, yet if with this are balanc'd the many Advantages flowing from a freedom and ſecurity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and the many Privileges and Liberties enjoy'd in the Chief City of ſo Wealthy a Republick, the cauſe of Complaint, if there be any, is extreamly Minute and Inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
