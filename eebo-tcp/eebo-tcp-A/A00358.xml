            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therfore I were ryghte moche vncourtoys / if that I in so sorowfull a chance wolde warne you his father to make lamentation / whan I that am but a straunger can nat chose but wepe &amp; wayle. Ye myght well thinke me rude and vntaught / if I wolde go about to heale your gresse / whan I my selfe had nede of a phisitian: if I wolde lette you his father to wepe / whan the teares stylle abundauntlye trykell downe from myne eien.</p>
            <p>And all be it / that the ilke stroke of

And for what cause shulde ye nat clene forgette it? seinge that the space of a fewe dayes wyll cause idiottes so to do / me thynketh reason shulde persuade an excellent wyse man.

For who is nat ware (excepte he that myndeth nothynge) that he is borne vnder suche a condition / that whan so euer god wyll call hym: he muste forth with nedes departe hence?

For loke that ye esteme me nowe delyuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the yuels / what so euer they be that maye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce a mortall man in his lyfe: of whiche your longe &amp; robustous lyfe (for a great parte) hath experience. And though that I be nat with you / with lowly obeisa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to do you seruice / 
<pb facs="tcp:26128:20"/>
yet may I be a sure &amp; an effectuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate for you before the high maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of god. And finally / howe small a thynge is hit / that deuideth our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation &amp; familiaritie? Nowe loke that you so endeuour your selfe / that whan ye haue well and vertuouslye passed the course of your lyfe / that ye maye than at the houre of dethe be founde worthy to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed hither.</p>
            <p>If that your sonne (I saye) shulde saye these wordes to vs: myghte we nat well be ashamed thus to lament and mourne as we do?</p>
            <p>with these maner of reasons I am wonte to ease the greffe of myn owne mynde: of the whiche I wolde that you shulde be part taker / nat all only that ye haue any great nede of those remedies: but I demed it agreable / that ye shulde be partaker of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation / of whose sorowe I was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiner. But briefly to conclude all that
<pb facs="tcp:26128:20"/>
hath ben at length reasoned: by this maner meane / ye shall aswage the smartynge sorowe of your mynde.</p>
            <p>My so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne is deed: ye begotte a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall creature. I haue loste a great ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well: ye haue yelded hit agayne to hym that frelye gaue hit you. It is a right greuous thing to be thus desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: It shulde be the lighter borne / that may be redressed by some mene. He hath lefte me his father alone co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles. what dothe it auayle to wepe and wayle for that that can nat be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied? or why mourne you for that / the whiche chaunceth to so manye thousandes as well as to you? Alas I can nat chose but wepe for the deth of my sonne: ye but he that diethe well / dothe in no wyse perysshe. But he died to sone: He that diethe well / diethe nat to sone. He dyed longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his daye was come: There is no man that hath a daye certayne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb facs="tcp:26128:21"/>
vnto hym. He decessed in his flourynge youthe: It is than best to dye whan to lyue it is moste swete. He died a very yonge man: So is he withdrawen from the mo yuels and troubuls of this lyfe. I haue loste the beste childe that any man coude haue: Be gladde that ye had suche one. He departed out of this worlde an innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: No deth shulde be more desired and lesse bewayled. Ye but it is nat lefull for me the meane whyle to haue fruition with my sonne: Yes in your mynde you may: and within shorte space you and he to gether bodye and soule shall ioye and take pleasure. If ye knowe any better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies than these / of gentylnes let me here them: if ye do nat / than vse these with me. And thus fare ye wel / which your so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne also wold ye shuld.</p>
