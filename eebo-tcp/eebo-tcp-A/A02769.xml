            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WHat Church is this? Christs Church. Who builds it?</l>
               <l>Mr. <hi>George Herbert,</hi> Who assisted it? </l>
               <l>Many assisted: who, I may not say,</l>
               <l>So much contention might arise that way.</l>
               <l>If I say Grace gave all, Wit straight doth thwart,</l>
               <l>And sayes all that is there is mine: but Art</l>
               <l>Denies and sayes ther's nothing there but's mine:</l>
               <l>Nor can I easily the right define.</l>
               <l>Divide: say, Grace the matter gave, and Wit</l>
               <l>Did polish it, Art measured and made sit</l>
               <l>Each severall piece, and fram'd it all together.</l>
               <l>No, by no means: this may not please them neither.</l>
               <l>None's well contented with a part alone,</l>
               <l>When each doth challenge all to be his owne:</l>
               <l>The matter, the expressions, and the measures,</l>
               <l>Are equally Arts, Wits, and Graces treasures.</l>
               <l>Then he that would impartially discusse</l>
               <l>This doubtfull question, must answer thus:</l>

               <l>Humble thy selfe, and God will lift thee up;</l>
               <l>Those that exalt themselves, he casteth down:</l>
               <l>The hungry he invites with him to sup,</l>
               <l>And cloaths the naked with his robe and Crown.</l>
               <l>Think not thou hast what thou from him would'st have;</l>
               <l>His labour's lost, if thou thy self canst save. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Pride is the prodigalitie of grace,</l>
               <l>Which casteth all away by griping all:</l>
               <l>Humilitie is thrift, both keeps its place,</l>
               <l>And gaines by giving, rises by its fall.</l>
               <l>To get by giving, and to loose by keeping,</l>
               <l>Is to be sad in mirth, and glad in weeping.</l>

               <l>God will have all thou hast; thy minde, thy will,</l>

               <l>He that sets forth towards Heaven, and doth sit</l>
               <l>Down by the way, will be found short at last.</l>
               <l>Be constant to the end, and thou shalt have</l>

               <l>Prize not thine own too high, nor under-rate</l>

            <head>¶ Inundations.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>WE talke of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood as of a wonder;</l>
               <l>And so we may:</l>
               <l>The Scrptures say,</l>
               <l>The waters did prevaile. the hils were under,</l>
               <l>And nothing could be seen but sea.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And yet there are two other sloods surpasse</l>
               <l>That flood as farre,</l>
               <l>As heaven one starre:</l>
               <l>Which many men regard as little as</l>
               <l>The ordinariest things that are.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The one is <hi>sinne,</hi> the other is <hi>salvation:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And we must need</l>
               <l>Confesse indeed</l>
               <l>That either of them is an <hi>inundation,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That doth the <hi>deluge</hi> farre exceed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In <hi>Noahs</hi> food he and his houshold liv'd;</l>
               <l>And there abode</l>
               <l>A whole Ark-load</l>
               <l>Of other creatures, that were then repriev'd,</l>
               <l>All safely on the waters rode.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when sinne came, it overflowed all,</l>
               <l>And left none free:</l>
               <l>Nay, even he</l>
               <l>That knew no sinne, could not release my thrall;</l>
               <l>But that he was made sinne for me.</l>
            </lg>

               <pb facs="tcp:4076:17"/>
               <l>And when salvation came, my Saviours blood</l>
               <l>Drown'd sinne againe</l>
               <l>With all its traine</l>
               <l>Of evils; overflowing them with good,</l>
               <l>With good that ever shall remaine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh! let there be one other inundation:</l>
               <l>Let grace overflow</l>
               <l>In my soule so,</l>
               <l>That thankfulnesse may levell with salvation,</l>
               <l>And sorrow sinne may overgrow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then will I praise my Lord and Saviour so,</l>
               <l>That Angels shall</l>
               <l>Admire mans fall;</l>
               <l>When they shall see Gods greatest glory grow,</l>
               <l>Where Satan thought to root out all.</l>
