            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>disposed persons, to publish this treatise, I haue thought good to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the same to your Maiestie, as the chiefe patron and defender of the faith and Gospell of Christ (vpon earth) against Antichrist and his adherents. For hereby not onely your royall courage may be stirred vp, and your godly resolution in oppugning Antichrist (according to the prophecies of the scripture, foretelling the dutie of Christian Princes in this behalfe) more and more confirmed: but also it may most euidently appeare to all men, that vpon most iust and weighty considerations, you and your people renounce all communion with the Pope and church of Rome, and by all good meanes doe set our selues against them. For if the Pope be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ (which is prooued in this Booke) &amp; consequently the church of Rome, the whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and synagogue of Antichrist: the papists, (who call themselues Catholicks, and vs Heretiques) the limmes of Antichrist; the religion and doctrine of popery, the mysterie of iniquitie and meere Antichristianisme: it followeth necessarily, that Christian princes are not to tolerate either the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of papists or their persons within their dominions. The reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deu. 13. 1. 5</note> 
               <hi>of papistry being a Catholick Apostasie from God, consisting not onely in respect of the worship, of manifold superstion and most grosse idolatrie; but also in respect of the doctrine, of many hundred Antichristian errours and doctrines of diuels. The persons of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick-papists, being Catholick heretiques and reuolters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, members of Antichrist, palpable idolatours; many of them (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Seminarie priests and Iesuites) perswaders of others to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and apostasie from God. Not to speake of the treason against Christian Princes which is enclosed in the bowels of popery, and bosomes of papists. For they teach that all Christian Princes who acknowledge not the Pope for their supreame head and Lord, (as no true Christians doe) are Schismaticks at the least, and</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:25487:6"/>
               <hi>consequently that the Pope hath authoritie to depose them, and to absolue their subiects from their allegiance: and that the Pope when he proceedeth to the sentence of excommunication and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of them (as he did against your sister of blessed memorie Queene</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and doth, so oft as he dareth, against others) he doth not erre in his definitiue sentence. And therefore (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they pretend to the contrarie) it is certaine, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the marked slaues of Antichrist, wholy deuoted to his will, are also willing and ready (when meanes and opportunitie faile not) to put in execution his Antichristian censures, and diuellish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signements. In consideration whereof, Christian Princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are not onely bound to come out of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and to renounce</hi>

For which cause I tooke vpon me in my publicke readings not long since, to intreat of this maine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie betwixt vs and the church of Rome, concerning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. But because my speech could prosite onely those that heard me, I haue for diuerse causes thought good by writing to make the benefit of my labours co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon: First, that by this means
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25487:8"/>
the Papists which be tractable may be reclaimed: Secondly, that those which bee obstinate among them may bee confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Thirdly, that Protestants and professours of the trueth which be found &amp; resolute, may be more &amp; more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed: last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; especially that those which be weake &amp; wauering may be stayed, and preserued from falling into that fearfull iudgement, which as the Lord hath threatned 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. against vnsound professours in these latter times, so hath it within these few years fallen vpon very many, who hauing by the great mercy of God beene deliuered out of the more then Egyptian bondage of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist: and being set in the way toward the celestiall <hi>Canaan</hi> and land of promise, seemed with the vnthankfull <hi>Israelites</hi> to be wearie of the celestiall Manna the foode of their soules, and desired to be againe among the flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For seeing they had not receiued the loue of the trueth that they might be saued, therefore God hath sent vpon them the efficacie of errour <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 10. 11. 12.</note> that they should belieue lies (meaning the lies of Antichrist) that all they might be condemned, which belieued not the truth, but delighted in vnrighteousnes, meaning the mysterie of iniquitie wherof he had spoken <hi>verse.</hi> 7. that is to say, Antichristianisme or <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 7.</note> Popery.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And that we may proceed in order, we are first to set down the state of this controuersie, which in deed is the cheese of all controuersies betwixt vs and the Papists, and of the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. For if this were once throughly cleared, all others would easily be decided. Our assertion therefore in few words is this, <hi>That the Pope of Rome, who is as it were the God of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, is that grand Antichrist, who according to the prophecies of the holy Ghost in the Scriptures, was to be reuealed in these latter times.</hi> The Papists hold the contrary. And whereas we say and proue that their Lord God the Popes holinesse in Antichrist, they affirme that our assertion is blasphemie, and our arguments do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. <note place="margin">Rhemist. in 2. Thess. 2. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min lib. 3. de Pont.

                  <hi>this, that as the name Christ is taken two waies, to wit, commonly and properly, so also the name Antichrist.</hi> The name <hi>Christ</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly belongeth to all that are annointed of God; and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the speciall calling of a King, Prophet or Priest, or to the general calling of a Christian. And in this sence it is taken either <note place="margin">Psal. 105. 15.</note> more largely for the whole body of those that professe the name of Christ, whereof some are members of Christ in title and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 12.</note> onely; or more strictly for the society of the elect the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of heauen, who haue <hi>the marke of God,</hi> and are not only <note place="margin">Apoc. 9. 4.</note> in shewe and profession, but also indeed and in truth members of the mysticall body of Christ.

                  </gap> the name Christ belongeth to Iesus the sonne of God, who was <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with the oyle of gladnesse aboue all his fellowes,</hi> and is the <note place="margin">Psalm. 45. 7.</note> head, after a general maner, of all Christians, but more specially of the elect. In like sort the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary name Antichrist belongeth commonly to all that be enemies to Christ; and those either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen &amp; professed enemies as the Iewes, Turkes, Infidels (in which sence the worde is not vsed in the Scripture) or else couert, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing themselues Christians, and vnder the name and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, oppugning Christ and his truth.

The head of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian <note place="margin">Apoc. 17.</note> body &amp; catholicke apostasie, we hold to be the Pope of Rome; and consequently that the Pope is that graund Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, whom the holy Ghost in the Scriptures hath described vnto vs; And that he <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is called the Antichrist, not onely

because he is the head of the Antichristian body, but also because he being in profession the vicar of Christ, is in deed <hi>Aemulus Christi,</hi> that is, an <hi>enemy opposed vnto Christ, in emulation of like honour,</hi> as if we should say, a counter-Christ, as the worde Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ doth also signifie.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But when we say that the Pope is Antichrist, wee meane not this or that Pope, howsoeuer some of them haue beene more notorious Antichrists then others: as for example <hi>Siluester</hi> the 2. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. <hi>aliâs Hildebrand, Boniface</hi> 8. <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. <hi>aliâs</hi> 24. <hi>Alexander</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the whole rowe or rabble of them, from <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3. downeward. For although the Antichrist be but one person, yet he is not one as Christ the head of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian body, is one, Christ because he liueth for euer hath no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours, and therefore is one in nature and number, as being one singular &amp; definit person. The head of the Antichristian body, which is to continue to the end of the worlde, is continued not in one singular and definit person, but in a succession of many, who are mortall and momentary; which successiuely haue bene, are, or shalbe the heads of the catholicke apostasie: of any wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of indefinitely, or of all commonly, the worde Antichrist is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. For euen as the Pope or vicar of Christ according to the Popish conceipt, is one person not in number and nature, but by lawe and institution, one at once ordinarily, but many succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely; so Antichrist is not one singular person, but a succession of Antichristian Popes, which we begin at <hi>Boniface</hi> the thirde. Because he with much adoe, about the yeare of our Lord 607. obteined from the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> and al his successours since, haue challenged vnto them, the Antichristian title of <hi>the head of the catholicke or vniuersall Church, or oecumenicall &amp; vniuersall Bishop.</hi> Which title of blasphemy, as <hi>Gregory</hi> calleth it, befitting <note place="margin">Lib. 4. epist 32. &amp; 34. &amp; 38.</note> him that resembleth Lucifer in pride, when as <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bishop of Constantinople had challenged not long before, to wit, about the yeare 600. in the time of <hi>Mauritius,</hi> whom <hi>Phocas</hi> cruelly murdered, <hi>Gregory</hi> the great then Pope of Rome affirmed confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently (for so he saith, <hi>Fidenter dico)</hi> that therein he was the forerunner of Antichrist, who was now euen at hand. <hi>Omnia e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim</hi>

Now this is a principle in the church of Rome, that the Pope, (especially such a Pope as <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, speaking definit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if this be true (as they may not deny, the Pope being the foundation of all their trueth) then must they needs confesse that Antichrist was come, almost a thousand yeers since, and that the Pope their prince of priests, who not onely succeedeth <hi>Iohn</hi> of Constantinople in that Antichristian title, but also farre exceedeth him in all Antichristian pride, challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a soueraigne and vniuersall authority not onely aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops and priests, but also aboue all kings and Emperours, is that Antichrist.</p>

               <p n="6">6 <hi>Vnto whomesoeuer the prophecies of holy scripture descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Antichrist the head of the Antichristian body, doe wholy and onely agree, hee is that graund Antichrist who is foretold in the scriptures. Vnto the Pope of Rome the prophecies of holy scripture concerning Antichrist the head of the Antichristian body, do who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and onely agree: therefore the Pope of Rome is that graund An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist which is foretold in the scriptures.</hi> The proposition I take for graunted. For seeing the holy ghost hath of purpose in diuerse places of the scripture taken vpon him fully and sufficiently to describe Antichrist, and that to this end, that he might bee knowne; we neede not doubt, but that this description of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is so perfect and so proper vnto him, as to whome that des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription agreeth not, he is not Antichrist: &amp; contrarywise whom it wholy and onely fitteth, hee must be held and acknowledged to be that Antichrist. All the controuersie therefore is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the assumption, namely, whether the descriptions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in the scriptures agree to the Pope or not. Antichrist is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the holy ghost, especially in three places, viz. in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of the second epistle to the Thessalonians, in the thirteenth of the Reuelation from the eleuenth verse to the end, and in the seuenteenth chapter of the same booke. For I omitte those places in the prophecie of <hi>Daniel</hi> which vsually are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, (because they speake properly of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 7. &amp; 8. &amp; 11. &amp; 12.</note> who was but a type of Antichrist, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also confesseth,) and the ninth of the Apocalypse, because it is by some expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de pont.

               <p n="7">7 And that the description of Antichrist in the scriptures fitly agreeth to the Pope, it appeareth by this induction. For whereas all the arguments and notes whereby Antichrist is described in the scriptures, may be reduced to these heads, to wit, the place or seat where we are to find him; the time, when we were to looke for him; his condition and qualities, that he is an aduersary op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vnto Christ in aemulation of like honour, a man of sinne in generall, and more particularly an horrible Idolatour: his actions
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25487:10"/>
and passions, that is, such things as he shall either do or suffer: I will make it euident by the helpe of God (whose all-seeing spirit I humbly beseech to guide me into the truth) that all and euery one of them doe so fitly and properly agree to the Pope of Rome, that in the descriptions of Antichrist in the scripture, the Pope may behold himselfe as it were in a glasse.</p>

                  <hi>Rome is Mysticall Babylon, spoken of in the seuenteenth and eighteenth of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse. Therefore Rome is the seat of Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the proposition, you are to vnderstand that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon in the scriptures is taken sometimes literally, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mystically: literally, for Babylon either in Chaldaea, or in Egypt. Babylon in Chaldaea was the Metropolis or imperiall city of the Babylonian and Assyrian Monarchy. Babylon in AEgypt is called Babylis and Cayrus, of which some vnderstand the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Peter</hi> to speake 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 5. 13. Babylon mysticall in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse, is the seat or chiefe city of Antichrist, resembling the <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 13. Apoc. 17. 5.</note> Assyrian Babylon in pride, idolatry, filthinesse, and especiallie in most cruell persecution of the church of God. And for the same causes <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. 8. is called spiritually, Sodom and Egypt. Sodom, <note place="margin">Ap. 11. 8.</note> for pride and filthinesse: Egypt, for idolatrie and for cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Israel of God. And as the church of Christ in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse is called Ierusalem mysticallie, or the holy city: so the church &amp; especially the Metropolis or chiefe city of Antichrist, is mysticallie called Babylon. This as it is the receiued opinion of the faithfull, so may it euidently be gathered out of the seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and eighteenth of Apocalypse, which without all doubt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25487:11"/>
are prophecies concerning Antichrist, and the Antichristian city and seat, as the Papists themselues often confesse. <note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 3. de P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And the argument which our Rhemists bring to proue their assertion, is without sence, to wit in their annotation vpon <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. 21. where the Angell throwing a great stone into the Sea, saith, with such violence shall that great city Babylon be throwne, and bee found no more. <hi>By this</hi> (say they) <hi>it seemeth cleere, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle meaneth not any one city, but the vniuersall company of the reprobate, which shall perish in the day of iudgement.</hi> But I answere, that the destruction of the vniuersall company of the reprobate in the day of Iudgement, is described afterward chap. 20. 11. And this destruction, as appeareth plainely by the circumstances of the text, especially in the ninth verse, and those which follow vnto the eighteenth, shall be before the day of Iudgement, and therefore is not the destruction of the vniuersall company of the wicked. For if the vniuersall destruction of the wicked were here signified, then none of the wicked should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uruiue after this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to lament the same, as there shall, vers. 9. 10. 17. And that the vniuersall societie of the wicked is not meant by Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, euidently appeareth by the whole discourse, chapters 17. and 18, where the holy ghost speaketh of a city ruling ouer the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth, situated vpon seauen hilles, sitting vpon many waters, that is, ruling ouer many people, nations and languages, with whome all princes and inhabitants of the earth haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fonication, whose destruction is bewailed of all sorts of the wicked, none of which people or princes, or wicked ones that mourne for her, should be of the vniuersall company of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate (as vndoubtedly they are) if Babylon signified the whole number of the wicked. And whereas they alleadge <hi>Ierem.</hi> 52, where onely the history of the Babylonian captiuity is recorded, to prooue that Babylon signifieth the whole number of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: it argueth, that they haue not so much as any shewe of reason to obiect against the truth of this proposition, namely that mysticall Babylon is the seat, or as they speake, the See of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, <note place="margin">See<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. But let vs come to the assumption, <hi>viz,</hi> that Rome is mysticall <hi>Babylon:</hi> which I will proue by three arguments.

This beast is said to haue 7. heads: which the holy Ghost expoundeth two waies. 7. <hi>capita vrbis, the</hi> 7. <hi>heads of the citie,</hi> are 7. hilles: the 7. heads of the Empire or people subiect to Rome (which also are compared to waters whereon the whore sitteth) are 7. kings, <note place="margin">Apo. 17. 1. 15.</note> that is seuen seuerall regiments, or heads of gouerment, (for so the holy Ghost elsewhere calleth them,) wherby the Empire or <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 21.</note> people of Rome hath at diuers times beene gouerned: to wit, Kings (which also were seuen.) Consuls, Decemuirs, Tribunes (not <hi>tribuni plebis,</hi> but <hi>tribunt militum consulari potestate),</hi> Dictators, Emperours, and Popes. Now the Apostle doth not say, the seuen heads are seuen hilles, and the seuen hilles are seuen Kings: but the 7. heads are seuen hilles, and they (namly seuen heads) are (also) seuen kings, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also acknowledgeth.

                  </gap>y the Rhemists, that the great Antichrist shall haue his seate there. And we doe not denie saith the authour of the Wardword, but that Rome is Babylon. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not onely say it, but proue it. How then? Forsooth wee must distinguish of Rome. For Rome is either Heathenish or Christened. Heathenish Rome vnder the persecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours was <hi>Babylon:</hi> But Rome Christened is the Apostolicke See, and as it were the Ierusalem of the Christians. But this cuasion of theirs, howsoeuer they please themselues in it, is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous and absurde, as shall appeare by these reasons. For <note place="margin">1.</note> first, if Rome be <hi>Babylon,</hi> as now at the length they confesse, and consequently the seate of Antichrist, as they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with any shewe of reason: I would faine know of them, whether vnder the heathenish Emperours Rome could be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25487:13"/>
the seat of Antichrist, because Antichrist did then sitte in Rome, or because he was to sitte there after the Heathenish Emperours were remoued. If they say, because he sate there then, their answere is ridiculous, and contrary to all that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues hold concerning Antichrist. Therefore they must needs confesse, that Rome is called Babylon and the seat of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ; not because Antichrist sate there whiles it was heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe, but because he was to sitte there after the Emperours were remooued.</p>
               <p n="8">8 And that the holy ghost by Babylon doth not meane Heathenish Rome vnder the persecuting Emperours, either onely or principally, but Rome christened vnder the Pope, it may further appeare out of the whole discourse of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the seuenteenth and eighteenth of the Apocalypse. The whore of Babylon is the great city, which in the Apostles <note place="margin">2.</note> time, and since vnder the Popes, reigned ouer the kings of the earth; called a whore, and the mother of fornications: not onely because her selfe hath by spirituall fornications plaid the strumpet, according to that which is sayd of Ierusalem: <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delis ciuit as fact a est meretrix, The faithfull city is become an</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Esay. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>harlot:</hi> but also infected al kings and nations, subiect vnto her, with her superstition &amp; idolatry. But Rome heathenish, which neither dealt by whorish sleights and allurements, but by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall pollicy and power, neither had professed her selfe to bee the Church and spouse of Christ, could not so fitly be called an harlot, whereby is signified an adulterous and apostaticall state. And besides, Heathenish Rome for the most part per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to euery countrey their owne religion: and was so far from enforcing her religion vpon other nations subiect vnto her, that as in her was erected the Pantheon in honour of all the Gods (which <hi>Boniface</hi> the fourth hauing obtained of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>

Rosin. lib. 2. c. 9.</note> consecrated to the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and all the Saints) so shee admitted the idoles, religions, and superstitions allmost of all other countries, excepting the religions of the Egyptians and the Iewes, because they did not forsooth beseeme the maiesty of the Empire. But Popish Rome, of Bethel is become Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen, and of a faithfull city an harlot, exceeding all others in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25487:14"/>
whorish entisements, cousenages, impudencies, cruelties, and all filthines: insomuch that we may truely say with <hi>Mantuan, Roma est iam tota lupanar, Rome wholy is become a stewes:</hi> and with <hi>Petrarch,</hi> that shee is <hi>scelerum aetque dedecorum omnium sentina, The sinke and sewre of all villantes and shamefull practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi> and hath not onely plaid the harlot her selfe, but is become the mother of all fornications, that is, idolatry and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the fountaine of all other abhominations in the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world. With which the cup of her fornications inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth (which more argueth the sottishnes of the Romish religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) all kings and people that consent vnto her, and with fire &amp; sword, obtrudeth her superstitions and Idolatrous religion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all nations that they can make subiect to that See.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Againe, if <hi>Iohn</hi> had spoken of old Rome, which then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly persecuted the saints, then had he not spoken of a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">3.</note> (as he doth) neither would he so greatly haue wondred to <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 5. 7.</note> see the whore of Babylons eitheir idolatry or cruelty, against the Saints (as he doth vers. 6.) if by the whore were meant old Rome, whose Idolatrie and crueltie to <hi>Iohn</hi> was not strange. And further that the holy ghost by Babylon meaneth Popish <note place="margin">4.</note> Rome, it may be proued out of the rest of the 17. chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the 8. verse: where the Angell declareth vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> the mysterie of the beast, whereon the woman sitteth, which hath the 7. heads and ten horns.

To the which, as also to the Papacy (which is the second beast in the 13. of the Apocalypse) though they be either of them but seuerall heads of the beast (vers. 10, &amp; 11.) yet the holy ghost giueth the name of the beast. For this beast saith he, on which the woman sitteth, was &amp; is not, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25487:14"/>
shall arise out of the depth: and again, that it is the beast which was and is not, though it be. And vers. 11. hauing shewed that the 7. heads of this beast signifie both the imperiall seat stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on 7. hils, &amp; also 7. kings, that is, 7. chiefe gouernments: he saith, that this beast which was and is not, is the eight (namely head of gouernment, or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) and is one of the seauen, namely of Emperors. All which cannot be vnderstoode of the Romane Empire, as it was heathenish, but as it is Popish. For this head which had bene and after was not (for it lay voide from the time of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustulus</hi> vnto <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> the space of 325. yeers, viz, from the yeer 475, vnto the yeere 800) was after to arise (for so hee saith <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) being reuiued by the Pope, who was to put <note place="margin">Ap. 13.</note> life into the image of the former beast. For this Empire erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Pope, although it hath the name of the beast ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto it, yet it is but the image of the former beast, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not, in truth &amp; imperiall authority &amp; dominion, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Rome, although in title it be. And further it is said, that this beast is the 8. head, &amp; is one of the 7. which cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the heathenish Emperors but of the Popish. If therfore this beast whereupon the whore of Babylon sitteth, ruling &amp; guiding the same, as the rider doth the beast on which he sitteth, be not the old Empire but the new, erected by the Pope: then the whore of Babylon is not old Rome vnder the heathenish Emperors, but Rome christened vnder the Pope. But the first is true, therefore the last.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And siftly the ten homes (saith the Angel) which thou saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est are ten kings, that is, the chiefe gouernors of the ten prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">5.</note> or kingdomes, who before the dissolution of the Empire in <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 12.</note> the west, had not as yet receiued the kingdome; because they stil remained as proco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>suls or propraetors, that is deputies &amp; lief tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vnder the Emperor. But after the Empire was dissolued in the west, they receiued power as kings about the same time with the beast. i.

For albeit neither hee could raigne in Rome, nor they in the prouinces, by soueraign authority, while
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25487:15"/>
the Empire stood in the west, and flourished; yet when it was once decaied, (but especially when the Emperour also of the cast had by the Popes meanes lost his title in Italy and Rome, and was by him bereaued, as the authour of the booke called <hi>fasciculus temporum</hi> saith, of the westerne Empire) then he sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth on Rome, and a great part of Italie, and they on the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prouinces. And that these ten hornes are the heads of ten kingdomes, which together with the beast (meaning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ) shall diuide among them the Romane Empire, (for that is signified when it is saide that they receiue power as kings, that is, soueraigne authoritie, the same houre with the beast) it is the receiued opinion of the best writers. Yea <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himselfe saith, <hi>Ioannes dicit decem reges, qui sibi diuident Rom. imperium, odio habituros purpuratam meretricem. i.

And consequently, he speaketh of Rome as she should bee, not onely after the dissolution of the old Empire in the west, but also after the erection of the new, that is to say of Rome Popish.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Of these ten hornes it is further said, that they haue all <note place="margin">6.</note> one minde, being all of the same Popish religion, al of them <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 13.</note> with one consent wholie deuoted to the Pope, and sworne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

And before this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction the Empire was to be diuided into ten kingdomes, which first should ioyne with Antichrist, and afterward op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne him. Which is vtterly false of Rome heathenish, but yet is begunne to bee fulfilled of Rome Popishe, and will in due time be accomplished. And againe it is most plaine that <hi>Iohn</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25487:16"/>
confesse, was not to come whiles Rome was heathenish, but after the dissolution of the Romane Empire. And lastly, <hi>Hierome</hi> and other of the fathers, in whose times Rome was not Heathenish, doe notwithstanding call it <hi>Babylon.</hi> Not that <note place="margin">9.</note> then it was, or had beene before, but because it should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophecies of the holy Ghost, the seat of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, whose comming he and other of the fathers supposed not to be farre of: and therefore <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Marcella,</hi> vseth this argument as the principall to perswade her to come from Rome (which then was not Heathenish) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. These arguments might suffice to proue that not Rome Heathenish vnder the Emperours, but Rome Christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder the Popes, is mysticall <hi>Babylon</hi> the chiefe citie and See of Antichrist. But yet for better euidence of this trueth, and for the clearer manifestation of Antichrist, I will further proue vnto you, that Rome Christened and professing her selfe to be the Church of Christ, is the seate of Antichrist. For if Antichrist shall sitte at all in Rome, then shall hee sitte in Rome Christened professing her selfe to bee the Church of Christ. But he shall sitte in Rome (as hath beene proued in parte and shall further bee cleared) therefore in Rome christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and professing her selfe to be the Church of God. The proposition is built vpon this foundation, that Antichrist shall sitte in the Churche of God, and therefore if Antichrist shall sitte at Rome, he shall sitte in Rome professing her selfe the Church of God. Now then that Antichrist shall sitte in the Church of God, I proue by the testimonie of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming 2. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2. 4. that Antichrist shall sitte in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">2.

For first, the temple at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and citie it selfe, as it was a type of the church of Christ: so when the church of Christ was once plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the preaching of the gospell throughout the worlde,

to be the true church of God, then they can proue the temple of Antichrist at Ierusalem, where they say he should sit, to be <note place="margin">Of this see more in the 2. booke, &amp; 13. chap. §. 4. 5. &amp; 6.</note> the temple of God. It is sufficient that the church where Antichrist sitteth, hath bene the true church, and still is in title and profession; although in truth it bee but an Apostaticall church. Eor Antichrist, as he was to sit in the church, so he was to be the head of the Apostasie, and of those that fal from god: who notwithstanding (according to that exposition in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine)</hi> shall sit in <hi>templum Dei</hi> as though they alone were the true church of God.</p>
               <p n="16">16 But the Papists confirme their exposition, viz, that the temple of God signifieth the temple at Ierusalem, out of the <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 8.</note> eleuenth of the Apocalypse &amp; eight verse. <hi>Where Iohn sheweth</hi> (say they) <hi>That the bodies of Enoch and Elias being slaine by Antichrist, shall lie in the streets of Ierusalem.</hi> Whereunto I answere, that <hi>Iohn</hi> in that place neither speaketh of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> not yet of Ierusalem. And whether he speake of the persecution of Antichrist, there may be some doubt; because he seemeth verse. 2. and 7. to speake of the same persecution of the holy city that is the church, vnder the heathen; &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the persecuting Emperours, for 42. moneths, which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Apocalypse 13. 5. But supposing it to be vnderstood of Antichrist his persecution, let vs consider the force of their argument. <hi>Where the two witnesses of God are slayne by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, there is</hi> (say they) <hi>the seat of Antichrist: At Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem the two witnesses of God shall bee slaine, therefore at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem shall be the seat of Antichrist.</hi> The proposition they take for graunted, the which notwithstanding is not generallie true. For the two witnesses of God may bee slaine in that place by the authoritie and commaundement of Antichrist, where his proper seat is not. For as our Sauiour Christ was put to death, by the authority of the Romane Empire, at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, where notwithstanding was not the imperiall seat of the Emperour: So the witnesses of our Sauiour Christ might be slaine by the authority and commaundement of the Antichrist of Rome, either at Ierusalem or else where, where notwithstanding is not the proper seat of Antichrist, This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25487:18"/>
is sufficient to ouerthrow their whole argument. For if their proposition be not generally true, then their whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation from a particular proposition is mere sophistry.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Notwithstanding, their assumption is also to be denyed, because the holy ghost speaketh not of Ierusalem (as <hi>Hierome</hi> proueth) but of Rome, or rather of the Empire of Rome. <hi>Yea but</hi> (say they) <hi>Christ also was crucified where the two witnesses should bee slayne: at Ierusalem Christ was crucified, and not at Rome, therefore at Ierusalem the two witnesses should bee slayne.</hi> I answere to the assumption: Christ was crucified at Ierusalem, and in the great city also, that is to say, within the Romane Empire, wherein and by authoritie where of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ was put to death. In which sence the Rhemists seeme to apply this prophecy to Rome. <hi>If by the great city</hi> (say they) <hi>is meant any one city, it is most like to be old Rome, For by</hi>

                  <hi>the authoritie of the old Romane Empire Christ was put to death first.</hi> Whereunto I might adde, that euen in Rome it selfe Christ hath bene crucified in his members: and that within Ierusalem Christ was not crucified Heb. 13. 12. Now that Ierusalem is not here meant, but Rome, or rather, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, I proue; first, because it is called the great citie.

Now thirdly, if the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> doe signifie Rome christened, that yet notwithstanding it is not (as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>

But if Rome christened or Church of Rome be the whore of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> (as wee haue proued though our aduersaries should not confesse it) then is it so called because shee is an adulterous and apostaticall church, which hath fallen from Christ to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, whom in steed of Christ she acknowledgeth to be her husband and head: then is she the mother both of all fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 5.</note> that is of all superstitious and idolatrous worshippe, and also of al abominations, as <hi>Atheisme, Machiauellisme, Sodomy</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> heresies, with whom the Kings and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 2. 4.</note> of the earth haue committed fornication, being made drunke and intoxicated with the golden cuppe of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that is, of her glorious idolatries and Antichristian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: who as she is cloathed with Scarlet, so is she died red, and <note place="margin">Apoc 17. 4. 6.</note> drunke with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Iesu: as being that citie and church wherin the two witnesses of Christ are put to death. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.

Let vs see then whether the <hi>Iesuit</hi> be able to bring so much as a shew of reason against this truth.

But when as Christ shall begin to waste and to weaken him with the spirit of his mouth, that then these 10. Kings shall oppose themselues against the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian citie and the head thereof. Which, euent and experience in parte hath proued to bee true in some of these 10. Kings, as hath before beene shewed. From that place therefore wee <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> may reason thus; The purple harlot which the 10. Kings shall assault is the city of Antichrist. Rome is that purple harlot, as the aduersarie himselfe confesseth, therefore Rome is the citie of Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Their last refuge is this: that Rome Christian, where the Pope sitteth, doth not stande vpon 7. hilles, but is remoued from the seuen hilles into the plaine of <hi>Campus Martius:</hi> and that the Pope sitteth on the other side of the riuer vpon the mount <hi>Vatican. Saunders</hi> therefore thought it to bee but a childish argument to proue from the 7. hilles that the seate of Antichrist is at Rome. But we would knowe of him whether it be the same Rome where they say <hi>Peter</hi> sate or not. If it be the same, then it standeth on seuen hilles, if it bee not the same, how is it then the Apostolicke seate and chaire of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> True in deede it is, that in the time of the Emperours the <hi>Pomarium</hi> of the citie was enlarged, so that it enclosed a good parte of <hi>Campus Martius:</hi> and that since some more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:25487:20"/>
auncient partes of the citie being decaied, the greatest parte of priuate buildings stande in the plaine. Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euen to this day, the seuen hilles are enclosed within the walles of the citie, and vpon them there doe yet remaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides some of the Popes palaces and courts, diuers churches and houses of religion and other buildings of note: as that learned diuine of blessed memory D. <hi>Fulke</hi> particularly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">In Apoc. 17. 9.</note> in his answere to the <hi>Rhemists.</hi> Neither doth the enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the citie in one parte, and the decaying of it in another, proue it not to be the same citie. And although the Pope doth liue in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> or in any other pallace of his whersoeuer: yet who knoweth not, that Rome is the Papal or as they cal it the Apostolick seat, appointed as they <note n="a" place="margin">Rod. Cupers de eccles. pag. 37. num. 1.</note> say by Christ himself. Neither can the Pope as <note n="b" place="margin">Cupers dae eccles. p. 226. num. 16.</note> they teach chaunge his seate: or if he should, he should ceasse to be the successour of <hi>Peter.</hi> For whosoeuer is chosen Bishop of the citie of Rome, he (say they) is the successor of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the vicar of Christ, and Bishop of the world. And as Rome in generall is the Popes seat, or See; <note place="margin">Cupers pag. 37. num 4.</note> so more specially the cathedrall church of <hi>Laterane,</hi> whereof more properly the Pope is Bishop, as the husband of one wife. <note place="margin">Cupers. pag. 221. n. 31.</note> In which respect they say, that as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his successours bee the head of the whole church or vniuersitie of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, so the <hi>Laterane</hi> church being referred to other materiall <note place="margin">Cupers. pag. 106. num. 11.</note> churches, is the head of all churches of the world. Vnto this church was adioyned the chiefe pallace of the Pope, which was inhabited by them vntill the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9. as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> testifieth, that is to say 1400. yeares almost after <note place="margin">De 7. vrb. eecl.</note> Christ: howsoeuer since the time of <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. who lodged therein, it is within these last hundred yeares decaied.

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S from the place we gather the Pope to be Antichrist, because the seat of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is Rome christned, or professing her selfe the church of Christ: So the consideration of the time ioyned with that of the place, doth make this trueth much more euident. Rome Christned is the seate of Antichrist: but when doth Antichrist sitte, that is, raigne there? I answere that he could not exercise Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian dominion there, whiles the Emperours had their seat in Rome. But when the Emperours were remoued and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the West dissolued: then did Antichrist succeed them in the seat, that is, in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Rome. And this may be proued first, by the testimonie of S. <hi>Paule.</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>And then that outlaw,</hi> meaning Antichrist, <hi>shalbe reuealed.</hi> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 8.</note> is that? <hi>When he that hindereth shalbe taken out of the way.</hi> And who is that which hindereth the reuelation of Antichrist for a time, <hi>that he might be reuealed in his due time?</hi> Who this was, <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 6. 7.</note> the Apostle had told the <hi>Thessal.</hi> by word of mouth, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forbare for iust causes to tell them by writing which they knew already, to wit, that he might not incurre the needlesse <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 5. 6.</note> hatred of the Romanes. But that which he had told them, in all likelyhood, was continued in the church. For although this place in it selfe be most difficult, yet generally it is vnderstood of the Empire and Emperours of Rome by most of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers of the Church. <hi>Tertullian: who shall be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the way, but the Romane state? whose departure being diuided</hi>

                  <hi>the Empire of Rome, when it shall bee taken out of the way, then he</hi> (meaning Antichrist) <hi>shall come, and worthily. For whiles men shall be in awe of the Empire, none will hastily be brought in subiection to Antichrist. But when the Empire shall be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he shall seize vpon the vacancie, and shall challenge to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the Empire or rule both humane and diuine.

                  <hi>might be reuealed in his time: that is</hi> (saith he) <hi>what the cause is why Antichrist commeth not yet, you know very well. Neither could he plainelie say that the Romane Empire is to be destroyed, which the Emperours thinke is aternall. Wherefore according to the Apocalypse of Iohn, there is written in the forehead of the harlot cloathed with purple, a name of blasphemy, that is,</hi> Romae aeternae, <hi>to Rome aternal.</hi> And afterwards these words <hi>onelie he which holdeth now must hold vntill hee bee taken out of the way, and then that out law shall be reuealed,</hi> hee expoundeth thus, <hi>onelie that the Romane Empire which now holdeth</hi> (that is, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth) <hi>all nations, depart and be taken out of the way, and then Antichrist shall come.

                  <hi>that which letteth and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. And what is that? Many vnderstand the holy ghost, others the Romane Empire, whose iudgement is the better? For vntill that be dissolued, Antichrist shall not come. And for this cause blessed Paul spake so obscurelie, because he would not incur vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable enmitie with the Romans. For when they should heare that the Empire of the Romanes shall be dissolued, they would persecute him and al the faithful, as being such as looked for the dissolution of the Empire. But if he had spoken of the holy ghost, what letted him to haue said plainelie, that the grace of the holie ghost did hinder him that he should not appeare?</hi> To which we may adde, that in the sixt verse the Apostle speaketh in the newter gender, and in the seauenth in the masculine: the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25487:22"/>

                  </gap>) as he vseth to speak sometimes of Antichrist and wee of the Pope; although both by the one and the other is signified not one man, but a state or succession. <hi>Augustine</hi> in deede saith of <note place="margin">De ciuit.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 But what need I to be so diligent in gathering testimonies for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of this truth, seeing it is not only confirmed by the former assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for how could Antichrist raign in Rome while the Roman Emperors remaind or raignd there) but also is confessed by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself, namely that by this let, is to be vnderstood the Empire of Rome. Rather let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider whe ther the Empire that hindred, be taken out of the way, or not. <hi>Beliarmine</hi> vnderstandeth this taking away, of an vtter aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing <note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> of the Romane Empire, so that there should not remaine so much as the name of the Emperor or King of the Romanes. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he would proue that Antichrist is not yet come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Romane Empire is not yet abolished. Wee confesse that the Romane Empire which hindred the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist was to be dissolued, and also diuided among ten, that is many kings (for so this number of ten is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsed indefinitly): <note place="margin">Num. 14. 22. Iob. 19. 3. Nehem. 4. 12.</note> which is all that can be gathered either out of the scriptures or fathers. But that there should be such an vtter abolishment of the Romane Empire, as that there should not remain so much
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25487:22"/>
as the name or title of the Emperor or King of the Romanes, we do vtterly deny. It is sufficient that the Emperor was so far <note place="margin">See a. book. chap. 5.</note> forth taken out of the way as it hindred the Reuelation or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Antichrist, And so much the phrase of the Apostle seemeth to import, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> vntil hee be done out of the way, (or as the Rhemists themselues do read, <hi>vntill he be taken out of the way)</hi> as may appeare by conference of like places. Let vs then consider, in what sence the Romane Empire did <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 49. Act. 17. 53. &amp; 23. 10.</note> hinder, and was to be taken away, and in what sence it hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, and was to remaine: For the better vnderstanding whereof we are to distinguish betwixt the old Empire and <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 2. 2, Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The old Empire, as it hindered the dominion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, was to be taken out of the way, that it might bee no more an hinderance thereunto. The new Empire in the west erected by the Pope hindreth not the dominion of Antichrist, but rather supporteth him, and therefore together with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ was to remaine. Neither doth the Apostle speake of the new Empire, but of the old, as shall appeare by these reasons;</p>
               <p n="3">3 First the Apostle speaketh of the Empire which hindered <note place="margin">1.</note> or held then, &amp; of that only: for so he saith, only he which now letteth wil let vntill he be taken out of the way. And <hi>Hierome</hi> expoundeth those words, <hi>and now what hindreth, you know,</hi> after <note place="margin">Ad Algas. quaest. 11.</note> this maner, <hi>quae causa sit vt Antichrist us in praesentiaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat optimè nostis, You know very well what the cause is that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist cometh not now:</hi> But the old Empire hindered them and not the new. And therefore the Apostle speaketh of the taking away of the old Empire &amp; not of the new, Again when he saith <note place="margin">2.</note> the Empire hindred, he meaneth the imperial authority &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that at Rome, not the title or name therof in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For it is not the name or title of an Emperour in Germany, that can hinder the dominion of Antichrist at Rome, &amp; much lesse at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where the Papists say his seat shall be. Thirdly, <note place="margin">3.</note> Antichrist appeared &amp; shewed himselfe (and in that sence was reuealed) before the erection of the new Empire. For the new Empire is the image of the former beast: which Antichrist the 2. beast Ap. 13. causeth to be made. And wheras Antichrist is (as the Papists also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sesse) the 7. head of the beast which hath
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25487:23"/>
heads, the Empire renewed (which is the beast that was and is not though it be) is the 8. in order, though in name it is one of the 7. and in that sence is to bee referred to the sixt head, namely the Emperours. Fourthly the whore of Babylon, that <note place="margin">4.</note> is the Antichristian state, was to sitte vpon the beast which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was to ascend, that is, the Empire renewed. Therfore with Antichrist there was to remaine an imperial state, though much abased vnder him. Fiftly, the Empire renewed is the <note place="margin">5.</note> beast whereon the whore of Babylon sitteth. And therefore is <note place="margin">Ioan de turre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crem. lib. 2. c. 114.</note> so farre from hindring Antichrist, that it supporteth him, as the beast doth the rider. And to that end in deed was this Empire erected in the west, that it might support the church of Rome. For when as the church of Rome was oppressed by the king <note place="margin">Adrian. 4. in epistol. ad ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiep. German. apud Auenlin. lib. 4.</note> of the Lombards, it sought aide of the Emperours of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople; and when they would not defend the church, the Pope translated the Empire to the French king: and from him vpon the same occasion to the Germaines, and that to this end, <hi>vt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dist. 96. c. si im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator, in glossa.</note> 
                  <hi>Rex Teutonicorum foret imperator &amp; patronus sedis Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae, that the king of the Almaines might be Emperour, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone of the See Apostolicke.</hi> And for the same cause the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">6.</note> is called of them <hi>procurator siue defensor Romanae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae, the proctor or defender of the church of Rome.</hi> Sixtly, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists themselues doe hould that the Empire which now is, shall continue vnto the end of the world. For they say that in the second of <hi>Daniel</hi> (as many others also haue said) is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a succession of the chiefe kingdomes or Monarchies of the earth, which should continue vntill the end of the world: the last whereof is the Romane Empire, Seauenthly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Romane Empire (which the fathers say shall go before the reuelation of Antichrist), is the dissolution and diuision thereof among ten kings, which in deede long since happened to the old Empire, but cannot happen to the new: vnlesse we can imagine that ten mightie kings shall arise out of the bare name and title of an Emperour diuided among them. When as the Papists therefore teach vs not to expect Antichrist vntill the Empire that now is either be diuided into ten kingdomes, they are ridiculous; or vtterly abolished which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25487:23"/>
they say shall continue to the end, they are absurd, and in both impious, making (as it may seeme) a scorne of the prophecyes concerning Antichrist, which they make to imply impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and contradictions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By this which hath bene said it plainely appeareth, that howsoeuer the old Empire in the west, which hindered the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Antichrist, was to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the way before An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist should be reuealed; yet notwithstanding euen with, &amp; vnder Antichrist there was to be an imperiall state in name &amp; title, which is the beast whereon the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> sitteth, &amp; therfore is so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hindering Antichrist, as that it suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him. Let vs then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider how the Empire which hindred the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichrist was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the way, &amp; how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Antichrist was reuealed. Of the taking away of the Emperour, as also of the reuelation of Antichrist there are two degrees. The Romane Emperour was first take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the way, when the imperia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the meane time <hi>Italy</hi> was gouerned first by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a great part thereof by the <hi>Lombards.</hi> And howsoeuer the Emperours of the East had recouered Rome, and some part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which because they gouerned by exarches hauing their seat in <hi>Rauenna,</hi> was called the exarchat of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi>

enioying the rest: yet before the renewing of the Empire in the West, the Emperour of the East had lost all Italy and Rome, and that by the Popes means. For when as <hi>Leo</hi> the third called <hi>Isaurus,</hi> Emperour of Greece, had held a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople of 330. Bishops, wherein was decreed that all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges within the Empire should be destroied &amp; burnt: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards put the same decree in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the Popes of Rome first <hi>Gregory</hi> the 2. and after <hi>Gregory</hi> the 3. exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate him, forbidtributes to be paid him out of Italy and Rome, absolue his subiects from their allegiance vnto him, and hauing stirred vp not onely the Italians, but Lombards also against him, the exarch of <hi>Rauenna</hi> is slaine, and the Emperour depriued of all his dominion &amp; reuenewes in Italy and Rome. So that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Empire in the East stood all this while: yet according to the prophecie of th'apostle, he which hindred the reuelation of Antichrist, that is to say, the Emperour of Rome, was taken out of the way; First, by remouing to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, where Antichrist could not vsurpe that dominion and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raintie whiles the Emperour had his seate there, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he did. Secondly, because the Empire of the west, which properly was the Empire of Rome, was dissolued, &amp; the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the East lost his title &amp; interest in Italy and Rome.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of the reuelation of Antichrist there be also two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. The first, of his raigning and shewing himselfe in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, of his acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Of his raigning there be 2. degrees also. The first, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged supreame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer the vniuersal church of Christ. Which he did when he vsurped the title of vniuersal or oecumenicall Bishop or head of the vniuersall Church: which was done as we said about the yeare 607. About which time besides other prodigious sights <note place="margin">Anno. 607.</note> there appeared a terrible comet, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we hold that Antichrist (to wit, the head of the Antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> body) was borne. True it is that the seeds of Antichristianisme were sowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before his time: &amp; euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th'apostles time the mystery of iniquity, that is, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianisme, was working although more couertly, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was made towards the birth of the great Antichrist, partly by heresies &amp; some declinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the church of Rome in

religion from the purity of the primitiue church, partly by the ambition of diuers of the Bishops of Rome, who aduauncing themselues as <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, beyond the limit of priesthood into forraine dominion, contended to haue the primacy aboue <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 11.</note> all other churches (and that is the chiefe scope of many of their Epistles decretall) and to the same end forged a Canon of the councel of Nice, when their ambition was curbed by other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councels. And lastly by the indulgence of deuout Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Princes, who haue by great deuotions and priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges aduaunced that church.

               <p>Seing therefore we haue proued, that Antichrist was to sitte in Rome professing her selfe the church of God, and that after the taking away of the Romane Emperour whom hee was to succeed in the gouernment of Rome, and there to be reuealed both by his owne shewing himself in his colours, &amp; also by the acknowledgement of others: it cannot be auoided but that the Pope is Antichrist. For he and none but he sitteth, that is reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in Rome, professing her selfe the church of God, and that after the taking away of the Romane Emperour, (not onely by the remouing of the imperiall seat, but also by the dissolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Empire in the West) whom hee succeedeth in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Rome, where he hath bene reuealed not onely by his owne shewing himselfe in his colours, but also by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of others.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Vnto the former place of the Epistle to the <hi>Thessal.</hi> we will adde two other places out of th'apocalyps, from whence both the place and time of Antichrist may be iointly gathered. The former place is in the 13. of th'apocalips, where two beasts are described, signifying two estates of the Romane gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">2.</note> as they are opposed vnto Christ: the former representeth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:25487:28"/>
the persecuting Emperours, the latter Antichrist. Of the former he saith thus, I saw a beast arising out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> sea (that is, of many &amp; diuers peoples which it had vanquished.) Now the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this beast containeth in it the resemblances of those 4. kingdoms which are described in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Romane Empire farre surpassing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al. The first of the beasts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kingdome of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to a Lion: The 2. resembling the kingdome of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> to a Beare: The 3. representing the monarchy of the <hi>Macedonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> to a Leopard: The 4. figuring the kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae,</hi> to a beast with 10. hornes, resembling so many of their kings, who should tyrannize ouer Iewry. The Empire of Rome therfore, as if it were compounded of them all, is resembled to a beast hauing ten hornes with so many diademes vpon them, both in respect of the ten persecuting Emperors, answering the 10. <hi>Seleucedae</hi> &amp; <hi>Lagidae,</hi> as also in regard of the 10. kingdoms or prouinces wherinto the Romane Empire in those times was diuided; being also like a Leopard, hauing the feet or pawes as it were of a Beare, &amp; the rauening mouth of a Lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And besides all this, is said to haue seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heads, which afterwards <hi>(chapt.</hi> 17.) are expounded to be 7. hilles, &amp; also 7. heads of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp;c. &amp; to this beast was giuen authority or power, ouer euery tribe, <note place="margin">Verse. 7.</note> language and nation &amp;c. al which are proper to the Empire of Rome. The former beast therefore signifieth the Romane state, especially as it was vnder the persecuting Emperours, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de pont. R. cap. 15.</note> confesseth.</p>
               <p>The second beast, described <hi>vers.</hi> 11. and so forward to the end of the chapter, is (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith all men do confesse) Antichrist: who also is, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of the said <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De pont. Rom. lib. 3. c. 10. &amp; 15.</note> one of the heads of the former beast. By the description of this beast (that we may now note that which serueth for the present purpose, reseruing the residue vntil their due time &amp; place) it is apparant, that there is one &amp; the same principall seate of both the beasts, that in that seat the second beast succeedeth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, practising al the power or authority of the former beast &amp; <note place="margin">Verse. 12.</note> that before him, that is to say, euen at Rome: and that his chiefe endeuors te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to magnifie the beast, that is the Romane state; as in making me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to worship it, in causing me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make an image

All which as they argue Antichrist to be a Romane, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Emperors in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Rome: so also they fitly &amp; properly agree to the Pope, who succeedeth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Rome, where he vsurpeth all &amp; more then al the power of the Emperours, chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging a more vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal &amp; soueraigne, or rather diuine authority, then belonged to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; whose maine endeuors are to aduaunce the Romane state, which he calleth the See Apostolik, &amp; which he maketh al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to worship: causing them also to make an image of the Empire (which was the head that had receiued the deadly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) to &amp; in behoofe of the Romane state; an image I say, partly in the Emperour of Almaine, rese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling the title orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; shew of the former Emperours: partly in his owne courts not onely in Rome, but in all other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the former imperial authority &amp; tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny both in Rome it selfe, and in the prouinces thereunto belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging.

For as there is no question to be made hereof in respect of his courts, so is it as true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Empire, if that be true which themselues professe. Namely, that what the Emperor hath, he hath it wholy fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that the Empire in the West was renewed by the Pope, who tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated the title of the Emperor of Rome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperor of the East, first to the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, &amp; after to the Germa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: that the Pope caused this new Emperor to be made, that he crowned &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized him, that he appointed 7.

as it were heads of gouernment, whereby Rome hath bene go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, euery one succeeding another. The sixt head being the Emperours, the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th Antichrist which is the Pope. For Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is one of the 7. heads of the beast which hath 7. heads &amp; 10. hornes. And this beast signifieth the Romane state, therfore Antichrist is a head of the Romane state. All which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> after a sort co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth. Now it is most certaine that Antichrist is <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de pont. R. c. 15.</note> none of the first 5. heads, for they were past in th'apostles time: neither is he the sixt head which was of the Emperours, that then was; for that was to be done out of the way, as the Papists the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues do teach, before the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichrist. It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth therfore that the seuenth head which is the Pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. The eight head, which also is one of the seuen, is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire renewed by the Pope, &amp; is said to be the beast, which was &amp; is not though it be, wheron the whore of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sitteth. If it be obiected that the seuenth head wherby Antichrist is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, was to continue but a short time, as it is said <hi>vers.</hi> 10: and that this therfore cannot agree to the Pope, who hath raigned already in Rome many 100. yeares: I answere that this is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of purpose to arme the faithfull with patience, who otherwise would thinke the reigne of Antichrist very long, &amp; our Sauiour Christ also to be slowe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. Whereas in truth neither is our Sauiour Christ slow in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming as <hi>Peter</hi> sheweth, neither is <note place="margin">2.

But in respect of God with whom a 1000. yeares are as one day, &amp; in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>patison of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal kingdome of Christ (with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithful are to raigne after they haue suffered vnder Antichrist,) it is to be accompted very short. And surely if the whole time from the Ascension of of our Sauiour vntil his returne vnto iudgement, is noted in the Scriptures to be very short, and that to this end that we should not thinke it long, then is the raigne of Antichrist (which is but part of this time) much more short. The holy Ghost in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reuelation signifieth that the time of fulfilling <note place="margin">Apoc 1. 3.</note> the prophecies therein m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

10. And further whereas the Papists obiect, in respect of the time, that Antichrist is not yet come, because the Romane Empire is not yet dissolued, and consequently that the Pope is not Antichrist: it may notwithstanding euidently be shewed out of the same chapter of the Apocalypse compared with the <note place="margin">Apoc. 17.</note> euent, both that the Empire is dissolued, and that Antichrist is already come. For the Empire is then knowen to be dissolued, when it is diuided among ten who shall haue receiued power as kings, as <hi>Iohn</hi> noteth, the fathers teach, &amp; the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues confesse. But it is most certaine that the old Empire of of Rome is diuided among ten kings at the least, who before the dissolution had not soueraigne authority: and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which now is, being but a title, and contayning no such kingdomes, is not capable of such a partition. And that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ also is come it is as euident. For those ten hornes which in the Apostles time had not receiuèd the kingdome nor so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authority, but were gouernours of the prouinces by deputation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour, were after the dissolution of the Empire to receiue powèr as kings with the beast; or, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists reade, after the beast, that is Antichrist, If therefore the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours <note place="margin">Ap. 17. 12.</note> of the kingdomes whereinto the Romane Empire was diuided, haue receiued power as kings, then it is certaine that Antichrist is already come. For oither after him, or at least with him they were to receiue their soueraignty. It is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine therefore that Antichrist is come, as it is sure that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the prouinces which once belonged to the Empire are soueraigne princes and not liefetenants vnder the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. And that this Antichrist which is already come is the Pope, it is plaine enough by the same chapter. For whosoeuer succeedeth the Emperours (who were the sixt head) in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of Rome, as the seauenth head of the Romane state, he is Antichrist. But the Pope as the seauenth head of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane state succeedeth the Emperors (who were the sixt head) in the gouernement of Rome; therefore he is Antichrist. If you say, the seauenth head was not come in the Apostles time verse 10. and yet there were Bishops of Rome then: I answere that the Bishops of Rome, in the first three hundred yeares, were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25487:30"/>
meane men in respect of their owtward estate, &amp; nothing lesse then heads of the Romane state. And that howsoeuer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they obtained great authority, &amp; more &amp; more aspired vnto the soueraignty: notwithstanding, vntill the sixt head was taken out of the way, the 7. was not reuealed. But after the sixt head was gone, the 7. succeeded in the gouernment of Rome. <note place="margin">Cupers de eccl. p. 37. n. 9. vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem Romanam ad papam ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no iure spectare constat. &amp; pag. 258. n. 7.

First, he is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate or reuolter: 2. a disguised enemy or hypocrite; that is, one that is fallen indeed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god &amp; his truth as it werea star fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, yet retaineth the name &amp; profession of Christ; vnder which name &amp; professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he oppugneth christ &amp; his truth: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a rebellious subiect, when he presumeth without commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to leuy a power of men against his Soueraigne, that he may deceiue the rest of the subiects, abuseth the name and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his prince to colour his rebellious practises. And that this is the property of Antichrist, <hi>Hilary</hi> hath well obserued: <hi>It is</hi>

                  <hi>the property of Antichrists name, to be contrary to Christ. This is now practised vnder the opinion of counterfeit piety: this, vnder a shewe of preaching the Gospell, is preached, that our Lord Iesus Christ may be denied whiles whiles he is thought to be preached.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Now the Papists are as ready to obiect this Apostasy to vs, as wee to them. How then shall we discerne whether we or they haue made this reuolt? The Apostle in the same place set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe two of those doctrines of diuells, as certaine notes whereby those which make this Apostasie may be discerned. <hi>Forbidding</hi> (saith hee) <hi>to marry, and commaunding to abstaine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim 4. 3.</note>

As for the Papists (especiallie since the times of <hi>Gregory</hi> the seauenth, they forbid mariage to some men at all times,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25487:31"/>
and certaine meats to all men at sometimes and that for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sake: esteeming of mariage in their clergie worse then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery or Sodomy; and eating of flesh in Lent, or other forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den times, as a mortall sinne. And as touching the falling away of the Church; certaine it is, that although neither the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <note place="margin">1.

As the Church of England which was in King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies, reuolted in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, from Christ to Antichrist. So hath the church of Rome (which once was famous for her <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> faith) as may appeare not onely by those notes set downe by the Apostle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. and some others which hereafter <note place="margin">See the 2. boke chapt. 2.</note> shalbe noted: but also in those innumerable particulars both in doctrine and maners wherein they haue reuolted from the purity of the primitiue Church.

Doe not many of them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of voluntary pouerty gather infinite riches?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25487:33"/>
And doth not all their religion stande in <hi>Opere operate,</hi> in the bare performaunce of the outwarde worke, that is to say, in hypocrisie? Neither are wee to omitte an hypocriticall pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie which of late they haue vsed. For when as they coulde not preuaile with their Sophistry, that is to say, with their Bookes of controuersies: they hoped to preuaile among the simple with their hypocrisie, that is to say, with their bookes of deuotion. Wherein there is a notable shewe of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait deuotion, zeale and holinesse, to bleare the eyes of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and vnstaied. But it were to be wished, that as they are, so they were esteemed to be no better then baits of Antichrist, seruing to allure men vnder shew of deuotion, vnto idolatry &amp; apostasie from God: especially if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that the principall of these bookes were set forth by <hi>Parsons</hi> &amp; other Iesuits, who <note place="margin">Quodlibet &amp;c.</note> are plainly discouered euen by some of their owne side, to be mere Machiuilians and wicked Atheists.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thus you see what maner of aduersary Antichrist is. Now wee must shewe in particular wherein he is opposed to Iesus Christ. He is opposed vnto him as he is Christ, and as he is Iesus: as hee is Christ, that is, as he was annointed of God to be our Prophet, our King, and our Priest; in which respect especially he is called Antichrist. He is also opposed vnto him as he is Iesus, that is to say, as he is our Sauiour. So that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ opposeth himselfe both to the offices of Christ signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the name Christ, and also to the benefites signified in the name Iesus. Now these things also most fitly agree to the Pope: who opposeth himselfe to Christ in all these respectes, not indeede <hi>aperto Marte</hi> as an open and professed enemy, (for so it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not Antichrist, who was to be an hypocrit sitting in the Church of God &amp;c.) but couertly and cunningly. For we must remember that Antichristianisme is the mystery of iniquity, wherin Christ was in word &amp; shew to be professed, but indeed &amp; truth, denied. First, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Christ our Prophet he is opposed, partly as he oppugneth the prophecy of Christ, and partly as himselfe is a false Prophet. He oppugneth the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Christ; First, in denying Christ to be our onely Prophet (whose voice in the canonicall Scriptures concerning matters
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25487:33"/>
necessarily to be beleeued vnto saluation, wee ought onely to heare) whiles he and his followers do teach that the scriptures are not perfect, and that besides the Apocryphall writings (which they haue matched with the canonical) their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions also are necessary, and of equall authority with the scriptures. Secondly by withholding from the people the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (which containe the whole doctrine of Christ our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) in a strange language, and also by reading and preaching vnto them their owne fancies and inuentions, out of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends and liues of saints, and festiualls &amp;c. in steede of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere truth of God. And by these two practises, the Pope, whiles he leaueth to Christ the name and title of beeing our prophet, he taketh the thing to himselfe. Againe he is opposed to Christ our prophet as himselfe is the false prophet spoken of in the Apocalypse, teaching Antichristian errours and doctrines of diuells. For so many errors, as are taught and held by the Pope and church of Rome, are so many oppositions betwixt him and Christ our prophet. Of the errours of the Romish church there be many centuryes or hundreds, and diuerse of them fundamentall. In respect whereof wee may truly say that the catholike Apostasie (for so I call the Romish religion) is the common sewre of many grosse heresyes.</p>
               <p n="6">6 But it will be said, that howsoeuer the Pope holdeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse errours, yet he teacheth not those, which the holy ghost hath noted as the peculiar doctrines of Antichrist. Whereof the authour of the Wardword reckoneth vp three, and <hi>Bellar-</hi>mine hath a fourth: But neither of them durst mention those two doctrines of diuells which <hi>Paul</hi> assigneth to that Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 3.</note> whereof Antichrist is the head, The first doctrine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ (say they) is, to deny Iesus to be Christ. Which they <note place="margin">Of this see more in the 2. booke and 14. chapter.</note> would proue out of 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. 22. &amp; 4. 3. and 2. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 7. But the Pope (say they) doth not deny Iesus to be Christ. To the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syllogisme or proofe of the proposition I answere, that these places of the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> doe not speake properly of the graund Antichrist, who is the head of the Antichristian body, but of certaine petite Antichrists, or heretickes of those times, which denied either of the natures of Christ, (for he speaketh
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:25487:34"/>
of such as were then already come into the world:) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from thence it cannot be proued that the great Antichrist shall directly and expresly deny Iesus to be Christ. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, seeing they are called Antichrists not onely because they belong to the Antichristian body as inferiour members thereof, but also as it may be thought, because they did after a sort deny Christ as the great Antichrist also should doe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not after the same manner: I doe therefore thus farre graunt the proposition it selfe, that Antichrist was in some sort to denie Christ. For <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh not of the manner how he doth denie Christ. Neither are we to thinke that Antichrist will denie him after euerie manner, but in such sort as shall be most consonant to the whole <hi>mysterie of iniquitie,</hi> and suteable to the rest <hi>of his lying and deceipt.</hi> That is to say, in outward <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.</note> shewe and semblance to professe Christ (as those Antichrists did, of whom <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh) but in deed and in truth to denie him. To come therfore to the assumption: let vs consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope and church of Rome doe not in some sort denie Christ, Christ may be denyed, either in deeds or words. <hi>Quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis autem factis negat Christum, is Antichrist us est, And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer in deedes</hi> (saith Augustine) <hi>denieth Christ, he is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. Let vs therefore marke</hi> (saith he) <hi>who it is that denieth, &amp;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tract. 3. in Epist. Ioan.</note> 
                  <hi>let vs not attend to his tongue but to his works. I regard not what he speaketh, but how he liueth. Works do speake, and do we require words? He is the more lying Antichrist, who with his mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth Iesus to be Christ, and by deeds denyeth him.</hi> According to the Lawyers rule, it is more to testifie a matter by deedes then by words. And <hi>Tullie</hi> saith, <hi>that where the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues</hi>

                  <hi>beare witnesse, words are needlesse.</hi> And as Antichrist was thus to deny Christ, both as he is the man of sin, and an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary oppugning Christ and his church: So doth the Pope, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer in word he professeth Christ. For euen the diuells them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue in word confessed Christ, whom notwithstanding by their deeds they deny. If therefore the Pope be a man of sin (which we shall proue anone) and an aduersary opposed vnto Christ, (which now we haue in hand to proue) then it cannot be denyed but that indeed he denieth Christ.</p>

7 Secondly, Christ may be de denyed in word &amp; doctrine, and that either indirectly and by consequent, or else directlie &amp; expresly. He that denieth Christ by consequent, howsoeuer openly he doth confesse him, doth indeede deny him; as those which deny either of his natures, or any of his offices. For such is the necessary coherence of truth within it selfe, as nothing can by necessarie consequence be deducted from it, which is not also true. And therefore it is impossible that the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent should be false, the antecedent being true. Whereupon it followeth, that whosoeuer denieth the consequent, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deny the antecedent. Iesus is Immanuel, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God and Man. He is Christ, and consequently annointed of God to be our King, our priest, &amp; our prophet. He therefore that denieth any of these, denieth Iesus to be Christ. And further, is Christ truly God? then is he also <hi>Iehouah,</hi> one that is of &amp; from himself, namely as he is God: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he also the Lord &amp; creator of al things, gouerning all things with his presence and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Is he truly man? then hath he a true body consisting of three dimensions, length, bredth, thicknes, circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scribed, visible, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Is he the true Messias &amp; Mediator betwixt God &amp; man? then is he the only mediator, for there is but one. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 5. Act. 4. 12.</note> whosoeuer saith, that Christ is not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>God of himself,</hi> he denieth him to be God: or preferreth any creature before him either in heauen or in earth, he denieth him to be the Lord and maker of al; or assigneth a vicar vnto him to supply his absence on earth, denieth his omniprese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Again, whosoeuer saith that Christ his body doth not consist of 3. dimensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that it is not circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scribed, that it is not visible, that it is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in one place as al other bodies, yea as al other finite natures are; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth Iesus to be truly man, &amp; consequently denieth him to be Christ. Lastly whosoeuer adioyne other mediators vnto Christ and in some respects preser others aboue him, deny him to be the only mediator; &amp; therfore deny him to be the true media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for there is but one, &amp; conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly deny Iesus to be christ. And thus as the Antichrists wherof <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh (according <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. 22. Lib. 3. de pont. Rc. ap. 14.</note> to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> his own expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) did, &amp; as the graund Antichrist (according to our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) doth deny Christ, not only in deed,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:25487:35"/>
but also in word and doctrine, although not openly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely yet indirectly, and by consequent: So doth the Pope and church of Rome, deny Iesus to be Christ. For, what a God and Lord, what a creatour and gouernor of all things the Pope and Papists make our Sauiour Christ, you may easily conceiue; First, when they de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>God of himselfe,</hi> and consequently Iehouah. For whosoeuer is Iehouah, he is of, and from himselfe. True indeed it is, that Christ is <hi>filius a patre, sed Deus a se, quate nus est Deus:</hi> that is, <hi>sonne of and from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but God of and from himselfe,</hi> namely as he is God. And if he were not of and from himselfe, he were not God. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the concrete we may and must say with the councel of Nice, that Christ is God of God, that is, Christ who is God, is from the father who is God (the word <hi>God</hi> beeing taken <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>personallio)</hi> because the person of the sonne who is <hi>Deus genitus God begotten</hi> is from the person of the father who is <hi>Deus gignens</hi> God begetting: yet it is not likewise true in the abstract. For howsoeuer the Godhead is communicated from the father to the sonne by eternall generation, and from the father and the sonne to the holy ghost by eternall processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the deity of the sonne and so of the holy ghost, beeing the selfe same infinite eternall and indiuisible essence of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is from, and of, and by, and for it selfe. And who knoweth not that such is the simplicity of the diuine nature as that God is the godhead, and the godhead is God, and consequentlie that Christ as he is God is the Godhead, which is of and from it selfe. And therefore to conclude, Christ is God of God, in respect of his person, and he is also God of himselfe in respect of his essence which is of it selfe: he is God of God, the name <hi>God</hi> being vsed personally and relatiuely (for hee is God the sonne, of God the father: and God begotten, of God beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) and he is God of himselfe, the name God beeing taken <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> essentially &amp; absolutely, namely as he together with the father and the holy ghost is one and the same eternall Iehouah and onely true God. In which respect if the Papists deny Christ to be God of himselfe, as they do when they accuse this our doctrine of heresie, and deny him so to bee <gap reason="foreign">

What a man they make our Sauiour Christ who knoweth not, when they hold, &amp; with fire &amp; fagot persecute those that will not hold the same, that his body is multipresent, that is, present in many or rather infinit places at once, and that disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued: for they say that it being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is also present really and corporally vpon the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer their Masse is celebrated or their hoste reserued, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it is not in the space betwixt heauen and earth, nor in those places where the host is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is to assigne many or rather innumerable bodies to our Sauiour Christ.

The which in effect is as much as to denie that Christ is come in the flesh, which is the doctrine of that Antichrist whereof <hi>John</hi> speaketh. And here by the way note the absurditie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. 3. 2.

of the sonne to be circumscribed: &amp; consequently against all reason make the deitie finit, and the humanitie infinit. The office of Christ is his mediation. Now what a mediatour they make him you may easily iudge, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ioyne infinit others with him. For the Apostle saith, that there is but one media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <note place="margin">1.

               <p n="8">8. Again, Christ may be denied directly &amp; expresly: &amp; that may be done either secretly &amp; in priuate, or else ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly &amp; in publick profession. After the latter sort Antichrist was not to denie our Sauiour Christ: because he was to be an hypocrite &amp; a disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed enemy as hath bene proued. Neither was it necessary that he should deny Christ expresly &amp; directly, &amp; yet this also may bee proued of diuerse Popes.

First by killing the bodies of the true seruants of Christ that refuse his marke, in respect whereof hee may most worthilie bee called <gap reason="foreign">

but of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Mentz.</hi> Yea, but say I, the <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de pont. Rom. cap. 21.</note> Pope hath so approued this speeche being deliuered by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that hee hath canonized it, and appointed it for one of the canons of his law. Which is more then if it had bin spoken by himselfe. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> replyeth; If this sentence of <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> be not true, why do you obiect it: if it be true, why do you not receiue it? I aunswere, because it being not onely false, but blasphemous also and Antichristian, is notwithstanding by the Pope authorized for a Canon in his lawe. Moreouer, one of the chiefe works of Gods spirit the spirit of adoption, which is speciall faith, apprehending the righteousnesse of Christ to our iustification, hee laboureth to extinguish in the hearts of men, calling it presumption: acknowledging no other faith <note place="margin">Iam. 2.</note> but such as is common to the diuells (which consisteth onely of knowledge and assent), and yet not requiring that in the lay people whome vnder the name of implicite faith, hee nuzleth in palpable ignorance, and leadeth them beeing blind, as <hi>Elizeus</hi> did the Aramites, euen whether it pleaseth <note place="margin">2. King 6.</note> him. The pure wheat of Gods word hee suppresseth and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth from the people in an vnknowne tongue, and see deth them with the mast of their Legends and festiualls and lyes (I should haue sayd liues) of Saints. The lawes of Christ he part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispenseth with, and partly abrogateth, making them of none effect by his owne constitutions and traditions. In the church, in steede of the offices and functions ordayned by Christ, hee hath created a new priesthoode, erected an hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, consecrated orders and religions of his owne. In the common wealth hee absolueth the people from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their princes if they shal displease him. And it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple among them, that it is lawfull for him to depose Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings, and to absolue their sworne subiects from fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and allegiance towards them. And thus you see how the Pope opposeth himselfe to the prophecy, priesthood and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ. Whereunto I might adde how he is opposed to these offices of Christ, not onely in these respects allreadie mentioned, but as an <hi>aemulus,</hi> as an antiprophet, an antipriest, and a counter king seeking in his Antichristian pride to match
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25487:38"/>
our Sauiour Christ in all those offices: but hereof I shall haue occasion to speake in the next chapter. Now to the benefites of Christ he is opposite, as he is an enemy to the grace of god: as hee taketh away Christian liberty, and taketh vpon him to make new lawes, to binde the conscience: as he abridgeth the merites of Christ, and ascribeth the merite of saluation not onelie to our owne works prescribed of God, but also to such as haue beene in superstition, will worship, and idolatrie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised by themselues: as he teacheth men to seek saluation else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where then in Christ. All which oppositions of the Pope to Christ, whosoeuer shall duely consider, hee will not seeke fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Antichrist.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:25487:39"/>
a man of sin, a sonne of perdition. And the greatest pride that is incident not onely to any man, but to any creature, be it the diuell himselfe (whose <hi>Satanicall</hi> pride Antichrist was to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and not to exceed) is this, to seeke to be as God. When as <note place="margin">Es. 14.</note> therefore it is said that Antichrist aduanceth himselfe aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, it is not meant that hee shall seeke to aduaunce himselfe, aboue God or the deitie it selfe: For God being infinite in goodnesse, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and power, there cannot bee conceiued a better, a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, a greater. And therefore wee cannot imagine how Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ should aduance himselfe aboue God. And it is euident that the height of Antichrists pride heere spoken of, is noted in these words, <hi>Insomuch as he shall sitte in the temple of God, as God,</hi> By all therfore that is called God, we are to vnderstand all those to whom the name of God is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated: not essence, for that cannot be communicated to any that is not god.

And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is said that hee shall aduance himselfe aboue all that is worshipped, wee are to vnderstand by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not God himselfe, but any thing that is worshipped as God, or wherein God is worshipped. So <hi>Wisd.</hi> 15. 17. images, and <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 23, altars among the heathen are called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Such in the church of Rome, are Saints, images, the crosse and reliques of Saints, the eucharist, &amp;c. The meaning then of the Apostle is this, that Antichrist being a wicked and wretched man, shall aduance himselfe aboue all that is called God, as Angells and Kings, or that which is worshipped, as Saints and images and altars, the crosse and eucharist it selfe, insomuch that he shall sit in the temple of God as God, that is, hee shall rule &amp; raigne in the church of God, challenging a soueraigne, vniuersall and diuine authority ouer al those that professe the name of Christ, as if he were a God vpon earth, shewing himselfe whether by words or by deeds that he is god, or which is all one, behauing himselfe <hi>tanquam sit Deus, As though he were God.</hi> The like things were foretold of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who is thought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:25487:39"/>
to haue bene a type of Antichrist. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36. But (to come to the application of this prophecie) if <hi>Antiochus</hi> were compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Pope in aduauncing himself aboue all that is called God: or if I shal not proue out of their owne (I meane popish) writings, that he hath lifted vp himselfe in such maner as is scarcely credible to be incident vnto a mortall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; then let not the Pope be deemed Antichrist, but rather looke for some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who shall goe beyond him in Antichristian insolency and Satanicall pride.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From this place therfore of th'apostle, I argue thus: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer aduaunceth himselfe aboue all that is called God or that is worshipped, insomuch that he sitteth in the temple of God, as God, taking vpon him as though he were a God, he according to the testimony of th'apostle, is antichrist,</hi> that is, <hi>Aemulus Christi,</hi> such an enimy as in a kinde of emulation seeketh to match Christ and to be equall to him. <hi>But the Pope of Rome</hi> (as shalbe proued) <hi>aduaunceth himselfe aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, insomuch that hee sitteth in the temple of God as God, taking vpon him as though he were a God vpon earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to this testimony of th'apostle the Pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi> And first that the Pope aduaunceth himselfe aboue all that is called God, it is plaine, because he lifteth vp himself not onely ouer Kings and Emperours on earth, but also aboue the Angels in heauen.

But where there is no example of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sation in the like case, then it appertaineth to the Pope alone to declare, when and in what particular case the reason of the lawe faileth.

So that whereas the lawes and commandements of God are to bee vnderstoode with this exception onely <hi>Nisi Deus ipse aliter voluerit, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God himselfe otherwise appoint,</hi> because hee alone may dispense with his owne lawes: notwithstanding by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish diuinitie they are to bee vnderstood with this exception, vnlesse the Pope otherwise appoint: that is, wee are bound to keepe euery commaundement of God, vnlesse the Pope inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his authoritie betwixt God and vs (as the tribunes of the comunalty among the Romanes were wont to intercede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst other magistrates) and exempt vs from the obedience thereof.</p>

Of which sins some are common to very many of them, and some are common to them all. For howsoeuer the crimes and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of such deepe dissemblers, as these Antichristian Popes haue beene, were many times either not commonly knowne to the world, or beeing knowne were not communicated to posterity, the writers of those times being for the most part the seruile flatterers of Antichrist: yet notwithstanding many of them were knowne, &amp; of those which were knowne many are recorded to haue beene guilty of fearefull crimes, besides those which either were not knowen or not recorded.

to heare some other examples of their cruelty, you may reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how <hi>Stephen</hi> the 6. caused the body of <hi>Formosus</hi> the Pope to be taken out of the graue, and hauing cut of two of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers &amp; cast them into the <hi>Tiber,</hi> he buried the body amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Laity: which body eight yeares after <hi>Sergius</hi> the 3. causeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be taken out of the graue, and hauing cut of the other 3. fingers, he casteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the body it self into the said riuer, &amp; condemned him and all his actes, which other Popes not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing as <hi>Romanus</hi> 1. <hi>Theodorus</hi> 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. ratified &amp; appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

And this is some part of their behauiour among themselues. For of their cruelty toward the Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Iesus who is able sufficiently to intreat?</p>
               <p n="3">3. To their cruelty I wil adde their perfidious treachery, &amp; traiterous practises, especially towards the Emperours &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christendome. For first, the Emperors of Greece, by the Popes rebellious opposition against their soueraigne Lords in the vngodly defence of images, were bereaued of their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the West. By which meanes the Empire being rent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder &amp; weakened, way was made for the Turke. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer at the first they seemed to honour their newly erected Emperors in the West whom they created for their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, yet afterward they neuer ceassed vntill they had gotten superiority ouer them. And euer since it hath bene their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to strengthen and aduaunce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues and their owne See by weakening and deiecting the Emperour and all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> princes. And this they had effected by diuerse diuelish pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies. As first they haue vsed to picke quarels against them, &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any pretext or colour of a iust quarell to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate them &amp; to absolue their subiects from their obedience. And if by these meanes they would not be brought into subiection, then to depose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they could, &amp; to set vp others against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if other means failed, to raise vp warres against them, &amp; to send forth Croisades into all Christendome with large indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:25487:52"/>
&amp; promises of heauen to all that would fight their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. And besides this, they haue also forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al other chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to vse any trafficke with them &amp; their subiects: and not onely that, but they haue exposed the princes themselues, sometimes their subiects also, to the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of murderers, &amp; their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries &amp; kingdoms as a prey to spoilers, warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting any to bereaue the prince or the subiect of their liues, &amp; to take their kingdome as a prey. Thus besides many others was <hi>He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry</hi> the 4. Emperour vsed by <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. &amp; <hi>Paschalis</hi> the 2. who not onely exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the worthy Emperor, absolued his subiects fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but also both vnder ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d suborned such as should murder him, &amp; openly set vp against him in the Empire, first <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the duke of <hi>Sueuia,</hi> and then his owne sonne: &amp; in the end the good Emperour being deposed, imprisoned, &amp; dead in prison, his body might not for 5. yeares be vouchsafed christian burial. Thus was <hi>Otho</hi> 4 vsed by <hi>Innocentius</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Lewis</hi> the 4. by <hi>Iohn</hi> 22. <hi>Benedict</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>Clement</hi> the 6. by whose meanes also he was poisoned. Thus diuerse kings of France, besides him that now is, haue ben intreated. But especially <hi>Lewis</hi> 12, a good king, by <hi>Iulius</hi> the 2. a notable Antichrist. For he not only exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Lewis,</hi> &amp; interdicted his land, but also stirred vp al Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans against him, promising great indulgence and pardon of all sinnes, to euery one that should by any meanes whatsoeuer kil any French man. In his owne person also hee went to warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, &amp; as he being armed brought forth his army on the bridge ouer <hi>Tiber,</hi> he cast his keies into the riuer, and drew his sword, vsing this speach in the hearing of many thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, seing <hi>Peters</hi> keyes doe nought auaile vs, I will therefore vse <hi>Paules</hi> sword. And to conclude, thus also haue our Kings beene dealt with, as king <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. &amp; our gratious Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom (to omit the other) the Popes haue exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued her subiects fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as much as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lieth depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her from her crowne, exposed her to the violence of her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret &amp; ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemies, raised rebellions against her, suborned cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats to murder her, sent forces into Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to win that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, stirred vp the Spaniard &amp; aided him against her, &amp; lastly by an Antichristian deuotion giuen her realme of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the Spaniard. But who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichrist cursed, Christ blessed:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:25487:52"/>
insomuch that hauing through the Lords goodnesse ouerliued 8. Popes, since she came to the crowne, in the end after a long and happy reigne she died in peace. Another practise of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ hath beene this, to bereaue the right owners of their crownes &amp; kingdomes, &amp; to set vp others which had no right, that they being adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by his meanes, should be obliged as vassals &amp; feed men vnto his See. And to this end, when co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue risen betwixt Christian princes, he hath not only nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished the same, but also taken part with the one against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that the one being by his means va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quished &amp; ouercome, the other may acknowledge the Pope for his good Lorde. To this end was the title of the Romane Empire translated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Greeks to the French in Charlemaigne, &amp; from the French to the Almaines in Otto, whom the Pope caused to sweare ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage &amp; fealty to him. To this end was <hi>Pipin</hi> crowned king of Fraunce, &amp; <hi>Childerick</hi> deposed &amp; shorne a Monke. But I shall not need to insist in the enumeration of examples: for scarcely is there any kingdome in Europe, if any at all, which the Pope <note place="margin">Vide Fulm. brutum pag. 74.</note> hath not in former times by these and other meanes made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect &amp; tributary to his See, vsing the kings as his vassals &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sweare homage vnto him. A third stratageme which the Popes haue vsed to weaken the Emperours and princes of christendome, &amp; strengthen themselues, hath bene this, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to goe with their forces &amp; chiefe of their strength into <hi>Palestine</hi> for the recouery of the Holy la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d from the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens;</hi> that in their absence he might worke his will in any part of Europe, not fearing their strength if they should returne, being weakened by those warres; but rather hoping they should not returne to make resistaunce. And to this purpose consider onely the dealing of <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. and <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, with the one and two <hi>Frederickes</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. For <hi>Alexander</hi> the third fearing the power of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke Barbarossa,</hi> by <hi>Hartmannus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Brixia,</hi> perswadeth him to goe with his armie into <hi>Palestine</hi> for the recouery of the holy Lande: the Pope in the meane time sendeth a picture of the Emperour to the <hi>Soldan,</hi> perswading him, that by some secret ambushment hee would apprehend him; which happened accordingly. The Emperour being
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:25487:53"/>
released by the Soldan, after his returne commeth to Venice, where the Pope as you heard before treadeth on his necke &amp;c. The other <hi>Frederick</hi> being first exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated by <hi>Gregory</hi> 9. <note place="margin">Bal. ex Mario &amp; Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> because he went not to <hi>Palaestine</hi> according to his appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, at the length to satisfie the Popes pleasure, he tooke his voiage: and hauing recouered Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; other places from the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and made truce with him for 10. yeares, he sendeth these glad ridings to the Pope. Who hauing receiued the letters causeth the messengers to be slaine, and giueth out that the Emperour was dead. For the Pope hauing a moneths mind to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Sicilia</hi> &amp; <hi>Apulia,</hi> wherof <hi>Frederick</hi> was the true heire, desired according to <hi>Saules</hi> old pollicie against <hi>Dauid,</hi> to haue him dispatched by the infidels, &amp; to that end was so earnest to haue him gone. For in his abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he seized on those kingdoms, &amp; wrote to the <hi>Soldan</hi> that he should in no case restore Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Emperour. And when as the Emperour was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Pope excommunicateth him againe, because hee had made truce with the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and would not absolue him vntill he had paid for his absolution on 100000. ounces of gold.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But now the filthy leachery of these hollow fathers, who would seeme so chast as that they condemne marriage in their clergy, offreth it selfe to be spoken of. For although it be a rule amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, <hi>Si non castè, tamen cautè, If not chastly, yet charily,</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding very many of them haue bene detected and knowne to be most filthy fornicatours and adulterers, besides <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8. or rather <hi>Ioane</hi> who was a harlot in mans apparell, and was deliuered of a childe in open procession.

the 11. and spent his time among harlots. Both these <hi>Iohns</hi> beeing as bad or worse then their fathers. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. also was so giuen to whoredome as that he is said to haue turned the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Laterane into a stewes. And being at the length taken in adulterie, by the husband of the adulteresse hee was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to death. Such were <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. &amp; 19. &amp; 21. &amp; 24. Likewise <hi>Benedict.</hi> 6. &amp; 9. who by sorcery allured women vnto him, and made them follow him vp &amp; downe like Cades. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Benedict</hi> 12. who kept many strumpets, and among others the sister of <hi>Frauncis Petrarch</hi> whom by great rewards he had purchased of her brother <hi>Gerhard.</hi> Such were <hi>Christopherus</hi> 1. and <hi>Calixtus</hi> the 3. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 6. and the 7. called <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who as also <hi>Victor</hi> the 3. were very inward with <hi>Mawde</hi> the countesse. <hi>Innocentius</hi> 4. had many bastards, and so had <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> the 8. who also vsed to paint his face. <hi>Nicolas</hi> 3. by his concubine begat a child which in nailes and haire was like a Bear, which some impute to the pictures of beares which hee being of the Vrsine family had caused to be made in his house. And therefore <hi>Martin</hi> 4. who kept the same concubine, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the like mischance, caused the pictures of the beares to be taken away. <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. kept many harlots, &amp; had by them diuerse nephewes, for so they call their bastards. <hi>Clement</hi> 5. was a common whoremonger and patron of harlots, and so was <hi>Clement</hi> 6. <hi>Clement</hi> 7. &amp; 8. was worse then so: and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 8. that now is, hath beene no better then he should bee.

               <p n="5">5 These are ordinary matters in the Romish votaryes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whome those Popes may be counted for men of the chaster sorte, who haue offended onely by fornication and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery. But, as very many of their votaries, so also diuerse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Popes haue fearefully sinned against nature by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest and Sodomie. Neither are we to maruell thereat, seeing they doe not onely embrace the meanes of lust, as idlenesse, fulnesse of bread, and abundance of worldly delights and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pleasures, but also reiect the remedie appointed of God, which is mariage; but especially because they beeing Idolaters
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:25487:54"/>
are by the iust iudgement of God giuen ouer to their lustes and to a reprobate sence, insomuch that they commit abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations against nature. It is recorded of <hi>Iohn</hi> the 13. and 23. <hi>aliàs</hi> 24. that, besides all other their whoredomes and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the one committed incest with <hi>Stephana</hi> his fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine; and the other with his brothers wife. <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6. not contented with diuerse other strumpets which he kept, by whome he had 6. bastards, committed incest with his owne daughter <hi>Lucretia.</hi> Hee also gaue leaue to Cardinall <hi>Mendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> to abuse his owne bastard sonne in incestuous Sodomy and Sodomiticall incest. <hi>Paulus</hi> the third committed incest with two of his nieces, prostituted one of his sisters to <hi>Alexander</hi> 6. to get a Cardinallship, and poisoned another because shee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected some other of her louers more then himselfe, neither did hee abstaine from his owne daughter <hi>Constantia.</hi> Of <hi>Pius</hi> 5. it is saide that he kept incestuous companie with his owne sister. <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. was not onely a filthie whoremonger and Sodomite himselfe, but also to incite and encourage others to the same filthinesse, hee built a famous stewes not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of women, but also of males also. And hee gaue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to the Cardinall of Saint <hi>Lucie</hi> and to all his familie; that they might in the three hote moneths of the yeere free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vse Sodomie. <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. abused vnto Sodomie, besides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, two young noblemen of Fraunce, whome <hi>Anne</hi> the Queene had sent to Rome and committed to a Cardinall to bee informed. <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3. made his <hi>Ganymedes</hi> a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and neither did he as some write abstaine from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Sodomie with the Cardinalles themselues. His Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate at Venice (a fit couer for such a potte) <hi>Ioannes a Casa.</hi> Archbishoppe of Beneuentum, set foorth a booke in Italian metre in commendation of this sin, for which the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed Sodom and Gomorrhe with fire and brimstone from heauen. Such sinners against nature were, as authors testify, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> 1. <hi>Clement</hi> 7. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 14. &amp; 24. <hi>Leo</hi> 10. and <hi>Paule</hi> 3. whose bastard sonne <hi>Petrus Aloysius</hi> I cannot passe ouer with silence: For hee treading in his fathers steppes, and beeing greatly loued and aduanced by him, besides incest with his

sister <hi>Constantia,</hi> and rapes with other women, and buggerie with diuerse men, he forced a Sodomiticall rape vpon <hi>Cosmus Cherius</hi> a worthy Bishoppe, vsing the helpe of his men to hold him by violence, whiles he committed that outragious act. But it is shame to speake that which they are not ashamed to doe.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And yet this is not all that is to bee alleadged against the Popes, that diuerse of them haue beene Atheists, many of them sorcerers, murtherers, traytors, Adulterers and Sodomits. For many of them haue beene most foule monsters (as some of their owne writers call them) compounded of these and other horrible crymes.

Neither may it be obiected, that although diuerse Popes haue beene men of sinne, yet many of them haue beene holy men and Saints of God, and consequently not Antichrists: For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer all the Romane Bishoppes of the first 600. yeares are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced as Saints and so called of Popish writers, as Saint <hi>Syluester,</hi> Saint <hi>Leo,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> &amp;c. a very few onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet a very fewe of them which haue liued this thousand yeares are euen by Popish flatterers esteemed Saints: and those fewe which be, are honoured among them not for any true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, <note place="margin">Onuphr.

But so far indeed these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postaticall Popes haue been from being Saints in the sight of God, that all of them haue deserued to be called men of sinne, sons of perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, outlawes, although some of them were not so wicked as the rest. Men of sin, because besides those peculiar sinnes wherewithall euery of them were seuerallie infected, the whole order or successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ofthem hath been guilty of many other crimes also, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them al, diuerse wherof the holy ghost hath set downe as noates of Antichrist. As namely those which I haue already proued, to be in the Pope, heresy, opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or enmity to Christ, apostasy, hypocrisy, satanical pride. For if the Pope be an heretick or false prophet teaching the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of diuels, if a notorious hypocrite, if an apostate, yea the head of the catholike apostasy, if an aduersary opposed vnto

               <p n="7">7 But vnto these, diuerse others may be added, as first and principallie the idolatrie, superstitious and counterfaite religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Pope and church of Rome. For the whore of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, whereby is signified the Antichristian state, is described in the scriptures not onely as a spirituall adulteresse, but also as the mother of all fornications and abominations in the earth, which with the golden cuppe of her fornications, that is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries <note place="margin">Apoc. 17.</note> and superstitions, hath made drunke the kings and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth. Now the idolatry of the Pope and church of Rome is manifold and grieuous. As first, to the bread in the sacrament, which beeing a small creature they worship as their maker and redeemer, neither doe they thinke that they can worshippe it enough, and therefore in the worship thereof the chiefe part of their solemne seruice consisteth. Secondly to the crosse and crucifix, and images of the trinitie, all which as they teach are to be worshipped with diuine worship, and are so worshipped among them. Thirdly, to the blessed virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who hath beene worshipped among them as much or rather more then God. Her they call their Lady and goddesse, and queene of heauen. In her they repose their trust and assiance, to her they flie in their necessitie, of her they craue all good things, and from her they expect remission of sins and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall saluation, in honour of her they haue deuised and vsed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse seruices, as offices, letanies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:25487:57"/>
the Pope in a couetous pollicie forbiddeth many things which GOD doth not forbid, namely to this ende that the straiter his prohibitions are, the oftner hee may haue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to dispense there with.

And yet there are many more deuises and sained words, whereby the Pope maketh merchandise of men for the enriching of himselfe and his clergie. As by his iubileyes, and canonizing of Saints, by his promising of remission of sinnes and eternall life to those that will fight his battailes or execute his wicked designes: by his doctrines of merites and works of supererogation, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Saints, of adoration of images and reliques, of pilgrimages, and in a word by all the doctrines almost of Poperie, I meane those, which bee peculier to the Pope and church of Rome, which are fayned words douised in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:25487:58"/>
diuellish pollicie to mainetaine their vnsatiable lust, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and couetousnesse. By all this which hath beene saide it plainelie appeareth that the Pope most worthilie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth to bee called the man of sinne: especiallie if you consider that in respect of diuerse of the aforesaide sinnes, hee is such a sinner as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was, who caused all Israell to sinne. For hee is not onelie an apostate, but also the heade of the catholike apostasie: not onelie an hereticke, but the false prophet and brocher of popish heresyes: not onelie an idolatour and adulterer, but also the cause and authour of these abominations in all the Christian world, making all sorts of men drunke with the wine of his fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="12">12 It remaineth therfore that we should consider whether the other two titles of Antichrist do belong to the Pope, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he is the sonne of perdition, and the outlaw or lawlesse person.

                  <hi>CHAP.</hi> 7. ¶ Of the miracles, or rather lying signes and wonders of Antichrist.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus much may suffice to haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the qualities and conditions of Antichrist: now we haue to intreat of his actions and effects. And first of his miracles as he calleth them, or rather, as the holy Ghost termeth them, lying signes and wonders. In speaking wherof I will not sticke to vse <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne grounds. For wheras there are <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de pont. Rom. cap. 15.</note> three things (as he saith) mentioned in the Scriptures concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the miracles of Antichrist, it shall appeare by the helpe of God, that all which the Scriptures haue foretold concerning this matter, doe most sitly agree to the Pope and church of Rome. The first is, that Antichrist and his followers should do many signes and wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders which they call miracles. For so saith our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24 (which prophecie, the Papists <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 24.</note> themselues vnderstand of Antichrist &amp; his adherents) <hi>They shal worke great signes &amp; wonders, insomuch that the very elect, if it were possible should be seduced.</hi> He saith, <hi>they</hi> shall worke great signes, &amp; not <hi>he,</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> because not onely Antichrist but his ministers also shall worke signes. And th'apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Antichrist, saith, his comming shalbe according to the <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 9.</note> efficacy of Sathan in all power in lying signes &amp; wonders. And likewise <hi>Iohn Apoc.</hi> 13. 13. affirmeth, that Antichrist worketh <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 13.</note> great signes in the sight of men. And that this note agreeth to the Pope &amp; church of Rome, it is most euident. For they abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with innumerable signes &amp; wonders which they cal miracles. Insomuch that there is among them almost no Saint or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of any sect, who is not renowmed for many faire mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: no temple or monastery of note, no image or reliques of saints vnto which the people went on pilgrimage, which was not famous for miracles: no doctrine which cannot be proued out of Scripture, that is to say, no point of popery which they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uo not commended to the people and authorised by such signes and wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders as they call miracles. And in regard of these
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:25487:60"/>
miracles (which they esteeme as a note of the true church) they contemne and despise all other churches, which doe not vaunt of miracles as they do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And yet notwithstanding, al their miracles are nothing worth: First, because they serue to confirme vntruths as shalbe shewed, &amp; therefore are not to be regarded. Secondly, because the vaine brag of manifold miracles amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g those that professe the name of Christ in these later times (wherein miracles need not for the confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods truth, which heretofore hath bin sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed) is so farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being a note of the true church, as that rather it is a plaine signe of false teachers, &amp; an euident marke of the Synagogue of Antichrist. For their owne deuises indeed &amp; doctrines of men do stil need signes &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Whosoeuer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not beleeue this doctrine, thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, neither will he beleeue though one should rise fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead to preach vnto <note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> him. Againe miracles are graunted not for the beleeuers, but for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that liue in infidelity. And as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Quisquis</hi>

                  <hi>me wary, saying, There shall arise in the last daies false prophets working signes &amp; wonders, that they might bring into errour, if it were possible, the very elect.</hi> Likewise <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> or whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <note place="margin">Chrysost homil. 49. in Matth.</note> was the authour of those learned Homilies vpon <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> in the 49. Homily (where hee proueth that the true Church of Christ cannot now bee knowne or discerned by signes or other meanes, but onely by the Scriptures) hee saith, that now the working of signes and wonders is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether taken away (namely among the true professours) and and the working of counterfeit miracles is more found among false Christians. And that, <hi>Peter</hi> in the history of <hi>Clement</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:25487:61"/>
that <hi>vnto Antichrist shalbe graunted the power of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king full, that is to say, profitable signes, So that now wee cannot knowe the ministers of Christ by this that they worke profitable signes, but because they worke no signes at all.</hi> And the Papists themselues confesse, yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would seeme to set it downe as one of his grounds, that to Antichrist and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers shalbe graunted the power of working many and great signes and wonders. And therefore vnlesse the Pope and his followers did vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their miracles, we should want one good argument to proue the Pope Antichrist. And thus it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the first point concerning the miracles of Antichrist doth fitte the Pope, and so fit him, as that from hence he may be proued Antichrist. <hi>For vnto whomsoeuer in these latter times this properly and onely belongeth, to boast of their myracles, they are Antichrist and the synagogue of Antichrist.</hi> For the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue foretold that by Antichrist and his adherents many signes and wonders should bee wrought in these latter times. <hi>But to the Pope &amp; church of Rome in these latter times this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and onely belongeth to vaunt of their manifold and great myracles.</hi> For the Iewes want them: the Turkes disclaime the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, professing that their religion must be propagated not by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles but by force &amp; armes. All other Christians which already beleeue the trueth, seeke not signes which they know among true beleeuers to be superfluous, and in others to be badges of Antichrist; therefore the Pope is Antichrist and the Church of Rome the Synagogue of Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The second thing which the Scripture noteth, is, what maner of myracles they are which Antichrist was to worke. This the Apostle (saith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> declareth in one worde, when hee calleth them <hi>Lying wonders,</hi> or as the wordes are, <gap reason="foreign">

Now they are called lying wonders either in respect of the end, which is to seduce men by confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vntrueths; or in regarde of their substaunce, which is counterfeit. And thus <hi>Chrysostome</hi> expoundeth the words of th'apostle, <gap reason="foreign">

For the Lord your God proueth you, to know whether you loue the Lord your God with all your soule, and with all your heart</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>there shall arise false Christs and false prophets which shall shew great signes and wonders, so that if it were possible they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euen the very elect.</hi> In like sort, the Apostle 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the comming of Antichrist shall be according to the <note place="margin">2.

Likewise <hi>Iohn</hi> the diuine prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 13. 14.</note> of Antichrist that he should <hi>do great wonders,</hi> whereby he should <hi>deceiue them that dwell on the earth.</hi> Hereby therfore it is euident, that false prophets and Antichrists many times haue power to worke great signes and wonders, not onelie in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:25487:62"/>
shewe and appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but in deed and in truth. Whereby they, indeauouring to deceiue all and to make them belieue lies, are permitted both in the iustice of God to seduce the wicked, &amp; in his mercy to try the faithfull. And therefore signes &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as they haue not alwayes bin signes &amp; tokens of true tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers &amp; professors of the truth, but onely then when they haue <note place="margin">Miracles are diuine testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies whereby the Lord doth beare witnesse to his truth. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4.</note> bin wrought for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of the truth: So in these later times, the same being wrought for confirmation of vntruthes are vndoubted signes of the synagogue of Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Let vs then consider whether such signes and wonders be wrought in the church of Rome. It is recorded of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. who was the first of the Popes which was openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be Antichrist, that as he was a notable sorcerer, so he wrought many signes and wonders: &amp; among the rest he vsed to shake fire out of his sleeues. And of his votaryes, after he had forbidden mariage in the clergy, <hi>Auentinus</hi> writeth <hi>that vpon that occasion many false prophets did as it were cast mists, and by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Annal. Boior. lib. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>fables and miracles did turne away the people of Christ from the truth.</hi> And againe, <hi>False prophets did then arise, false Apostles, false priests, who by counterfeite religion deceiued the people,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">lib. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>wrought great signes and wonders, and began to sit in the temple of God, and to bee aduanced aboue all that is worshipped. And while they endeuour to establish their owne power and dominion they haue extinguished Christian charity &amp; simplicity.</hi> And since those times the church of Rome hath much boasted of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold miracles, which haue beene partly deuised and partly wrought for the confirmation of such Antichristian doctrines &amp; idolatrous superstitions as cannot be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: as namely the absurd doctrine of transubstantiation, and adoration of the breaden God, the heathenish doctrine of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and superstitious prayer for the dead: the idolatrous inuocation and worshipping of Saints, the more then heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish adoration of images &amp; rotten reliques: the Antichristian aduancing of the Pope aboue all that is called God or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped: and such like doctrines of diuels &amp; lyes of Antichrist, for the confirmation whereof the miracles of the Apostaticall church of Rome haue bin inuented. But how many miracles
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:25487:62"/>
soeuer they produce for the countenancing of such vntruthes, they are so many arguments to proue their church Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, &amp; their Pope Antichrist. Because as Antichrist and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were in these latter times to abound with signes &amp; wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but alwayes such as serue to lead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into error: so neither Turks nor Iewes, nor any other churches of Christians, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Pope and church of Rome, do vaunt of miracles: and yet all their miracles are such as serue to deceiue men, &amp; to make them beleeue vntruthes. And therefore although they were in respect of their substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce neither counterfeit nor fabulous (as in deed the most of the miracles in the church of Rome are) yet were they to be esteemd as notes &amp; signes of false prophets &amp; Antichrists, because their end is to seduce me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; confirme lyes.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Secondly they are called lying signes in respect of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, being (as <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh) <hi>vel figmenta mendacium</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De vnitat. eccl. 16.</note>

And of them there are three degrees. For many of them were such fabulous fictions, ridiculous fables, incredible lyes, (whereof their legends and festiualls are full,) as none would euer beleeue, were they not intoxicated, &amp; made drunk with the whore of Bylons cuppe of fornications, and also giuen ouer of God to beleeue lyes. And these loud lyes and more then poeticall fictions were in such request in the church of Rome, that the records of them (I meane their legends &amp; festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualls and such like fabulous treatises) were both publickly and priuately read in the vulgar tongue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the holy scriptures were kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people in an vnknown la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage. The 1. degree then is of such miracles as neuer were indeed, nor yet in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nce, but in the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only of men besotted &amp; giuen ouer to beleue incredible vntruths. The 2. is of such as were pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tastical &amp; in appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce only as being crafty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of deceitful men, or iugling tricks of legerdemaine. As for example, the nodding or mouing, the smiling or frowning, the sweating or speaking of images, the apparitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of souls deceased, the manifold cures supposed to be wrought by saints departed or their images &amp;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:25487:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; such like. For of these two sorts there be innumerable won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders recorded, in their legends and festiualls &amp; liues of Saints, which are either altogether fabulous, as beeing reports of things which neuer were not so much as in appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>or if any such things haue bene done in the sight of men, they haue bin either praestigiatory conueyances of wicked men, or mere illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the diuell. The third degree is of such as were lying miracles in respect of the forme (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> speaketh) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though true in respect of the matter. For howsoeuer they were things truely done, yet they surpassed not the whole strength of nature: whereas true miracles are supernaturall, neither can bee wrought by any naturall causes whether knowne or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, but onely by the omnipotent power of God. And such lying signes are the principall miracles of the Apostaticall church of Rome. Neither is the Pope and al his adherents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to produce any one true miracle wrought by the finger of God for the confirmation of those doctrines which are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to that church, that is, to speake more plainelie, for the proofe of any point of popery. But all their miracles as they are lying signes and wonders in respect of their ende, so also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their substance, being either merely fabulous and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such things as neuer were not so much as in shewe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunce: or merely phantasticall, that is such things as were in shewe onely and not in truth: or merely natural and therefore but counterfeite miracles effected by the power of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Some of their owne writers confesse, that sometimes there is great deceiuing of the people in fained miracles by the <note place="margin">Nicol. Lyran. in Daniel. 14.</note> priests and their adherents for temporall gaine. And another saith, <hi>in the sacrament appeareth flesh, sometimes by the conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of men, sometimes by the operation of the diuell.</hi> I once did <note place="margin">Alexander de Hales.</note> see an image of Saint <hi>Nicolas</hi> as it was said, when it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others was burnt in the market place at Chester by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of my father then Bishoppe there, which was made with such a deuise that if one standing behind did pull a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine string which was in the back part thereof, it would moue the hand as if it blessed the people. But that it may appeare that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:25487:63"/>
in the Church of Rome were lying miracles, and that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish people were giuen ouer to beleeue lyes, I will for a taste recite a fewe examples out of their owne records. Their Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Legend (so called because as gold excelleth all other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals so that Booke <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> in lying.</note> excelleth all other bookes) in the inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body of S. <hi>Fremin</hi> the martyr, reporteth that after the Sunne had miraculously sent his beames through a stone wall vpon the graue, and thereupon they had digged there to find the body, there issued thence such a sweet smel as they weened they had beene in Paradise. Which odour spread it selfe not onely through the citie of <hi>Amiens</hi> where the body lay, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vnto diuerse other cities. The sweetnesse whereof as it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the people of diuerse cities to bring their oblations to this glorious Saint: so it cured some a farre off (as the Lord of <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency)</hi> from their diseases. But when this body was taken vp and caried in the citie of <hi>Amiens,</hi> straunge wonders were wrought. <hi>For then</hi> (that I may vse the wordes of the English Legend) <hi>the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts them moued, by the miracle of this Saint. The snow, that was that time great on the earth, was turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to powder and dust by the heat that was then: and the yse that hung on the trees became flowers and leaues: and the medowes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi> Amiens <hi>flowred &amp; became greene. And the Sunne which by his nature should goe lowe that day, ascended as high as shee is on S.</hi> Iohns <hi>day at noone in the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>mmer. And as men bare the body of this Saint, the trees enclined and worshipped the body, &amp; all maner sicke men of what malady they had, they receiued health in the inuention of the blessed body of S.</hi> Fremin <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Legend of S. <hi>Patricke</hi> the Irish Saint, by whose praier forsooth all venemous beastes were banished out of Ireland (for you may not thinke it was so before) wee read and reading smile, that on a time a sheepe being stollen, hee admonished all the people that whosoeuer had stollen it should within seuen daies restore it to the owner. The 7. daies being expired, the sheepe was not restored. <hi>Then</hi> (saith the Legend) <hi>S. Patricke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the vertue of God, that the sheepe should bleate and crie in the belly of him that had eaten it. And so it happened that in the presence of all the people the sheepe cried and bleated</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:25487:64"/>
                  <hi>in the belly of him that had stollen it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. In the Legend of the Annunciation of our Lady, wee are told of a noble Knight, who betooke himselfe vnto an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: and because hee was vnlearned, there was a Master as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed vnto him. But either hee was so dull or the inuenter of the tale so doltish, that in a long time hee could learne no more but these two words, <hi>Aue Maria.</hi> Which words as he alwaies had in his mouth whiles he was aliue, so they grew out of his mouth when hee was dead. <hi>For these wordes</hi> (saith the Legend) <hi>he had so sore imprinted in his heart that alwaies hee had them in his mouth, wheresoeuer hee was. At the laste hee died, and was buried in the Church-yarde of the brethren. It happened after that vpon his graue their grew a right faire Flowre de lyce, and in euery flower was written in letters of gold</hi> Aue Maria. <hi>Of which miracle all the brethren were marueyled, and they did open the sepulchre, and found that the roote of this Flowredelyce came out of the mouth of the said Knight, and anou they vnderstood, that our Lord would haue him honoured for the great deuotion he had to say these wordes,</hi> Aue Maria. Likewise in the booke of the conformities of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> which Booke I could wishe were more common, that Popery might appeare vnto all in her colours, there is a miracle recorded for the proofe of transubstantiation; that on a time frier <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> saying Masse did finde a spider in the Chalice, which hee would not cast out but drunke it vp with the blood. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rubbing his thigh, &amp; scratching where it itched, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der came whole out of his thigh without any harme to either. But if the bread and wine after consecration bee turned into the very body and bloud of Christ, then more maruellous and I am sure more true is the story of victor the Pope, and <note n="*" place="margin">An. 1154.</note> 
                  <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Archbishop of Yorke, and <hi>Henry</hi> of Lucemburgh the Emperour, all which were poisoned, the two first with that which was in the Chalice, and the Emperour with the hoste which a Monke had poisoned. And to these many more worthy miracles of the Church of Rome may be added. But you-will say, that howsoeuer their are many miracles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church of Rome glorieth, yet notwithstanding those
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:25487:64"/>
speciall miracles which are assigned to Antichrist in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, haue not beene wrought by the Pope or any of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This is indeed the third thing which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that whereas there are three examples of Antichrist his miracles, specified in the Scriptures: yet none of them haue bene wrought either by the Pope or any other in the church of Rome. But I answere, that of these three miracles one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not to Antichrist, as shalbe shewed hereafter, and the <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 15.</note> other two agree to the Pope. For howsoeuer <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other Papists from these groundes doe argue, that the Pope <note place="margin">The authour of the Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word.</note> is not Antichrist: yet from thence may the contrary be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. The former of these miracles is, that Antichrist or at least his ministers shall make fire come downe from heauen. The second, that hee shall cause the image of the beast to <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 13.</note> speake. These two miracles <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vnderstandeth literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from thence argueth thus; <hi>Antichrist or his ministers, shall make fire come downe from heauen, and shall cause the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the beast to speake. But neither the Pope of Rome at any time, nor any of his followers haue caused fire to come downe from heauen, nor yet made the image of the beast to speake, therefore the Pope is not Antichrist.</hi> The argument is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 13. literally vnderstood. For such is the absurde peruersenesse of the Papistes, that in other partes of Scripture which are simple and playne they doe hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mysticall and allegoricall sences: but in this Booke of the Reuelation which is moste mysticall and allegoricall, without all reason they insiste in the literall sence. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in that thirtenth chapter, where the holy Ghost spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the marke of the beast, which the followers of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ should receiue on their foreheads &amp; on their right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, they grossely vnderstande this of a reall and visible marke wherewithall men of all sortes should suffer themselues to bee branded as the slaues or cattell of Antichrist. Where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost speaketh of the image of the beast, which Antichrist puttoth life into and causeth to speake, they vnderstand it of a materiall image animated and made to speake. Where the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:25487:65"/>
holy Ghost speaketh of fire to come downe from heauen, they vnderstande it of materiall fire brought downe from heauen. Which course whosoeuer followeth in expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the prophecies in the Reuelation, must neuer looke to see them verified in the euent. The which I speake, not that literally they doe not agree to the Pope, but because (the mysticall sence being the more like to bee true) our aduersarie groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his argument wholy vpon the literall interpretation. But I will make it plaine that both these miracles agree to the Pope not onely in the mysticall sence, but also in the literall. And to that purpose let vs consider these miracles se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And first as touching that of fire, which Antichrist shall cause to descende from heauen, if it bee literally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, you shall perceiue that it agreeth to the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in diuerse Popish miracles there hath beene (as they say) fire brought downe from heauen. But seing the place is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee vnderstood mystically and allegorically, as well as other prophecies of the Reuelation: wee are not therefore by the comming downe of fire to vnderstand literally a reall des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending of materiall fire, but that which mystically in the Scriptures is meant by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming downe of fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. You are therefore to bee infourmed that descending of fire from heauen, in the Scriptures signifieth three thinges: 1. Gods approuing of the religion and sacrifices of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts: 2. His sending downe of the graces of his spirit vpon his children: 3. His vengeaunce executed from heauen vpon his enemies. For the first, it is cleare that the Lorde infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times vsed to testifie his approbation of the religion and sacrifices of his seruaunts, by sending fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to consume their sacrifice: in which respect hee is said to answere them by fire from heauen. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 9. 24 1. <hi>Chron,</hi> 21. 26. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 1. wherunto some adde <hi>Gen.</hi> 4, 4. <hi>Iud.</hi> 13. 19.

If therfore the Pope of Rome or his ministers haue, by as strange signes and wonders in the opinion of men, confirmed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as though God from heauen approued thereof, as hee was woont to signifie his approbation in answering by fire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen: they may be sayd to haue made fire to come down from heauen, although they neuer had caused materiall fire to descend. But if besides many other strange signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they call miracles, they haue confirmed their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious religion and Antichristian doctrines by bringing fire from heauen; then can it not be denyed but that this place doth most fullie and properly agree vnto them.

And therefore to countenaunce their abominable i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole of the masse, they haue in the sight, that is, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, opinion, and beliefe of men, caused fire to come downe from heauen that it might point out the body, &amp; from it reach to heauen.</p>

And it is a wonder that, hasting from so sharpe a banquet, they did not leaue their heades behind them for haste. Among manie other miracles they tell vs of fire also which they haue caused to come downe from heauen in the sight, that is iudgement and opinion, of men besotted and giuen ouer to beleeue their monstruous vntruthes. In the life of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> and <hi>Iacinct,</hi> they make fire to come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to kill <hi>Melancy</hi> the false accuser of <hi>Eugenne.</hi> They haue brought downe a pillar of fire reaching from heauen vnto the earth where the bodie of Saint <hi>Edward</hi> the Martyr lay. Vpon the head of Saint <hi>Martin</hi> as hee was saying masse they haue fetched downe a tongue of fire from heauen to make him equall as they say to the Apostles. In the fable of Saint <hi>George</hi> they make fire to come downe from heauen to burne the idoles with their temple and priestes. In the life of <hi>Barbara</hi> wee reade that when her owne father beeing her persecutour had drawne his sworde to slay her, shee was miraculouslie taken vp in a stone and caried into a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; where two shepheades were feeding their sheepe. And when one of them had bewraied her to her father, and shee in her charitie had cursed him, anone his sheepe became locustes and hee consumed into a stone. Then her father hauing apprehended her deliuered her to the iudge, who put her to death. Whereupon they bring downe fire from heauen to consume her father. Their doctrine of purgatorie and prayer for the dead, is confirmed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie wonders and strange apparitions of soules departed, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging masses for their deliuerance out of purgatorie. And in like manner it is reported that when <hi>Birstan</hi> the Bishoppe of Winchester staying all night in the churchyard, as his manner was, said ouer his psalmes for the soules departed, comming to these words <hi>requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to descend from heauen. When as they tell vs of a certaine Bishoppe, who, appearing in the clouds of heauen to another here vpon earth, did let some fire drop vpon him to giue him a tast of the torments in purgatorie. Besides these examples ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other might bee found if they were woorth the seeking in their fabulous writings, as also in some other of their storyes which testifie that diuerse times in the church of Rome, fire hath beene brought downe from heauen. But these which I <note place="margin">Ioan. Linturius in appead. ad fascic. tempor.</note> haue recited may suffice: in seeking and setting downe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I should haue thought my time and paines not wel bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (such are the ridiculous fooleries of popery, wherewith the churches in the time of darknesse haue beene pestered) sauing that I considered that the more incredible the report is of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish miracles, the more euidently it is proued, both that the Pope is Antichrist, and the Papists the followers of Antichrist, vpon whome God hath sent strong illusions that they might beleeue lyes. In the first sence therefore the prophecy <hi>Reuel.</hi> 13. doth fitte the Pope and church of Rome, who by greate signes and wonders do so confirme their Antichristian errours and superstitions in the sight, that is, in the iudgement, opinion, and beliefe of men besotted and made drunke with the whore of Babylons cuppe of fornications, as though God did seeme to approoue thereof in aunswering by fire from heauen. And this interpretation seemeth to be confirmed by the words; for it is not directly said that Antichrist should cause fire to come downe from heauen, but onely thus, that he doth great signes, insomuch that fire descendeth from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the sight of men. That is, insomuch that in the iudgement of men God seemeth to answere him by fire from heauen, and to beare witnesse to his doctrines by miracles wrought by the finger of God.</p>

In which sence the Pope may bee saide to make fire come downe from heauen, but wee must adde <hi>before men,</hi> that is in their opinion and conceipt. For he forsooth, as the church of Rome beleeueth, giueth not onely the graces of the spirite to men, but also the power of sanctification both to men and also

Thirdly, the comming downe of fire sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the wrathfull vengeaunce of God executed vpon his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, which often in the Scriptures is called fire, to wit, the <note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 9.</note> fire of Gods wrath. As <hi>Elias</hi> therefore brought fire from heauen to consume the two Captaines and their fifties: so Antichrist, according to this interpretation, shall with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine reuenge, as it were with fire from heauen, take vengeance vpon his aduersaries, but here also we must adde <hi>before men,</hi> who shall thinke that those against whom Antichrist shal send the thunderbolt of his wrath, are punished with a Diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, and as it were with fire from heauen. This also is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the Pope of Rome, who with a diuine reuenge (as he forsooth is <hi>Deus vindictae, The God of reuenge)</hi> pursueth his <note place="margin">R.

And well may this be reckened among the wonders of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. For it were more then a wonder, that Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours should by excommunications from the Pope bee either so daunted in themselues or abandoned of their subiectes as some haue beene, but that the Popes haue professed and their followers haue beleeued, that God himselfe doth whatsoeuer is done by the Pope, who being Canonically elected is a God vpon earth, and hath the same consistory and iudgement seate with God himselfe, whose vicar he would seeme to be; &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that those Kings and Emperours were deposed of God, who were excommunicated by the Pope: whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes and people that are not made drunke with the cuppe of their fornications haue esteemed their bulles of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication as <hi>Bullas</hi> that is bubbles, &amp; the fire of vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which they cause to descend in the sight of men, as painted fire, or as the thunder and lightning of <hi>Salmoneus,</hi> who (as the

                  <hi>&amp; sonitus imitatur Olympi, Imitateth the lightenings of Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the thunder of heauen.</hi> But howsoeuer it is, whether this descending of fire from heauen is to be vnderstood literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or mystically, the prophecy of the holy Ghost concerning this first miracle of Antichrist is verified of the Pope and church of Rome, who haue caused fire to come downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen according to the literall sence: &amp; according to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoricall interpretation they haue so confirmed their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines by signes &amp; wonders, as if God had answered them by fire from heauen: and secondly they haue taken vpon them to bring downe the fire of Gods spirite, and to bestowe his grace as it pleaseth them: and lastly, they haue according to the example of <hi>Elias</hi> with a diuine reuenge &amp; as it were with fire from heauen, taken vengeaunce of their enimies; not to speake of his punishing with fire all those that will not adore him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And thus much may suffice to haue spoken of the first miracle. The second miracle (saith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> is, that Antichrist or his ministers shall make the image of the beast to speake. But neuer Pope nor any minister of his did make an image to speake: therefore, saith hee, the Pope is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. But I answere that this prophecie euen according to the Popishe interpretation agreeth to the Pope and his followers, among whom it hath beene an vsuall practise to put life as it were into images in the sight and opinion of simple men, making them to sweate, to smile, to srowne, to nodde, to becke and many times to speake, which might happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle, for the Diuels sometimes did speake in the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Heathen. Notwithstanding wee are not after a Popishe, that is to say, a grosse maner, but after a propheticall and spirituall maner to vnderstand this mysticall prophecy of the holy Ghost concerning the image of the beast. For if wee vnderstand the beast it selfe mystically, as needes wee must, or else wee shall make but a beastly interpretation of it: so wee are in like sort to expound the image of the beast with the life and speach thereof. The beast it selfe signifieth the <hi>Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> state especially vnder the Heathenish Emperours as hath bene
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:25487:68"/>
shewed. The image therefore of the beast must signifie a state which hath some resemblaunce thereof, or at least the name and title of the Romane Empire, (as images beare the name of that which they resemble) and is indeed but an image thereof. Thus, besides the Popes courts both in Rome and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countreys, is the Empire renewed in the West, which besides the name and some titles and ornaments hath little or nothing of the olde Empire. For the old Empire consisted in the gouernment of Rome and the prouinces thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, none of which the Emperour hath as a Soueraigne Prince by right of the Empire, and therefore is said to bee the beast which was and is not though it be, being indeed, as it is <note place="margin">Apoc. 17.</note> here called, but an image of the former beast. The life of this Empire is the imperiall dignity, and the speach are his edicts. Whosoeuer therfore caused this Empire, which in the west had lien void 325. yeares, to be renewed: whosoeuer at the first cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated this Emperour, &amp; since hath taken order for the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Emperour, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he may be said to haue caused the image of the beast to be made, &amp; to haue put life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, &amp; to haue procured authority vnto it, wherby it speaketh.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now to whom all this is to bee applied, let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe be iudge. For he, in his bookes <hi>De translatione imperij Romani,</hi> by many testimonies laboureth to proue, first, that the Empire of Rome was translated, but he might better haue said renewed, in the West, and as it were reuiued by the authority of the Pope, and that <hi>Charles</hi> the great in whom this Empire was renewed, receiued the same by no other title but by the authority of the Pope. And that is the summe of his first booke. Secondly, that the Empire of Rome was translated from the family of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and from the French nation to the family of <hi>Otho,</hi> and the nation of the Saxons and Germanes, and that <hi>Otho</hi> was aduaunced to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by the Pope: which is the scope of the second Booke. Thirdly, that the seuen Electours of the Empire were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and appointed by the Pope, which is the argument of his third booke. And in his first booke he setteth downe the state <note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> of that controuersie thus: the question is (saith he) who is the

And elsewhere in their lawe it is said, <hi>Imperator tenet imperium a Papa, vnde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur praestare iuramentum homagij scil. quod vasallus praestare solet domino suo.

This image the Pope causeth to be made, this hee putteth life into, this he hath made to speake. For first he renewed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the west, after it had lyen voide by the space of 325. yeares, when hee annointed and crowned <hi>Charles</hi> the greate Emperour of the west, &amp; so caused him to be acknowledged: after he translated the Empire to the Almaines, among whom he hath appointed seauen electours as it were to renewe this image, but so as himselfe putteth life thereinto, by approuing the person and ratifying the election, &amp; maketh him to speake by annointing him Emperour and giuing vnto him the name and title of <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Caesar.</hi> Which things I shal not need further to proue, because they are matters wherof the Pope and Papists do greatly boast.

Here is wisedome: let him that hath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man: and his number is six hundreth sixty and six.</hi> Of which prophecie <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith thus. <hi>Fatentur omnes pertinere om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino</hi>

                  <hi>ad Antichristum verba illa Ioannis Apoc.</hi> 13, &amp;c. <hi>All men confesse that those words of</hi> Iohn Apoc. 13. <hi>doe vndoubtedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Antichrist.</hi> From this ground therefore we may reason thus. <hi>Whosoeuer enforceth all sorts of men according to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie to take vpon them the name of the beast, or the marke or number of his name, he is Antichrist: But the Pope of Rome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth all sorts of men according to this prophecy to take vpon them the name of the beast, or the mark and number of his name: therefore he is Antichrist.</hi> For the clearing of this argument, two things are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered. First, what this name, number, and marke is: Secondly, whether the Pope impose the same vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all sorts of men. The number is expressed in the text, to be 666. And it is plainelie saide to bee the number of the name. That we may not thinke it to be the number of the time when Antichrist should appeare as some haue imagined: neither can it in any good sence bee said that Antichrist inforceth men to take vpon them the number of that time. And it is called the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:25487:70"/>
number of the name, because in the letters of the name this number is contained. For it is the maner of the Hebrewes and Greekes to vse their letters for notes of number, according to their order in the Alphabet &amp;c. it is also called the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of a man, because (as it may seem) the name of the beast, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining this number, is also the name of a man. And this I take to bee the most simple interpretation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What the name is wherof the holy ghost here speaketh, it may easily be gathred out of the text. For 1. the holy ghost doth not speak of Antichrist his name properly, but of the name of the beast which Antichrist should cause al sorts of men to take vpon them. If therefore we know what the beast is, it will not be hard to tell what the name is. The beast whose name Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall compel men to take vpon them, is the former beast described in the beginning of the chapter. For so it is said, that Antichrist the second beast, exerciseth the authority of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer beast, that he causeth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to worship the first beast whose <note place="margin">v. 12.</note> deadly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was healed: that he causeth an image to be made <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> to the beast, that he giueth spirit to the image of the beast, that <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> he suffereth none to buy or sel which haue not the name of the <note place="margin">v. 17.</note> beast: which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be vnderstood but of the former beast. Now that beast described in the former part of the chapt. is without doubt the Roman or Latin state, as hath bin proued heretofore &amp; the Papists so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse; the name wherof without questi on is <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> If therfore the name <hi>Romane</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> in the learned to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues containe the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber 666. then the name of the beast which Antichrist causeth men to take vpon them, is <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> But in what la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage are we to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the beasts name? Surely either in Greeke which is most likely, because the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in greek: or in Hebrew because the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as some think) was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hebrew to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> being an Hebrewe borne: or else we may take the beasts name according to his own la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage set down in Hebrew cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, because the Latines doe not vse their letters as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes &amp; Greeks do in numeratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For seeing we know what the beast it self is, we might wel take that name which fitteth this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber any of these ways. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (whose master <hi>Policarpus</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:25487:71"/>
beene Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> disciple) reporteth, that those, who had seen <hi>Iohn,</hi> face to face, did teache, that the number of the name of <note place="margin">Lib. 5.</note> the beast <hi>according to the computation of the Greeks by the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which be in it,</hi> shall containe 666. Hee therefore setteth downe three names in greeke letters contayning that number: in two whereof there is no shew of reason that either of them should be this name, seeing neither of them (I meane <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) is the name of the beast. The third name, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereof hee writeth thus: <hi>Sed &amp;</hi>

                  <hi>nomen sexcentorum sexaginta sex numerum; &amp; valde verisimile est. Quoniam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissunum regnum hoc habet vocabulum, Latini enim sunt qui nunc regnant. But the name Lateinos also containeth the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 666. <hi>and it is verse likelie, because the most true kingdome hath this name. For they are Latines which now raigne.</hi> Which in effect is as much as if hee had saide, the name <hi>Latine</hi> is very likelie, because it hath the number 666. and is the name of the beaste which figureth <hi>verissimum regnum the most true king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that is the Latin or Romane state. The name of the beast <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 7.</note> therefore in greek contayning the number, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to say <hi>Latine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In Hebrew the beasts name comprehending that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is <hi>Romane.</hi> For the beastes name beeing a nowne or name collectiue, may indifferently, according to the maner of the Hebrewes, be vttered either in the Masculine or Foeminine gender. And the Foeminine termination doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitte the prophecy, not onely because it rendreth the iust number, but also because the beast as it is subiect to Antichrist beeing the adulterous Romane state, is elsewhere in the foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine called the whore of Babylon, and the mother of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The most vsuall name of the beast in it owne language, that is, the Latine tongue, <hi>is Romanus,</hi> which in Hebrewe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters is, as Master <hi>Foxe</hi> supposeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the knowledge whereof as himselfe reporteth hee attained by earnest prayer. And that the name <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Romane</hi> in the learned tongues is the name whereof the holy ghost speaketh, it appeareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause euery thing here spoken of the name, agreeth fitly and properly thereunto. For first it is the name of the beast. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:25487:71"/>
is containeth the number 666, as may appeare by this supp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Thirdly, it is such a name as he, to whom all other notes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist doe agree, (I meane the Pope) enforceth men to take vpon them, as shalbe shewed. Fourthly, because the name <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> or <hi>Romanus</hi> is also the name of a man. For <hi>Latinus</hi> was one of the auncient Kings of Italy, and <hi>Romanus</hi> was one of the Popes. Wherefore I doubt not to conclude that the name is <hi>Romane</hi> or <hi>Latins</hi> in the learned tongues. For howsoeuer many others names may be produced which comprehend the number 666, yet either they are not the name of the beast, or are such names as Antichrist was not to impose vpon men. But <note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 10.</note> of this, more here after.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now let vs see what that marke is whereof the holy Ghost speaketh. <hi>Chara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> or <hi>Character</hi> is as it were a cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance &amp; a note of difference wherby men of any profession, or religion, are knowne and distinguished from others. And it is partly in ward and partly outward. The inward is that which is imprinted in the soule: the outward is that which is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or receiued outwardly, as namely in the forehead, or in the right hand. In the forehead that is by outward profession, and in the right hand that is by operation, as the ordinary glose expoundeth. As for example, the character or marke of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian or seruant of Christ is subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Christ and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of him to be our head &amp; Sauiour. This inwardly is the grace of a true faith wrought in the soule by the finger of Gods spirit, wherby we beleeue in Christ our sauiour. For those that truly beleeue are sealed or signed to saluation. That which <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:25487:72"/>
outwardly is expressed, is either by consession of the mouth, or operation of the hands. In respect whereof, profession of the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith may truely be said to be the outward marke of a Christian, as also <hi>determinat us modus us viue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di &amp;c.</hi> (as the schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men speake) the certaine maner of liuing according to the law &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ. So that he which beleeueth with his hart &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth with his mouth that Iesus is Christ, &amp; withal frameth his life according to the law &amp; doctrine of Christ, he may be said to haue the marke of God <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9. 4. both in the heart by beleeuing, &amp; in the forehead by profession, &amp; in the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by operation. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. 10. &amp; 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the outward markes receiued to testifie our subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ &amp; our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with him, as also to distinguish vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men of other religions, are the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Christ, as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Lords supper. And thus you see the marke of a Christian which is but one in substance, namely the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Christ, is thus diuersly expessed &amp; testified.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The like may be said of the marke of the beast, which is also called the marke of his name. The beast as wee haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Apoc. 14. 11.</note> is the Romane state, the name is <hi>Romane</hi> or <hi>Latine.</hi> The marke therfore of the beast is that whereby they of the Romish or Latine religion whom we call Papists, are distinguished fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, that is their subiection vnto the Pope as their head and acknowledgement of the See of Rome. This inwardly in the soule is their implicite faith: whereby euery Papist is bound hand ouer head to beleeue whatsoeuer the Pope or Church of Rome beleeueth: and the rather because they are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that neither of both can erre. That which outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is expressed is either by confession of the mouth or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hands. So that the profession of the Romishe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and certaine maner of liuing according to the Lawes and customes of the Pope and church of Rome, may also be said to be the marke of Antichristians: euen as the obseruation of the Heathenish rites is called 2. <hi>Macah.</hi> 4. 10. the Character of the Graecians. Who soeuer therfore in heart beleeueth whatsoeuer the Pope &amp; church of Rome do or shall beleeue, &amp; outwardly professeth the Romish religion &amp; frameth his life according to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25487:72"/>
the lawes &amp; customes of the church of Rome, as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to fal downe before images, to adore the Eucharist, to freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Masse &amp;c. he may be truly said to haue the marke of the beast. Moreouer the outward marks receiued to testifie their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the church of Rome, are certaine sacraments of their holy mother church, which as they say do <hi>imprimere charactere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indelebilem, imprint a character that cannot be done away,</hi> and therfore are not to be iterated, as namely their sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; orders. In the former wherof (which they prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptisme) all you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ones are anointed in the forehead with oile, which they cal <hi>Chrisma salutis, The Chrisme of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; without which they will haue none to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted christians. <hi>Nunqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erit Christianus</hi> (say they in their law) <hi>nisi co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmatione</hi>

                  <hi>episcopali fuerit Chrismat us.</hi> In the latter, those of their clergy besides their shauing on their heads, are anointed also on their heads, as Bishops, or on their hands as Priests. Thus you see al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so how the Characteristicall note or marke of Antichristians which is one in substance, namely subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Pope &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the See of Rome, is diuersly expressed &amp; testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Whosoeuer therfore since the reuelation of Antichrist is a <hi>Romane</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> in respect of his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, acknowledging the Popes supremacy, &amp; professing himselfe a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the church of Rome, that is to say, in one word euery resolued Papist, hath the marke of the beast, his name and number of his name.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now it remaineth that, by application of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Pope, I should shewe that <hi>hee causeth all both small and great, rich and poore, free and bonde, that hee should giue them a marke in their right hand or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, saue hee that had the marke, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thus much is meant, that Antichrist by his vsurped do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and tyranny should make all sortes of men subiect vnto him, and to testifie their subiection both by wordes and deed: and that hee should suffer none to liue among them or to enioy the benefites of humane society, but such as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the See of Rome, professe themselues members of the Romane church, and vse the Latine religion and seruice.

               <p n="11">11. Hereby it appeareth that the Pope causeth the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth to worship the beast with seuen heads, that is, seuen hilles: that with the citie of Rome (which wee haue proued to bee the whore of Babylon) the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth haue committed spirituall fornication, and that with the cuppe of her fornications they haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated and made drunke. And that the Pope hath caused men vpon paine of death to worshippe the image of the <note place="margin">3.</note> beast which he hath animated and put life into, it is easie to proue, whether you vnderstande it literally or mystically. For literally, as they haue put life and motion into images and made them to speake in the sight of men: so haue they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered none to liue that would not participate with them in their idolatry which they call worshipping of images. My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:25487:76"/>
the image signifieth either the Popes court, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire renewed, or both: the one resembling the authority and power, the other bearing the name and representing the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the old Empire. Of the Popes court at Rome, and of his Legates and Officers abroad there is no question to bee made, but that none are suffered to liue which worshippe not them. And it is true also of the Empire. But by worshipping the image of the beast, wee doe not vnderstand obedience to the Emperour in his lawfull decrees: but the obedience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto him as hee is an image of the persecuting Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, inspired by the Pope, and seruing as his minister to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish and propagate the Romish religion. In this sence as hee who obeyeth him worshippeth the image of the beast, and is in the same predicament with those that receiue the marke of the beast, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 9: So hee that obeyeth him not is put to death; and dying in this quarell is in the same happy state with <note place="margin">Apoc. 14, 13. 15. 2.</note> those which refuse to receiue the marke of the beast.</p>

                  <hi>to the beast,</hi> meaning Antichrist: and that in his quarell <hi>they shall fight against</hi> Christ <hi>the lambe</hi> in his members. But the <note place="margin">v. 14.</note> bloud of Martyrs being the seede of the Church, and the truth preuailing when it is most oppugned: Christ by the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his Martyrs and preaching of his word <hi>ouercommeth.</hi> For though in respect of the manner of his resistance hee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a meeke lambe: yet hee shall be sure to ouercome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>he is the king of kings and Lord of Lords;</hi> being able by weake and foolish things (as they are esteemed in the world) to ouercome the wise and strong. And howsoeuer those fewe in comparison that stoode with him were condemned for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and schismatickes, yet <hi>are they the called, chosen, and faithful</hi> seruants of the Lord. Whereas contrarywise the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall multitudes (whereof the catholicke apostasy consisteth) are the slaues of Antichrist, and subiect to the whore of Babylon. For <hi>the waters whereon she sitteth, are peoples and multitudes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>and tongues.</hi> But when as our Sauiour Christ shall disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Antichrist, and by the ministery of the word, as it were the breath of his mouth, waste and consume him: then shal the ten kings, which before had ioyned with him, set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against him: and those which <hi>before had committed fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with</hi> the <note place="margin">v. 2.</note> whore of Babylon, <hi>shall hate her and make her desolate and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi>

                  <hi>and shal eate her flesh and shall burne her with fire.</hi> And that this decay of the Antichristian state doth follow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the gospell, it appeareth <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 6. 7. 8. where it is said that vpon the preaching of the euerlasting Gospell, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell saith, <hi>It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon that great city: for shee gaue to all nations to drinke the wine of the wrath of her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">v. 17.</note> For vntill this time that Christ discouer Antichrist and in some measure consume him with the spirite of his mouth, the ten kings are giuen ouer of God to support with one consent the beast and purple harlot; whome, after Antichrist is discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they shall hate and oppugne.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But let vs come to the application. For euen as from this place I proued before that Antichrist is already come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so may I now from hence conclude that the Pope is that Antichrist. That Antichrist is come, it is as certaine as that the prouinces
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25487:77"/>
of the Empire are not ruled by deputyes of the Emperour, but by soueraigne princes, who haue together with Antichrist di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the Empire among them. And that the Pope is that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist it is as certaine. For he it is, who, as well as the kings, hath risen by the decay of the Empire in the west: he it is, and no other, to whome these kings haue with one consent giuen their strength and power, submitting themselues vnto him as his vassalls, swearing to mainetaine and support him, fighting his battailes and drawing their sword at his becke. And being made drunke with the cuppe of his fornications they fought against the lambe, and persecuted those seruaunts of Christ whom Antichrist condemneth as hereticks and schismaticks: who notwithstanding are in truth the called, chosen, &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; though few and despised in the world. When as contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the vniuersality of people whereon the whore of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon sitteth, and whereof the adulterous church of Rome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth, are but the branded slaues of Antichrist. But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer these kings, whiles they were besotted and giuen ouer of God in his iust iudgement that they should submit themselues to the Antichrist of Rome, did seeke by all meanes to support him: yet when Christ had discouered him to be Antichrist, and by the preaching of his word as it were the spirit of his mouth began to waste &amp; consume him, and more and more since the times of <hi>Luther</hi> to abate the opinion which men had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of him; then these princes, not al, but some of them, began to reuolt from Antichrist, and to hate the Antichristian whore <note place="margin">See chap. 2. §. 11.</note> of Babylon the city and church of Rome, and as much as in them lyeth haue left her desolate and naked: and the rest in Gods good time shall accomplish his will. For this prophecie concerning that which Antichrist was to suffer, is as yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but in part. And still there remaineth to bee fulfilled the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall destruction of Rome the seat of Antichrist, before the end of the world, soretold <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. and the finall ouerthrowe of Antichrist at the glorious appearing of Christ at his second comming, prophecied 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19. 20. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichrist the great enemy of Christ and his church is to be ouerthrowne by these three meanes, by the powerfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25487:78"/>
of the word, by the puissaunt strength and power of Christian princes, by the glorious comming of Christ to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all faithfull ministers are to bee stirred vp seriouslie and earnestly to oppose themselues against Antichrist, that by their ministery as it were the spirite of Christs mouth, he may bee more and more wasted and consumed. All true Christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be excited not onely to hate the whore of Babylon, but also according to the prophecie of the holy ghost to make her desolate and naked, to eate her flesh and burne her with fire, &amp; to do to her children as she hath done to the seruants of Christ. And finallie all sound Christians are to be exhorted, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly <note place="margin">Apoc. 18. 6.</note> and continuallie to pray that the Lord Iesus would not onely consume Antichrist, giuing successe to the ministerie of his seruants: but also that he would hasten his second coming and destroy him at his glorious appearing. <hi>Euen so Lord Iesu, come quicklie.</hi> And thus haue I shewed that the prophecyes of <note place="margin">Ap. 22. 17. 20.</note> the holy ghost in the scriptures concerning Antichrist <note place="margin">Conclus.</note> do most fitly and properly agree to the Pope of Rome: whereupon I doe necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that therefore the Pope of Rome is the graund Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ described in the scriptures.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing in the former Booke sufficiently prooued by euident demonstration out of the worde of God, that the Pope of Rome is Antichrist: it remaineth that we should maintaine this our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion against the arguments of the Papists. For as the force &amp; euidence of our proofes may perswade vs to embrace this truth; so the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sophistry, which appeareth in the obiections of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries may confirme vs in this perswasion. And the rather if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either the weight of this controuersie it selfe, or their will and skil to maintaine their part; or lastly the aduantage which they seeme to haue in this controuersie. For first the controuersie it selfe is of such consequence, as that if our assertion be true, then is all Popery ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and all controuersies betwixt vs and them easily decided: then are all Papists limmes of Antichrist, and all their doctrines pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them, errours of Antichrist. And if you respect their will, you neede not doubt, but that they, being wholy deuoted vnto the Pope, haue done their best endeuour to free their head and Lord from all imputation of Antichristianisme. And for their skill, they beeing men of great learning and much reading, you may bee well assured that they haue scarcely omitted any thing, which may be said in so waighty a cause. And questionlesse, they haue no small aduantage in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25487:80"/>
this controuersie being to prooue the negatiue part. For whereas we cannot prooue the affirmatiue but by the concurrence of those mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold properties and markes which the holy Ghost hath assigned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Antichrist: they on the other side haue libertie to disprooue the same, and to prooue the negatiue, if they can but shew plainly &amp; eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that any one seuerall and essentiall marke, ascribed vnto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in the Scriptures, dooth not agree to their Lord God the Pope. For if the Scriptures foretell vs as touching the place, that Antichrist shall haue his seat in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, Rome, which being situated on seauen hils, had in the Apostles time vnder the Emperour, and since vnder the Pope, dominion ouer the Kings of the earth, and that in Rome, professing her selfe the Church of God, because it is said, that Antichrist shall sitte in the Temple of God: as concerning the time, that he should sit in Rome, after the remoouing and taking away of the Emperours, whom hee was to succeed in the gouernement of Rome, as hath beene shewed out of these places, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 7. 8. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. and 17. and in respect of his conditions and qualities, that he should be for opposition an aduersary, although a disguised enemy; for pride and ambition, aduancing himselfe aboue all that is called God: for his other vices, a man of sinne in generall, and more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an horrible idolatour: in regard of his effects, that he and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers should be workers of signes and wonders, in the sight of men, that he should compell all sorts of men to receiue the marke or name of the beast, or number of his name: and lastly, for that which he was to suster, that Christ shall consume him with the breath of his mouth, that is, the Ministerie of the Gospell; and that thereupon the ten hornes which first assisted him, shall afterwards assault him: It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth therefore, that vnto such as we affirme to be Antichrist, all these notes are to be applied, (as we haue applied them all to the Pope of Rome) whereas contrariwise the deniall of any one essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall propertie, is an argument sufficient to prooue the negatiue. As for example, if any man will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ake vpon him to prooue, that the Turke is Antichrist, because some of the markes seeme to fitte him, he shall neuer bee able to prooue it, because all the properties doe not agree vnto him. For neither hath he his seat in Rome, neither dooth he sit in the Church of God, neither is he a couert and disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but an open and professed enemie: neither may he be matched
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25487:80"/>
with the true Antichrist, either in aduancing himselfe aboue all that is called God, or in idolatrie, or in lying signes and wonders, &amp;c. And from any of these we may reason thus. Antichrist was to haue his seat in Rome, which is mysticall <hi>Babylon:</hi> the Turke hath not his seat there: therefore he is not Antichrist.

Let vs therefore consider their arguments, and conceits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon their arguments are grounded: not as they are propounded by the elder Papists, which liued in the daies of our forefathers (for their conceits concerning Antichrist were meere dotages) but as they are deliuered by the refiners of Poperie the Jesuits, and namely by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> whose bookes are as it were a shot whereunto many of them, as it seemeth, haue contributed. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore in his third booke <hi>De pontifice Romano,</hi> reduceth all his arguments to nine heads. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the name Antichrist. 2. Concerning his person, whether he be but one man, or a state and succession of men. 3. Concerning the time of his comming, and death. 4. Of his proper name. 5. Of his nation &amp; followers. 6 Of his seat. 7. Of his doctrine and maners. 8. Of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. 9. Of his reigne &amp; battels. From all which he hopeth (although in vaine) to prooue, that the Pope is not Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

                  </gap> is not once vsed. Notwithstanding we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his ground: that we are so to vnderstand the word Antichrist, as it is vsed in the Scriptures. Now it is vsed in the epistles of <hi>Iohn</hi> onely,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25487:81"/>
and there ascribed not to open and professed enemies, but to such as being enemies, notwithstanding professed the name of Christ, as the heretiques of those times. Thirdly, <hi>al those authors</hi> (saith he) <hi>which haue written of Antichrist, haue vnder that name vnderstood a notable false Christ, who shall affirme himselfe to be Christ.</hi> If they meane that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall be such a false Christ, as shall plainly and directly affirme himselfe to be Christ the onely Messias, that affirmation agreeth not with that Antichrist whom the Scriptures describe. If they hold that although in words he professe himselfe a follower and seruant of Christ, and yet indeed obtrudeth himselfe vpon the Church, as if he were Christ, taking vpon him the titles, attributes, offices and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christ, which in effect is as much as if he should say; I am Christ (Christ being a name of office) we also confesse so much, and withall professe, that the name Antichrist in this signification, most fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth vnto the Pope. Fourthly, he alleadgeth <hi>Henry Stephen:</hi> but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor any approoued Author denieth, but that <hi>Antichristus</hi> may signifie him, who being an enemy of Christ, professeth himselfe to be his vicar. And therfore all these foure arguments are friuolous: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh <hi>Antichrist</hi> do signifie an enimy to Christ, yet that doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that it may signifie him which is the Vicar of Christ; because he which in profession is the vicar of Christ, may indeed be the enemy of Christ. 2. Because the compositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word importeth so much. 3, Because the beast which figureth Antichrist, is said to haue two hornes like the Lambe: for horne in the Scripture signifieth power, &amp; the two hornes his two-fold soueraigne power: whosoeuer therefore challengeth this twofold power, as the Vicegerent of Christ he hath two hornes like the lambe: and the same person, as he is the Vicar of Christ in profession, so is he also that Antichrist, which is resembled by the two horned beast. The Scriptures therefore describe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, both as an enimy of Christ, and as the Vicar of Christ: an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie indeed, and Vicar in profession.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And so much of his proposition, which we hold to be most true, that Antichrist according to the signification of the word, is <hi>host is &amp; aemulus Christi,</hi> but withall we adde, that the word may signifie also such an aduersary as obtrudeth himselfe vnto the Church, as a <hi>Prochri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> that is, as a vicar of Christ. Let vs therfore come to his assumption, &amp; consider how he proueth that the Pope is not <hi>hostis &amp; aemulus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti, An enemy, &amp; one that seeketh to match himselfe with Christ.</hi> Forsooth,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25487:82"/>
                  <hi>because the Pope confesseth himselfe to be the seruant of Christ, and subiect vnto him in all things: neither doth he by any meanes say, that he is Christ, nor make himselfe equall vnto him.</hi> As if he should say, he that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himselfe to be the seruant of Christ, is not an enemy of Christ, and he that dooth not call himselfe Christ, nor make himselfe equall vnto him, he is not <hi>aemulus Christi.</hi> As touching the former, I answer, that vnlesse the Pope did confesse himselfe to bee the seruant of Christ, he could not be such an aduersarie as Antichrist is described to be in the Scriptures, that is, a couert and disguised enemy, who vnder the name and profession of Christ, oppugneth Christ and his truth. And what though he professe himselfe to be the seruant of Christ, dooth it therefore follow, that he is not an enemy to Christ? Surely no more then it followeth, he is <hi>Seruus seruorum Dei</hi> indeed, because he calleth himselfe so.

And that the Pope is <hi>aemulus Christi,</hi> that is, an aduersarie opposed vnto Christ in emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of like honour, we haue prooued heretofore at large, shewing how in many things he matcheth himselfe with Christ, and in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things aduanceth himselfe aboue him. So that the former part of his speech dooth not prooue his assumption, as being inconsequent, the latter needeth proofe, as being vntrue. And yet this is all that he bringeth to prooue, that the Pope is not <hi>hostis &amp; aemulus Christi.</hi> But the vntruth of this assumption, we haue heretofore demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at large, when as we concluded thus: He that is such an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie as is described in the Scriptures, opposed vnto Christ in emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of like honour, he is Antichrist as the Papists confesse: But the Pope is such an aduersarie as is described in the Scriptures, opposed vnto Christ in emulation of like honour, as we then prooued at large: therefore the Pope is Antichrist. <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 4. et. 5.</note>

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He second argument which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vseth, to prooue, that the Pope is not Antichrist, is drawne from the person of Antichrist, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that Antichrist is one certaine man, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Popes haue beene many. His reason is thus framed: Antichrist is but one singuler person.</p>
               <p>The Pope (meaning the order or succession of Popes) is not one singuler person.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Pope is not Antichrist.</p>
               <p>To the proposition I answere, that as the Pope is one, so is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. The Pope is one person not in number and nature, as one certaine and singuler man, but one at once by lawe and institution, though successiuely so many as haue enjoyed the Papacie. For euen as the Papists when they say, that the Pope hath beene the head of the Church and Vicar of Christ these 1500. yeares, doe not meane <note place="margin">See lib. 1. cap. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. 4.</note> any one Pope, but the order and succession: so we when we say, that the Pope hath beene Antichrist almost these thousand yeeres, wee meane not any one Pope onely, but the whole rowe or rabble of them since the yeere 607. And thus Antichrist, that is, the head of the Antichristian body, which was reuealed after the taking away of the Romane Empire, &amp; is to continue after a sort, vntill the end of the world, is one person: one I say at once ordinarily, but continued in a succession of many. The proposition thus denied by vs, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to confirme by authoritie of the Scriptures, and testimonies of the Fathers. Out of the Scriptures he produceth fiue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The first out of the Gospell of <hi>Iohn,</hi> chapter 5. verse 43. <hi>I am</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25487:83"/>
one singuler person: And that he would prooue by testimonies of the Fathers, and foure reasons. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the rest of the Papists, which make this collection out of this place, either ignorantly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, or wilfully depraue this text. For first, whereas our Sauiour Christ speaketh indefinitely, of any false teacher which should come vnto them in his owne name, that is, not sent of God, they expound him, as if he had spoken definitely of one singuler Antichrist. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas Christ speaketh not onely indefinitely, but also conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, <hi>If another come,</hi> they expound him, as if in a simple and proper axiome or proposition he had prophecied of the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ: as if he had said, that other counterfeit Messias, that is to say, that singuler Antichrist, sha'l come in his owne name, and him you will receiue. And thirdly, whereas Christ speaketh of those Iewes to whom he speaketh, they vnderstand him to speake of those which shalbe in the end of the world. But let vs consider his proofes. The Fathers, saith he, doe testifie that these words are spoken, <hi>de vno An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristo,</hi> of one Antichrist. First I answer, that although diuers of the Fathers expound these words of Antichrist, yet none of them hath that word <hi>Vno,</hi> one: and therefore the Iesuites collection is absurde. The Fathers vnderstand this place of Antichrist, therefore Antichrist is one singuler person. For the Fathers also vnderstand that place <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. of Antichrist, where our Sauiour Christ speaketh in the plurall number, of false Christs, and false Prophets which should arise; and confer that place with this. And therefore they may seeme to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this speech of our Sauiour, as if he had said: If another come <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 5. 24.</note> in his owne name (as many indeed shall come) such will you receiue. And sure it is, that the Iewes haue receiued more then one of such as haue come in their owne name. And secondly I answer, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had no reason to restraine these words vnto Antichrist alone, as though Christ had prophecied of the Iewes receiuing of Antichrist for their Messias, seeing his speech is neither simple nor definite, but conditionall and indefinite. Whereby our Sauiour Christ would shew the vntoward disposition of the Iewes, who as they rejected him who was sent of God, so they would be ready to receiue any other that should come in his owne name, not sent of God. And so <hi>Nonnus</hi> in his Paraphrase vpon this place, expoundeth these words. Ei <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>But if any other come, &amp;c.</hi> And lastly, if these answers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25487:83"/>
will not suffice, let the aduersary conclude his argument drawne from the authoritie of the fathers in a Syllogisme, and when he hath so done, let him prooue the proposition, which must be this: <hi>whatsoeuer those fathers write concerning Antichrist is true:</hi> and then the assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is to this effect, <hi>but this those fathers write that Christ speaketh those words, de vno Antichristo, of one singuler Antichrist,</hi> &amp; then (which will neuer be) I will yeeld to the conclusion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But omitting his testimonies, let vs come to those arguments which he draweth out of the text, to proue that Christ in these words speaketh of one singuler Antichrist. First saith he, <hi>Christ opposeth vnto himselfe another man, that is, person to person, as appeareth by these words, I, another, &amp;c.</hi> His reason is thus to be framed, where these two words, <hi>I,</hi> and <hi>another,</hi> are opposed one to the other, we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that as <hi>I</hi> signifieth one singuler person, so also <hi>another:</hi> but in this place, <hi>I,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> are opposed: therfore &amp;c. I answere, where the other is taken definitely for that other, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is vsed <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. 16. and 20. 2. 3. 4. there the proposition may be true. But where it is vsed indefinitely, as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>another,</hi> in this place, it is most false: for in such speeches, to a certaine and definite person, is opposed an indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and vncertaine. As for example <hi>Iob.</hi> 31. 8. <hi>What I sow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I haue laide the foundation &amp; another buildeth thereon, but let euery one take heed how he buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereon. Such examples are ordinary. As if I shoud say, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I call a childish reason, another would call it a dotage, and so I let it passe. His second reason is this: <hi>Whom the Iewes shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue for their Messias, he is but one particular man: Antichrist shall be receiued of the Iewes for their Messias, as Christ here saith: therefore Antichrist is but one singuler man. Answer.</hi> Christ dooth not here foretell that Antichrist shalbe receiued of the Iewes for their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias.</hi> For first, his speech is conditional, therefore not a prophecie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he foretel what they were to do, but sheweth them what in respect of their present disposition they were ready to doe, if any false teacher should obtrude himselfe vnto them. Secondly, it is indefinite, and therfore not to be restrained to a certaine person. Thirdly, he doth not say, that they shall receiue another for their <hi>Messias</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in his owne name, but onely that they shall receiue him. Fourthly, those Iewes to whom &amp; of whom our Sauior speaketh, were not to be aliue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25487:84"/>
at the comming of the great Antichrist, according to the opinion of the Papists themselues, therefore our Sauiour speaketh not of the Iewes receiuing of Antichrist, &amp; much lesse of Antichrist as one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person. <hi>Thirdly</hi> (saith he) <hi>all false prophets come in the name of another, not in their owne name. But Christ here speaketh of one that should come in his owne name, therefore he speaketh not of false prophets.</hi> He might as well haue concluded against the Scriptures, that Antichrist is not a false prophet. For false prophets, saith <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> come not in their owne name, Antichrist commeth in his owne name: therefore if <hi>Bellarmines</hi> argument be good, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist is not a false Prophet. But I answere, that Antichrist and all other false Prophets may be said to come both in their owne name, and also in the name of God. In their owne name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not sent of God, in which sense our Sauiour Christ here speaketh, I am come, saith he, in my fathers name, sent from the bosome of my father who hath sealed and sent me to this worke of mediation, and you receiue me not: If another shall come in his owne name, not sent from God, or as <hi>Lyra</hi> expoundeth those words, <hi>in nomine suo, in his owne name,</hi> that is, not hauing the aforesaid testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from God, whereby to warrant his calling from him, such will you receiue. They are said also to come in the name of God and of Christ, because they pretend (although falsely) a calling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from God. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 14. 14. 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 5. For whereas <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> expoundeth these words thus, in his owne name, that is, shall not acknowledge any God, but aduance himselfe aboue all that is called God, and assigneth such a comming to the expected <hi>Messias</hi> of the Iewes, it is absurde. For the Iewes expect a <hi>Messias</hi> to be sent them from God. And therefore if any shall take vpon him to be their <hi>Messias,</hi> and be receiued of them, he will without doubt professe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be sent of God. And such a one may be said to come in his owne name, because he is not sent of God, and in Gods name, because he pretendeth a calling and commission from him. Fourthly (saith he) <hi>if Christ had spoken of false Prophets, whereof many were to come, he would not haue said, if another come, but many come: but the second is false, therefore the first.</hi> I answere, if Christ had spoken simply and definitely, one other shall come, there had beene some shew of reason in the argumentation of the aduersary.

For <hi>Iohn</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 22.</note> plainely affirmeth that those many heretickes and deceiuers of his time, are the Antichrist.

From which places I argue thus. If <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the Antichrist. Wherfore in respect of those heretickes and lims of Antichrist in the Apostles times; Antichrist is then said to haue entred, and as it were, to haue set his foote into the world. And accordingly the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 7</note> that euen in his time the mystery of iniquity, that is, Antichristianisme was working (namely by those which belonged to the body of Antichrist) although couertly and vnderhand, vntill the head of that body was reuealed as he was, after the Empire in the West was dissolued, and the Emperour which hindred was done out of the way; according to the prophecie of the Apostle, 2. <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians.</hi> 2. 7, 8. And thus you see what a slender argument this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:25487:87"/>
is taken from the article, although it be vsed as one of the principall demonstrations generally of all the Papists, that write of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but more especially of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who thinking it too good to goe for one argument, hath deuided it into two.</p>
               <p n="7">7 His fourth testimonie is taken out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 7. 11. &amp; 12. <hi>Where Antichrist is called a King, and not a Kingdome, who of the ten Kings which he shall finde in the worlde, shall take away three, and shall make the other seauen subject to himselfe.</hi> But I answer, that <hi>Daniel</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of Antichrist at all, but of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this allegation is impertinent. For the learned of our times haue made it euident, that the foure kingdomes whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh, were ended before the incarnation of Christ: and that the fourth kingdome which many haue taken to be the monarchie of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> was the kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> so farre forth as the people of <hi>Iewrie</hi> was subject thereunto, and is therefore described as the most terrible of all the foure, because it was most trouble some to the Iewes. And that the ten hornes were ten Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> which successiuely tyrannized ouer the people of the Iewes; <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> being the tenth and the last of those Kings which tyrannized ouer Iewrie. But because in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious cruelty and cursed hostility, not onely against the people, but also against the religion of the Iewes, he surpassed all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; of him therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh so plainely and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he hath seemed to some rather to write an Historie of him, then a Prophesie; as shall hereafter more fully be shewed, when as <note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> we shall also manifestly declare that this which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth concerning Antichrists killing of three Kings, and subduing of the other seauen, is but a dreame, which is indeed so farre from all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of truth, as that it cannot be verified of that party whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> describeth. <hi>Daniel</hi> describeth him as the tenth: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh him the eleuenth, as if it were a beast of eleuen hornes. <hi>Daniel</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of ten Kings, which successiuely ruled ouer the Iewes: <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> maketh him speake of ten, who together with the eleuenth, should be at one time in the world. Of those ten <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, that three were pluckt vp before the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th, &amp; as it may seeme by his means, but of the other sixe, either all or the most were dead before he was borne: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh him to kill three and subdue the other
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25487:88"/>
seauen, which indeed liued not in his time, as shall be shewed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of the eleuenth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the succession of these ten Kings, and the affaires of the tenth, who can be no other but <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanes,</hi> are particularly and fully described. This argument drawne from the misconstruing of <hi>Daniel, Bellarmine</hi> although he knew it to be nothing worth, yet he was content to make a flourish with it, because he had some of the Fathers to father it vpon. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he commeth nearer to the purpose, and saith, that <hi>Caluin,</hi> as some of the Fathers before him, to wit, <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Ierome,</hi> affirmeth, and so doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe else where, that <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who was a type of Antichrist. Therefore leauing his former hold, he reasoneth thus: <hi>Such as is the type or figure, such is the thing figured:</hi> Antiochus <hi>the type was but one singular person, therfore Antichrist that is figured is but one.</hi> The proposition is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the proportion and likenesse onely in those things, in respect whereof the type is a figure, and not generally in all things. As for example, the High-priest was a type or figure of Christ, but therefore it doth not follow that there was but one High-priest, because Christ is one. The Papists holde that <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> who was but one, was a type of their Masse Priests, which are many. <hi>Iosuah, Dakid</hi> and <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> were types of Christ, but therefore not like vnto him in all things. So <hi>Antiochur</hi> may not vnfitly be said to haue beene a type of Antichrist; because as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a type of other tyrants which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the Church of God: so he in falshood deceit, pride, idolatry, cruelty, and persecuting of the Church of God, resembled Antichrist the man of sinne, which is an enemie, and is listed vp about all that is called God, or that is worshipped. In which respects <hi>Antiochus</hi> was so fit a type of Antichrist, that <hi>R. Leui Gerson</hi> alledged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the end of the 12. chap. applieth whatsoeuer is spoken of him <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> If therefore you vnderstand the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position generally, it is false: if particularly, the whole argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a fallacion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His fift testimonie is <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>For these places are to be vnderstood of Antichrist, as</hi> Irenaeus <hi>teacheth, and as it is plaine by the likenesse of the words in</hi> Daniel <hi>and</hi> Iohn, &amp;c. His reason is thus framed, <hi>If</hi> Daniel <hi>spake of one King, then also</hi> Iohn: <hi>but the former is true, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the later.</hi> The proposition, wherin there is indeed no coherence,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:25487:88"/>
he prooueth by the similitude of their words: First, <hi>because both make mention of ten Kings, which shalbe in the earth when Antichrist shall come.</hi> It is true that both make mention of ten hornes, but with such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as that otherwise there is no likenesse. <hi>Antiochus</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> by whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue vs to vnderstand Antichrist, is the last of the ten, &amp; not one besides the ten; otherwise the fourth beast, were a beast of eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hornes: Antichrist is one besides the ten hornes in the Reuelation, and of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> somtimes is called the eleuenth. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> Antichrist in <hi>Daniel</hi> is the little horne signifying indeed but one man, but the true Antichrist in the Reuelation is called not an horne, but the beast, whereby not one man, but a state is signified. The ten hornes in <hi>Daniel</hi> are so many kings which succeed one another, in the kingdome vsurped ouer the Iewes, before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the <hi>Messias:</hi> the ten hornes in the Reuelation are so many rulers ouer diuers king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, which receiue their kingdome together, not only after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but also after the dissolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Roman Empire: So that in truth nothing is here alike, saue that in both there is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ten hornes. Secondly saith <hi>Bellarmine, both of them foretel that the kingdome of Antichrist shall continue three yeares and an halfe.</hi> But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that neither of both assigne that time to Antichrist. For first <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> assigneth a time, and times, and parcell of time, that is, three yeers and ten daies, to the persecution vnder <hi>Antiochus,</hi> wherby the publick worship of God was for that time interrupted, <hi>viz.</hi> from the 15. day of the month Casleu in the 145. yeare of the kingdome of the Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae <note place="margin">See. Chap. 16.</note> 1. <hi>Mac.</hi> 1. 57. vnto the 25. of the month Casleu in the yeare 148. 1. <hi>Mac.</hi> 4. 52. But of this more hereafter. Neither doth <hi>Iohn</hi> any where assigne three yeers &amp; an halfe to the raigne of Antichrist: but to the beast with seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heads &amp; ten hornes, which signifieth the Roman state either generally as it is opposed vnto Christ, or particularly as it was gouerned by the sixt head, that is, the emperors, he assigneth fortytwo <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 2. 7. and 13. 1 5.</note> months, which are not literally to be vnderstood. Now Antichrist is not the beast with seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heads, but one head of the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; is described vnder the second beast as our aduersaries also confesse, which in plaine terms is called another beast. For how can he be that beast, if he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 11.</note> And of this also, I shal haue better occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake more fully hereafter. Lastly, he flieth to the authority of the fathers as his last refuge; but neither do these fathers expresly say, that Antichrist shalbe <note place="margin">See. Chap. 8.</note> but one man: neither if they did, can any sound argument be drawne
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25487:89"/>
from their testimonies, vnlesse <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be able to prooue, that whatsoeuer these fathers haue written concerning Antichrist, is true. And againe diuers of the Fathers, as <hi>Irenaeus, Origen, Chrysostome, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Ruffinus, Primasius, Augustine,</hi> expounding that place <hi>Math</hi> 24. 24. which speaketh of more then one, as spoken of Antichrist, they could not vnderstand Antichrist to be but one. Yea but the Fathers say, <hi>that Antichrist shall be a most choise instrument of the Diuell, that in him shall dwell all the fulnesse of diuellish malice bodily, euen as in the man Christ dwelleth the fulnesse of the diuinitie corporally.</hi> But although this allegation were true (as I will not thereof dispute,) yet is it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent: for the Pope (meaning the whole succession of Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Popes) may be a notable instrument of the diuell, &amp;c. and yet hereof it followeth not that there hath beene but one Pope: As touching the other assertion of <hi>Antichrists raigne three yeares and a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>halfe,</hi> we are hereafter to intreate.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now that Antichrist is not one singuler man, but a whole state and succession of men, it may appeare by these arguments. First by conference of 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. with the Epistles of <hi>Iohn;</hi> for <hi>Iohn</hi> plainely <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4 3. 2. Iohn. 7. 1. Ioh. 2. 18</note> saith, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Antichrist,</hi> of whom they had hard that he should come, was in his time. And of whom had they heard it, but of <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2. <hi>Thes</hi> 2. where in like sort the Apostle saith, that euen in his time the mysterie of iniquitie, that is, Antichristianisme was work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: noting that Antichrist in some of his members was already come, although he were not reuealed, vntill that which hindered was taken out of the way. Now as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> doe both testifie, that the Antichrist was in their time; so <hi>Paul</hi> also sheweth that Antichrist shall remaine vnto the second comming of Christ, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 8. for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he should be wasted and consumed before by the spirit of Christs mouth (that is, the ministery of the word) yet he should not be vtterly destroyed vntill the second comming of Christ. From hence therefore we reason thus: If Antichrist were in the Apostles time, and was to remaine vntill the second comming of Christ; then Antichrist is not one singuler man, but a succession of men; vnlesse they will say, that one and the same man may liue vpon the earth from the Apostles time vntill the comming of Christ, of which time there be already aboue 1500. yeares expired. But Antichrist was in the Apostles times, and is to continue vntill the second comming of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25487:89"/>
Christ, as the two Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> do plainely testifie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichrist is not one singuler man.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Of this syllogisme <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot deny either the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, or the assumption. Onely he distinguisheth of the former part of the assumption: <hi>viz.</hi> That Antichrist in the Apostles time was come indeede, but not in his owne person, but onely in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners. And this he would prooue; first, by a similitude, which he might haue knowne from <hi>Plato</hi> to be a most slippery argument. <hi>As</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ came in the beginning of the world not in his owne person, but in his forerunners the Patriarches and Prophets; so Antichrist came in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time not in his owne person, but in his forerunners, the heretickes &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of the church.</hi> In which similitude there is no proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnlesse that which is in question betaken for granted, namely that Antichrist is but one particular person, as Christ is. For if Antichrist be a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of heretiques, then might he be said to come in the first of the ranke; although the chiefe of that order, which principally is called Antichrist, was not yet come. And secondly, the protasis or propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this similitude is vntrue. For although Christ might be said to be come from the beginning in respect both of the truth of the promise, and also of the efficacy of his merits, which is extended to all the faithfull from the beginning: yet we neuer reade, neither can it truely be said that he came in the Patriarches and Prophets: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seeing the holy Ghost maketh a kinde of opposition betwixt <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1. Mat. 21. 37 Gal. 4. 4.</note> Gods sending of them, and the comming of Christ, who was not sent before the fulnesse of time came. Neither are the Prophets or Patriarches any where called the forerunners of Christ: For forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners goe a little before, as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did, who therefore is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the forerunner. If any man obiect that as Christ <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 19</note> spake in the Prophets; so Antichrist in the heretiques: I answer, that this latter is true not of Antichrist, but of the diuell, who is a lying spirit in the mouthes of all false Prophets. Thirdly, the reddition is contradictory to that which the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> deliuereth. For he saith plainely that the Antichrist with the article prefiexed, and that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist whom they heard was to come, was already entred into the world, 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4. 3. 2. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 7. and thence prooueth that therefore it is the last houre, because Antichrist was to come in the last houre, 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. 18. So that in this similitude nothing is sound, no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25487:90"/>
in the whole, no truth in the parts.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Wherefore by a new supply of arguments, he laboureth to make good this exposition. And as touching the place in <hi>Paul,</hi> he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth first from the authority of <hi>the fathers &amp; interpreters, wherof some vnderstand by the mystery of iniquitie, the persecution vnder</hi> Nero: <hi>others the heretiques of those times which secretly seduced many.</hi> The former had no reason to call the open persecution of <hi>Nero</hi> a mysterie: who also although he were an enimy, yet belonged not to the body of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, who is a disguised enimy and a pretended Christian. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exposition we doe embrace. For we holde Antichrist to be the whole body of heretiques in the last age of the world, who vnder the name and profession of Christ aduance themselues against Christ, first secretly, as in the Apostles times; afterwardes more openly, when that which hindred, was taken out of the way. Of this body as euery member seuerally and all ioyntly is Antichrist (and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth the heretiques of his time Antichrists, and of them all saith that they are the Antichrist:) so especially the head of this body, which we haue prooued to be the Papacy, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> called Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. Wherefore although Antichrist was after a sort come, and the mysterie of iniquity wrought in the Apostles time, yet Antichrist was not reuealed vntill the head of this body appeared, that is, vntill the Pope became Antichrist, who since the yeare of the Lord 606. hath shewed himselfe in his colours; first by vsurping supreame authority ouer the vniuersall Church, &amp; afterwards by claiming soueraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer kings and Emperors, as we haue heretofore shewed Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heretiques of whom the fathers speake, did belong to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Antichrist, it cannot be denied but that Antichrist, when they were in the world, was come in some of his members, and had as it were set his foote into the Church.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Secondly from our owne confession he would seeme to driue vs to great absurdity. For (saith he) <hi>if Antichrist were come in the Apostles times, and if Antichrist hath his seat in Rome, then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Peter &amp;</hi> Paul <hi>were the true Antichrists, &amp;</hi> Nero <hi>or</hi> Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus <hi>the true Christ. For there were no other Bishops of Rome then, but Peter and</hi> Paul, <hi>with whom</hi> Nero <hi>and</hi> Simon Magus <hi>contended.</hi> I answere, that it cannot be prooued out of the Scripture, or by any sound argument that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were Bishops of Rome: and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25487:90"/>
although they were, it would not follow vpon our assertion, that therefore they were Antichrists, and much lesse that <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was Christ. For when we say that Antichrist was come in the Apostles time, we speake of the body of Antichrist with <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we say that Antichrist hath his seate in Rome, we speake of the head of this body, who especially is called Antichrist: whom we do with <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledge not to haue beene reuealed, vntill that which hindered was taken out of the way, that is, vntill the Romane Empire in the West was dissolued: but afterwards by degrees he was aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Papacie, aboue all that is called God; sitting in the temple of God, as if he were God, that is, ruling and raigning in the Church, as if he were a God vpon earth. And surely if the head of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian body was to be reuealed not long after the dissolution of the Romane Empire in the West, and was about the same time with the rulers of the Prouinces, to attaine vnto his kingdome, as hath bin shewed; and lastly, if he shall continue in the world after he is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, vntill the second comming of Christ: then it followeth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that euen this head of the Antichristian body, cannot be any one singular man, but is continued by a succession of many from the time of his reuelation, vntill the end of the world: of which time there is almost a thousand yeares expired. But both in this argument, and in the former, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sophistically beggeth the question. For in his arguments there is no consequence, vnlesse this be taken for granted, that Antichrist is but one man. Antichrist came in the Heretiques in the Apostles time, therfore he came not in his owne person. A good argument, if Antichrist were but one man, which is the question. If Antichrist were in the Apostles time, and if Antichrist must sit at Rome, then he that was then Bishop of Rome, was Antichrist; a good argument if Antichrist were but one man, which is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Now whereas S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that Antichrist in his time was come, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> faineth him to speake of Antichrist, as he saith, <hi>Our Sauiour spake of</hi> Elias <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 11. Elias <hi>indeed shall come (namely in his own person) but I say vnto you,</hi> Elias <hi>is already come in</hi> suo simili, <hi>in his like, that is, Iohn Baptist.</hi> So S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of Antichrist, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to come in his owne person, but now he was come in his type. You see to what silly shifts this worthy cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion of the Pope is driuen.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25487:91"/>
For first he fathereth vpon Christ that Iewish fable, which with the Iewes the Papists holde against Christ himselfe. For whereas <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> had prophecied of the comming of <hi>Elias</hi> before the day of the <note place="margin">Malac. 4. 5</note> Lord, meaning the first comming of Christ: our Sauiour Christ plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie anoucheth <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 14. that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was that <hi>Elias,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophecie of <hi>Malachie</hi> was to come. Now <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> was called <hi>Elias,</hi> because he came in the spirit and power of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> to turne the hearts of the fathers, &amp;c. as the Angell also applyeth that prophesie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 17. But suppose that Christ had spoken of <hi>Elias</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Malac. 4. 6.</note> according to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit; yet how dooth it follow that <note place="margin">Luke. 1. 17.</note> therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of Antichrist after the same manner? No more then it followeth, that <hi>Dauid</hi> should long after his death be sent againe to gouerne the people of God: because it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> that the Lord would raise vp a Pastor for his people, euen <hi>Dauid</hi> his seruant, &amp;c. But as by the name of <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eze. 34. 23 24. &amp; 37. 35.</note> is meant not <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, but Christ of whom <hi>Dauid</hi> was a type: so by the name of <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Malachie,</hi> is not meant <hi>Elias</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <note place="margin">Iere. 30. 9.</note> but <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who resembled <hi>Elias</hi> in spirit and power in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Church of God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Our second argument is this: That which in the Prophecies of the Scriptures, especially in the 7. and 11. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in <hi>Apoc.</hi> the 13. and 17. is described vnder the name and figure of a beast, is not one singuler thing or person, but a whole state or succession: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist is described in the <hi>Apocatypse</hi> 13. vnder the name and figure of a Beast, therfore Antichrist is not one singuler person, but a whole state and succession. The proposition is prooued by induction of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examples. As in the 7. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> by the Lion is figured the Kingdome of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians:</hi> by the Beare the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians:</hi> by the Leopard the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> by the beast with ten hornes the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae,</hi> and so Chapt. 8. In the 13. of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> there are two Beasts descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the former signifying the state of the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours: the second signifying the state of Antichrist. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that <hi>Daniel</hi> as sometimes by the beasts he signifieth whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; so sometimes also particular persons. As in the eight Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the Ramme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>he vnderstandeth <hi>Darius</hi> the last King of the <hi>Persians:</hi> by the Goate, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. In which answer
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25487:91"/>
the vpright dealing of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with the Scriptures appeareth. For in the 20. verse of the 8. Chapter, where that vision is expounded, <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 20.</note> the Angels words are these: The Ramme which thou sawest, hauing two hornes are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> And the Goate is the King of <hi>Iauan</hi> or <hi>Grecia</hi> (meaning as before the Kings or Kingly estate, as appeareth plainly by the words that follow, and not as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>Alexander) and the great horne betweene his eyes is the first King,</hi> namely <hi>Alexander, which being broken, foure other stand vp in the steed thereof.</hi> As <hi>Daniel</hi> therefore by seuerall beasts <note place="margin">Dan. 8. 22.</note> meaneth not so many particular men, but whole states and orders of men; and as <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 13. of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> by the former beasts meaneth not any one Emperour, but the whole state and succession of Emperours at the least: so the holy Ghost in the same Chapter by the second beast describing Antichrist, meaneth not any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <note place="margin">Apo. 13. 11</note> person, but the whole state and succession of Antichristian Popes, to whom (as heretofore hath beene shewed) that description wholy agreeth. And whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth, that <hi>Paul</hi> when he entreateth of Antichrist, speaketh not of any one of the foure beasts in <hi>Daniel,</hi> but of the little horne mentioned in the 7. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> vers. 8 I answer, that the Apostle speaketh neither of the one nor of the other; and therefore the former part of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> speech is vaine, for no man saith so; and the latter is false. For the little horne is not Antichrist, but <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who liued aboue 200. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the incarnation of Christ: who although he were but one man, might not vnsitly be called a type of Antichrist, who is a state or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of men.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Our third argument is taken from that Apostasie, which the Apostle foretelleth 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. For where he speaketh of a defection (whereof Antichrist is the head) without addition, we vnderstand a <note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 3.</note> generall defection of the visible Church, which as it began to worke in the Apostles time; so was it to increase vntill the reuelation of Antichrist, and to continue more or lesse vntill his destruction. This Apostasie because it cannot be the worke of one man, or of a fewe <note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 7.</note> yeares, euidently prooueth that Antichrist is not one singuler man, but rather a state and succession of men. To this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for want of one good answer, maketh many. <hi>First</hi> (saith he) <hi>by that Apostasie wee may very well</hi> (nay he saith <hi>rectissimè) vnderstand</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:25487:92"/>
                  <hi>Antichrist himselfe, as diuers of the fathers teach;</hi> and what will he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thereupon? that therefore Antichrist is but one man? Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the contrary is to be inferred. For if Apostasie be put by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymy of the adiunct for the subiect, or rather of the effect for the cause, that is, for the parties which doe reuolt: then it followeth, that Antichrist (who according to this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is signified by Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) doth not signifie one man, but the whole body and company of those that doe reuolt, that is, the whole body and kingdome of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, which we haue prooued to be the Apostaticall Church of Rome. And so <hi>Augustine</hi> whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth in the very same place which he citeth, reading in the concrete, <hi>nisi venerit refuga pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, vnlesse the Apostate first come,</hi> and expounding what is meant by <note place="margin">De ciuit. Dei. lib. 20. cap. 19.</note> the temple, not the temple at Ierusalem, but rather the Church of God, because the Apostle would not call the temple of the diuell, the temple of God, propoundeth the opinion of some which hee doth not mislike, <hi>Vnde nonnulli non ipsum principem, &amp;c. Whereupon some vnderstand in this place not the Prince himselfe, but his whole body as it were, that is, the company of men pertaining vnto him together with their Prince, to be Antichrist: and they thinke that it might more rightly be said in Latine as it is in the Greeke, that he sitteth</hi> (non in templo dei, sed in templum dei) <hi>not in the Temple of God, but as the Temple of God, as though he were the Temple of God which is the Church.</hi> Which as hath beene shewed, notably sitteth the Pope and Church of Rome. And here we are by the way to note, whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith that <hi>Antichrist shall be such a notable Apostate, as that he may be called the Apostasie it selfe,</hi> that seeing none can be an Apostate which hath not beene a Christian: by this assertion therefore of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Antichrist shall not be a Iew, but a backslyding and reuolted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Secondly</hi> (he saith) <hi>by Apostasie we may vnderstand a reuolt from the Romane Empire, as many of the Latin fathers doe expound.</hi> To omit the dissension of the fathers, which prooueth that their exposition can be no good rule of interpreting the Scriptures, we doe confesse that before the manifest reuelation of Antichrist, there was to go, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> onely a defection from the faith, but also a reuolt from the Romane Empire. But as the reuolting from earthly kingdomes is neuer in the Scriptures termed Apostasie: so is it not here signified; but as

the word elsewhere is vsed, and by the most and best writers here is <note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifieth a falling away from God, a defection or departure from the true faith, as heretofore I haue shewed. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustme</hi> saith, <hi>quem refugam vocat, vtique a domino Deo, whom he calleth a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 20. cap. 19. §. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>runnagate, namely, from the Lord God.</hi> Neither can it be denied but that this Apostasie is that which afterward the Apostle calleth the mystery of iniquity, which was working in and by the heretiques of those times, whom also <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calleth the forerunners of Antichrist, because they peruerted the faith, and therefore the defection caused by Antichrist is an Apostasie from the faith, according to the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of the Apostle, that <hi>in these latter times diuers should make an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1. 2. Tim. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>from the faith, and should turne away their hearing from the truth, and shalbe turned vnto fables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. Thirdly, <hi>although we should grant</hi> (saith he) <hi>that by Apostasie is to be vnderstood a defection or reuolt from the true faith and religion of Christ, yet it is not necessary that it should be an Apostasie of many yeares. For it may be that the Apostle speaketh of one great Apostasie which shalbe onely in that most short time of Antichrists raigne,</hi> that is, of three yeares and a halfe. But this bare ghesse of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ought not to be of so great waight with vs, as the plaine speech of the Apostle compared with the euent. And therefore it is but vaine to tell vs what might be, seeing we haue seene the contrary to be, which the Apostle foretold should be. For as the Apostle tolde vs that there should be an Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: so he saith, that the mysterie of iniquity whereby many were sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, did worke already euen in his time, and insinuateth that it should worke vntill the full reuelation of Antichrist. And the euent hath shewed how by degrees this Apostasie hath bin wrought euen from the primitiue Church, vntill it came to that height wherein it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vntill Antichrist began to be acknowledged. And surely as this generall Apostasie could not grow at once, but by degrees: so can it not be abolished at once, but by degrees; and therefore was not like to be an Apostasie of three yeares and an halfe onely. Neither is it credible that by one man the greatest part, not onely of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but also of the Iewes should be seduced in three yeares and an halfe: seeing Christ in the like space of time could not, as he was a man and minister of the circumcision, conuert many of the Iewes; notwithstanding that his doctrine was more effectuall, and his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25487:93"/>
miracles more admirable then those of Antichrist can be; yea the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postlès &amp; some other of the disciples, who for so long time scarce went out of Iewry, were able to preuaile but with a few of the Iewes in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of those which reiected their doctrine: And shall wee thinke that Antichrist, who (as the Papists hold) shal be but one man, shall in three yeers &amp; an halfe, seduce the remnant of the Iewes, and al the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church of God dispersed into so many parts of the world? And wheras he alledgeth <hi>Augustine</hi> as a fauourer of this ghesse, therein he abuseth the authority of that learned father, to seduce the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who onely deliuereth the Iudgement of others concerning the mysterie of iniquity, &amp; that to this effect. That the mystery of iniquity worketh in <note place="margin">De ciuit. Dei. lib. 20. cap. 19.</note> euill men in the Church and counterseit Christians, when as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt from the truth, and that vnto this mystery belongeth the reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of those of whom <hi>S. Iohn</hi> speaketh, They went out from vs, but <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 19</note> were not of vs, &amp;c. And that this mystery should stil worke, that is, that vnsound men in the Church should more and more reuolt vntill they make a sufficient number for Antichrist. But there is neuer a word of this defection caused either by one man, or in so short a time, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary, as hath beene shewed.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Fourthly he answereth, <hi>that although it should be granted that this Apostasie is of many ages</hi> (which he saith cannot well be denied, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing th'apostle saith it began to worke in his time) <hi>yet it is not necessary that it should appertaine to one body vnder one head, neither that it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the kingdome of Antichrist, but rather is a disposition thereunto, happening in diuers dominions vpon (undry occasions, &amp;c.</hi> But this fourth answer is ouerthrowne by the first: wherein this Apostasie was made so proper to Antichrist, as that by it <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thought we might most fitly vnderstand Antichrist himselfe, or rather as we shewed the whole body and kingdome of Antichrist. And further we haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heretofore that the whole body of Apostates and heretiques pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the name of Christ, is Antichrist, and after a more speciall maner the head of this body &amp; Apostasie. And therfore it followeth, that all of this Apostasie professing the name of Christ, belong to this body and kingdome of Antichrist. And whereas hee saith, that <hi>this Apostasie is onelie a disposition so the kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, &amp;c.</hi> I answere that all the degrees of this Apostasie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the reuelation of Antichrist, were a disposition not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25487:93"/>
to the being, but to the reuealing of Antichrist. For in the Apostasie Antichrist was as <hi>Iohn</hi> plainely sheweth, neither could he be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnlesse first he were Wherupon <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, <hi>Defectionem appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat Antichristi praesentiam, he calleth Apostasie the presence or comming of Antichrist.</hi> But is it not very likely thinke you that there hath bene a disposition or preparation already of more then 1500. yeares in most parts of the world, for the raigne of one man three yeres and an halfe?</p>
               <p n="19">19. Fiftly and lastly, <hi>although we should grant</hi> (saith he) <hi>that a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Apostasie from the faith hauing now continued many yeares, is the kingdome of Antichrist: yet it would not follow that therefore the Pope is Antichrist. For it is not yet decided who haue made this defection, they or we. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For whereas we proue that Antichrist is not one man, contrary to their assertion, by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument among others, because that generall Apostacie of the visible Church continuing for many ages, whereof Antichrist is the head, cannot be the worke of one man or of a few yeares: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth thus in effect, that although your argument be very good to prooue that Antichrist is not one man; yet notwithstanding here of it followeth not, that the Pope is Antichrist. Why, neuer any of vs vsed this argument: Antichrist is not one man, therefore the Pope is Antichrist. But in this assertion of ours, we answere your chiefe demonstration whereby you would prooue that the Pope is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and where in especially you please your selues, reasoning as hath beene hard, after this manner: Antichrist is but one man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope is not Antichrist. And after you haue prooued this by many worshipfull demonstrations, and stoutly denied our contrary arguments: now in the end you make this cowardes bragge: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this should be granted which you say to prooue that Antichrist is not one man, yet it doth not follow that the Pope is Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. But let vs pursue the Iesuite in his flight. <hi>Although this should be granted,</hi> saith he, &amp;c. <hi>Yet it followeth not that therfore the Pope is</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:25487:94"/>
                  <hi>Antichrist. For the question yet is, who hath made this Apostasie, we or you.</hi> Well then, let vs ioyne in this issue. If the Apostasie be on our side, let vs be thought to belong to Antichrist; if this Apostasie be in the Church of Rome, whereof the Pope is head; then let it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the Pope is the head of this Apostasie, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Antichrist. But <hi>you</hi> (saith the Iesuite) <hi>haue reuoltd from the Church and religion of your forefathers, that is, from the Church of Rome and Latin religion. And therefore when you read,</hi> vnlesse there come are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt, <hi>&amp;c. it is a wonder that you doe not apply that prophesie to your selues.</hi> The Apostasie whereof the Apostle speaketh, is not a separation from the Church of Rome that now is, nor a forsaking of Romish or Popish religion: but a reuolting from God, a departure from the true faith and religion of Christ, vnto Antichristianisme and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. We in forsaking the Church of Rome, haue come out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon <note place="margin">Apoc. 18. 4.</note> according to Gods commaundement, and in reuolting from the Pope haue returned to God: and therefore this Apostasie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not vs. But you, say I to the Papists, haue reuolted from the true faith and religion of Christ vnto Antichristianisme and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: as besides the infinite particulars wherein your Apostasie doeth consist, may briefely appeare by these notes. First, the Apostle speaking of the same Apostasie in another place, hath these words. <hi>The spirit speaketh plaincly, that in the latter times some shall make an Apostasie from the faith, attending to erroneous spirits and doctrines of</hi>

Secondlie, this Apostasie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those who are fallen from the true religion and worship of God, into idolatry and superstition. For the Apostaticall Church is the Idolatrous Church signified by the whore of Babylon, the mother of fornications. But the Church of Roome is strangelie addicted to idolatry and superstition, and for the same deserueth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25487:94"/>
to be called the whore of Babylon; where as we through the mercie of God are free from idolatry, and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postásie is with them and not with vs. For the Apostasie is of them that are made drunke with the cuppe of the whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylous fornications, as the Papists are, and wee are not, who haue come out of Babylon. Thirdlie, the Apostasie is of those that receiue the name and marke of the beast as the Papists doe, and not of those that refuse it as wee doe.

Thus therefore I reason. The head of the generall Apostasie is Antichrist: The Pope is the head of the generall or catholicke Apostasiei therefore he is Antichrist.</p>

For euen as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Iewes, when Christ was among them, contrary to their one perswasion, for worldly respects refused the true <hi>Messias,</hi> and made the people expect another which neuer shall be: So the learned among the Papists hauing Antichrist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, for worldly respects cannot endure that he should bee acknowledged; but teach the people that he is not yet come, and describe vnto them such an Antichrist as themselues may well know shall neuer come, as by the grace of God shall appeare in the particulars. Now as touching the time of Antichristes comming, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> first reciteth diuers false and erronious opinions as heo calleth them: and afterwarde setteth downe sixe solemne demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations to prooue that he is not yet come.

               <p n="2">2. But let vs come to his heretiques: <hi>Who although they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this, that Antichrist is come, and that it is the Pope:</hi> yet saith <hi>Bellarmine, they are deuided into sixe opinions.</hi> The first opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Samosatenians</hi> in <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Transyluania,</hi> is not worth the mentioning, being of such heretiques as deny the Trinity, and also the diuinity of Christ, with whom though we haue as little to doe as the Papists, sauing that some of our men haue soundly confuted their heresies, whiles the Papists held their peace: yet he numbreth our opinion with theirs, as Christ was numbred among the wicked; that by this mixture of truth with falshood, he might discredit the truth. As for the rest, it is easie to shew, that all Protestants almost that haue written in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:25487:96"/>
this argument, and namely those whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth, doe agree in the substance concerning the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ: And that there is no such difference among them, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would beare vs in hand. For concerning this matter, this is the receiued opinion of our Churches. When with <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Epistles we speake of Antichrist, meaning the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Heretiques and Antichrists, we hold with <hi>Iohn</hi> that euen in the Apostles times Antichrist had as it were set his foote in the Church, and that from that time the mysterie of iniquitie, that is, Antichristianisme, did more and more worke, vntill the head of this body the man of sinne was reuealed: Which with <hi>Paul</hi> we hold to haue beene done, after that which hindered was remooued out of the way. But when we speake of the head of this body, who <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is called the Antichrist, figured by the second beast, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. of whom also the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. the constant opinion of the learned is this: that of the reuealing or manifest appearing of Antichrist, there were two principall degrees. The first about the yeare 607. when <hi>Boniface</hi> the third obtained the supremacie ouer the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall <note place="margin">See lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> Church. The second after the yeare 1000. when he claimed and vsurped both swords, that is, a soueraigne and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall authoritie, not onely ecclesiasticall ouer the Clergie, but also temporall ouer Kings and Emperours. Vnto which second soueraigntie they had long aspired, but neuer attained, vntill the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seauenth. We holde then, that Antichrist was come and shewed himselfe in <hi>Boniface</hi> the third: and that after this his birth as it were, he grewe by degrees, vntill he came to his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or full growth in <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seauenth: in whose time and in all ages since, the Pope hath been by some acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be that Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now as touching his comming or birth, which is the chiefe matter in question, all agree. <hi>Illyricus</hi> and the other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">2.</note> of the Centuries, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth, hold, that about the yeare 606. Antichrist was borne, when <hi>Phocas</hi> granted to the Bishop of Rome, that he should be called the head of the whole Church. Of the same judgement is <hi>Chytraeus.</hi> For although he <note place="margin">3.</note> confesse, that the smoake of false doctrine, ascending out of the <note place="margin">In Apoc. 9</note>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:25487:96"/>
bottomlesse pitte, began sooner to obscure and darken the truth: yet he saith, that in the yeare 607, <hi>Boniface</hi> the third was by <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> ordained the Angell of the bottomlesse pit, meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Antichrist, when he receiued from him the title of oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Bishop. <hi>Luther</hi> perceiuing that the Papacie consisteth of <note place="margin">4.</note> the two swords, teacheth that there is a two-fold comming of <note place="margin">De supput. annorum Mundi.</note> Antichrist: the first with the spirituall sworde after the yeare 600. when <hi>Phocas</hi> gaue him the Antichristian title: the latter, with the temporall sworde, after the yeare 1000. <hi>Bullinger</hi> doth not say, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> falsely chargeth him, that Antichrist first <note place="margin">5.</note> appeared Anno 763. for he aboue all others most plainely and <note place="margin">In Apoc. 13.</note> distinctlie hath deliuered that truth which we doe hold. <hi>Pontisex Romanus</hi> (saith he) <hi>initium quidem dominij jecit sub Phocá: sub regibus Francorum fundauit regnum: ampliauit autem sub. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricis et Fridericis: confirmauit demum sub sequentibus aliquot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus: regnat nostro seculo ac praecedentibus aliquot. The Pope of Rome laide the beginning of his dominion vnder</hi> Phocas: <hi>vnder the French Kings he founded his kingdome: vnder the Henries and Fredericks he enlarged it: vnder some other Kings which followed he confirmed it: bereigneth in our and some former ages. Musculus,</hi> whom he nameth in the sixt place, dooth not say, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ <note place="margin">6.</note> came about the yeare 1200: but by the tyrannie of the Popes, and vsurped dominion ouer the Church, by their shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse symony, by their excessiue riote, and diuellish pride, by their abominable lusts and vncleannesse, he concludeth that the Church of Rome is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the seat of Antichtist: and addeth that <hi>Bernard</hi> was of the same minde. Who seemeth to haue signified that Antichrist was then come, and that onely it remained that the man of sinne should be reuealed (that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and detected, as <hi>Musculus</hi> vnderstandeth him) which discouerie of Antichrist, saith he, hath followed in our age. And thus you see a notable consent of all our writers whom he alledgeth in the maine point, concerning the time of the comming of Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now let vs see what he objecteth against this receiued truth. Concerning the time of his comming with the spirituall sword, he objecteth that <hi>Phocas did not giue the title of vniuersall</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:25487:97"/>
                  <hi>to the Pope, but called him the head of the Churches, as</hi> Iustinian <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him had done, and also the councell of</hi> Chalcedon: <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no reason, why the comming of Antichrist should be placed in the time of</hi> Phocas. As touching the title, good authours affirme, that he receiued from <hi>Phocas</hi> both the title of the head of the Church, and also of vniuersall or oecumenicall Bishop. And no doubt he sought for, and by suite obtained that which <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had before claimed. Neither is there any great difference betwixt these two titles, as they are now giuen to the Pope, saue that to be the head of the vniuersall Church, is the more Antichristian stile. And although titles of honour and preheminence were sometimes giuen to the Church of Rome, as the chiefe or head of the Churches, the mystery of iniquitie working before the reuelation thereof in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie: yet before this graunt of <hi>Phocas,</hi> which was obtained with much adoe and contention, the Church of Rome had the preheminence and superioritie ouer all other Churches excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> not in respect of authoritie and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction (which after this graunt, it more and more practised) but in respect of order and dignitie: And that for this cause espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, because Rome whereof he was Bishop, was the chiefe citie, as it is specified in the councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Yea and the Bishops of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> because their city was the chiefe in the exarchate of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> whereunto Rome was for a time sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, stroue with the Bishop of Rome in the time of the exarches for superioritie. Seeing therefore that now the Pope of Rome had with great contention and ambition obtained the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and soueraigntie ouer the vniuersall church; and now intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himselfe the head of the vniuersall Church (a title peculiar vnto Christ) the head I say, not onely in respect of excellencie and dignitie, as a chiefe member of the Church (as he had beene in former times by some acknowledged, because he was the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:25487:97"/>
Bishop of the chiefe citie; but also in respect of authoritie and Iurisdiction, as beeing the prince and supreme gouernour of the Church vniuersall: we doe therefore worthily call this soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne dominion challenged ouer the vniuersall Church, the first reuelation or open comming of Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Concerning the comming of Antichrist with the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sworde after the yeare 1000. he obiecteth, <hi>that from the</hi> 700. <hi>yeare the Pope had receiued te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall dominion, &amp; that about the yeare</hi> 715. <hi>he excommunicated the Greeke Emperour. &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> knoweth well enough that we speake not so much of the Popes temporall dominion ouer those parts which they call the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> but of that which they call and challenge to themselues, <hi>Utriusque potestatis temporalis &amp; spiritualis Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchiam, The Monarchie of both powers, temporall and spirituall.</hi> I answer therefore, that the Pope indeed had a temporall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion before, but not generall: and that he had long ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to get the superioritie ouer the Emperours, but neuer so fully attained vnto it, as in the times of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seauenth, and afterwards.

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O prooue that Antichrist is not yet come, and consequently that the Pope is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, he bringeth sixe slender conjectures from sixe signes, which, as shall be shewed, are neither proper nor necessarie. And these by a strange kinde of Logicke, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth forsooth sixe demonstrations. For so haue I read of some troubled with melancholie, who haue thought euery Strawe or small Reed in their hands, to haue beene so many Speares. <hi>We must know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the holy Ghost in the Scriptures, hath giuen vs sixe certaine signes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Antichrist. Whereof two goe before,</hi> viz. <hi>the preaching of the Gospell throughout the whole world: and the desolation of the Romane Empire. Two accompanie Antichrist, to wit, the preaching of</hi> Enoch <hi>and</hi> Elias: <hi>and the most grieuous persecution of the church, insomuch that the publicke seruice of God must wholy cease. Two come after, namely the ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e of Antichrist after three yeares and a halfe: and the end of the world. Of which signes, none</hi> (saith he) <hi>is yet fulfilled.</hi> We hold the contrary, namely, that all those signes, which the holy Ghost hath giuen concerning the comming of Antichrist, are fulfilled: and that those which are not yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are none of those signes which the holy Ghost hath assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For I will not stand now to tell you how fitlie he maketh the death of Antichrist, and the end of the world, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit followeth after his death, to be two signes of his comming.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The first signe which goeth before the comming of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, is the Preaching of the Gospell throughout the world. From whence he reasoneth thus: <hi>If the Gospell hath not as yet beene preached throughout the world, then is not Antichrist as yet</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:25487:98"/>
                  <hi>come: But the Gospell hath not as yet beene preached throughout the world, therefore Antichrist is not yet come.</hi> But in this argument nothing is sound: no necessitie of consequence in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, nor truth in the assumption. The proposition, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he would prooue, because our Sauiour Christ maketh this vniuersall preaching of the Gospell a fore-runner of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 14. <hi>This Gospell of the kingdome shalbe preached in all the world, for atesti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>onie to all nations.</hi> But our Sauiour Christ doth not say that the Gospell shall be preached through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world before the comming of Antichrist, but before the end, as it followeth in the very same verse; <hi>and then the end shall come.</hi> Whereby we are to vnderstand either the destruction of Jerusalem, which is most like, or the end and consummation of the world, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expoundeth it. And therefore vnlesse he take it for granted, that the comming of Antichrist shall not be before the very end of the world, which we do constantly denie, as being the matter in question betwixt vs, there is not so much as any shew of reason in this allegation, being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood according to his owne exposition, which also is false. Neither is it the purpose of our Sauiour Christ to signifie vnto his Disciples the time of Antichrists comming, but by way of answer to the question propounded by his Disciples verse 3. to shew them when Ierusalem should be destroyed, as also to giue them some signes of his comming, and of the end of the world. But because the former part of this Chapter is diuershe abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Papists in this matter concerning Antichrist, I thinke it needfull by way of a short analysis to giue you the true meaning thereof; that by one labour all their cauils may be refuted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas therefore our Sauiour Christ had foretolde his Disciples the vtter desolation of Ierusalem, and destruction of the temple: they being perswaded that the temple and citie of Ierusalem should not haue an end before the end of the world, demand therfore of our Sauiour Christ when should be the end of both. Tell vs (say they vers. 3.) when these things shalbe: that is, when the temple shall be destroyed, &amp; what shalbe the signe of thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; of the end of the world.

two parts, receiueth an answer to both. To the former, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the destruction of Ierusalem, from the 4. vers. to the 23. To the latter, concerning the comming of Christ, and the end of the world, from thence to the 42. As touching the former: our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour prophecieth, first of the calamities and troubles which should go before the destruction of Ierusalem vnto the 15. verse. And secondly of the destruction it selfe, and the greeuousnesse thereof, vnto the 23. The troubles and calamities which were the forerunners of the destruction of Ierusalem, were either tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or spirituall. The temporal either publique and common; or peculiar to the disciples of Christ among the Iewes. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, warres, and rumors of warres, famine, pestilence, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, which were but the beginning, <gap reason="foreign">

The peculiar troubles to the Christians, persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and hatred for Christs sake; and the effects thereof in the vnsound, falling away, and betraying and hating one another, verse 9. 10. The spirituall, in the teachers spirits of errour and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, vers 5. 11. In the heaters, seduction by false Prophets and falling away, verse 11. 12. Now vnto this Prophesie are admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both admonitions and consolations. Admonitions, that they should take heed of false Prophets, verse 4. that they should not be troubled or dismaide with rumors of warres, verse 6. Consolations grounded vpon a two-folde promise, first of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those, who, notwithstanding these temptations, shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere to the end, verse 13. Secondly, of the successe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, that before the desolation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Gospell should be preached throughout the world for a testimonie to all nations, verse. 14. And therefore that they should not feare, least together with <hi>Ierusalem</hi> his Church should bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. For before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> he would by their Preaching to all nations, both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> plant his Church in many nations of the world. And for asmuch as the Temple and Citie of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were types and figures of the Church of Christ, which were to be abolished when the church of Christ should be established: therefore he addeth, that vpon the planting of his church by their ministery should the end and

To this prophecie also he admixeth counsel and consolation. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, that they which shalbe in Iewry prouide for their selues by flight, verse 16. 17. 18. in respect whereof he both pitieth the women and such as giue sucke, and biddeth them pray that their flight be not in winter, nor on the Sabboth day, verse. 19. 20. His consolation is, that for the elects sake the time of the siege shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be shortned: for otherwise none of the Iewes could escape, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> also expoundeth, verse. 22. This exposition is plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed by conference of this Chapter of <hi>Mathew</hi> with <hi>Luke.</hi> 21. where the same question being propounded, verse. 7. concerning the end of Ierusalem alone, receiueth an answer pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the destruction of Ierusalem, vnto the 25. verse.

4. By this analysis of the text &amp; conference with <hi>Luke,</hi> it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeareth that all these predictions from the 6. ver. to the 23. in <hi>Mat.</hi> &amp; in the 21. of <hi>Luke</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 7. vers. to the 29. concerne the destruction of Ierusalem, which hapned within forty yeares after this prophecie was deliuered. Neither may we thinke that our sauiour Christ would intermingle the prophecies concerning the destruction of Ierusalem and the end of the world, therby to nourish the aforesaid errour of his disciples, who imagined that the end of Ierusalem should not be before the end of the world, as appeareth by their question. For euen afterward ver. 34. where seemeth the greatest mixture, our Sauiour Christ speaketh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly. For wheras our Sauiour had spoken first of the end of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and then of the end of the world seuerally, &amp; had giuen signes of both, wherby they might know the approching of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as by the budding of the fig tree they gather summer to be neare, he defineth the time of the one, &amp; the other he leaueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definit: Verily I say vnto you, this generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall not passe, vntil al those things (saith he, pointing as it seemeth towards Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he sat in the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Oliuet) be fulfilled. And as touching the end of the world, he noteth both the certainty therof, &amp; the vncertainty of the time: of the former he saith, Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth shal passe away (&amp; that with a noise, as <hi>Peter</hi> saith) but my words shall not passe away, howbeit of that day &amp; houre (namely, wherin the sonne <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 10</note> of man shal come, and wherin the heauens shal passe away) none knoweth, no not the Angels of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the father only. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Papists therefore alledge out of the former part of the Chapter, as fauouring any of their fancies concerning Antichrist, as namely the preaching of the Gospel before the comming of Antichrist, the abomination of desolation, &amp; the most greeuous tribulation in the time of Antichrist, &amp;c. may easily be answered.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But if these prophecies be compared with the history and euent, we shall finde this trueth to be more euident, seeing all these predictions had their complement at or before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Ierusalem. For (to omit the rest) the Apostle testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 6. 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. &amp;. 10. 18. that the Gospell was in his time preached in all the world; and therefore before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3</note> of Ierusalem, which hapned about two yeare after his death. From whence also euidently appeareth, how false <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:25487:100"/>
assumption is, as being contradictory both to the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Christ in this place, as also to the testimony of the Apostle testifying the fulfilling thereof in his time, according to the commission giuen to the Apostles, that they should goe into all the world and teach all nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. which was accordingly performed, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16 20. And thus <note place="margin">Homil. in Mat. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> also expoundeth this place, that before the end, that is, the destruction of Ierusalem, the Gospell was to be preached throughout the world, and prooueth by the same testimonies of <hi>Paul,</hi> that this prophecie was fulfilled before the taking of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. But if it seeme incredible vnto any that the Gospell should be preached throughout the world in so short a time: he must consider, first, that by the whole world is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood euery small corner and vnknowne part of the world: but by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> the greatest part of the world then knowne and inhabited, as <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 1. And by all nations, not all and euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but all sorts, that is, both Iewes and Gentiles. For both here and elsewhere there seemeth to be an opposition made betwixt the whole world and the land of Iewry: betwixt all nations and the Iewes. For wheras before the Church was contained in Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp; the word preached to the Iewes, our Sauiour sheweth that before the desolation of Ierusalem, the Gospell should be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched commonly in all parts of the world, &amp; not only in Iewry; &amp; indifferently to all other nations, &amp; not peculiarly to the Iewes. Secondly, he is to consider, both the multitude of the preachers &amp; dispersers of the Gospell, and also the infinit power of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and miraculous efficacie of his word preached in that it could in so short a time spread it selfe so far as it did. Thirdly a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be made betwixt preaching the Gospell and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it: For it was preached in all the world, but not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued euery where. And that our Sauiour signifieth where he saith, it should be preached in all the world for a testimony to all nations, to leaue those which embrace it not, without excuse. If then the preaching of the Gospell throughout the world be not made by Christ our Sauiour a signe of Antichrists com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and yet notwithstanding it be most true, that according to the prophecie of Christ, the Gospell was preached in all the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:25487:101"/>
world before the desolation of Ierusalem: what shew of reason is there in this demonstration? And this is all that I thinke worth the answering in his fourth Chapter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For to what purpose should I tell you of his argument, which notwithstanding he saith it was now no time to prooue, to wit, that before the comming of Antichrist the Gospel should be preached throughout the world, because the cruel persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichrist should hinder al publicke exercises of trus religion: &amp; therfore was to be preached generally throughout the world either before the time of Antichrist, or not at al: which we shall in part finde time to answer in his fourth demonstratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the mean time we answer first, that the greeuous tribulation, before which our Sauiour saith the Gospel was to be preached in al the world, is not the persecution vnder Antichrist, but the affliction of the Iewes at and before the destruction of Ierusalem by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, as I haue manifestly prooued. And secondly, that if the generall preaching of the Gospell were made a signe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs comming, as it is not, but of the end; yet is it not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that it should be preached generally throughout the world at one time: for it might suffice that in one age it were preached to one nation; and in another age, to another people. And therefore although during the persecution of Antichrist the Gospell were not preached generally and at once to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet in that time it might be preached to some nations, where it had not formerly beene preached, and therefore might be preached to all nations before the destruction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, though it were not before his comming. Or to what end should I spend any time in answering the testimonies of the fathers, who supposed that the Gospell should be preached in all the world before the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, seeing according to the meaning of our Sauiour Christ, it was to be preached in al the world, before the destruction of Ierusalem? Or what account should we make of his obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wherein he alledgeth that the Gospel hath not as yet beene preached throughout the world, seeing our Sauiour who cannot he hath prophecied, and the Apostle by the same spirit of truth hath testified, that before the destruction of Ierusalem,
<pb facs="tcp:25487:101"/>
the Gospell of the kingdome was preached in all the world. And therefore the Papists in this point, whiles they study to contradict vs, are not afraide to giue the lye to our Sauiour Christ. Neither are his cauillations, wherby he indeuouteth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide &amp; elude those testimonies of Scripture, which doe testifie that the Gospell was in the Apostles times preached in all the world, worth the mentioning. For whereas <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>No doubt their sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d went out through all the earth, &amp; their words into the ends</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>of the world: Bellarmine</hi> cauilleth that the Apostle vseth the time past, insteed of the future, as if he had said, <hi>no doubt their sound shal goe through all the earth.</hi> But (say I) the Apostle prooueth that the Iewes had heard the Gospel, because the sound of the Preachers thereof was gone through all the earth: and therefore they from whom the Gospell proceeded to other nations, could not be ignorant thereof. And againe, whereas the same Apostle saith, that the Gospell in his time was in all the world, and addeth that <note place="margin">Col. 1. 6.</note> it did bring forth fruite euen as it did among the <hi>Colossians: Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> answereth that the Apostle would not say that it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, but virtually, as they say, in all the world. But how could it bring forth fruite, vnlesse it were actually? and besides, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in the same Chapter saith, the Gospell had been preached <note place="margin">

If by the end is to be vnderstood the end of Ierusalem, as I haue manifestly proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; then according to our Sauiours prophesie, the Gospell was preached in all the world, in the Apostles times. But that the generall preaching of the Gospell should be a signe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs comming, the Scripture hath neuer a word.</p>

From whence this demonstration is raised. <hi>If the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire be not yet vtterly destroyed, then is not yet Antichrist come for: the vtter desolation of the Romaine Empire is a certaine signe going before his comming: But the Roman Empire is not yet vtterly destroied: therfore Antichrist is not yet come.</hi> We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that before antichrist could be reuealed by exercising a soueraigne dominion in Rome, it was necessary that the Emperour, so farre forth as he hindred this reuelation of Antichrist, should be taken out of the way: But that there should be such an vtter desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Empire, as that there should not remaine so much as the name of the Emperor or king of the Romans, that we doe vtterly dony. He that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred was taken out of the way, partly when the imperiall seate was remooued from Rome to Constantinople, and that to this end (as they haue set downe in the donation of Constantine) that the City of Rome might be left to the Pope: but especially when as after the diuision of the Empire into two parts, the Empire in the West (which properly was the Empire of Rome) was dissolued, and lay voyde for many yeares: All which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished before <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. attained to the Antichristian title. Neither doth the reuiuing of the Westerne Empire in <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,</hi> after it had bin voide 325. yeares, hinder the reuelation or dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichrist; but rather proueth that Antichrist was then come. For this new Empire, erected by the Popes meanes, it is the image of the beast (that is, of the old Empire) which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist <note place="margin">Apoc. 13.</note> the second beast causeth to be made, &amp; putteth life ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. It is the beast wheron the whore of Babylon sitteth, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hindring Antichrist, that it supporteth him. This beast which was an imperiall state, but is not indeed, though in title it be, as being but an image of the old Empire, is said to be the eight head of the beast, &amp; yet one of the seuen: wheras Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ <note place="margin">Apo. 17.</note> by the confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of papists is the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th. Wherfore although
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:25487:102"/>
the old Empire in the West (which hindred) was done out of the way, and indeed dissolued before the reuelation of Antichrist; yet euen with and vnder Antichrist, there was to be an imperial state in name and title, which is the beast whereon the whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon sitteth, as I haue heretofore prooued. <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 3. §. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But let vs come to his arguments. The first whereof is this. <hi>If before Antichrists comming the Romane Empire is to be diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten kings, whereof none shalbe called king of the Romanes; then is not Antichrist yet come, for yet there is a king of the Romanes: but the first is true, therefore the last.</hi> The proposition he taketh for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, although it cannot be denyed but that vpon the desolation of the empire in the West, it was deuided among ten kings at the least; who although they had the prouinces of the Empire, yet none of them was called the king of the Romanes. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition therefore is false, and the reason may be returned vpon our aduersary. For seeing these ten kings had not receiued their kingly power in the Apostles time, but were to receiue it either after the beast (which is Antichrist,) as some reade; or with the <note place="margin">Apo. 17. 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> beast as others: it is euident therefore, that when the ten rulers of the prouinces had receiued authority as kings, then Antichrist was come. But many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeers since, the rulers of the prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ceased to be deputies vnder the Emperor, &amp; obtained power as soueraigne kings, diuiding among them the westerne Empire, therfore many hundred yeres since was Antichrist come. The as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption he prooueth out of <hi>Daniel</hi> chap. 2. <hi>Where</hi> (saith he) <hi>is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the chiefe kingdomes vnto the end of the world by a certaine image, the golden head wherof signifieth the kingdome of the Assyrians; the Breast of siluer, the kingdom of the Persians; the Bellie of Brasse, the kingdome of the Grecians; the Legs of Iron, the kingdom of the Romans diuided into two parts, &amp;c. And in the 7. chap. the same kingdomes are signified: the last which hath ten hornes being the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Romanes. Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>as the two Legs haue ten toes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Subtiliss.</note> 
                  <hi>which are not legs, &amp; as the ten hornes are not the beast: so the Roman Empire shall be diuided into ten kings, whereof none is the king of the Romanes. Answere.</hi> 1. This argumentation of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a contradiction. For if there be in <hi>Daniel</hi> described a succession of kingdomes which shall continue to the end of the world, whereof the Romane is the last: then the Romane
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25487:103"/>
Empire shall not vtterly be destroyed before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichtist, which goeth before the end of the world. But howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion hath bin, that the fourth kingdom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in those chapters is the Romane Empire; yet by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, especially of these latter times, it hath beene most clearely prooued, that by it is vnderstood that kingdome of the <hi>Seleuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> &amp; <hi>Lagidae,</hi> which tyrannized ouer the people of Iewry. For the <hi>Seleucida</hi> who were Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the <hi>Lagidae</hi> who were Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were the two legs of the image, &amp; were also the fourth beast: the ten kings of these two kingdomes, which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely <note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> vsurped dominion ouer the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were the ten hornes of the beast; which being most true as hereafter also shalbe shewed, it appeareth euidently, that this whole argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is impertinent. But suppose that <hi>Daniel</hi> had spoken in those places of the Romane Empire, yet would not that follow which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would inferre thereof. For by the beast is signified the kingdome it selfe, and by the hornes the seuerall kings, who although they be not the kingdome it selfe signified by the beast, no more then the hornes are the beast, yet are they so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kings of that kingdome, which is signified by the beast. As for example: <hi>Seleucus, Antiochus,</hi> and the rest of the ten kings signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the ten hornes, and as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> speaketh, by the ten toes, though they were not the kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> &amp; <hi>Egypt</hi> it selfe; yet were they kings of that kingdome, and therefore this argument of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is very friuolous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His second proofe is out of <hi>Apocal.</hi> 17. <hi>Where</hi> Iohn <hi>describeth a beast with seauen heads and ten hornes, vpon which beast a certaine woman sitteth, which he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to be the great citie sitting on seuen hils, that is to say, Rome. The seauen heads as they signifie seuen hils, so also seauen kings, by which number</hi> (saith he) <hi>al the Romane Emperors are vnderstood: the ten hornes are ten kings, which shal raigne together. And least we should thinke that these shalbe Romane kings, he addeth, that these kings shall hate the harlot, and make her desolate, because they shall so deuide the Romane Empire among them, that they shall vtterly destroy it.</hi> Here <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as you see, confesseth, that Rome is the whore of Babylon, and consequently the seate of Antichrist, and not Rome vnder the olde Emperors, but Rome after the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25487:103"/>
of the Empire. And that the ten hornes are so many kings, among whom the Romane Empire should be deuided, and that these ten Kings were to receiue their kingdome together; and consequently that these are not the same ten hornes whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh, which reigned successiuely, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, the 7. heads signifie all the Emperours, it is vntrue. For the holy Ghost nameth seauen, because they were seauen indeed, and therfore numbreth them. Fiue are fallen, the sixt is, and the seauenth is not yet come. But all this is besides the present purpose. How then doth he prooue, that before Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ commeth, the Romane Empire shall be so vtterly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that not the name of a Romane Emperour or king of the Romanes should remaine? <hi>because the Empire shall be deuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ten kings, which are not Romane kings.</hi> But that proueth not that the name shall not remaine: for he that is none of those ten kings, may haue the name of the Emperour or king of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, as namely the beast which was, and is not, though it be, which is the eight head, and is one of the seauen, that is to say, the Emperour erected by the Pope.

of diuers of the Fathers, the which we are so farre from denying, that from hence, as one especiall argument, we prooue the Pope to be Antichrist. But neither the Apostle nor any of the Fathers (excepting <hi>Lactantius,</hi> whose Prophecie in this point the Papists themselues do thinke to be erronious) doth say, that the Empire of Rome shall so vtterly be abolished, as that not so much as the name of the Emperour or King of the Romanes shall remaine; which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> should haue prooued.

As for the Empire renued by the Pope, that hindereth not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, but rather furthereth, as hath beene shewed; and therfore there is no necessitie that it should be taken away. Neither is there now an Emperour of the Romanes indeed, but onely in title, without the thing it selfe, as enjoying neither the citie of Rome it selfe, nor yet the Prouinces. And therefore either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully or sophistically are these Emperors, which haue no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall authoritie either in the citie or the prouinces, compared with those ancient Emperours, who although they had the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, wanted Rome it selfe.</p>

and of the Emperours in the West, but was cured, therefore not vtterly destroyed: and cured by the Pope, both in respect of the city, and in regard of the Emperour. And therefore the Pope is Antichrist, as some of our writers infer, because this wound was to be cured by the second beast, which figureth Antichrist. And <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith vpon 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. That Antichrist shall restore liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the Romans, but in his owne name. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, <hi>That he readeth no where in</hi> Iohn, <hi>that the beast, which signifieth the Romane Empire, was to be cured by antichrist.</hi> Yea but this he might haue read, that the second beast, which is Antichrist, causeth the image of the beast (that is, the new Empire) to be made, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth life vnto it. For by this renuing of the Empire, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where <note place="margin">De translat. imperij. lib. 1. c. 4.</note> prosesseth, that the Romane Empire was restored to the same estate, wherin it was before <hi>Augustulus.</hi> But what hath <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> read in <hi>Iohn?</hi> Forsooth, <hi>That one of the heads of the beast should dye, and shortly after rise againe by the helpe of the diuel; which the Ancient expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Antichrist, who shall faine himselfe to be dead, and by diuellish art rise againe, that so by resembling the true death and resurrection of Christ, he might seduce many.</hi> First, it is euident that the former beast figureth not Antichrist, but the Romane state, and that vnder the Romane Emperors especially. Secondly, it is not said, that one of the heads did faine it selfe dead, and by the helpe of the diuell did rise againe (which needed not, if the death were cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit) but that one of the heads had receiued a deadly wound, &amp; was cured againe. The head was the state of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, to wit, the sixt head, which receiued a deadly wound in <hi>Augustulus,</hi> after whom the Empire in the West lay voide 325. yeares.

maketh the question, which he goeth about to prooue. First, by testimonies of Scripture. Secondly, by consent of the fathers. Thirdly, by reason.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There be foure Scriptures</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmine) to prooue that</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>in their owne persons shall come against Antichrist.</hi> Howbeit this is a manifest vntrueth; for no place of Scripture speaketh of <hi>Enoch</hi> his returne. <hi>The first</hi> Malach. 4. 5. <hi>Behold I will send vnto you</hi> Elias <hi>the Prophet, before the great and fearefull day of the Lord come, and he shall turne the hearts of the fathers vnto the children, and the hearts of the children vnto their fathers.</hi> This place maketh no mention of <hi>Enoch,</hi> but onely of <hi>Elias:</hi> and by <hi>Elias</hi> is meant not <hi>Elias</hi> the Thesbite, but <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist:</hi> who (as the <note place="margin">Luke. 1. 17.</note> Angel applying to him this prophecy saith) should go before the Lord Iesus in the spirit and power of <hi>Elias,</hi> that he may turne the hearts of the fathers vnto the children, &amp;c. And our sauior Christ <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 14</note> most plainely affirmeth, that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> is that <hi>Elias</hi> who was to come, and <hi>if you will receiue</hi> (saith he) that is, if you will giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to my speech, <hi>this is that</hi> Elias <hi>who was to come:</hi> And addeth, <hi>he that hath eares to heare, let him heare.</hi> Which sheweth that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists neither haue harts to beleeue Christ, nor eares to heare him: but haue ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both hearts to receiue and eares to heare the fables of the Iewes: who as they yet looke for their <hi>Messias,</hi> so they looke also for <hi>Elias</hi> to be his forerunner. For as <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth vpon this place of <hi>Malachy, the Iewes and Iudaizing heretickes thinke that before their Messias,</hi> Elias <hi>shal come, and restore all things. Hence it is, that vnto Christ this question is propounded in the Gospell: what is that which the Pharisies say, that</hi> Elias <hi>shall come? to whom he answered:</hi> Elias <hi>indeed shal come: and if you will beleeue, he is already come, by</hi> Elias <hi>meaning</hi> Iohn.

                  <hi>to grind him.</hi> If notwithstanding all this which hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, any man shall thinke the first comming of the Lord, not so fitly to be called terrible: I further answer, that the Hebrew word <hi>Norah,</hi> signifieth also reuerend, to be feared, or had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 21. and so is translated by <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> in this place of <hi>Malachie.</hi> And thus both that word, and others of the same roote are vsed in the signification <note place="margin">Psal. 130. 4</note> of reuerence, or filiall feare. And whereas it is added, that <hi>Elias</hi> should be sent to conuert the people, <hi>Least when I come</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>I should strike the earth with a curse:</hi> the meaning is, that the Lord would send his messenger to prepare the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that some of the people at the least, might be ready to receiue our Sauiour Christ, least if all should reject him, he should be prouoked to strike the land: for at his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, he shall without peraduenture strike the earth. And in this exposition of <hi>Malachie</hi> besides others, <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> the most learned writer among the Papists, doth wholy agree with <note place="margin">In Malach.</note> vs; expounding this Prophesie of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth another <hi>Elias,</hi> and of the first comming of Christ. Thus therefore I answer: First that <hi>Malachie</hi> speaketh not of <hi>Enoch,</hi> but of <hi>Elias</hi> onely: and secondly, of <hi>Elias</hi> his comming, not with Antichrist, but before Christ: thirdly, &amp; that before the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ: fourthly and consequently, not of <hi>Elias</hi> literally, but of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who came in the spirit and power of <hi>Elias.</hi>

                     </gap>ance vnto the Gentiles.</hi> First I answer to both places, that although this booke of the sonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> be very commendable; yet it is not of Canonicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, being but a humane writing, as appeareth not onely by the former place alledged, but also by that erronious conceit concerning <hi>Samuel,</hi> chapter 46. 23. Secondly, in neither place is it said, that either of them should come to oppose themselues
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:25487:107"/>
against Antichrist; that from hence their returne into the world, should be made a signe of the comming of Antichrist. But as touching the former place, seuerally I answer with <hi>I ansenius</hi> one of the best writers among the Papists (howsoeuer <hi>Bellarmine</hi> wondereth at him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee should consent with vs in the trueth, beeing a Popish Bishop) that although the ancient writers haue thought that <hi>Elias</hi> was to come againe, yet it cannot be euinced out of this place. For we may say that <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus</hi> did write this according to the receiued opinion of his time, grounded (as they thought) vpon the words of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie,</hi> that <hi>Elias</hi> was truely to come in his owne person before the Messias: when as that was not to be fulfilled in his owne person, but in him that was to come in the spirit and power of <hi>Elias.</hi> True indeed it is, that not onely the authour of that booke, as it seemeth, but the Iewes in generall, vnderstanding the words of <hi>Malachie</hi> literally, did expect that <hi>Elias</hi> in his owne person should returne before the comming of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as. But our Sauiour Christ reformeth this errour, applying the Prophecie to <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> And secondly I answer, that if <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> will argue out of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> according to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he must prooue that <hi>Elias</hi> was to come in his owne person, before the first comming of the Messias, of which <hi>Malachie</hi> speaketh, and before which this authour as all the rest of the Iewes, doe holde that <hi>Elias</hi> was to come: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Papists might aswell with the Iewes, looke for their Messias, as for <hi>Elias.</hi> Now as touching the other place, it is a wonder that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would alledge it for this purpose. But that hauing nothing to say to the purpose, he is desirous to say some-thing to bleare the eyes of the simple. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Text hath these words, <gap reason="foreign">

applying his prophecie to <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who is figuratiuely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Elias.</hi> Yea but <hi>it cannot truely be said that</hi> Iohn Baptist <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all things: for to restore all things, is to call all the Iewes and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and perhaps some of the seduced Catholickes to the true faith,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obiecteth. This is indeede the Popish conceit, that Enoch <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>shall preach against Antichrist</hi> 1260. <hi>daies, at the end whereof they shalbe put to death by Antichrist, and after three dayes and an halfe, shall rise againe. Within a moneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death, Antichrist shalbe destroyed in mount Oliuet: and</hi> 45. <hi>dayes after that, Christ shall come to iudgement.

As touching the former he saith, <hi>the sonne of man when he commeth, shall he finde faith vpon the earth?</hi> And as <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 8.</note> touching the other, he hath foretolde that the end of the world shall be suddaine and vnlooked for, euen as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot.</hi> But if this conceit of the Papists be <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 39 Luk. 17. 26 18.</note> true, there shall be more true beleeuers at the end of the world, then euer had beene at one time before: and the day of Christs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, after the reuelation of Antichrist, but especially after his death, shalbe precisely knowne, &amp; accordingly looked for. Now whereas he saith, that <hi>Iohn</hi> did not restore all things, which (as Christ saith) <hi>Elias</hi> should doe: I answer, that Christ speaketh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their vnderstanding, and therefore that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did restore all things in that sense that <hi>Elias</hi> was, according to their conceit, to restore al things. But by restitution in this place, we are to vnderstand the reformation of the people and Church of the Iewes (to whom the messenger and forerunner is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; not to heretickes and seduced catholickes) wherein <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was another <hi>Elias.</hi> Neither is this restitution ascribed to the <hi>Baptist,</hi> as though it had beene perfected by him, but because he began that, which Christ was to bring to perfection.

For <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> they were taken vp into heauen: where in soule at the least they enioy the glorious presence of God.

But whether they be there in soule alone, or in soule &amp; body, there may be some question: but if they be there in body, it cannot be that their body is mortall (as the Papists would haue it) &amp; subiect to death.

8. Vnto these restimonies in the last place he addeth a reason, to make vp this demonstration, which may thus be concluded. <hi>If</hi> Enoch <hi>&amp;</hi> Elias <hi>were taken vp before their death, &amp; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                     </gap> bodies, wherein they are once to die; therefore they shall come in the time of Antichrist to set themselues against him.</hi> The proposition is vnnecessary, and the assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntrue. For though we should grant that they yet liue in mortall bodies, and that their death is yet deferred: yet how doth this follow, that they liue to resist Antichrist and to be slaine of him? <hi>Yea but saith</hi> Bell armine, <hi>there can n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ne other reason be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Of their translation, there is this reason, that there might be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent examples of reward and happinesse laid vp both for the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in <hi>Enoch,</hi> and for the zealous in <hi>Elias.</hi> Of their yet liuing in mortall bodies, if they did so according to the opinion of some of the fathers, that reason might be giuen, which they alledge, to wit, to conuert the Iewes. But the assumption also is false. For it is vntrue that they liue in mortall bodies, or that they shall euer dye. For where I beseech you doe they liue in mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in the earthly Paradice, or in the heauenly? In the earthly say the Papists; but that was defaced either at or before the floud: so that although the place remaine, yet no Paradice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> else where confesseth. And if they were <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Sanctor. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitud. C. 3</note> liuing in the earthly Paradise, how is it said, they were taken vp, as it is plainely said of <hi>Elias,</hi> that he was taken vp into heauen? Or what priuiledge or reward haue they aboue others, if all this <note place="margin">2. Kin. 2. 12</note> while they haue wanted Gods glorious presence which others enioy, and hereafter are to be slaine of Antichrist? Or how was <hi>Enoch</hi> translated that he should not see death, if notwithstanding his translation, he must dye the death? If in the celestiall Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, that is the third heauen as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, it may first be <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> doubted, whether they be there in body: because it may be thought that Christ was the first that in body ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: or if their bodies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o there, we must hold that in the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were changed into immortall and incorruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as theirs shall, who shall be found liuing vpon the earth as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:25487:110"/>
the second comming of Christ, and shalbe rapt vp into the aire. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 51.</note> For <hi>this I say</hi> with <hi>Paule, that flesh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of heauen, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="9">9. But will you see vnder one view, how farre this slender <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 50.</note> coniecture taken from the comming of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> is from being a demonstratiue proofe. First, he cannot prooue necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they are yet in their bodies. Secondly, if they be in their bodies, he cannot proue that their bodies are mortall. Thirdly, if their bodies be mortal, it is not necessary that they should returne into the world and die, because at the end of the world they might be changed with the rest that then shalbe liuing, as some also haue thought. Fourthly, if they should returne into the <note place="margin">Iustin. q. 85 ad ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxos.</note> world and dye, there is no necessity that they should come in the time of Antichrist. Fiftly, if it should be granted that they are to come against Antichrist, yet it would not follow that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichrist is not yet come: but this only would follow, that Antichrist is not yet destroyed, which we doe not deny. And this was his third demonstration, whereby he proueth that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is not yet come, and consequently that the Pope is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. To conclude therefore, must not this needs be a good cause, that by so learned a man is so stoutly proued?</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25487:110"/>
the publicke seruice of God wholy ceased, therefore Antichrist is not yet come. Of his third argument, and consequently of the proposition and assumprion, there are three partes, which seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are to be considered, that the persecution vnder Antichrist is, 1. Most greeuous. 2. Most manifest. 3. Such as shall cause all Gods worship to cease. As touching the first, he reasoueth thus: <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Antichrist shalbe the most greeuous persecution; as yet this most greeuous persecution hath not bin, especially vnder the Pope; therefore Antichrist is not yet come, neither is the Pope Antichrist.</hi> The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, namely, that the most grieuous persecution is vnder Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, he proueth by two testimonies.

Neither is that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting loose of Sathan to be vnderstood of the persecution onely vnder Antichrist: for it is manifest by the text, that within those thousand yeares, many martyrs were put to death by Antichrist for refusing to receiue his marke, and that the greatest part la<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dead in Antichristian errours and superstition, verse. 4. &amp; 5. and by the 8. verse, that Satan was let loose not onely to stirre vp per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution against the faithfull, but also and that principally to stir vp vniuersall wars betwixt the nations of the world, betwixt <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> that is, as some expound, the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi> Now I would gladly know of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> when these thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres began, and when they expired: for hereof there be diuers opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but I wil touch the principall, 1. That these thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres begin with the incarnation of Christ, and determine accordingly, when as <hi>Siluester</hi> the second had obtained the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie by the helpe of the diuell: after whom followed in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian seat a succession of notable sorcerers. 2. That the thousand yeeres begin about the 73. yeare of Christ: at which time the people of the Iewes being destroyed, and the Church of Christ of a particular became catholick &amp; dispersed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all nations, the diuell as it is in the end of the 12.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is said Chap. 20. (where the former story, as some thinke is continued) the Angel! bindeth Satan for a thousand yeares, which end in the yeare 1073. which being expired, the diuell is loosed, and <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. alias <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (a notable sorceres, and murtherer, in whom Antichrist came to his full growth) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled in the Papacie. <hi>Augustine</hi> beginneth this account much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">De ciuit.

In this expedition there met at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem 600000. footmen, and 100000. horsemen out of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, besides eight or nine other expeditions afterwards, for the recouerie forsooth of the holy-land. 4.

All which opinions being seuerally probable, it is more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that those 1000. yeeres are already expired: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that Antichrist is already come. For as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the diuell was to be loosed in the time of Antichrist, and the Text plainely sheweth, that before the expiration of the thousand yeares, and loosing of the diuell, many were slaine by Antichrist. So that the testimonies which he alledgeth are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his purpose. For the great tribulation whereof Christ speaketh is already past, and the thousand yeeres whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh, already expired: and therefore if <hi>Bellarmines</hi> allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be to the purpose, then Antichrist is come.</p>

Treason against the Prince, not onely because of their confederacie with the chiefe enemies of our state, the Pope and Spaniard, in regard whereof those Iesuites and Priests, which come among vs from beyond-Seas, as also those which harbour them, are worthy of death: but also because more generally they hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Popes supremacie and authoritie to depose Princes, and withall, beleeuing that the Pope in his definitiue sentence cannot erre: they cannot but approoue the Bull of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, wherein <hi>Pius</hi> the fift, (as much as was in him) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed our Queene of famous memory, and absolued her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from all allegeance to her.

Alas poore Wolues, how cruelly they haue beene handled among the sheepe of Christ!</p>
               <p n="5">5. But to proceed: <hi>As the persecution vnder Antichrist,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine, shall be most grieuous; so shall it be most manifest.</hi> For thus he reasoneth: <hi>The persecution vnder Antichrist shall be most manifest: this vnder the Pope is not manifest; therefore this is not the persecution of Antichrist.</hi> The proposition is prooued, <hi>because then all the wicked shall</hi> aperto marte, <hi>oppugne the whole church: and not onely those that be Infidels and open sinners, but the hypocrites also and false brethren, shall then joyne themselues to Antichrist, and discouering themselues, openly assault the Church.</hi> And is not this well gessed thinke you, contrary to the word of truth, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our Sauiour Christ? For whereas our Sauiour hath said, that the good and bad shall growe together like Wheate and Tares, vntill the day of the great haruest: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> telleth vs, that when Antichrist commeth, there shall such a separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made, that there shall not an hypocrite be left in the Church: but all the wicked without exception, shall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <note place="margin">Omnes prorsus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pios simul futuros in exercitu Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti.</note> in Antichrists hoste; and shall openly oppugne the whole Church of the Saints. But such separation is not to be looked for, vntill Christ shall seuer the Lambes from the Goates. And therefore if we must not beleeue that Antichrist is come, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such a separation be made: assuredly Christ will come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs to judgement, whiles we looke for Antichrist. Yea but <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>That now there be many false bretheren in the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De ciuit. Dei. lib. 20. c. 11.</note>

                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:25487:114"/>
If <hi>Augustine</hi> had said so, we might wel haue esteemed his speech to haue beene but a humane conjecture, rather then a Prophecie diuine. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> without all shame falsifieth his words. For <hi>Augustine</hi> in that place speaking of those words, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>Soluetur Satanas de custodia sua &amp; exibit ad seducendas nationes, Satan shall be let loose out of his warde, and shall goe forth to seduce the nations: Exibit autem dictum est</hi> (saith he) <hi>in apertam persecutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, de latebris erumpet odiorum: Now it is said that he shall goe forth,</hi> viz. <hi>into open persecution; he shall breake forth of the couerts of hatred,</hi> speaking of the diuell alone, and not of all the wicked. And thus was his proposition doughtily prooued, being neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse according to his sense, repugnant to the Scriptures, which describe Antichrist, not as an open enemy, but as a secret; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher antichristianisme, not as a professed hostilitie, but as a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of iniquitie, as hath beene shewed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Come we to his assumption, This manifest persecution hath not bin, neither is, as yet, &amp; why? First, <hi>because there are now so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false brethren in the church as neuer were more;</hi> speaking of the church of Rome, wherin it is hard indeed to finde a true christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But shal not Antichrist come whiles there are false brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the church? or rather shall we not thinke, that the Apostasie of false brethren in the church of Rome &amp; pretended Christians, wherof Antichrist is the head, is a good argument of his comming? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>because no man can tell when this persecution began.</hi> That, if it were true, doth not disprooue the greatnesse of the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but argue the length. Yea <hi>but vnder</hi> Nero, Domitian, <hi>&amp; the rest of the persecuting Emperours, it was well knowne when the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions began, and when they ended.</hi> That happened because there was some intermission of those persecutions: but these persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnder Antichrist they haue no end, nor yet intermissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be when they haue none to persecute. But how doth it appeare that none know when these persecutions of Antichrist began? For sooth, <hi>because some of vs say, that Antichrist came in the yeere</hi> 200. <hi>others in</hi> 606. <hi>others in</hi> 773, <hi>others in</hi> 1000, <hi>others in</hi> 1200. The vanity of which objection, which now like a twice-bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>de Colewurt he setteth before vs againe, hath bin shewed before. For of these opinions, onely two belong to vs, and those not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. For we hold, that as the whole soueraigntie and tyranny
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:25487:114"/>
of the Pope consisteth in his two swords, which he did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine at once, but by degrees: so we make two degrees of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ his comming: first with the spirituall sword in the yeere 607. secondly, with the temporall, after the yeere 1000. which was more fully obtained then before, in <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth: In whom, as hath bin said, Antichrist was come to his full growth. Since which time, he hath been more and more reuealed, and by some acknowledged. Vpon which acknowledgment there hath followed separation from him, according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, and refusall of his marke: whereupon persecution hath ensued, and neuer hath ceased where any such haue been found, where the Pope hath to do. Neither are we with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly to confound the time of his comming, with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his persecution. For he began not to persecute, vntil men began to forsake him: and men did not forsake him vntill he was discouered what he was, and acknowledged: neither was he acknowledged, vntill he came to his full growth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And thus the two first parts of this demonstration, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the persecution of Antichrist, how great and manifest it should be, are already answered, although in truth not worth the answering. The third part is concerning the <hi>publike seruice of God and ceremonies of the church, which</hi> (he saith) <hi>in the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ by reason of that grieuous persecution shall wholy cease.</hi> His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is thus framed. <hi>When Antichrist is come, the publicke seruice of God, and daily sacrifice of Christians (meaning the sacrifice of the Masse) shall cease: but as yet the publicke seruice of God, and daily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christians, hath not ceased; therefore as yet Antichrist is not come.</hi> To the proposition I answer, that Antichrist being an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and pretended Christian (as hath bin prooued) shall not abolish all worship of God, &amp; much lesse at his first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh this interruption of Gods seruice, a fruite of his greatest persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: his persecution (as I said) is a consequent of mens for saking him; and that of his acknowledgement: and that, of his shewing himselfe in his colours, when he was come to his full growth, whereunto he attained not at the first, but by degrees. But this proposition is prooued, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> out of <hi>Daniel. chap.</hi> 12. <hi>verse</hi> 11. <hi>From the time when the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, are dayes</hi> 1290. <hi>Where</hi> (saith he) <hi>Daniel speaketh of</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:25487:115"/>
                  <hi>the time of Antichrist.</hi> For the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this place, we need not with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> run to the Fathers, seeing by conference thereof with some other places in <hi>Daniel,</hi> whereunto it hath reference, it may most plainly be shewed, who it is that taketh away this dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrifice, and what that sacrifice is. In the eight chapt. vers. 11. and chapt. 11. vers. 31. it is affirmed, that by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and his armies, the daily worship of God should be taken away. When as therfore <hi>Daniel</hi> asked when there should be an end of these things? the Holy-ghost answereth, that from the time that the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the abomination of deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation placed, whereof he had spoken, chap. 11. 31. there should be 1290. dayes. For of the restitution of Gods seruice, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of the Iewes from the tyranny of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> there are foretold diuers degrees at diuers times, which agreeably to these Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> are noted in the histories of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and of the <hi>Maccabees:</hi> for from the interruption of Gods seruice, to the first restitution thereof by <hi>Iudas Macchabeus,</hi> were three yeeres and ten daies, namely from the 15. of the moneth <hi>Casteu,</hi>

                  </gap> the sacrifice of Christians ceased. But if by the publicke seruice of God he meaneth his true worship and seruice in spirit and truth: assuredly it hath beene taken away in the Papacy, except will-worship, superstition, and Idolatry be the true worship of God. As touching Christian sacrifices; we acknowledge the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praise, the sacrifice of a broken and contrite heart, the <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 15 Psal. 51. 17 Rom. 12. 1. Heb. 13. 16.</note> sacrifice of obedience wherein we offer our selues, the sacrifice of almes wherby we offer our goods; these sacrifices, no Antichrist can wholy take away. As for the sacrifice of the masse, we holde it to be a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>strous abomination, wherein the holy sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords supper, is turned into an abominable Idoll. Seeing therfore there is no soundnesse of truth either in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or assumption, must we not needes thinke that the question in hand is soundly concluded? And yet vpon these grounds <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth not only infer the question in hand, but two more also. From hence saith he, three things may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. First, <hi>that Antichrist is not as yet come, becàuse the daily sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice yet continueth.</hi> He might as well haue concluded with the Iewes that Christ is not yet come: for he was to abolish the daylie sacrifice, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 27. partly by his owne sacrifice, vnto which the shadowes of the Law were to giue place; and partly by the ouerthrow of the temple, in which and not elsewhere it was to be offered. His second conclusion is, <hi>that the Pope of Rome is not Antichrist, but rather an aduersary vnto him; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee doth adore and maintaine this sacrifice, which Antichrist is to abolish.</hi> Nay rather by ordaining this propitiatory sacrifice, and erecting a new priesthood to offer the same, the Pope, sheweth himselfe to be Antichrist. For by this Priesthood Christ is denyed to bee our onely Priest: by this Sacrifice,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:25487:116"/>
his sacrifice on the Crosse is supposed not to be sufficient: in this sacrifice the humanity of Christ (as hath beene shewed) is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and a God of bread set vp in his roome to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and adored. In this sacrifice Christ alter a sort is made infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to euery masse-monger, who as they can make their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour by breathing out a few words <hi>(hoc est corpus meum)</hi> so when they haue made him in their conceit, they offer him vp to God, to be a sacrifice propitiatory both for the quicke and the dead. His third conclusion is; <hi>that the heretickes of this time aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are forerunners of Antichrist, because they desire nothing more, then the ouerthrow of this sacrifice of the masse.</hi> Nay rather as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the former answer, they shew themselues the limmes of Antichrist, who ouerthrowing the sacrament of the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (which we haue reduced to the first institution) seeke to vphold this masse and heape of all abominations and sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Idolatry. And how are all these things prooued? forsooth because <hi>Daniel</hi> hath prophecied that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for a time the daily sacrifice of the Iewes; therefore Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is not yet come, therefore the Pope is not Antichrist, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those that mislike the masse are forerunners of Antichrist. And so with these three conclusions, as it were so many roapes of sand, he knitteth vp his fourth demonstration.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here remaine two demonstrations (as he calleth them) proouing that Antichrist is not yet come, taken from those signes which follow Antichrist, to wit, the death of Antichrist after three yeers &amp; an halfe, and the end of the world. Where <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> teacheth vs not to looke for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, vntill he be gone; not to expect his comming, vntill the world haue an end. For if these be signes that Antichrist is not yet come (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh them) then may we argue
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:25487:116"/>
now, and so may argue euen vntill the end of the world: <hi>Vntill Antichrist be dead and the world haue an end, Antichrist commeth not; but at yet (may we say now, and so may say vntill the end) An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist is not dead, neither as yet hath the world an end; therefore as yet Antichrist is not come.</hi> By this argument therefore you see, how fitly these two signes are made the ground of two demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, that Antichrist is not yet come. Now as touching the former, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reasoneth thus. <hi>The fift demonstration</hi> (viz. to proue that Antichrist is not yet come) <hi>is taken from the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Antichrist. Antichrist shall not raigne but three yeeres and a halfe. But the Pope hath raigned spiritually in the Church aboue</hi> 1500. <hi>yeer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s, neither can any be assigned that hath bene taken for Antichrist, who hath raigned precisely three yeers and a halfe: The Pope therfore is not Antichrist. Wherefore Antichrist is not yet come.</hi> His reason is thus to be resolued. <hi>If neither the Pope be Antichrist, nor any other, who hitherto hath beene taken for Antichrist; then is not Antichrist as yet come: But neither the Pope is Antichrist, nor any that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath beene taken for Antichrist; therefore as yet Antichrist is not come.</hi> Where you see by a circular disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Iesuit for want of better arguments, bringeth the maine question (namely whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope be Antichrist) as an argument to proue, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is not yet come, and consequently that the Pope is not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. The Pope is not Antichrist; why? because Antichrist is not yet come: and why is not Antichrist yet come? because the Pope is not Antichrist. He may as well goe on, for there is no end in a circle: and why is not the Pope Antichrist? because Antichrist is not yet come: and why is not Antichrist yet come? because the Pope is not Antichrist. And thus <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as you see, danceth in a round.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But to come to the purpose, how doth he prooue, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope is Antichrist, nor any other that hath beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Antichrist? by this syllogisme: <hi>Antichrist shall raigne but three yeeres and a halfe precisely: but neither the Pope, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath beene taken for Antichrist, hath raigned three yeers and a halfe precisely: therefore neither the Pope is Antichrist, nor any other that as yet hath bene taken for Antichrist.</hi> The assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he might haue proued by a truth, he chooseth to proue
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:25487:117"/>
by a falsehood. For whereas he might haue said and that truely, that the Pope hath raigned spiritually in the church aboue 900. yeeres, and therfore aboue three yeers &amp; a halfe; he saith, he hath raigned (meaning an vniuersall raigne ouer the whole Church, or else he proueth not his assumption) aboue 1500. which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. For he could not obtaine this vniuersall raigne, before the yeere 607. But all the controuersie is concerning the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For we doe grant, that the Popes haue raigned and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Church, almost a thousand yeeres; and therfore aboue three yeers and a halfe. Let vs therfore consider how he proueth, that Antichrist shall raigne 3. yeers and a halfe precisely. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it by diuers prophecies of the Scriptures, &amp; ghesses of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which were no prophecies. And first he alleageth these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. <hi>and</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Where we read</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the raign of Antichrist shal continus a time and times &amp; halfe a time, that is, a yeere and two yeeres and halfe a yeere; and so he saith, S.</hi> Iohn <hi>expoundeth it,</hi> Apoc. 11. and 13. <hi>by</hi> 42. <hi>moneths, and</hi> 1260 <hi>daies,</hi> I answer, that none of these places defineth the time, or terme of Antichrists raigne. <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh not of the time of Antichrists raigne, but of that time wherin the Iewes were to be afflicted, &amp; the temple &amp; seruice of God in Ierusalem was to be profaned by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> which time the Angell diuersly recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <note place="margin">Chap. 16.</note> as was in part shewed in the last chapter, &amp; shal hereafter be more fully declared. For of their deliuerance from the tyrannie of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> there are foure degrees, obtained at 4. seueral times, all which seeme to be noted by <hi>Daniel.</hi> The first, is the restitution of Gods worship &amp; renouation of the temple by <hi>Iudas Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Mac. 1. 57.</note> From the profanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore, which was on the 15. of <hi>Casteu</hi>

Now whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, that the terme of antichrists raigne shalbe 3. yeers &amp; a halfe precisely, &amp; saith that this terme is expressed in the Apocalypse by 1260. dayes, and in <hi>Daniel</hi> by 1290. he seemed not to haue beene well aduised: for 1290. are not 1260. nor 3. yeeres and a halfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely: And therein he contradicteth himselfe, and maketh <hi>Iohn</hi> in the same matter to be repugnant to <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As touching the places in the Apocalypse, it is hard to prooue that the times mentioned in the 11. 12. and 13. chapters, be the same (which he must prooue, or else by conference of these places he prooueth nothing) and if they be the same (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are not) it will be as hard to define where we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the account. But these two things may be affirmed. First, that all these times are not to be vnderstood literally: And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defineth the time of Antichrists raigne. The 42. moneths in the 11. and 13. chapters signifie the time of the persecution vnder the Romane Emperours either only or es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially: for Chap. 11. v. 2. it is said <hi>that the Gentiles shal tread vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy city</hi> 42. <hi>moneths.</hi> But antichrist (as the Papists hold) shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be the Prince of the Iewes and counterfeit Christians. And v. 7. it is said, that the beast which ariseth out of the deepe (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same with that which is described chap. 13. 1. is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane state, especially as it was vnder the persecuting emperours) that this beast (I say) shall persecute the two witnesses of God, and their bodies shall lie in the streetes of the great Cities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in the Apocalypse is meant Rome or the R. empire. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also it appeareth that this terme of 42. moneths mentioned in both places, is not literally to be vnderstood. For the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder the Romane Emperours alone, endured so many Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths of yeeres, as there are moneths mentioned in those places, that is, 294. yeers, as Master <hi>Fox</hi> expoundeth it. Now if the other
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:25487:118"/>
termes mentioned, chap. 11. and 12. of time and times and halfe a time, and of dayes 1260. be the same with the 42. moneths, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will needes haue it; then by them is not signified An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs raigne, neither are they to be vnderstood literally, no more then the 42. moneths: but in the 11. chap. the time of the two witnesses preaching, during the time of the afore said perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and chap 12. the womans, that is, the Churches liuing in the desert during the said time. Howbeit the speech of time and times and halfe a time may rather be vnderstood (according to <hi>Daniels</hi> phrase) of three yeeres and a halfe, wherin the Church of <note place="margin">Vid. Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in Apo. 12.</note> Christ which was at Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after it was admonished by a voyce out of the sanctuary to depart, &amp; accordingly remoued to <hi>Pella,</hi> was sustained there. For in that place it is plaine, that the holy Ghost speaketh not of Antichrist nor yet of the beast, but of the Serpent the diuell, who seeketh the ouerthrow of the Church of Christ among the Iewes, &amp; afterwards turneth his anger towards the rest of her seed, that is, the faithful among the Gentiles, and to that end standeth on the sea shore, from whence he raiseth the beast with seauen heads, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And further I ad, that if these times me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in those places which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth, did signifie the terme of Antichrists <note place="margin">2</note> raign precisely, &amp; were to be vnderstood literally; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it wold fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that after antichrist is once reuealed, al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Scriptures, may precisely define before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the very day of Christs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: which the Lord notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing wil not haue known <hi>(Mar.</hi> 13. 32.) as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself <note place="margin">Cap. 3. lib. 3.</note> must needs grant, seeing he vseth this as the chiefe argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those which by 1260. dayes vnderstand so many yeeres. Againe it is incredible, if not impossible, that so many &amp; so great <note place="margin">3.</note> things as they assigne to Antichrist, should be effected &amp; brought to passe in so short a time; as <hi>Hentenius</hi> a learned Papist doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and as hath bin shewed heretofore. For this is an errour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending <note place="margin">In praesat. translat. Arcth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> vpon the former, concerning the person of Antichrist, &amp; presupposing that Antichrist is but one man. And therfore when <note place="margin">4</note> we proued that Antichrist is not any one man alone, but a whole state and succession of men, we proued this by consequence, that his raigne was not to continue only three yeers and a halfe. And
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:25487:118"/>
againe Antichrist, according to the conceit of the Papists, is to <note place="margin">5</note> raigne before the preaching of the two witnesses, and as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> faith, is to continue one moneth after their death. Seeing then the two witnesses preach 1260. dayes, which, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also saith, make three yeers &amp; a halfe precisely, how can the terme of Antichrists raigne be three yeeres and a halfe precisely? Lastly <note place="margin">6</note> the Scriptures plainely testifie, that the Antichrist which is to be destroied at the second comming of Christ, was come euen in the Apostles time, although he was not reuealed by exercising openly a soueraigne &amp; vniuersal dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntill that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that is, the Roman Empire was taken out of the way. But after the Empire was once dissolued in the West, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the East had lost his right in Italy and Rome, that is, when that which hindred was taken out of the way, then according to the prophecie, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 8. was Antichrist reuealed, succeeding the Emperor in the gouernment of Rome, and claiming an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall authority, first spirituall, ouer the whole Church in the yeere 607. &amp; after temporal, ouer the whole world, &amp; aduancing himselfe aboue all that is called God: all which we haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proued to haue bin done in the Papacie, aboue three yeeres and a halfe agoe, yea aboue so many hundred yeers agoe; so that we shall not need to expect another Antichrist, who is to raigne three yeers and a half. And thus you haue heard not only <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> allegations answered, but also his assertion confuted.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Now let vs see what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can reply either against our assertion in general, or against the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of some protestants in particular. For wheras we generally affirme, notwithstanding his allegations aforesaid, that Antichrist hath already ruled in the Church almost a thousand yeers, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> besides the slender coniectures of diuers of the fathers grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on such prophecies of Scriptures as they could not vnderstand, which are his first argument, he produceth six other reasons, no lesse easie to be answered. His second argument is, because the scriptures say that the time of the diuels loosing, and Antichrists raigning is <hi>breuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum, very short,</hi> or <hi>most short: But how can that be true if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall raigne a thousand yeeres or more?</hi> For that which he speaketh of 1260. yeeres, is the priuate opinion of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:25487:119"/>
some of which shall be touched afterwards. I answer, that the Scriptures no where say that Antichrists raigne, or that the time <note place="margin">Apo. 17. 10 <gap reason="foreign">

Let vs then weigh his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which may be resolued into two syllogismes: the former, <hi>A thousand yeeres or more is not a short time: Antichrists raigne is a short time: therfore Antichrists raigne is not a thousand yeers or more.</hi> First to the proposition I answer, that a thousand yeers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord (who speaketh in the Scriptures) is a short time. The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> expresly saith, that a thousand yeers with the Lord <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 8.</note> are but as one day. Yea, and the whole time from the ascension of Christ vntil his comming to iudgement, is often noted in the Scriptures to be a short time, and in one place it is called the last houre. And likewise aboue 1500. yeers agoe, it was promised, <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 18</note> that the prophecies concerning the destruction of Antichrist, the second comming of Christ, &amp; end of the world, should within a short time be fulfilled. To the assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I answer, that although the time of Antichrists tyranny seeme to belong to them that <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Ap. 22. 10. 12. 20. Heb. 10. 37</note> are exercised therby; yet it is but short in compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that time which they shall raigne with Christ, and is so called; <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. 10. But yet nothing so short as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> imagineth. This therefore he proueth in the second Syllogisme: <hi>The time of Sathan loosed is very short: the terme of Antichrists raigne is the time of Sathan loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: therefore the terme of Antichrists raigne is very short.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position he proueth by two places in the Apocalypse, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his time to be short, but yet nothing so short as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists imagine: for in the former place, Chap. 12. 12. he is said to haue but a short time, before he persecuted the Church of Christ among the Iewes, which was aboue 1500. yeeres agoe. And in the latter place, Chap. 20. 3. it is said that he should be <hi>let loose for a smal time:</hi> but this smal time beginneth at the expiration of the thousand yeeres wherein he had beene bound, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vntill the time that he shalbe cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, in the end of the world. Now the thousand yeeres were expired many hundred yeeres agoe, as hath beene shewed. But although the time of Antichrists raigne be called short, yet is it not so short as the time of Sathan loosed: and therefore the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:25487:119"/>
assumption is false: For howsoeuer the thousand yeares expire in the time of Antichrists raigne, yet we are not to beginne the raigne of Antichrist with the loosing of Sathan. For within the thousand yeares of Sathans imprisonment, Antichrist not onely <note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 4.</note> was, but also persecuted those that refused his marke: and yet we are not to confound the time of his persecution, much lesse of his hotest persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the time of his continuance. Now the time of the diuel loosed, as the Papists teach, is the time of Antichrists most greeuous persecution, which was a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent of mens refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his marke, &amp; that a fruite of his discouerie &amp; acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but he was not acknowledged vntill he came to his full grouth, whereunto he attained not at the first. And it is to be thought that the heate of his persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wilbe slaked before his end, himselfe being consumed and wasted by the spirit of Christs <note place="margin">2.

In this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Bellarmine</hi> presupposeth that Antichrist is but one man, as Christ is, which we haue proued to be most false. 2. he taketh vpon him to be the Lords counsailour, auouching that it is not fit that Antichrist should preachlonger then Christ did: he might haue added that it was not fit, or to speake more fitly, not like that Antichrist in the same time should be able to preuaile with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:25487:120"/>
more then Christ did, &amp; much lesse to peruert almost the whole world in three yeeres and a halfe; whereas Christ as he was man, could conuert but a few of the Iewes, &amp;c. 3. Although Christ in his owne person preached but a few yeres; yet he being the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word and wisdome of his father, hath euer since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spoken by the mouth of his Prophets &amp; ministers, by whose ministerie also as it were the breath of his mouth, he shall waste and consume Antichrist. 4. Neither can it be prooued by any shew of reason, that Antichrist is to preach just so many yeeres, as Christ our Sauiour did: Or that he shall in three yeeres and an halfe subdue by force, I know not how many kingdomes, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert by preaching, &amp; gather to himselfe the remna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Iewes, and all counterfeit Christians, dispersed through so many nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as a man cannot trauell through in three yeeres and a halfe: not to speake of his repairing Ierusalem, &amp; erecting the temple, and many good morrowes, which by many poëticall fictions the Papists assigne to their deuised Antichrist. His fift and sixt reasons are not worth the mentioning. For the time and times, and halfe a time, as hath bin shewed, belong not to Antchrists raigne, and therby we vnderstand 3, yeeres &amp; a halfe, as also by the 7. times, <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 19.</note> in the 4. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> 7. yeeres, according to the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Ghost (expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, as it seemeth) <hi>times</hi> by <hi>yeres. Dan.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the last place he laboureth to take away the exceptions which some particular man, as namely, <hi>Chytraeus, Bullinger,</hi> &amp; the authors of the Centuries, make against his former allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s out of <hi>Daniel</hi> &amp; the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> but scarsly toucheth any one of the 6 exceptions before mentioned. For whereas <hi>Chytraus</hi> answereth, <note place="margin">§. 3. &amp; 4.</note> that the 42. moneths in the 11. and 13. of the <hi>Apoc.</hi> may not be vnderstood literally for three yeres and a halfe, because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to experience: and besides the Apostle affirmeth that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall continue vntill Christs comming. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> replieth, that he beggeth the question. But I answer againe as before, that experience sheweth that the persecutions vnder the beast with 7 heads, continued longer then three yeeres and a halfe: &amp; when as <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmeth that the Antichrist was come in his time, &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> foretelleth, that he should after a sort continue (though at the last in a kind of consumption) vnto the second comming of Christ,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:25487:120"/>
surely their meaning was, that he should continue aboue three yeeres and a halfe. 2. He findeth fault <hi>with him</hi> &amp; Bullinger, <hi>who thought that the holy ghost mentioning</hi> 42. <hi>moneths &amp;</hi> 1260. <hi>dayes, by a certaine time, meant an vncertaine;</hi> replying that the <hi>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber which is meant, is certaine, when it consisteth of great &amp; small nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers mixed.</hi> But they speake of the time, and he of the number, and therfore his reprehension is vnjust. For although the holy ghost do meane no other number then 42, and 1260, yet by the certaine time mentioned, that is, moneths &amp; dayes, he meaneth an vncertaine, which may be as some thinke 42. sabbothes of yeeres, and 1260 yeeres. And thirdly, whereas <hi>Illyricus,</hi> and the other authors of the Centuries by 1260. daies, vnderstand so many yeeres; <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> denieth that daies are put for yeeres any where in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet cannot deny, but that by 390. dayes in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> is <note place="margin">Ezec. 4. 5. 6</note> meant 390. yeeres, and by 40. dayes so many yeares, <hi>a day for a yeere,</hi> as the holy ghost speaketh. And likewise <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 10. by ten <note place="margin">Vid. Iun. in Apoc. 2.</note> daies is meant 10. yeeres, as some of the learned thinke. Indeed if any shall by 1260 dayes, vnderstand (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth) the just time of Antichrists reigne, and withall expound them either by 1260. yeeres, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> chargeth some, or by three yeeres and <note place="margin">Cap. 3.</note> a halfe, as the Papists do; they may be refuted by the reason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged, because after the reuelation of Antichrist the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall time of Christs comming may according to this exposition be foretold, which notwithstanding shall not come by obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but suddenly, neither shall precisely be foreknowne, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowne onely to the Lord.</p>

For whereas he propounded this question to be concluded, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:25487:121"/>
Antichrist is not yet come, he concludeth that he came not long since. So that for all this demonstration Antichrist may alreadie be come, although perhaps not so long since, as some doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: But let vs see how he proueth that he was not come long since. <hi>If Antichrist were come long since, then also the world long since should haue had an end: but the world hath not yet an end, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichrist was not come long since.</hi> The proposition he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, because Antichrist <hi>commeth a very little while before the ende of the world, and as it were immediately before the second comming of Christ.</hi> But this whole demonstration may easily be refuted by this one distinction: for we must distinguish betwixt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Antichrist and his death, betwixt his beginning and his ende. Antichrist indeed is not vtterly to be destroied before the second comming of Christ: but this doth not proue that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was not come long since. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth tell vs that Antichrist is to be destroied at the second comming of Christ: notwithstanding both he doth insinuate and <hi>Iohn</hi> plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professeth that the Antichrist which they had heard was to come in the last houre, was alreadie come in his time: and thereupon inferreth that euen then was the last houre or age of the world, which the holy ghost calleth an houre, that we should not thinke it long.</p>

First, that the reigne of Antichrist is not three yeeres and a halfe precisely, or 1260. dayes; but 1290. dayes.

therfore now is the last houre.

But as I said before, suppose they all spake of the day of judgement, &amp; end of the world following vpon Antichrist: yet none of them joineth the end of the world with his comming &amp; birth, but with his death &amp; destruction. And the like may be said of his allegation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the common consent of the fathers &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his aduersaries, <hi>For our aduersaries</hi> (saith he) <hi>confesse, that Antichrist shall raigne</hi> (we say he shall continue) <hi>vnto the end of the world: &amp; therfore sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, He was come in his time, &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he should be reuealed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which hindered was done out of the way, which was done many hundred yeeres ago. Therfore though his end concur with the end of the world, yet there shall be a greater distance then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> imagineth, betwixt his comming and the end of the world. This <hi>Bellarmine</hi> foreseeing, perceiued very well, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> this demonstration by it selfe alone, there is no force at all. And therfore he joyneth it with the fift, of both which together he saith, an vnanswerable demonstration may be made, to prooue that Antichrist is not yet come, &amp; that the Pope is not Antichrist. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>if presently after the death of Antichrist the world shall haue an end, and Antichrist shall dye, after he hath raigned but three yeeres &amp; a halfe; then it followeth, that Antichrist shall not appeare nor begin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the Pope hath raigned longer then 3. yeers &amp; an halfe, and yet the world co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth, therfore the Pope is not antichrist.</hi> The vanity of the former demonstratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is made the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the last, I haue sufficiently shewed before: &amp; therfore that which is said of two ciphers in ciphering, the same may be said of these two demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations ioyned together, that naught to naught makes naught.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:25487:123"/>
For now I will not stand to tell you, how the three yeares and a halfe which in the former demonstration were 1260. dayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely, are now growne to 1335. dayes. For Antichrist shall not begin to reigne, saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> vntill within three yeares and a halfe before the end, and yet from the beginning of his reigne, vntill the end of the world, shall be 1335. dayes; so that in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermines</hi> precise account of halfe a yeare, 75. dayes, that is 10. weekes, and 5. dayes are nothing.</p>
               <p>Thus haue we answered these sixe demonstrations, which we haue shewed to haue beene farre from proouing demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, either that Antichrist is not yet come, or that the Pope is not Antichrist. Wherefore to conclude, if the Papists demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations in so weighty a cause, whereupon all Poperie depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, be such trifling trumperie, as is scarse worth the answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, what shall we thinke be their ordinary arguments in other causes of lesse importance.

For the name of Antichrist cannot be knowne as the name of Antichrist, vntill Antichrist himselfe be knowne and acknowleged. But Antichrist himselfe was not commonly to be knowne &amp; acknowleged at his first comming: For then he could not be able to seduce many, few or none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so desperately madde as to follow him whom they know to be Antichrist. First therefore the mysterie of iniquity was to worke secretly to the seducing of many: afterwards, Antichrist was to be reuealed, first, by his manifest appearing and shewing himselfe more plainely and openly; after by his acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereof also there are degrees; first by some particularly; secondly, by whole Churches generally; and yet neuer in this world to be acknowleged of those, that receiue and retaine his marke.

As appeareth in the prophecies of the scripture ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Christ, but not yet vnderstood of the Iewes, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to haue bin verified in Christ. And euen as the prophecies concerning Christ are by true Christians easily vnderstood; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit to Iewes &amp; infidels they remaine darke &amp; obscure, because the God of this world hath blinded their eyes, that they should not see the shining light of the Gospel: so also the prophecies
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:25487:124"/>
concerning Antichrist, which already are fulfilled in the Papacy, howsoeuer many of them are plainly vnderstood of the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours; yet to the followers of Antichrist, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath giuen ouer to strong illusions, that they may beleeue lies, they seeme to be darke &amp; obscure, and not as yet fulfilled. Notwithstanding the former part of his assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do embrace: that prophecies vntill they be fulfilled are (for the most part) darke and ambiguous, and herein with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> we approue <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his iudgement. But hereupon we infer, that therfore the writings of the fathers, who liuing before the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichrist, &amp; expounding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning Antichrist, were most vncertaine ghesses (as <note place="margin">Sed nec isti patres vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerunt sententias illas suas, alio loco haberi, quam suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionum &amp; coniectura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.</hi> Lib. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> euen in this chapter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth) the prophecies being to them darke and ambiguous, which now since the fulfilling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of haue bin more plaine and perspicuous: &amp; therfore that it is no arrogancy in vs which see the euent agreeing with the prophecy, to take vpon vs to expound diuers prophecies concerning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, the true vnderstanding whereof was hid from the fathers. For if God would haue had them plainly known before their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, surely he would haue made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowne by those his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts th'apostles by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were deliuered. And so <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, that he would not take vpon him certainely to define what this name shold be, <hi>Scientes</hi> (saith he) <hi>quoniam si operteret manifeste prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti tempore praeconari nomen eius, per ipsum vti<expan>

Thirdly, because <hi>Irenaeus</hi> reporteth from those who had seene <hi>Iohn</hi> face to face, that the name of the beast shall according to the computation of the <hi>Greekes</hi> by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are in it, containe 666. The second opinion is of those who thinke Antichrists name to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of which we will speake anone in his due place. The third opinion is of many Papists who thinke that his name shalbe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, thereby vnderstanding an aduersary, but that is not a name that he shall assume to himselfe, or impose vpon others, but a name rather giuen him of his aduersaries. Neither is it the name of the beast here spoken of. The fourth of <hi>Rupertus,</hi> who imagined that by this threefold number 666. is signified, the threefold preuarication of Sathan: first in himselfe; secondly, in our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; thirdly in Antichrist.

               <p n="5">5. To these opinions many more might be added, but to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:25487:125"/>
make short worke: the last of these opinions is <hi>Bellarmines:</hi> the second is ours: therefore let vs consider how he prooueth his owne opinion, and disprooueth ours. That this name is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would prooue by the authority of <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> as if he should haue said, This name was not certainely knowne in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time; therefore not in our time. I deny the consequence, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> liued before the fulfilling of this prophecie, as himselfe professeth &amp; as the truth is: for he liued aboue 1400. <note place="margin">Non ante mul'um temporis, pene sub nostro saecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo. Iren. Lib. 5.</note> yeeres agoe: and as himselfe saith, the reuelation was giuen to <hi>Iohn</hi> but a little before his age. For it was giuen in the end of the first Century, and he liued in the second, and therefore it is more safe (saith he) to waite for the fulfilling of this prophecie, then before hand to determine any thing. For if the Lord would haue had this name knowne in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time, he would haue made it knowne by <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe, to whom the reuelation was giuen. But as before the fulfilling of this prophecie, he saith, this name was very obscure; so he signifieth, that after the fulfilling it should be more plaine. And therefore that which he could but ghesse at in his time, we may now define, time hauing reuealed that trueth, which vntill the prophecie was cleared by the euent lay hidde: otherwise it shall be lawfull for men to reason from the authority of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, euen vnto the end of the world. But may we then reason thus: this name was not knowne in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time, therefore it shall neuer be knowne? to what end was this prophecie giuen, if it shall neuer be vnderstood? Whereas therefore he vseth the arguments whereby <hi>Irenaeus</hi> prooueth, that this name could not be knowne in his time, to prooue that it cannot be knowne in our time, he is ridiculous. There are many names, saith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that haue this number, therefore it is heard before hand to tell which is this name. Againe, if in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time God would haue this knowne, he would haue reuealed it by <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to define before hand his name, for missing of his name we shall not know him when he commeth, and therefore shall be in the more danger to be decoiued by him. All this we grant. But will <hi>Bellarmine</hi> needs be so ridiculous, as to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:25487:126"/>
conclude: <hi>In</hi> Irenaeus <hi>his time men were not able to tell which of those names that containe the number</hi> 666 <hi>is the name of the beast, therefore</hi> 1400. <hi>yeeres after none shall be able to tell. God would not have it knowne in</hi> Irenaeus <hi>his time, therefore he will not haue it knowne now. It was dangerous then before the fulfilling of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, to define what this name should be: therefore it is dangerous now, when the prophecie is expounded by the euent, to apply the one to the other?</hi> And what doth he inferre hereuppon? <hi>Therefore no doubt the Protestants, who thinke the Pope to be Antichrist, shalbe deceiued of the true Antichrist, when he commeth.</hi> But blessed be God that hath already reuealed vnto vs the true Antichrist, that knowing him we might auoyde him: whereas vpon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists he hath sent strong illusions, that they may beleeue lyes, because they loued not the truth that they might be saued, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Againe he prooueth this name not to be knowne, because there is great controuersie about it, what it should be. But by the same reason he may conclude that few points of religion are yet knowne, because there be few concerning which there is no controuersie. Notwithstanding as in other controuersies, the trueth is knowne of those which are Orthodoxall, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer others will not acknowledge it: so I doubt not, but that the trueth in this matter is knowne, although some cannot, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not, as yet see it. For seeing the hardest matter in this mystery is knowne, it is not to be thought that the easier is hid or vnknowne, especially seeing the knowledge of the one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the other euident. The chiefe thing here to be considered is, what this beast is. For if the beast be knowne, it will not be hard to tell what his name is, especially if the number of the name be 666. The beast, as appeareth by the whole context, is, as I haue shewed, the former beast, which without doubt figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Romane or Latine state. The name of this beast is Romane or Latine. If therefore this name in the learned tongues containe the number 666. and be such a name, as he to whom all other notes of Antichrist doe agree, shall enforce men to take vpon them; then without doubt this is the name
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:25487:126"/>
where of the holy Ghost speaketh: but these properties agree to the name Latine or Romane. For <gap reason="foreign">

But we build not vpon <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his authority, but vpon those reasons, whereon his conjecture is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, which are two: the one, because it is the name of that kingdome which is figured vnder the former beast <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 7. whose authority Antichrist was to vsurpe: the other, because it containeth 666: his words be these. <hi>But the name La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinos also comprehendeth the number</hi> 666. <hi>et valde verisimile est, and it is very likely.

Whereas therfore the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Latines was in those times most mighty, but now other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; there was some likelyhood then, that he might by subduing them be called Latinus, but now there is no such probability.</hi> I answere, the name whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh is not the name of Antichrist properly the second beast, but the name of the former beast;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:25487:127"/>
which name of the former beast, Antichrist the second beast causeth men to take vpon them. And so Latinus, is not the name of Antichrist properly, but of the beast, that is, the Latine or Romane state.

those is or can be.

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> to faine a priuatiue marke, as if the not vsing of some marke, were the marke whereof the Holy-ghost speaketh: yet he affirmeth, (such is his blind malice) that herein we are notable fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Antichrist. In the fourth place he addeth his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that Antichrist shall inuent a positiue or reall marke, which as yet is not knowne: whereby as he would ouerthrow all the former opinions, so especially he confuteth the last. From whence notwithstanding, as if it were true, he would faine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that we are the fore-runners of Antichrist. And this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he doth confute by two reasons. First, because the marke must be positiue; and secondly, because it is as yet vnknowne. And this is the summe and effect of his whole eleuenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But what of all this? or whereunto doth all this discourse tend? You will say, to prooue that the Pope is not Antichrist. He had indeed propounded that question to prooue, but in this Chapter he concludeth nothing for the Pope. Onely he telleth vs, that there be three opinions concerning the marke, and to them he addeth a fourth of his owne, and there an end. Other Papists when they handle this argument, reason thus: Antichrist shall compell men to take the marke of the beast; the Pope doth not compell men to take the marke of the beast. Therefore the Pope is not Antichrist. Which argument if he had vsed, and had also made good the assumption, he should haue said something to the purpose. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> concludeth no such matter, <hi>Nec enim a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>sus est, nec potuit.</hi> For well doth he know, that from this marke of the beast we conclude the affirmatiue, namely, that the Pope is Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How then doth he argue? surely it is not easie to tell. For after the sophisters guise, he hideth his conclusion, that he may the more easily deceiue. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Philosopher saith. But so far as I can gesle, either by resoluing the discourse it selfe, or by conferring the same with the former chapter, whereunto he seemeth to refer vs, he would seeme to reason thus: <hi>If Antichrists marke be not yet knowne, then is not Antichrist yet come: But Antichrists marke is not yet</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:25487:129"/>
                  <hi>knowne; therefore Antichrist is not yet come:</hi> and consequently the Pope is not Antichrist. The proposition he omitteth, and so taketh it for granted: although in truth there is no necessitie of the consequence. For as we said before of his name, so now we say of his marke: that after Antichrist is come, his marke might bee vnknowne, yea was for a time to bee vnknowne. Otherwise he should not be able to enforce his marke vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, few or none being so desperately wicked, as knowing his marke, to suffer themselues by the same to be branded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; as all they are, who doe receiue and retaine it. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 9, 10. And further I adde, that although this marke bee knowne to very many of those who haue the <hi>Marke of God:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 9. 4.</note> yet to them that are branded with this marke of the beast, and doe retaine the same, that is, who liue and die Papists, it neither is, or shall be knowne, or at least not acknowledged of them during this life.

Why, their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie glosse could tell them, that the marke is receiued in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head <hi>by confession,</hi> and in the right hand <hi>by operation,</hi> as we also hold. <hi>Antoninus</hi> also and <hi>Lyra</hi> teach that <hi>Character est deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatus modus viuendi secundum legem alicujus, quo à caeteris di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguuntur; A Character or marke is à certaine manner of siuing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawe of any, whereby men are distinguished from others:</hi> which also agreeth with our judgement.

                  <hi>humanae creaturae declaramus, dicimus, definimus, &amp; pronuntiamus omnino esse de necessitate salutis: For euery humane creature to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Pope of Rome, we declare, affirme, determine, and proneunce, that it is altogether of the necessitie of saluation.</hi> See more lib. 1. cap. 8. § 6. &amp; 7. Thirdly, saith he, <hi>The scripture sheweth this character to be such a one, as may indifferently be caryed either in the right hand or in the forehead. But none of these markes which the Protestants mention are such. The Chrisme is receiued in the forehead, and not in the hand, &amp;c.</hi> The scripture saith thus, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>And he causeth all, both small and great, &amp;c. That he may giue them a marke on their right hand, or else vpon their foreheads.</hi> That is, by his vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped dominion and tyranny, he shall make all sorts of men sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject vnto him: and in testimony of their subjection, to receiue his marke on the forehead by profession, or in the right hand by practise and operation. Of the carying of this marke, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of it indifferently either on the forehead, or in the hand, the scripture speaketh not. The marke is subjection vnto him, which (as hath beene said) is diuersly expressed and testified. <hi>Fourthly, the Scripture saith, that none in the kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, shall be suffered to buy or sell, vnlesse he haue this marke: but how many</hi> (saith he) <hi>are there within the dominion of the Pope, who hauing none of these markes, doe buy and sell, as namely the Iewes?</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:25487:130"/>
I answer, that Antichrist was to sit in the Church of God, and to tyrannize ouer Christians. Now of all those that professe the name of Christ, the Pope suffreth none where he hath to doe, either to buy or sell, except he haue his marke. See the Bull of <hi>Martin</hi> the fift, annexed to the councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> where expresse and straight charge is giuen, that whosoeuer doth not liue in subjection to the Pope, and communion with the Church of Rome (meaning such as <hi>Wicliffe</hi> and <hi>Husse)</hi> shall not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred <note place="margin">See lib. 1. cap. 8. §. 7.</note> to buy or sell, or to enjoy the comforts of humane societie. Whereas therfore the Pope permitteth that to the Iewes, which he will not permit to the professours of the Gospell of Christ: that, as it sheweth his greater opposition ot the seruants of Christ, then to the enemies of Christ the Iewes; so it bewrayeth him to be Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His second reason is thus concluded. <hi>If all these things, which the Protestants mention, were vsed in the Catholick Church before the comming of Antichrist, then none of them belong to the marke of Antichrist, (for otherwise Antichrist should haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them of the Church:) But all these things as namely Chrisme and the rest, which the Protestants mention, were vsed in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church before the yeere</hi> 607. <hi>that is, before the comming of Antichrist, according to the opinion of the Protestants: therefore none of these belong to the marke of the beast.</hi> First I answer to the proposition, that although these things had beene vsed in the Catholick Church before the reuelation of Antichrist, yet that hindereth not, but that now they may appertaine to the marke of the beast. For we doubt not to affirme that before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of Antichrist there were many corruptions crept into the Church, both in Doctrine and in the worship of God (the mysterie of iniquitie more and more working, euen from the Apostles times, vnto the reuelation of Antichrist) which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions Antichrist was to retaine with increase. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the seeds of Antichristianisme, which were sowne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichrists appearing, were signes of his approaching; the same being as it were growne vp, confirmed and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, may without absurditie bee sayd to belong to the marke
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:25487:131"/>
of Antichrist already come. Especially if we consider the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in vsing of them since the reuelation of Antichrist and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For there was not in the Catholicke church an vniuersall subjection to the Pope as the head, vntill he by much ambition and contention obtained the supremacie, and was called the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Bishop, and head of the vniuersall Church, which he could neuer obtaine vntill the yeare 607. Seeing then there was not an vniuersall subjection to the Pope before that time, these things if they had beene vsed at all, could not be vsed as signes thereof; as since they haue: Neither were they imposed before and enjoyned vpon all by the lawes of the Pope, as since they haue: so that the cause of vsing them now, is not the example of the ancient Church, but the authoritie of the Popes lawe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning and commaunding them. Therefore although these thinges had beene vsed in the Church before the yeere 607, yet now they may appertaine to the marke of the beast: And therefore the connexion of the proposition, is first to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. But now if these things were not vsed in the first 600. yeeres, will not he then in confuting those toyes, shew himselfe a meere trifler?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But let vs consider of the particulars. And first, that <hi>Chrisme was vsed before the yeere</hi> 606. he proueth by the <hi>testimonies of Tertullian, Cyprian and Augustine.</hi> I answer, that these Fathers speake of the annointing with Oyle vsed in the Sacrament of <note place="margin">1. Chrisme.</note> Baptisme, which also without warrant of the Scriptures is retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the Papists. But of the chrisme of saluation, which the Papists make the element of their counterfeit sacrament of confirmation, whereof there is no institution in the Scriptures, no worde, no element, these Fathers speake not. The ceremonie of imposition of hands, with prayer for the confirmation and strengthning of those, which before had beene baptized, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed vsed in the primitiue church: neither is it altogether misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of vs, although not much vsed among vs, because it was so much abused by them. But this ceremonie was done without vnction or chrisme: for further proofe whereof see D. <hi>Fulke</hi> his answer to the <hi>Rhemists, Acts.</hi> 8. 17. And therefore notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ancient practise of the Church, this Chrisme vsed in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:25487:131"/>
confirmation, may belong to the marke of the beast. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because the Papists make their confirmation with Chrisme, not onely a sacrament, but also a most necessary and Principall sacrament. So necessary as that they haue set it downe as a law, that no man is to be esteemed a Christian without it. <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. dist. 5. C. vt ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuni.</note> 
                  <hi>erit Christianus nisi confirmatione episcopals fuerit Chrisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. He shall neuer be a Christian, who is not confirmed with Chrisme by a Bishop.</hi> So principall, as that they preferre it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptisme, affirming that it is <hi>maiore veneratione veneran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, with greater veneration to be reuerenced.</hi> Now if it be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge <note place="margin">De conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. dist. 5. C. de. his vero.</note> peculiar vnto Christ the author and bestower of grace, to ordaine Sacraments of grace; then must it needes be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a practise Antichristian, if any man shall take vpon him to ordaine a Sacrament, and not onely to obtrude the same vpon all as necessary to saluation, but also to preferre it before that excellent Sacrament of Baptisme ordayned by Christ himselfe. Therefore as the ordayning and enforcing of this Sacrament vpon men is a note of Antichrist, so those which doe not onely receiue it when they are young, but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it when they are olde, remayning in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of Rome, may be said to haue the marke of the beast.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Secondly, <hi>that to adhere to the Romaine Church was a marke of a true Catholicke before the yeere</hi> 606. he prooueth by <note place="margin">2. Romanae ecclesie adhaercre.</note> 
                  <hi>the authority of</hi> Augustine, Ambrose <hi>and Victor Vticensis.</hi> But we speake of the Church of Rome that now is, that is, the aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Church of Rome: he argueth of the ancient Church which was apostolicall. Indeed whiles the Church of Rome did cleaue vnto Christ, so long might it be a note of a good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to cleaue vnto it, although these testimonies doe scarce proue it: but after that Church became apostaticall and adulterous, as appeareth by their fundamentall heresies, and horrible Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, and consequently of a faithful Church became an harlot, and of the Church of Christ the synagogue of Antichrist: it hath beene the marke of an Antichristian to liue in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that Church. Besides this great difference betwixt the present and the ancient state of the Church of Rome, there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:25487:132"/>
is also great oddes in the manner of adhering or cleauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Then, as other Churches did cleaue to the Church of Rome, so did the Church of Rome cleaue to them: now it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no Church besides it selfe. Then the Church of Rome was accounted but a part of the Catholicke Church, and so a man might be a good Christian although he were not of the Church of Rome: now the Church of Rome alone must be accounted the Catholicke Church; and consequently he that is not a member of that Church, must not be taken for a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke or true Christian. For when the Pope got the title of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Bishop, or head of the vniuersall Church, then the church whereof he was head, was accounted the onely Catholicke and vniuersall Church. Hereunto agreeth that Glosse, <hi>Constat ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ideo esse vnam, quia in vniuersali ecclesia est vnum caput suprem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>in the time of</hi> Gregory <hi>the great, and therefore before the yeere</hi> 606. <hi>as appeareth in the Epistles of</hi> Gregorie. I answere, that although <note place="margin">Lib. 10. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 31.</note> before the yeere 606. the Bishops of Rome tooke more vpon them, then became the ministers of Christ: yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is not able out of all antiquity to alleadge one example of such an oath of fealty and allegeance imposed by the Pope vpon forraine Bishops, and much lesse vpon Kings and Princes, as all Catholicke Bishops, as they call them, Priests, graduates, Princes and potentates are compelled to sweare vnto the Pope of Rome. That one example, which, as it seemeth, is all that he can alledge, of an oath taken not long before the yeere 606. is little to the purpose. For it is not an oath of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and allegeance to the Pope, but of faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards God, conformable to the faith and religion then professed by the Bishop, and Church of Rome. For it is the oath of a certaine Bishop who sweareth to renounce his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heresies, and to professe and maintaine that faith and religion, which then the Bishop and Church of Rome did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: which oath in effect is no otherwise to be vndestood, then if a minister among vs, being reclaimed from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or some other heresie, should take an oath before a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, that whiles he liueth, he will professe and maintaine that religion which is now professed and established in the Church of England, and other reformed Churches; which is not to sweare allegeance to them, but the like allegeance with them vnto Christ.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Fourthly, the annointing of Priests, we confesse to be as ancient as the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> from whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse <note place="margin">4.

And why then do they not as well retaine circumcision, the sacrifices of Buls and Goats, &amp; other ceremonies of the Leuiticall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that they might more plainely shew themselues, whiles they seeke to be the Apes of the Iewes, to be as indeede they are, according to the censure of <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epistle to the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:25487:133"/>
                  <hi>Galathians,</hi> Apostates from Christ. But as their priesthood it selfe is Antichristian, wherby the Leuitical priesthood and many Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish ceremonies are retained, as though Christ had not put an end to them: whereby Christ is denyed to be our onely Priest: whereby Christ himselfe (as they say) is daily offered, to the disgrace of his owne sacrifice, as though that once performed had not beene sufficient: to the ouerthrow of his humaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they hold to be in many places at once inuisible and incircumscriptible, without quantity and dimension, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no body; to the disparagement of his diuine excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, whiles euery shaueling Priest taketh vpon him by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out a few words after a magical maner to create his maker, and when he hath done to offer him as a sacrifice to the father, euery sacrifice being inferiour to the sacrificer: to the deifying of a piece of bread consecrated to most sacrilegious Idolatry: as I say, their priesthood it selfe is Antichristian, so their vnction, whetherof Bishops on the head, or of Priests on the hand, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly belongeth to the marke of Antichrist. And although they were able to shew some practise hereof in the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the yeere 606. yet this hindreth not, but that this Priestly Vnction may belong to the marke, because as I said, some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions were before the reuelation of Antichrist crept into the Church, which by him were to be retained with increase and maintained, as also because this ceremony is vsed not by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their example, but as receiued from <hi>Moses</hi> by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ceremoniall law, as though it were not abrogated by Christ, and as imposed vpon the Church by the law of the Pope: And lastly because it is a ceremony belonging to such a sacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priesthood, as was not known in the primitiue Church.

And as touching the worshipping of Images, it is most plainely forbidden and condemned in the Scriptures, and Councels, and writings of the fathers, who liued in the first 600. yeeres. The Wine of this fornication, wherewith all sortes haue beene made drunke, was first set abroach to the world in the second Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> about the yeere 789. For further proofe whereof read <hi>B. Iewell</hi> in his 14. article against <hi>M. Harding.</hi> And the like may be said of the adoration of the Eucharist, which is a consequent of the eleuation of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and transubstantiation, neither of which were vsed or heard of in the first 600. yeeres, as the same <hi>Iewell</hi> prooueth <hi>Artic.</hi> 75. 10. And <hi>Artic.</hi> 8. he sheweth that the adoration of the sacrament ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be warranted by any commandement of Christ, nor by any word or example of th'apostles or ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but that it is a thing lately deuised by Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> about the yeere 1226. But let vs weigh his proofes. That Images
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:25487:134"/>
were worshipped he prooueth by the testimony of <hi>Ierome,</hi> who in the life of <hi>Paula,</hi> speaking of her zeale and deuotion in visiting those places, where our Lord Iesus had beene conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant; he sheweth how at length she commeth to the sepulcher and kisseth the stone, which the Angell had rouled away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouth of the sepulcher, and licked the place where Christs body lay: and seeing that very Crosse (as was supposed) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ was crucified, <hi>Prostrata ante crucem quasi pendentem Dominum cerneret adorabat, Falling downe before the crosse she wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the Lord, as if she had now seene him hanging on the Crosse.</hi> I answere that this practise was not common, but peculiar to her; and to her not vsuall, but onely at that time, and in that place: neither did she worship the Crosse (as the Papists doe the images of that Crosse, <hi>cult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now that the adoration of the Eucharist was also in vse before the yeere 606. he prooueth by the testimonies of <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Augustine. Ambrose</hi> his words are these, <hi>Itaque per scabellam terra intelligatur, per terram caro</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de spiritu S. chap. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Christi, quam hodie quoque in mysterijs adoramus, et quam A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postoli in Domino Iesu, vt supra diximus, adorarunt. Therefore by the footestoole let vs vnderstand the earth, and by the earth the flesh of Christ, which at this day also we adore in the mysteries, and which the Apostles adored in the Lord Iesus, as we said before.</hi> But it is one thing to adore and honour Christ in his sacraments, as the ancient Christians and we doe: and another thing to adore the sacrament, as if it were Christ himselfe, as the Papists doe, deifiyng a piece of bread, and adoring it with such a worship as indeed belongeth not (I say not to the man Christ, but) to the humanity of Christ, whereof alone and not of the deity the bread is a sacrament: For the bread is a sacrament of the body of Christ crucified, and the wine of his blould-shed. But if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue read but fiue or sixe lines further, he should haue sound a better testimony against their adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints and images, then this was for the adoration of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:25487:134"/>
the sacrament. For <hi>Ambrose</hi> proouing that the holy Ghost was to be adored, because he is adored that according to the flesh was borne of the holy Ghost: <hi>Ac ne quis h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From whence as he vainely supposeth, is gathered a most euident demonstration, that the Pope is not Antichrist. <hi>For Antichrist shall be receiued of the Iewes for their Messias, and consequently</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:25487:135"/>
                  <hi>he is to be a Iew both by nation and religion: But none of the Popes since the yeere</hi> 607. <hi>hath boene receiued of the Iewes as their Messias; neither hath any one beene a Iew either in nation or religion: therefore the Pope is not Antichrist:</hi> or rather as hee ought to conclude from the premisses, <hi>therefore not any one of the Popes is Antichrist.</hi> For in all this disputation <hi>Bellarmine</hi> presupposeth that to be true, which we haue prooued to be most false, that Antichrist is but one singular person, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly reasoneth, as if we held that this or that Pope were the Antichrist. We holdeindeed that euery Pope for his time, as he is the head of the catholicke Apostasie, so is an Antichrist: but the Antichrist is the whole rowe and order of them from <hi>Boniface</hi> the third downeward. If therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon a false supposition, we are like to haue but a simple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of it. But let vs examine his disputation. Before he proposeth his proposition, as the basis or ground of his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, he dealeth with vs as cunning tradesmen, who being desirous to vtter their bad wares at a good price, first, shew those that are worse, that the naughtinesse of the worse may commend and set foorth those that be not so bad. So he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth diuers opinions concerning the generation of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and first those that are false and absuide, as namely, that <hi>Antichrist should be borne of a virgine by the operation of the diuell, as Christ was borne of a virgin, by the operation of the holy Ghost.</hi> Which opinion is propounded by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the treatise concerning Antichrist, falslie ascribed to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that the diuell himselfe is Antichrist, who shall fayne himsefe to haue taken flesh of a virgine, at Christ truely did; which is the conceit of</hi> Hippolytus: vpon whose counterfeit authority the Papists in other points concerning this controuersie, doe so much relie. Thirdlie, <hi>that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall bee a true man, but withall a Diuell, by the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Diuell; euen as Christ, who is God, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation became man: which opinion</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> Origen <hi>thought to bee possible.</hi> These opinions shew into what absurdities men doe fall, when as they will needes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:25487:135"/>
be comparing Christ with Antichrist, as the Papists in many things do. Fourthly, <hi>that</hi> Nero <hi>who died</hi> aboue 1500. yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe <hi>should come againe in his owne person to be Antichrist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 But these wares are all so corrupt, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not for his credit sake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend them vnto vs. And therefore he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a second shew of such opinions as are more probable, viz. <hi>That Antichrist shall be borne in fornication and not in marriage, which is the opinion of</hi> Damascen <hi>and some others.</hi> And secondly, <hi>That be shalbe borne of the Tribe of Dan,</hi> which is the iudgement of twelue of the Fathers, &amp; other approued Authors amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Papists; and generally of all Papists almost besides <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe. But although these opinions be, as he saith, very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, &amp; the latter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended by a whole Iury of auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet <hi>because they cannot be proued out of the scriptures,</hi> he will not put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into our hands, as though he meant to warrant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that now we must needes thinke that we shall be well dealt withall, and that no corrupt or counterfeit stusse shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs, but that which is currant and warrantable by the word of God. But what say you <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> cannot this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that Antichrist shall be of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> be proued out of the scripture? what say you then to those three places of scripture, which are to this purpose vsually alledged in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> the first <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 17. <hi>Dan shal be a serpent in the way, &amp;c.</hi> The second, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>The neying of his horses was heard fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dan.</hi> The third, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7. where 12000. of euery Tribe being sealed to saluation, the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> is leftout, because Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ was to come of that Tribe. To the first of these places <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth with vs, that the propheticall blessing of <hi>Iacob,</hi> was verisied in <hi>Sampson,</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> &amp; that <hi>Iacob</hi> meaning in these words to blesse <hi>Dan,</hi> his meaning cannot without absurditie be peruerted to the signification of a curse. And I adde, that they might with as good reason alledge that Antichrist shal be of the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>verse</hi> 27. that he shal rauin as a Wolfe. <hi>Ieremy</hi> vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaketh not of Antichrist, nor yet as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> but of <hi>Nabuchadonosor,</hi> who was to come by the coast or countrey called <hi>Dan,</hi> to destroy <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Ierome</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:25487:136"/>
rightly expoundeth. Why Dan <hi>is omitted in</hi> Apoc. 7. <hi>it is not wel knowne</hi> saith Bellarmine, <hi>especially seeing</hi> Ephraim <hi>also which was one of the greatest Tribes is left out.</hi> But here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaricari,</hi> and by trifling betray the truth. For it is not true that <hi>Ephraim</hi> is left out: for seeing <hi>Manasses</hi> is mentioned <hi>Verse</hi> 6. wee must needes by the Tribe of <hi>Ioseph</hi> mentioned <hi>Verse</hi> 8. vnderstand the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> Neuer thelesse, this may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said, that there are other causes of this omission, then that which is alledged concerning Antichrist. For else we may say as well, that Antichrist should come of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon,</hi> because he is not mentioned in the blessing of <hi>Moyses. Deut.</hi> 33. The truth is, that where the holy Ghost numbreth the 12. Tribes, and mentioneth <hi>Leui,</hi> which for the most part is not <note place="margin">As Apoc. 17.</note> reckned among the 12. Tribes, because it was scattered among them all; some one of the other Tribes is left out, otherwise, where 12. are named, 13. should be reckned. The mentioning therfore of <hi>Leui,</hi> is the cause why some one of the rest is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, but either comprehended vnder an other that is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as <hi>Simeon</hi> vnder <hi>Iuda Deut.</hi> 33. <hi>Ephraim</hi> &amp; <hi>Manasses</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two seuerall &amp; great Tribes, vnder <hi>Ioseph. Deut.</hi> 27. 12. <hi>Ezec:</hi> 48. 32. are altogether omitted, as <hi>Dan. Apo.</hi> 7. Now <hi>Dan</hi> seemeth to be omitted, rather then any other, because that was the first Tribe which fel from God vnto Idolatry: &amp; for the same cause (as some thinke) the genealogie of that Tribe is omitted in the first booke of the Chronicles.</p>
               <p n="3">3 These opinions therfore though countenanced with the authoritie of the Fathers, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dareth not deliuer as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of truth, because they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be proued out of the scriptures. The which in truth is the cause why we reiect all the fancies of the Papists concerning Antichrist, wherin they differ from vs, because that although many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were also the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the auncient writers (who could but ghesse at the meaning of prophecies not then fulfilled) yet they cannot be proued out of the word of God, wherein Antichrist is sufficiently described. This libertie therefore which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> lawfully taketh vnto himself in reiecting the testimonies of the Fathers in this point not warranted by the scriptures, must in equitie also be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:25487:136"/>
vnto vs. For vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same principle or ground which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> here setteth downe, we reason against the Popish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits after this maner: <hi>Those opinions concerning Antichrist which cannot be proued out of the scriptures, are not to be held as certaine truthes, or beleeued as matters of faith, although they haue the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Fathers: But all the Popish co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Antichrist, are such as cannot be proued out of the scriptures: therefore none of the Popish conceits concerning Antichrist, are to be receiued for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truthes, though diuers of them haue the testimony of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Now let vs heare in the third place what those things are which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue vs to take vpon his word for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and sound in this point. <hi>There be two things</hi> saith hee, <hi>most certaine: one that Antichrist shall come for the Iewes especially, and shalbe receiued of them for their Messias. The other, that he shall be borne of the Nation of the Iewes, and shall be circumcised, and shall at the least for a time obserue the Sabbath.</hi> On which two points the propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the syllogisme before rehearsed doth consist, the which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thought to set out as true, by setting by <note place="margin">§. 1</note> it other opinions more absurd then it is. But although there be degrees of falsehood in all these opinions, yet all of them are false, as being grounded vpon this false supposition, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ <note place="margin">1</note> is but one singular man. And secondly, by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that moued <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to reiect the former opinions, may <note place="margin">2</note> these also be reiected, namely, because they cannot be proued out of the scriptures; but contrariwise may be disproued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For Antichrist shall sit in the Temple of God, that is, shall raigne in the church of Christ, and shall be an Apostate, <note place="margin">3</note> and the head of the Apostasie, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth, and therfore not the head of the Iewes (who cannot be said to make an Apostasie before they be called) but of back-sliding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Againe, Antichrist is one of the seuen heads of the beast mentioned <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. that is, of the Romaine state, hauing his <note place="margin">4</note> seate in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the gouernment whereof hee succeedeth the Emperour: who, whiles hee ruled in <hi>Rome,</hi> hindered the reuelation of Antichrist, as it hath beene shewed heretofore out of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:25487:137"/>
All which do sufficiently proue, that Antichrist was not to be a Iew, either by nation or religion, but a Latine or Romaine, which name with the marke therof, he causeth all sorts of men to take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And lastly, for as much as the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues hold the calling of the Iewes: it would be knowne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they shall reuolt, after their calling from Christ to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, or whether they shall be called after the destruction of Antichrist, or during the time of Antichrists raigne, which shalbe as they say, the terme of three yeares &amp; a halfe precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or 1260. daies. But themselues denie that the Iewes shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt after their calling, or that they shalbe called in the time of Antichrists raigne: &amp; that they shalbe called after the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Antichrist, which shall not be before the ende of the world, it is absurd.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But let vs see how he proueth these things which he saith are most certaine &amp; sure, &amp; from whence he draweth his most <hi>euident demonstration.</hi> First that Antichrist shall be receiued of the Iewes for their Messias, he proueth by testimonies of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by authoritie of Fathers, and by reason. Out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he produceth two testimonies, the former <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 43. which place I haue heretofore freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the papists, shewing that our Sauiour Christ doth not speake absolutely, <hi>Another shal come,</hi> but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditionally, <hi>If an other shal com,</hi> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not foretel what they were afterwards to do, but tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them what in respect of their present dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were readie to do, if an other should come in his owne name vnto them, not sent of God. 2. Neither doth he speake definitely of Antichrist, but indefinitly of any false teacher. 3. he speaketh of those Iews, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he speaketh, who could not be the receiuers of Antichrist, vnlesse he were come aboue 1500. yeares agoe.</p>
               <p n="6">6 His second testimony is 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10 11. <hi>Because they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not the loue of the truth that they might be saued: therfore God shall send them the efficacie of errour that they may beleeue lyes, &amp;c.</hi> Which words he vnderstandeth <hi>of the Iewes, who because they receiued not Christ shal therefore be seduced by Antichrist.</hi> But the place is plaine inough to them that wil vnderstand. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle immediately before these words saith, that Antichrist shall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:25487:137"/>
preuaile with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>that perish, because they receiued not the loue of the truth that they might be saued:</hi> And immediately after these words, <hi>(Therfore God shall send them the efficacie of error, that they may beleeue lyes)</hi> he addeth, <hi>that all might be iudged or condemned that haue not beleeued the truth, but haue taken pleasure in vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi> In which words the Apostle doth not goe about to define of what Nation or people Antichrist shalbe receiued: but hauing described Antichrist as by other arguments, so in the last place by this effect of seducing, now he describeth the followers of Antichrist, who shall be seduced of him not by their nation, but by their condition before God. And withall cleareth the iustice of God in giuing them ouer to be seduced to their destruction. The followers of Antichrist are described by their conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before God, that they are reprobates, or such as perish, according to that, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 24. that it is impossible that the elect should finally be seduced by him: which is set downe, not so much to be a note wherby to discern Antichrist: as to signifie the estate of those that follow him, whom before hee had described, that they are <hi>such as perish, and that worthily.</hi> For as I said, in the next words he cleareth the iustice of God, after this manner: On such as haue not receiued the loue of the truth that they might be saued, nor beleeued the same, but haue delighted in vnrighteousnesse, the Lord sendeth iustly the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of errour, that they may beleeue lyes, that they may all bee condemned: But the followers of Antichrist are such as haue not receiued the loue of the truth, that they might be saued, nor beleeued the same, but haue delighted in vnrighteousnes: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord iustly sendeth vpon them strong illusions, that they may beleeue lyes, that all such as beleeue not the truth, but delight in vnrighteousnesse, may be condemned.</p>
               <p>This is the discourse of the Apostle, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the followers of Antichrist, which cannot with any shewe of reason be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to the Iewes, vnlesse it may be said that they alone are such as perish; that they alone haue not receiued the loue of the truth that they might be saued; that they alone haue not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the truth, &amp;c. for he saith, that <hi>all might be condemned, &amp;c.</hi> For it is certaine, that as Antichrist, which in this chapter is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,

is not the head of the Iewes, but of counterfeit Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: so the Iewes (as they are Iewes) are not the followers of Antichrist here described. Antichrist is the head of the aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie or reuolt from Christ, and consequently the head of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Christians. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. Antichrist shall sit in the Temple of God, that is, shall rule and raigne ouer the Church of Christ.

For seeing they are the Apostate Christians described, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 1. 3. certaine it is, that they haue not receiued the loue of the truth, that they may be saued.

                  <hi>but of the Iewes: for he saith, that Antichrist shalbe sent to them who would not receiue Christ, which is true of the Iewes, but vntrue of Christians.</hi> The Apostle speaketh of those that <hi>receiue not the loue of the truth that they might be saued,</hi> which may be verified of vnsound Christians (as the Rhemists themselues on this place do graunt) that is, of all those who content themselues with a bare profession of the faith, hauing neither a true faith, nor yet a sound loue of the truth. A sound Christian doth not only professe the name of Christ, but also hath some good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding &amp; knowledge of the truth, and withall an assent thereto, in which two, namely knowledge &amp; assent, consisteth the historicall, or dogmatical faith: &amp; not only a knowledge &amp; assent (for so much the diuels haue) but also a loue &amp; liking of the truth; &amp; not onely that (for euen hypocrites &amp; temporary beleeuers may attaine to a loue &amp; liking of the truth for some temporary respects) but also a speciall application of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospell vnto himselfe, &amp; particular apprehension of Christ his merits, whereby he is receiued of the beleeuer to iustification &amp; saluation. Now the Papists are such as professe Christ, but indeed receiue him not, nor yet the loue of his truth that they might be saued. And therfore this place is verified of them. For doth any man I beseech you, receiue Christ or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, who doth not beleeue that Christ is his Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer &amp; Sauiour? But if thou be a Papist, thou must not beleeue that Christ is thy Redeemer &amp; Sauiour; thou must sing <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat,</hi> but thou maist not say with <hi>Mary,</hi> that thy soule reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in God thy Sauiour: nor with <hi>Paul,</hi> that Christ hath loued thee, or giuen himselfe for thee. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. Must thou beleeue that Christ is thy Sauiour &amp; redeemer? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must thou beleeue that thou art redeemed by Christ, and shalt be saued by him. Must thou beleeue that thou hast redemption by Christ? then must thou also beleeue that by him thou hast remission of sinnes. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 14. But this to beleeue without speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and extraordinary reuelation, is damnable presumption saith the Papist. Therefore they professe Christ, but they receiue him not. Nay, they are so farre from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Christ by a lustifying faith, that they might be saued, that they haue not so much as the historicall faith, which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:25487:139"/>
consisteth in knowledge of the truth &amp; assent thereto. For the most of them haue no knowledge, pleasing themselues in their implicite faith: vnder which name grosse &amp; palpable ignorace is commended in the laitie of the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the rest assent not to the truth, but set themselues against it. So that whereas all the faith which they professe themselues to haue, is but that faith which is also in the diuels, yet they haue not euen that little which they do professe. <hi>But the Apostle</hi> (saith <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) speaketh in the pretertence, which haue not receiued the loue of the truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not in the future: therefore this speech cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of any other but those who before the Apostle wrote this, had refused to beleeue the preaching of Christ &amp; his Apostles, that is to say, the Iewes.

Therefore as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in that point answered a whole dozen of Fathers, so may I answere here with as good reason, that although this opinion might seeme probable to the Fathers in their time, liuing before the reuelation of Antichrist, yet now there is no probabilitie in it, seeing it cannot onely not be proued out of the scripture, but as you heard, is confuted both by the scripture and the euent.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Let vs therefore in the third place consider his reason: <hi>Antichrist shall without doubt ioyne himselfe first and chiefly to those who are readie to receiue him: But the Iewes are readie to receiue him, not the Christians nor the Gentiles, therefore Antichrist first and principally shall ioyne himselfe to the Iewes.</hi> First to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition I answere, that Antichrist shall ioyne himselfe not to any whatsoeuer, but to those in the Church that are readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him.

The assumption standeth on two parts. 1. affirmatiue, <hi>that the Iewes are readie to receiue Antichrist.</hi> 2. negatiue, <hi>that the Christians and Gentiles are not readie to receiue him.</hi> The former hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, <hi>because the Iewes do yet looke for their Messias, who shall be a</hi>

                  <hi>temporall King, such a one as Antichrist shall bee.</hi> But this reason is built on false suppositions. First, that Antichrist shall be one particular man, which we haue proued to be false. Secondly, that Antichrist shall professe himselfe to be the Messias of the Iewes, which as it hath bene disproued out of the scriptures, so can it not with any colour of reason be proued out of the same. For as hath bene shewed, Antichrist is the head of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Apostasie or Apostate Christians, sitting in <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is, <hi>Rome,</hi> professing her selfe the church of God, being one of the seuen heads of the Romane state, succeeding the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mperours in the gouernment of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, as Antichrist shall not be such a one as the expected Messias of the Iewes: so there is no necessitie that there should such a one come to the Iewes, as they expect. The second part also of his assumption is false. For although sound and constant Christians bee not readie to receiue Antichrist, but alwayes haue bene readie to resist him euen vnto the death: yet vnsound and back-sliding Christians, who embrace not the loue of the truth that they might be saued, either are as readie to receiue Antichrist, as they are apt and prone to decline from the truth (a searefull caueat to those which waxe wearie of the Gospell) or alreadie haue reuolted from Christ to Antichrist, &amp; haue receiued the marke of the beast. <hi>Yea, but Christians</hi> saith he, <hi>doo not expect Antichrist, as the Iewes doo. The Iewes looke for him with ioy, as for their Messias, but the Christians with feare.</hi> I answere, as true Christians looke not at all for the expected Messias of the Iewes to be Antichrist, but acknowledge him that is come: so Papists, but that they cannot see the wood for trees, might in stead of looking for Antichrist, looke vppon him.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The second thing which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deliuereth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Antichrist for a certaine truth, is, <hi>That Antichrist shall be a Iew both by Nation and Religion; that is, he shall be a Iew borne, hee shall be circumcised, hee shall be an obseruer of the Iewes Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and other Iewish ceremonies.</hi> But how is this certaine truth proued? forsooth <hi>from the premisses. For the Iewes will not receiue one for their Messias, that is not a Iew borne, nor circumcised.</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:25487:140"/>
                  <hi>Nay, it is not to bee doubted, but that as the Iewes looke for their Messias out of the family of</hi> Dauid; <hi>so hee will faigne himselfe to be of the Tribe of</hi> Dauid, <hi>although indeed he be of the Tribe of Dan.</hi> But this Popish conceit, built vpon their owne vaine imaginations, needeth no answere. For seeing I haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne their former assertion, wherevpon this is grounded; therefore this building of it selfe falleth to the ground, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer</hi> (saith hee) <hi>shall be receiued of the Iewes for their Messias, he shall be a Iew borne, and circumcised, but Antichrist shall be receiued of the Iewes for their Messias: as hath bene proued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichrist shall be a Iew borne, &amp;c.</hi> The proposition is not altogether true, for the Herodians receiued <hi>Herod</hi> for <note place="margin">Epiphan. lib. 1. de haeresi Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeor. 7.</note> their Messias, and thence had their name. But I will not stand vpon that.</p>
               <p>The assumption I haue alreadie disproued, shewing that Antichrist was not to be receiued of the Iewes for their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, and therefore there is no validitie in this argument. In the next place therefore for want either of reason, or authoritie of scripture, he vnderproppeth this tottering wall with testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Fathers; but such as either himselfe before hath reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or else in this question may by the same reason be little regarded. <hi>The twelue Fathers</hi> (saith hee) <hi>which affirmed that Antichrist shall be of the Tribe of</hi> Dan, <hi>doo therefore holde that hee should be a Iew borne.</hi> But himselfe hath tolde vs, that we are not to beleeue them, because their opinion cannot bee prooued out of the scriptures: and therefore by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, neither they, nor the rest are to be beleeued in this point, which hath no ground in the word of God.</p>
               <p>And thus his <hi>most euident demonstration</hi> is come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For although the Iewes receiue not the Pope for their Messias, but rather esteeme of him as of an other <hi>Pharao,</hi> and withall apply vnto him all that is spoken either of Antichrist, as the Papists say, or of the type of Antichrist <note place="margin">R.

               <p>But of these three things which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> avoucheth in commendation of this conceit, two are false, and the third is to no purpose. For neither is this exposition more common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the auncient Fathers, then that other, which by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnderstandeth the churches of the Christians: which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we haue shewed to haue beene the iudgement of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi>

Neither is it more probable: for if the temple shall neuer be reedified, as hath bene shewed, then is there no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie that Antichrist should sit in it. Neither were that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, though it were more literall, vnlesse the literall were vsuall. For in all the Epistles by the temple of God is meant the Church: and there is an vsuall metonymie betwixt the

The Apostle therfore by <hi>temple,</hi> meaneth not a materiall temple of wood and stone, but a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall temple compact of liuing stones: and by sitting in the temple, not a corporall gesture, for Antichrist is to sit there as God, that is, he is to rule and raigne in the church of God, as if he were a god vpon earth. But of this whole matter, see more in the first booke, chapt. 2. § 13. &amp; 14. &amp; 15.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Now let vs come to his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or disproofe of our asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who hold that Antichrist shall sit not at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> but at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> professing her selfe the church of God. First by a fond cauillation, wherein hee greatly pleaseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he seeketh to driue vs to an absurditie. <hi>For</hi> (saith hee) <hi>if Antichrist shall sit in the Church of God, and if the Pope be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, then the church wherein the Pope sitteth is the true church: and consequently the Protestants and all others that be not of that church, are out of the church, &amp;c.</hi> This cauill is to be resolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three syllogismes. 1. <hi>Antichrist sitteth in the Church of Christ, The Pope of Rome is Antichrist, therfore</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine, the Pope sitteth in the true church of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But hee might as well conclude thus: Hee that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the name of Christ is a Christian: the Papist, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist, the Familist, &amp;c. professeth the name of Christ, therefore the Papist, the Anabaptist, the Familist is a true Christian. But hath not <hi>Bellarmine</hi> learned so much Logicke as not to foist into the conclusion, that which is not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the premisses? the word <hi>true</hi> is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, and therefore sophistically thrust into the conclusion. For Antichrist may sit in the church, although not in the true
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:25487:143"/>
Church. Generally the Church of Christ signifieth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Christians, that is, of those that professe the name of Christ. But as of Christians, some are onely in title and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, some indeed &amp; in truth: so of Churches, some are onely in title and profession Churches of Christ, others are his true Churches. Now Antichrist he was to be an Apostata, and the head of the Catholike apostasie: therfore the church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Antichrist is the head, although it be in title and profession a church of Christ, as being a company of them that are chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened, and professe the name of Christ: yet it is but an aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall church; a church which of a faithfull Citie is become an harlot; and of the true Church of God, the whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi> But may not this absurditie rather be returned vpon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who by the templeof God 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 4. vnderstand that temple which Antichrist shall build at <hi>Ierusalem?</hi> Antichrist shall sit in the temple of God, saith the Apostle, Antichrist shal sit in that temple which himselfe shall build at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> saith the Papist, therefore that temple which he shall build at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> shall be indeed the temple of God. Whereas in truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their owne conceits, it were rather to be called the temple of the diuell. If any man obiect that it might after a sort be called the temple of God, because the temple of God did stand there, and because Antichrist will pretend to make it to the honor of God, wherevnto the former temple was erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: I answere by the like reason the church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be called the church of God, bicause once it was a true church, and stil is in title &amp; professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church ofChrist: although in truth it be but little more the church of Christ, then <hi>Antichrists</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary temple at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> would be the temple of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5 His second syllogisme which is inferred vpon the former is this. <hi>If the Pope sit in the true Church of God then the church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the onely true Church (for the Church of Christ is one as Christ is one): but the Pope sitteth in the true church of God,</hi> as was proued in the former syllogisme, <hi>therefore the church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the onely true church of Christ.</hi> First, I answere to the proofe of his proposition. The Catholike &amp; inuisible Church of Christ is one sheepfolde vnder one shepheard Christ: but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:25487:143"/>
particular &amp; visible churches are more then one, as the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the seuen churches in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps, and all the Churches of the Gentiles mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 4. and therefore the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> although it were a true visible church, yet were it but a particular church, and therefore not the onely true church. But now the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a true visible church of Christ, but the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> an adulterous, and Idolatrous, and Apostaticall church, which once was <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Petrarch</hi> saith, now <hi>Babylon;</hi> once <hi>Bethel,</hi> now <hi>Bethauen:</hi> once the Church of Christ, now the synagogue of Antichrist, as hath bene proued. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there being no truth either in the proposition, or the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, I answere the proposition by this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Pope did sit in the true church, yet it followeth not that therefore the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the onely true Church: and the assumption by this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but the Pope doth not sit in the true church, and therefore there is no shewe of reason in this cauill.</p>
               <p n="6">6 His third syllogisme is inferred vpon the second: <hi>If the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>be the onely true Church, then those which are not members of this Church, whereof the Pope is head, as namely the Protestants, are out of the Church.</hi> But now (say I) the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is so farre from being the onely true church, as that it is that <hi>Babylon, Apoc.</hi> 18. 4. from which we are commaunded to seperate, if wee will bee saued: there being no saluation in that Church for those that receiue and retaine the marke of the beast, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14. 9. therefore this also is a fond and sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall cauill. Notwithstanding, as the adulterous and aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall state of <hi>Israel</hi> vnder <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Achab,</hi> so the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the Pope, may be called the church of God: in respect both of some notes and signes of a visible Church, as the administration of some sacraments and profession of the name of the Lord, and also of some reliques and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as it were the gleanings of the inuisible Church. In <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi> although an Apostaticall and Idolatrous state, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of circumcision was retained: so in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the sacrament of baptisme. The church of <hi>Israel</hi> professed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:25487:144"/>
                  <hi>Iehouah</hi> to be their God, although they worshipped him Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrously: so the church of <hi>Rome</hi> professeth the name of Christ, but exceedeth <hi>Israel</hi> in Idolatry. In <hi>Israel</hi> euen vnder <hi>Achab</hi> the Lord had reserued 7000. who neuer bowed their knee to <hi>Baal:</hi> and so we doubt not, but that in the corruptest times of Popery, the Lord hath reserued some who haue not receiued the marke of the beast. And as the church of <hi>Sardis</hi> was still called the church of Christ, although greeuously fallen from Christ, because they still professed the name of Christ, and retained no doubt the Sacrament of Baptisme, and had among them some fewe names that had not defiled themselues: so I confesse with <hi>Caluin,</hi> that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be called a church of Christ, both in respect of some <hi>vestigia</hi> and outward notes of a visible church, as administration of Baptisme, and profession of the name of Christ, and some secret reliques of the inuisible church, which haue not bowed their knees to <note place="margin">Apo. 20. 4</note> 
                  <hi>Baal.</hi> But that which is saide to the church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> may most iustly be avowed to the church of <hi>Rome. Thou hast a name that thou liuest, but indeed art dead:</hi> thou professest <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 1.</note> thy selfe to be the church of Christ, but art the synagogue of Antichrist: thou art called the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which once was famous for her saith, but art the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <note place="margin">Apo. 3. 4.</note> mother of all the fornications, and abhominations in the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Heere <hi>Bellarmine</hi> obiecteth two things: <hi>If there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the church of</hi> Rome <hi>but ruines and reliques of a true church, then the church may be ruinated, and the truth hath lyed, who saith, that the gates of hell shall neuer preuaile against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Catholike and inuisible church of Christ, which is the whole company of the elect, can neuer faile: But visible and particular churches which consist of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites many times and vnsounde christians (which are in the visible church, but are not of the inuisible) as the greater part, may faile and fall away, although not one sound christian that <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 19.</note> is of the inuisible church doth fall away. As the lamentable experience of the church of <hi>Israel</hi> seuered from <hi>Iuda,</hi> the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25487:144"/>
examples of <hi>Corinth, Ephesus,</hi> and many other famous Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which were planted by the Apostles. Againe saith <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine: If the Church be ruinated, and the ruines remaine in Poperie, then the Papists haue the Church, although decayed and ruinated, but the Protestants haue no Church; not entyre, for the entyre Church is ruinated: not ruinated or decayed, for the ruines are among the Papists. What haue they then? a new building, which because it is new, is none of Christs, and therefore who seeth not, that it is safer to liue in the church decayed, then in no church at all?</hi> But in this cauill there is not so much as any shew of reason, vnlesse he take that for graunted, (which we do most confidently denie, and they are neuer able to proue) that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> not onely is the true church of Christ, but also the onely true church. For otherwise the church of <hi>Rome</hi> may fall, and yet the Catholike church of Christ may stand, yea, shall stand, maugre the force of Antichrist, and malice of Sathan himselfe. And as for the church of the Protestants, it is no new building, as Antichrist vaunteth, but is a part of the Catholike church of Christ, reformed and renewed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God, and the example of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue church: euen as the Church of <hi>Iuda</hi> vnder <hi>Iosias,</hi> was no new building, but the olde frame, as it was vnder <hi>Dauid,</hi> renewed and reformed according to the lawe of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The exceptions which he taketh against our arguments, concluding that <hi>Rome</hi> is the seate of Antichrist, I haue for the <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> most part taken away before. It shall suffice therefore now, to answer those which before were not touched. That <hi>Rome</hi> is the seat of Antichrist we proue, because it is mysticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on seuen hilles, &amp; hauing dominion ouer the Kings of the earth, &amp;c. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> among other answers before refuted, saith, that <hi>by mysticall</hi> Babylon <hi>we are to vnderstand</hi> Rome <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish, not</hi> Rome <hi>christned, because S.</hi> Iohn <hi>speaketh of that</hi> Rome <hi>which had dominion ouer the kings of the earth, and which is said to bee drunke with the bloud of the Saintes and Martyrs of Iesu.</hi> I aunswere, that although these notes agreed not to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:25487:145"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> yet we might vnderstand the Apostle thus, that that citie which then had dominion ouer the Kings of the earth, &amp; then persecuted the Saints, is called <hi>Babylon:</hi> because it was to be the seate or See of Antichrist. But now these notes agree also to Popish <hi>Rome,</hi> both in respect of dominion vsurped more insolently ouer the Kings of the earth by the Pope, then by any Emperour: and in regarde of most cruell persecution of the Saintes of Christ, as before hath beene shewed.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Againe, whereas we proue that Antichrist shall sit in the church of God because the Apostle saith, he shall sit in the Temple of God, and withall affirme that this cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which now is vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied, &amp; is no more to be reedified, as <hi>Daniel</hi> testifieth <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>verse</hi> 27. hee answereth that <hi>Daniel would say</hi> something that he doth not say: eyther <hi>that the Temple should not be reedified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a little before the ende of the world.</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a litle before the end: but as their owne translation readeth, <hi>Vs<expan>

Not that <hi>Michel</hi> at her death, or a little before had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: not that <hi>Ioseph</hi> euer knew <hi>Mary:</hi> nor that Christ will euer forsake the faithful: So that this word <hi>vntil</hi> in the scriptures sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth rather perpetuitie then cessation before the time, which seemeth therby to be limited. Whereas therfore <hi>Daniel</hi> saith that the temple should lie desolate vntil the end &amp; consummatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, it is as much as if he had said, that it should neuer be reedified. Or if that were not <hi>Daniels</hi> meaning, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he must say, <hi>that although the temple should be built againe, yet as it was desolate before it be built, so afterward the abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of desolation, that is, Antichrist or his Image, should remain in it to the end.</hi> Yea but the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:25487:145"/>
Primitiue Church beleeued that the temple should neuer be built againe, and held this assertion of the Papists as a Iewish fable. And as touching the abhomination of desolation, it hath bene shewed that our Sauiour Christ by a metonymie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 20. and Mat. 24. 15.</note> thereby the armies of the Romanes, who in respect of their paganisme were abhominable, and in regard of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect desolations, such as brought vpon <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and desolation. <hi>Daniel</hi> saith <hi>per alam detestationum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solantem</hi> by a <hi>synecdoche</hi> for <hi>per legiones &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Esay</hi> 8. 8. Or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this must be <hi>Daniels</hi> meaning, <hi>that the temple shall neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly be reedified, but that the reedifying is to be begunne, and that in the temple so begunne Antichrist shall sit.</hi> Thus shamefully the wilfull patrones of errour, sticke not to drawe the scripture to their fancies, not caring to conforme their iudgement to the scripture. <hi>Daniel</hi> in that place speaketh not a word of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, nor yet of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his type, but of the vtter desolation and finall destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the Romanes: and of this desolation, according to their owne translation, he saith, that it should continue to the ende and consummation: that is, (saith <hi>Bellarmine) the temple shall neuer perfectly be built againe, but yet it shall be built againe, and in it being so built, Antichrist shall sit.</hi> How built? is it like that Antichrist, who shall according to their conceit be the most mightie Prince and Monarch in the world, that he I say, will suffer that temple which he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for his chiefe seate, to be vnbuilt: or that so great and so proud a monarch will sit in a temple without a roose or vnsini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, professing the same also to be his principall seate? Why but Christ saith, the destruction of the temple should be such as that one stone should not be left vpon another; and <hi>Daniel</hi> saith according to their owne translation, that this desolation of the temple should continue to the ende. How then can his meaning be, that it should be reedisied either in whole or in part? The stories also of the church do testifie, that as <hi>Daniel</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Socrat. li. 3 c. 20.</note> and our Sauiour Christ had foretold the finall destruction and desolation of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> so when <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, desiring <note place="margin">Theodoret li. 3. ca. 20.

For the forerunner must not be equall to him, whose forerunner he is, but lesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour.

the Kings and Monarchies of the earth. Neither hath the Antichristian pride of the Pope rested heere, but as I haue shewed heretofore, in some thinges hee matcheth himselfe <note place="margin">Li. 1. cap. 5.</note> with Christ, in some things he aduanceth himselfe aboue him, and aboue all that is called God. To the second <hi>Bellarmine</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth, <hi>that it was not</hi> Gregories <hi>meaning, that Priestes as they are Priests, belong to the army of Antichrist, but as they are proud. But hence it followeth not</hi> saith hee, <hi>Antichristum fore principem sacerdotum, sed fore principem superborum, that Antichrist shall be the prince of Priests, but that he shall be the prince of proud men:</hi> shamelesse, and yet ridiculous. Doth it not follow, that if he be the prince of Priests as they are proude, that he is the prince of proude Priests, such as the whole hierarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> consisteth of? It followeth therefore vpon our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, notwithstanding all his cauils, that Antichrist was to haue his chiefe seate in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> professing her selfe the church of God, but being indeed the whore of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>

Yea, but this difference betwixt the smal Antichrists &amp; the great Antichrist is proued, <hi>because by the small Antichrists or heretikes, Sathan is said to worke the mystery of iniquitie, wheras the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Antichrist is called a reuelation.</hi> The mystery of iniquity 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 7. is Antichristianisme, or that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Apostasie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ mentioned <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. which is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called a mystery of iniquity, because it being a diuellish op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Christ, is cunningly cloaked vnder the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ. This mystery as it was a working in the Apostles time in the heretikes &amp; petite Antichrists by degrees: so was it more fully wrought &amp; accomplished in Antichrist himself, the head of the catholike Apostasie: vnder who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it deserueth so much the more to be called the mysterie of iniquitie, as it masketh vnder more glorious shewes and visards of outward profession, and shrowdeth it selfe vnder the name and title of the catholike and onely true visible church. The mysterie therefore of iniquitie, which in the former part of this Antithesis is appropriated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heretikes, doth indeed most truly belong to Antichrist him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and therefore if it be called a mystery because it is a couert and cunning deniall of Christ, then vnder the graund Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ Christ shall be most cunningly denied, when he is most gloriously professed. Now Antichrist is said to be reuealed, when the head of the Antichristian body is manifested, and of this reuelation there be degrees; the first his shewing of himself in his colours, by challenging &amp; vsurping an vniuersall supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie &amp; soueraigntie ouer all the world; and secondly his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after he was come to his full growth, of which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:25487:149"/>
we haue heretofore spoken. It appeareth therefore that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ was not to denie Christ plainly and openly; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the first part of his proposition (wherevpon the latter is inferred) is false.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The latter part of his proposition is, <hi>that Antichrist shal abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish all the ordinances of Christ, &amp; in stead of them, bring in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Iewes, as circumcision in stead of baptisme, &amp; the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Sabboth in stead of the Lords day.</hi> But how is this proued? <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he shall openly deny Christ, and shall in nation and religion be a Iew.</hi> But as both these assertions haue bene proued false: so are we to thinke of this which is inferred vpon them. For seeing he was to be a disguising hypocrite, and his religion a mysterie of iniquitie: it cannot be thought that he sitting in the Temple of God; and professing the name of Christ, should abolish all his ordinances; but rather that he would depriue &amp; corrupt them, and take away the right vse thereof, by diuellish doctrines, by superstitious Idolatries, by mixture of Iewish and Heathenish ceremonies. But both the parts of his proposition he seeketh further to proue by testimonies of Fathers, and by reason. The testimonies of the Fathers in this question deserue no further credit, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spire with the prophesies of scripture, and agree with the euent. But let vs examine them seuerally. First <hi>Hillary</hi> is alledged as though he testified, that wheras the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans affirmed that Christ is not the sonne of God by nature, but onely by adoption: the Antichrist shall teach that he is not so much as the adoptiue sonne of God. But if you read the place, <note place="margin">Lib. 6 de trinit. fol. 102.</note> you shal find that <hi>Hillary</hi> applieth the speech of <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1, <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. 22. to those heretikes who professing Christ to be their Sauiour, but denying him to be the natural son of God, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently denying him to be Christ, affirmed that he is the adoptiue son of God: &amp; therfore inferreth out of that place of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they cannot auoyd, but that they are Antichrist. Wherfore the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     </gap>.</note> neither doth he denie him openly &amp; directly, but indirectly &amp; by consequent. The next authority of <hi>Hippolytus</hi> is counterfeit, and the testimony here alledged as currant, (that the marke of Antichrist shall be <hi>nego baptismum, nego signum crucis, I deny bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, I deny the signe of the Crosse)</hi> heretofore hath bene reiected

Where he hath taught that there is but one marke of the beast, and that not a priuatiue (as this is) but a positiue marke, which is not yet knowne. Thirdly, he alledgeth <hi>Augustine,</hi> as though he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">De ciuit. Dei lib. 20 c. 8.</note> that Antichrist should suffer none to be baptised. Yet <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh not of Antichrist, but of the diuell, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that euen then when the diuell shall be loosed, many shall be added to the church: and that the diuell himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loosed, shall not be able to hinder Baptisme, <hi>but surely so valiant shall be both the parents for the baptising of their children, and also those which shall then first beleeue, that they shall ouer come that strong one being vnbound.</hi> The speech of <hi>Ierome</hi> on the 11. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> if it deserue credit, it must be taken either as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie it selfe, or else a true exposition of <hi>Daniels</hi> prophesie. <hi>Verse.</hi> 21. 22. But <hi>Ierome</hi> was no Prophet. And <hi>Daniels</hi> speech vndoubtedly is to bee vnderstood of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> to whom this exposition (if it were good) should literally agree. But <hi>Antiochus</hi> did not rise of the Iewes, neither did he faigne himselfe to be the Prince of the couenant. And for further answere, and better vnderstanding of the place, read <hi>Polan.</hi> on <note place="margin">Polan. in Daniel. cap. 11. ver. 21. 22. in 2. Thess. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> 11. If <hi>Sedulius</hi> affirme as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> citeth him, that Antichrist shall restore all the ceremonies of the Iewes, his speech is incredible, for many of them cannot be obserued but in the Temple, which shall neuer be reedified. If he speake of many, it may be verified of the Pope, and of some other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, who notwithstanding haue not openly denied Christ. <hi>Gregorie</hi> in the same place which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth, doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <note place="margin">Lib. 11. Epist. 3.</note> that Antichrist shall haue in reuerence not onely the Sabboth day, but also the Lords day; which cannot stand with such an open deniall of Christ as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> imagineth. His words be these. <hi>Qui veniens diem Sabbati atq dominicum ab omni faciet opere custoderi, Who when he commeth</hi> (speaking of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ) <hi>shall cause the Sabboth day, and the Lords day, to be kept from all worke.</hi> And of this there may better reason be giuen, then of the other, because (as hath bene proued) Antichrist was to be a pretended Christian.</p>
               <p n="5">5 These were his authorities: now let vs weigh his reason,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25487:150"/>
which is thus concluded. <hi>In whose time the publike seruice of God, and diuine sacrifices shal cease by reason of the vehement persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he shall openly deny Christ, and shall abolish all his ordinances, and in stead of them, bring in Iewish ceremonies: But in Antichrists time, by reason of the vehement persecution, the publike seruice of God, and diuine sacrifices shall cease;</hi> therefore, &amp;c. I answere by distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If by the seruice of God he meane the true worship of God, the proposition is vntrue. For in the Papacie the true publike worship of God, by reason of the vehemencie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution hath ceased, and yet the Pope doth not openly deny Christ and abolish his ordinances, although he do vilely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them, and mingle them not onely with Iewish, but also Heathenish ceremonies. If by the publike seruice, and diuine sacrifices he meaneth generally any seruice of God, although superstitious, any sacrifices although idolatrous (such as is the sacrifice, of the Masse) then the assumption is false: for such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions and will-worshippes do best beseeme Antichrist. But of this argument concerning the persecution of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, we haue spoken before, chap. 7.</p>
               <p n="6">6 This may suffice for answere to his proposition and the proofes thereof. Whereas therefore he assumeth, that the Pope doth not deny Christ, &amp;c. I answere: if he meaneth a direct deniall in open profession, that the Pope may be Antichrist, although he do not so denie Christ: If he meaneth a deniall of Christ in deed and in truth, although couertly, indirectly, and by consequent, I haue heretofore proued that he doth so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Christ, not onely in word and doctrine, as he is a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but also in deed and fact, as he is a man of sinne, denying him in his life, and as he is an aduersary, not onely denying, but also oppugning Christ and his truth. <hi>See the first Booke. chap.</hi> 4. §. 6. 7. 8.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>The second doctrine of Antichrist</hi> saith Bellarmine, <hi>is to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme himselfe to be the true Christ.</hi> From whence he gathereth his second argument. <hi>Antichrist shal affirme himselfe to be Christ. The Pope doth not affirme himselfe to be Christ, therfore the Pope i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> not Antichrist.</hi> That Antichrist being <hi>hostis &amp; amulus Christi, (that is, an enemy of Christ opposed vnto him, in emulation of</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:25487:151"/>
                  <hi>like honour)</hi> shall indeed challenge vnto himselfe those offices, prerogatiues and authoritie which properly belong to Christ (which in effect is as much as if he should say, <hi>I am Christ)</hi> we denie not: and withall auouch that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> doth so affirme himselfe to be Christ. But that Antichrist shall openly and in so many words expresly affirme that he is the Christ or Messias of the world, that we deny to be agreeable to that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, who is described in the word of God. For Antichrist was to be a dissembling hypocrite, as hath bene proued, and his religion is a mysterie of iniquitie cloaked vnder the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christianity. Neither could he seduce so many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, if hee should plainely and openly professe himselfe to be the true Christ. But let vs see how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proueth that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall openly and expresly name himselfe Christ. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth out of <hi>Ioh</hi> 5. 43. <hi>If an other come in his owne name, him will you receiue: Where</hi> saith he, <hi>our Lord seemeth of purpose to haue added these words</hi> (in his owne name) <hi>foreseeing that the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans and Caluinists would say, that Antichrist shall not come in his owne name, but in the name of Christ as being his Vicar.</hi> But I haue heretofore proued, that Christ in this place doth not speake absolutely <hi>an other shall come,</hi> but conditionally, <hi>if an other shall come,</hi> nor definitely of Antichrist, but indefinitely of any false Prophet that should come in his owne name, not sent of God. Neither doth it follow, that if Antichrist shal come in his owne name, that therefore he will professe himselfe to be Christ. For all false Prophets come in their owne name, because they are not sent of God, and yet the most of them haue not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed themselues to be Christ. And it is plaine that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ in this place maketh an opposition betwixt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and euery false Prophet in this respect, that he came vnto them in the name of his Father, that is, not taking vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe this honour to be our Prophet and Priest, without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and commission from God, but sent from the bosome of his Father, and yet was not receiued of the Iewes: but if an other, meaning any other false Prophet, should come vnto them not in the name of the Father, but in his owne name, that is, hauing no commission or authoritie from God, such a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:25487:151"/>
one should be embraced of them. And further we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that Christ professing himself to be the Messias, seemeth to deny that he came in his owne name, (for hee signifieth that false Prophets come in their owne name, but hee came in the name of the Father) therfore to come in his owne name, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to come of himselfe, without any calling or commission fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: And therfore our aduersaries cannot with any shewe of reason conclude out of this place, that Antichrist shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse himselfe to be Christ. And yet this is all the proofe which he can bring out of the scriptures. Yea, but though the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach no such matter, <hi>Yet some of the Fathers affirme, that Antichrist shall professe himselfe to be Christ:</hi> yea, but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath told vs, that we are not to giue credit to such coniectures of theirs as haue no ground in the word of God. For how could they, being no Prophets, certainly foretell such things of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist without booke, that is to say, without warrant of the scriptures. And whereas he addeth, that these Fathers affirme, that he shall be receiued of the Iewes for their Messias, and therfore shal professe himselfe to be the Messias, I answer, that in like sort a dozen of them affirmed that Antichrist should come of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> wherof notwithstanding there is no probabilitie.</p>
               <p n="8">8 To the proposition therfore I answer, that Antichrist was not plainely and openly to professe himselfe to be Christ, but to challenge the office and authoritie of Christ, which is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect although indirectly &amp; by consequent, as much as if he said <hi>I am Christ.</hi> To the assumption I answere, that although the Pope doth not plainly &amp; directly say, I am Christ, but forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the name of Christ, as <hi>Caesar</hi> did the name of a King: yet notwithstanding, in that he challengeth the office &amp; authoritie of Christ, it is as much in deed and in truth, although indirectly and by consequent, as if he made himself Christ, <hi>Christ</hi> being a name of office. For certainly whosoeuer professeth himselfe to be <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the head, the husband, &amp; Lord, &amp;c. of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal church, he maketh himself Christ, althogh he do abstain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name. For who is the head and Lord, &amp;c. of the vniuersall church, but Christ? who hath authoritie to ordain sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:25487:152"/>
prescribe lawes to the conscience, to deliuer doctrines and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of faith as necessary to saluation, to forgiue the sinnes of the quicke and the dead? who is the Prince of Priests, the great Priest after the order of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> the Pastor of Pastors, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, by whom Kings and Emperours do raigne, who hath authoritie to commaund the Angels, to bestow the kingdome of heauen on whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth. Finally, vnto whom is all power giuen in heauen and in earth, but onely to Christ? But the Pope doth challenge al this to himselfe, and much more, as hath bene shewed. He forsooth is the foundation, the head, husband and Lord of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 5.</note> Church, &amp;c. And to conclude, if you respect his nature, <hi>Atquè ac Christus Deus est ens secundae intentionis, compositum ex Deo &amp; homine, As well as Christ he is God, an essence of the second intention, compounded of God and man:</hi> if his office, <hi>vnctione Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus est, he is by annointment Christ,</hi> hauing the very same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which Christ had when he was vpon the earth. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Bellarm. de pontif. Rom. lib. 5. cap. 4.</note> if this be a propertie of Antichrist to leaue vnto our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the name and title of Christ, &amp; to take to himselfe the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, office, and authoritie of Christ: it cannot be auoyded but that the Pope is Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The third doctrine of Antichrist (saith <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> is this: <hi>He shall affirme himselfe to be God, and will require that hee may be worshipped as God.</hi> From whence he reasoneth thus: <hi>Antichrist will affirme that he is God, and will be worshipped for God: The Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>doth not affirme himselfe to be God, neither would be worshipped as God, therefore the Pope is not Antichrist.</hi> The proposition is proued out of 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>So that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as though he were God.</hi> Answ. The meaning of the Apostles words is thus much, that Antichrist shall sit in the Temple of God, as God, that is, he shall rule and raigne in the church of God, as if he were a God vpon earth, shewing himselfe not so much by words as by deedes, that hee is a God. Or as the vulgar Latine edition and English trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Rhemists doe reade, <hi>tanquam sit Deus; as though he were God.</hi> And thus <hi>Chrysostome, Theophylact,</hi> and <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> expounde this place, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>It is not therefore necessary that Antichrist should in worde plainly &amp; openly professe himselfe to be God: it is sufficient, if in deed and behauiour hee taketh vpon him as if hee were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If he shall cause, nay if he shal but willingly suffer himselfe to be worshipped as God, if he shall challenge vnto himselfe those titles, attributes, and workes which are proper &amp; peculiar to the Lord. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that this place in this sense may fitly be applied to the pope: therefore he contendeth that it is <hi>not sufficient that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ should indeed shew himselfe to be God</hi> (as the Pope doth) <hi>but that he shall openly name himselfe God: and that he shall vsurpe, not only some authoritie of God</hi> (as the Pope doth) <hi>but also the very name of God. And that he saith is prooued out of these words of the Apostle,</hi> 2. Thess. 2. <hi>in so much that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himselfe</hi> tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sit Deus, <hi>as though he were God.

<pb facs="tcp:25487:156"/>
vpon our aduersary after this manner: whosoeuer sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">Lib. 1. ca. 5 §. 6. 7.</note> in the temple of God as God, that is, ruleth and raigneth ouer the church as if he were a God vpon earth, and declareth himselfe either by word or deed that he is God: for example, if he shall challenge vnto himselfe those titles, attributes and workes which are proper vnto God, and shall be willing to be saluted, acknowledged and adored as God, he vndoubtedly is Antichrist. But the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ruleth ouer the church as if he were a God vpon earth, and declareth himselfe both by word and deed that he is God, challenging vnto himself those titles, attributes and workes which are peculiar vnto the Lord, &amp;c. as hath bene proued, therefore the Pope is Antichrist: <hi>yea but the Pope</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine, doth not declare himselfe to be God, for he acknowledgeth himselfe to be the seruant of the Lord.</hi> Hee might as well conclude that the Pope neuer calleth himselfe <hi>regem regu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terrae, ac Dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dominorum,</hi> the king of the kings of the earth, and Lord of Lordes, because he acknowledgeth himself <hi>seruu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seruoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dei,</hi> the seruant of gods seruants.

But he should haue remembred that the second beast which is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 11. as hee speaketh like the dragon belching out blasphemies against God: so hee hath two hornes like the lambe, &amp; as a dissembling hypocrite imitateth in some things the humilitie of Christ. And therefore that the Pope could not be such an Antichrist as is described in the scriptures, vnlesse he were an hypocrite, who doth by open profession pretend himselfe to be the seruant of God, when as in truth he aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himselfe against him. And yet this is all that our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alledgeth to proue his assumption, that the Pope doth not shewe himselfe to be God.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The fourth and last doctrine saith the Iesuite is this, <hi>he shall not onely affirme that he is God, but that he onely is God, and shall oppugne all other Gods both true and false, and shall suffer no Idols.</hi> But this absurd conceit of the papists, is not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto the truth, but also contradictory to their owne doctrines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Antichrist. For is it credible either that a mortall man shall affirme himselfe alone to be the true God,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:25487:157"/>
and none but he: or if he shall so affirme of himselfe that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Iewes and all the world almost will acknowledge and worship him as the onely true God? Againe, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian seate is figured by the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of her owne idolatrie is called a whore, and because she infecteth all nations that adhere vnto her with her idolatries <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. 2. 5.</note> and superstitions, she is said to make them drunke with the cup of her fornications, and also to be the mother of all the forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that is, idolatries of the earth. Yea, &amp; the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues expound <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 38. where <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed as an Idolater, as properly spoken of Antichrist. And do not themselues teach that Antichrist shall professe himselfe to be the Messias of the Iewes, and consequently that he is sent and annointed of God? Now if he shall professe himselfe sent from God, shall we thinke that he wil say there is no God besides himselfe? Or if hee being but a mortall man, shall say there is no God besides himselfe, may we not well thinke that either they will hisse at him as a foole, or stone him to death as a blasphemer? Nay, do not themselues teach that he shall be in religion a Iew, an obseruer of the Sabboth, and other Iewish ceremonies? And do they not alledge <hi>Ierome</hi> to proue, <hi>that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall faigne himselfe to be the chiefe of the couenant, and a</hi>

               <p n="12">12 But let vs see how this wise conceit is proued: Forsooth by testimonies of the scriptures and the Fathers. Out of the scripture hee alledgeth two places, the former 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Who is extolled aboue all that is called God, or worshipped.</hi> As if hee should say, <hi>Antichrist shall bee aduanced aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, therefore hee shall auouch that hee alone is God, and will suffer no other God either true or false to bee worshipped besides himselfe. I</hi> denie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. For first Antichrist may aduance himselfe aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, and yet suffer, yea require them to bee worshipped. <hi>Iupiter</hi> was supposed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:25487:157"/>
among the Heathen to aduance himself aboue all other Gods, and yet suffered them to be worshipped as Gods. Antichrist the second beast, aduanceth himselfe aboue the Image of the <note place="margin">Apoc. 13.</note> former beast, which is the Empire renewed, whereon he sitteth as the rider death vpon a beast, and yet requireth the same to be worshipped. The Pope aduanceth himselfe aboue Angels, <note place="margin">Apoc. 17.</note> Kings, and Princes, who are called Gods; aboue the Saints, the Host, the Crosse, and whatsoeuer <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet requireth them all to be worshipped. Secondly, Antichrist may aduance himself aboue or against al that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, or is worshipped, and yet not professe himselfe to be the only God. For so <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> aduanced himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst euery God, yea, against the God of Gods, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36. and yet he was neuer so mad as to professe himselfe the only God. Thirdly, seeing Antichristianisme is not open Atheisme, but a mystery of iniquity; &amp; Antichrist is described in the scriptures as an hypocrite &amp; pretended Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: we may be assured that although in deed &amp; in truth he shall aduance himselfe against God, &amp; against Christ our Sauiour, &amp; list vp himself aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped; yet he shall professe himselfe to be the seruant of Christ, and a worshipper of God. Fourthly, the words of the text do not ascribe to Antichrist so great an extolling of himselfe as the Iesuit imagineth. For first he is called a man of sinne, &amp; sonne of perdition, &amp; therfore we are to conceiue of such an aduancement of himselfe, as is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to a mortall &amp; wretched man. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, he is said to extoll himselfe aboue all that <hi>is called God,</hi> or <hi>that is worshipped.</hi> By all that is called God, we are to vnderstand all to whom the name of God is communicated, as to Angels in heauen, to kings and Princes on earth. And of this aduancing aboue Kings, we are the rather to vnderstand this place, because afterwards it is said, that the Romane Empire hindered Antichrists ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing or reuealing himselfe. And by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any thing which is worshipped as God, or wherein God is worshipped: Such in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are the Host, the Crosse, the Saints, &amp; their Images &amp; reliques. Aboue al which a man may aduance himselfe (as the Pope doth) and yet may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:25487:158"/>
acknowledge some other God besides himselfe. Thirdly, the greatest height of pride that is incident to any creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, is not to seeke to be aboue God, for that cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, but to be as God. And indeed the height of Antichrist his pride and aduancing of himselfe, is noted in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in so much that he shall sit in the temple of God as God.</hi> Whosoeuer therefore being but a mortall man, shall aduance himself aboue all that is called God &amp; worshipped, insomuch that he shall sit in the temple of God as God, that is, ruleth in the church of Christ as if he were a God vpon earth, he is to be deemed Antichrist (that is <hi>aemulus Christi, one that would faine be equall to Christ)</hi> although he neither professe himselfe to be the onely God, who onely is to be worshipped, neither yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish all other worship of God both true and false. And if in this sense this place do properly agree to the Pope, as indeed it doth, then can it not be auoided but that he is Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="13">13 The second testimony which he alledgeth to prooue this fond conceit is <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 37. <hi>neither shall he care for any of the Gods, but shall rise against all. I</hi> answere, <hi>Daniel</hi> in this place speaketh not of Antichrist, and he of whom he speaketh was an Idolater, and therefore this allegation is altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. As touching the first, it is euident that <hi>Daniel</hi> from the 21. verse of that chapter to the end, doth most plainly &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly describe <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> For howsoeuer in this place <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would proue by the authoritie of <hi>Ierome,</hi> that these words are to be vnderstood of Antichrist, &amp; not of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus:</hi> yet in another place when part of this verse is obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Li. 3. ca. 21</note> by some protestants as sitting the Pope, he telleth vs plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that Daniel speaketh</hi> ad literam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, <hi>literally of</hi> Antiochus, <hi>who was a figure of Antichrist.</hi> Secondly, hee of whom <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh was an <hi>Idolater,</hi> and establisher of Idolatry. So farre was hee from professing himselfe to be the onely true God, or suffering none to be worshipped besides himselfe. For if he speake of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> (as most certainly he doth) it may easily be proued both by Historie of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and by other stories, that he was both an Idolater himselfe, and an inforcer of Idolatry vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others. See I. <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1. 50. 2. <hi>Mac.</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:25487:158"/>
                  <hi>cab.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>&amp;c. Polybius</hi> also testifieth that <hi>in sacrifices &amp; honouring the Graecian Gods, he surpassed other Kings which went before him,</hi>

                  <hi>as might appeare by the Olympiaeum at</hi> Athens, <hi>and the Images a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the altar at Delos.</hi> This <hi>Ierome</hi> also auoucheth, and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> confesseth. But of whomsoeuer <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh, he doth plainly describe him in the next verse to be an Idolater. <note place="margin">Ver. 38.</note> And it is a world to see what silly shiftes the Iesuit maketh to auoyd this truth. For first he readeth the words thus: <hi>And he shall honor the God Maozim in his place:</hi> Secondly, he omitteth the words following (the God which his fathers knew not, he shall honour with golde, &amp;c. which most plainly specifie his Idolatry who is here described) and busieth himselfe wholy in giuing a false interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the god <hi>Maozim. The God Mao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim</hi> saith he, <hi>signifieth either Antichrist himself, and then the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is he shall honor himselfe, that is, cause himselfe to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: or else it signifieth the diuel whom Antichrist being a sorcerer shall worship in secret,</hi> which interpretation he preferreth before the other. <hi>And therefore this place doth not proue that he which is here described shalbe an Idolater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>I</hi> answere first, that although either of his interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the God <hi>Maozim</hi> were true (as neither is) yet the one hindreth not, and the other proueth that he which is heere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed is an Idolater. For let the word <hi>Maozim</hi> signifie what it may, yet the words following plainly conuince the partie here described of Idolatry, <hi>the God which his fathers knew not he shall worship with gold.</hi> And if the God <hi>Maozim</hi> signifie any but the true God, and if also the words are so to be read as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> readeth them: And he shall honor the God <hi>Maozim,</hi> and the God who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fathers knew not, he shall worship with gold and siluer, &amp;c. then by these words the Idolatry is encreased. For first it is said, that he shall worship the God <hi>Maozim</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reading, whereby is not meant as he saith the true God, nay he saith to make Christ the God <hi>Maozim,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Li. 3. ca. 21</note> it is intollerable blasphemy, O therefore first in these words is signified an Idolater: and secondly it is added, that the God also which his fathers knew not hee shall worship, where againe his Idolatry is most plainely noted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But indeede <hi>Bellarmines</hi> interpretation is meerely
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:25487:159"/>
false, and that which he inferreth therevpon, altogether absurd. The God <hi>Mahuzzim</hi> signifieth the God of fortitudes, that is, the most mightie or almightie God, which title as it is proper to the Lorde, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> calleth him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Iehouah, my</hi>

                  <hi>strength and fortitude:</hi> And likewise <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 31. 5. so may it not be ascribed to any other. And therefore it is a sencelesse imagination, that <hi>Daniel</hi> by the God of fortitudes would signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie either Antichrist himselfe, a wicked and wretched man, or the father of Antichrist the Diuell. And further, as touching the former interpretation, it seemeth to be absurd, that when <hi>Daniel</hi> according to his reading saith, he shal worship the God <hi>Maozim,</hi> his meaning should be, that Antichrist should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship himselfe, as though he that worshippeth, and hee that is worshipped were one and the same. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in like sort in the latter clause, by <hi>the God which he shall worship, which his fathers knew not,</hi> we must absurdly vnderstand himselfe. For whereas he cauilleth at the word <hi>worship,</hi> and saith, wee must reade glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, as though <hi>Daniels</hi> meaning were, that Antichrist should glorifie himselfe, and cause himselfe to be worshipped: it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the vulgar Latine (which hee preferreth before the Hebrew, and which by the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> hee is bound to stand to) hath <hi>venerabitur, shall worship.</hi> &amp; himselfe both in the second clause of the verse, hee readeth according to the vulgar <hi>colet, shall worship:</hi> and in his second interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he saith is the better, he doth so reade and vnderstand the word. His first interpretation therfore, that the God <hi>Maozim</hi> should sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Antichrist himselfe, is sottish and absurd.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Let vs therefore consider whether the second which he preferreth before the other, be any better. <hi>In the second place</hi> saith he, <hi>it may be said, which pleaseth me better, that Antichrist shall be a Magician or sorcerer,</hi> (such as very many Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue bene) <hi>and that according to the manner of other Magicians, he shall in secret worship the Diuell,</hi> (as diuers of the Popes haue done homage vnto him) <hi>by whose helpe he shall worke wonders, and that he is called the God</hi> Maozim. <hi>Answ.</hi> Whereas <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> preferreth this exposition before others, it seemeth hee hath forgotten the question which hee tooke vpon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:25487:159"/>
namely, that Antichrist shall not be an Idolater. For if he shall be a worshipper of the diuell, and also of a God whom his fathers knew not, I hope by this exposition he shall bee proued an Idolater. But let vs see what hee further alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to proue this exposition, which although it be false (for <hi>Daniel</hi> here neither speaketh of Antichrist, nor yet of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell) yet it maketh against himselfe. Forsooth <hi>Maozim</hi> as hee supposeth <hi>is not the name of God, but of a certaine strong and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place, in which shall be the chiefe treasures of Antichrist, and wherein he shall worship the diuell. For it followeth in</hi> Daniel, <hi>that he shall fortifie</hi> Maozim <hi>with a strange God whom hee knew, and surely</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Mahoz signifieth as well fortitude as a tower or place of munition.</hi> His meaning then is, that the diuell is here called the God <hi>Maozim,</hi> because Antichrist shall worship him in a certaine tower, which if it were true, hee should rather bee called the God <hi>Maoz,</hi> but <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh in the plurall number, the God of fortitudes or munitions, signifying accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Hebrew phrase, the most mightie and strong God, <hi>Deum summiroboris,</hi> as <hi>Tremellius</hi> readeth.</p>
               <p>And whereas hee saith it followeth, that <hi>hee shall fortifie</hi> Maozim <hi>with a straunge God, whom he hath knowne,</hi> I answere, that there is no such matter in the originall text, which word for word is thus: And he shall doo to the munitions of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huzzim</hi> with a straunge God, that is, hee shall commit the munitions of <hi>Mahuzzim,</hi> that is, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the citties of <hi>Iewry</hi> to a straunge God. Yea, but faith <hi>Bellarmine, one of these interpretations (either that Antichrist is the God</hi> Maozim, <hi>or if he be any other</hi> (for he dare not now say it is the diuell) <hi>hee shall not be worshipped of Antichrist, but secretly and in a most hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den place) one</hi> saith hee, <hi>of these interpretations must be good, or else there will bee a repugnancie in</hi> Daniels <hi>words. For if he care for no God, how shall he publikely worship Idols?</hi> yea, rather if he care for no God, how shall he worship any priuately? For it is more like that he which is an Atheist, and careth for no God indeed, will in Machiuilian policie worship some God publikely, although priuately he careth for none. And it more fitteth the disposition of Antichrist to be secretly an Atheist,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:25487:160"/>
and openly an Idolater, then contrariwise although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> here doth hold the contrary.</p>

of him, that both hee setteth himselfe against the Idols of the Gentiles, and also hath abrogated the true worship of God. And that in stead of Christ the Almightie God, he hath set vp in his churches, besides many other Idols, the abhominable I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll of the Masse, a God which his fathers the first Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> knew not, which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he honoreth with gold and siluer, and precious stones, and hath committed the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, cities, and countries of Christendome, to the tuition and patronage of diuers Saints, who as they are indeed, so are they called by <hi>Paulus Ionius</hi> a Popish Bishop, the <hi>tutelar Gods</hi> of the Papists. <note place="margin">Hist. lib. 24. in fine.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 And these were his testimonies of scripture. In the next place, for want of better proofes, he slyeth to the authoritie of the Fathers as his last refuge, as though they testified that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall not be an Idolater, nor one that will suffer Idols. But I answer, that the Fathers do either speake of the Idols and Idolatry of the Gentiles onely, and in that sence their speeches are verified in this behalfe of the Pope, who neither honoreth nor suffereth the Idols of the Gentiles: or else if they speake of all Idols and Idolatry in generall, when they say <hi>Idola seponet</hi> as <hi>Ireneus,</hi> or <hi>adidololatriam non admittet</hi> as <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> or <hi>idola odio habebit,</hi> as <hi>Cyrill,</hi> or <hi>adidololatria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non adducet ille,</hi> as <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> they deserue such an Antichrist as in this behalfe is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Pope. But indeed as the Pope is, so Antichrist in the scriptures is described to bee an Idolater, as hath bene shewed.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Hauing thus doughtily proued this Popish conceit, the Iesuit proceedeth to the disproofe of our assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some places of scripture, and especially that of 2. <hi>Thess,</hi> 2. Our assertion concerning the doctrine of Antichrist, hee saith <hi>is onely built vpon the scriptures falsely expounded by new glosses. In token whereof</hi> saith hee, <hi>they alledge not one Interpreter or Doctor for them.</hi> But this is a malicious slaunder, witnesse this place which he mentioneth 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. where we proue by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of many of the Fathers, that by the Temple is meant the church of God; and that in the church of God Antichrist was to be reuealed, after the Romane Empire, which hindered, was
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:25487:161"/>
taken out of the way, &amp;c. Our assertions concerning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, are grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on the prophesies of scriptures expounded by the euent, which is the best expóunder of prophesies. And with our assertions the opinions of the Fathers agree, where they are consonant to the scripture and the euent. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the assertions of the Papists concerning Antichrist, as they are repugnant to the scriptures and the truth of the euent: so are they wholy grounded either vpon the vncertaine (and many times misalledged) coniectures of the Fathers, who were no Prophets, and therefore being not able to foresee the euent, did not many times vnderstand the Prophesies: or else on the blinde conceits of Popish writers, who being deceiued with the efficacie of illusion, and made drunke with the whore <hi>Babylons</hi> cuppe of fornications, were giuen ouer to beleeue lyes. And whereas our writers expounding those wordes of the Apostle, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>(who is lifted vp aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped)</hi> doo apply the same vnto the Pope vpon very good and sufficient proofes, and from thence do plainely conclude the Pope to be Antichrist, (for euidence whereof, I referre the Reader to the 5. chapter of my former booke.) He culleth out some stragling sentences out of some one of the vnsoundest writers of our side, (as their maner is) which he may best hope to answere. As though we had no more, nor no better arguments to proue, that the Pope aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himselfe aboue all that is called God, or that is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, then these two: First, because he professeth himselfe to bee the Vicar of Christ: And secondly, whereas Christ subiected himselfe willingly vnto the scriptures, the Pope challengeth authoritie to dispense with the scripture. Howbeit the former of these two reasons hee depraueth, and the latter he is not able to satisfie. For <hi>Illyricus</hi> his reason to proue that the Pope ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanceth himselfe aboue all that is called God, is not because he maketh himselfe the Vicar of Christ, but this, because hee vaunting himselfe to be the Vicar of Christ, doth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing vsurpe greater authoritie, then the sonne of God claimed vnto himselfe, of which, that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Catalog. test. pag. 3.</note> alledgeth as a second reason, is by <hi>Illyricus</hi> added as a proofe:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:25487:162"/>
Wherevnto <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is no otherwise able to answer, then by impudent and shamelesse deniall, either that <hi>Christ subiected</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Contrary to Galat. 4. 4. Luke. 2. 51</note> 
                  <hi>himselfe to the lawe and word of God, or that the Pope taketh vpon him to dispense with the scriptures,</hi> or <hi>that any Catholike</hi> (meaning Popish) <hi>writer hath said, that he may dispense with diuine precepts;</hi> both which notwithstanding I haue heretofore proued by many instances and most euident allegations. <hi>See the first booke. chap.</hi> 5. §. 10. 11. 12. For that which hee addeth of Christs subiecting himselfe to the prophesies, and not to the precepts, as though <hi>Illyricus</hi> had spoken of the one in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and of the other in the assumption, it is partly false and partly ridiculous, and indeede not worth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee are now come to the eight maine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vseth to proue that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is not Antichrist; because forsooth those things which the holy Ghost in the scriptures hath foretold concerning the miracles of Antichrist, do not agree to the Pope &amp; church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>concerning the miracles of Antichrist, the scriptures</hi> (saith he) <hi>mention three things.</hi> 1. <hi>that Antichrist shall worke many miracles.</hi> 2. <hi>what maner of miracles they shall be.</hi> 3. <hi>there are recorded examples.</hi> Of al which points I haue intreated heretofore, prouing from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his owne grounds, that the Pope is Antichrist. And first that many signes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders should be wrought by Antichrist &amp; his adherents, which <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> they call miracles, the scriptures testifie, the euent hath proued, and we do confesse. And secondly, that all these signes &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, howsoeuer he and his followers do boast of them, and in respect thereof contemne the true professors: yet are as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>lying signes and wonders,</hi> both in respect of the ende, which is to seduce and to confirme lies, &amp; in respect of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which is counterfeit. For wheras <hi>Bellarmine</hi> addeth that they are also called lying signes in respect of <hi>the efficient and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:25487:162"/>
                  <hi>of them, which is the father of lyes, according to whose power Antichrist was to come, who as some of the Fathers affirme, was to be a notable Magician or sorcerer.</hi> This seemeth to be somewhat far fetched, vnlesse we will take the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be masculine (as none doth). Notwithstanding, because the Apostle ascribeth the working of these miracles to the power of Sathan, we will trace him in his owne steppes, not doubting to apply this note also to the Pope and church of <hi>Rome:</hi> seeing it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that as very many not onely of their Cleargy, but euen of their Popes, haue bene notable Magicians and sorcerers: so also very many of the miracles in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> haue bin the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or illusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the diuell. As for their Cleargy, who knoweth not, but that there haue bin fewe learned men among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who haue not bene knowne, or at the least suspected, to be coniurers, and skilfull (as some call it) of the blacke Art. But as touching the Popes, because it may seeme incredible, that any known Magician or sorcerer should be aduanced to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike See, as they call it: therefore it may be thought, that the sorcery &amp; witchcraft of the most of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who indeed were sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, was hidden &amp; vnknown. Notwithstanding eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their owne writers there are recorded as knowne Magicians &amp; sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers aboue 20. Popes, diuers wherofgaue themselues wholy to the diuell, that in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prophesie of the Apostle might be fulfilled, viz. that they might come to the Papacie by the helpe of the diuell, or as the Apostle speaketh, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 9. that their comming might be according to the efficacie of Satan: And as this hapned often, so especially about those times wherein An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist in the Papacie was in a maner come to his full growth, that is to say, in <hi>Syluestex</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. and all the Popes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, who were a sort of infamous sorcerers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any miracles haue bin wrought by such Popes, (as <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> braggeth of many signes &amp; wonders wrought by <hi>Gregory</hi> 7.) we need not doubt, but that as themselues were Magicians <note place="margin">Demonsir. 20.</note> and sorcerers, so their signes and wonders were wrought by the power of the diuell.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> through all the causes sheweth the miracles of Antichrist, to be lying signes and wonders.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:25487:163"/>
But to what ende I beseech you serueth all this discourse? Will <hi>Bellarmine</hi> conclude from hence that the Pope is not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, either because there are no miracles in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the first point, or because those miracles which they haue, be not lying signes and wonders, which was the second? If this were his ende, why then doth hee not from this proposition as it were his groundworke, assume and conclude after this manner. <hi>By Antichrist and his adherents many signes and wonders shall be wrought (which they call miracles) as the scripture testifieth: By the Pope and his adherents many signes and wonders haue not bin wrought which they call miracles, therfore the Pope is not Antichrist.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> durst not reason thus, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Papists bragge of nothing more then of their signes and wonders, which they call miracles. And therefore from this ground I haue heretofore inferred the contrary. For if it be a peculiar note of Antichrist and his adherents in these latter times to worke many signes and wonders, which they call miracles: then can it not be auoyded, but that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichrist, and the church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Synagogue of Antichrist, seeing they alone do bragge of miracles. <hi>See the first booke. chap.</hi> 7. §. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. Secondly, why doth hee not reason thus? <hi>By Antichrist and his followers, lying signes and wonders shalbe wrought: But by the Pope and church of</hi> Rome, <hi>there haue bene no lying signes and wonders wrought, therefore the Pope is not Antichrist.</hi> Indeed this would <hi>Bellarmine</hi> haue the simple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der gather from his words, and that is the drift of all that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. But this he could not assume and conclude, because his owne conscience doth tell him that, which all the worlde knowes, that their church is full of lying signes and wonders, which they call miracles. Therefore from <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne ground I reason thus: If it be a peculiar note of Antichrist and his Synagogue in these latter times to work many lying signes and wonders, then it must be confessed, that the Pope is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and the church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Synagogue of Antichrist, because among them are many lying signes and wonders: but the first is testified in the scriptures, and therfore the latter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, seeing I haue proued that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:25487:163"/>
full of lying signes and wonders, which notwithstanding they call miracles. <hi>See the first Booke. Chap.</hi> 7. §. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is plaine therefore, that of those three things which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> obserueth out of the scriptures concerning the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Antichrist, the two first doo fitly serue to proue the Pope Antichrist. Neither will the three examples of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ his miracles which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> setteth downe in the third place, disproue the same. For of these three examples, to wit, <hi>First that Antichrist, or at least his Ministers, shall make fire to come downe from heauen in the sight of men.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that he shall put life into the Image of the beast, and cause it to speake.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that he shall faigne himselfe to die, and to rise againe.</hi> The two first (which indeed belong to Antichrist) doe fitly agree to the Pope (as hath bene shewed in the first booke, chap. 7. from the 8. §. to the ende of the chapter.) The third belongeth not to Antichrist. From whence notwithstanding, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus. The <hi>third miracle of Antichrist</hi> (saith he) <hi>is, that he shall faigne himself to die &amp; to rise againe, for which miracle especially the whole world almost shall admire him. But neuer did any Pope faigne himselfe to die and rise againe, therefore the Pope is not Antichrist.</hi> I answere to the proposition, that no such miracle in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is assigned vnto Antichrist, but that it is a sond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Papists, which by some of them, and namely by <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de pontif. Rom. cap. 5</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe is propounded more fondly, to wit, <hi>that Antichrist shall faigne himselfe to die, and by the helpe of the diuell shall rise againe.</hi> For if his death be but counterfeit, he shall not neede the diuels helpe to raise him. Notwithstanding, they would grounde this miracle vpon those words, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>And I sawe one of his heads as it were wounded to death, but his deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondred after the beast.</hi> I answere, that in these words the holy Ghost speaketh not of Antichrist, &amp; that he of whom he speaketh, doth not saigne himselfe to die, and rise againe. As touching the first of those two beasts described in this chapter, the former is not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, but the latter. The former which is described vnto the 11. Verse, is the Romane Empire, especially vnder the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25487:164"/>
Emperours, as hath bene shewed, euery part of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription fitting the same. And that the latter beast signifieth Antichrist, it is in a maner confessed of all. Heare what <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> saith in the beginning of his tenth chapter, speaking of the <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Pontif. Ro. ca. 10.</note> 16. 17. and 18. Verses of this 13. chapter of the Apocalyps, which are spoken concerning the second beast, <hi>Fatentur om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> (saith hee) <hi>pertinere omnino ad Antichristum verba illa Ioannis</hi> Apoc. 13. <hi>&amp; fuciet omnes pusillos cum magnis, &amp;c. All men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that those words of</hi> Iohn, Apoc. 13. <hi>And he shall make all both small and great, &amp;c. do wholy appertaine to Antichrist.</hi> And in this very chapter how doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proue, 1. that Antichrist shall worke great signes, because it is said, <hi>verse</hi> 13. <hi>&amp; fecit sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na magna, and he wrought great signes.</hi> 2. that many of the signes of Antichrist shall be phantasticall, and onely in appearance, because it is said in the same verse, that he doth cause fire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend <hi>in the sight of men.</hi> 3. that Antichrist shall cause fire to come downe from heauen, and make the Image of the beast to speake, because it is so prophesied of Antichrist, <hi>verse</hi> 13. and 15. Now if this be confessed, that the latter beast is Antichrist, then can it not be truly affirmed, that the former beast is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, vnlesse we may say, that the former and the latter are one and the same. But that cannot be truly saide. For of the latter <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>And I sawe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>an other beast. verse.</hi> 11. If it be an other, then is it not the same, and the great difference in the descriptions of both, doth shewe that they are diuerse beasts, The one arising out of the Sea, hath tenne hornes, the other arising out of the earth, hath two hornes like the Lambe. The latter exerciseth the power of the former, and that in his sight, causeth men to worship the former beast, whose deadly wound was healed, maketh an Image to the former beast which had a deadly wound, &amp; liued. <hi>verse</hi> 14. Therfore the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> beast which signifieth Antichrist, is not that beast which had the deadly wound and was cured thereof, nor yet the head which was so wounded.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Againe (to come to that obiection which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto himselfe, and doth not satisfie) this miracle and the two first doo not belong to one and the same subiect: if

therefore the two first concerning fire and the Image, belong to Antichrist, then this doth not; or if this do, then the other two do not: but all confesse, that those two do belong to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, therefore this doth not.</p>
               <p>Herevnto <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would seeme to answere, that <hi>the former beast signifieth either the Romane Empire, or the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the wicked, and that one (that is to say the chiefe head thereof) which seemed to dye and rise againe, is Antichrist. For</hi> saith hee, <hi>Antichrist shall be the chiefe and the last head of the wicked, as also of the Romanes. The second beast signifieth either Antichrist himselfe, according to</hi> Rupertus, <hi>or the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Preachers of Antichrist, according to</hi> Richardus <hi>and</hi> Anselmus. <hi>And therefore these three miracles belong either to Antichrist alone, or to him and his Ministers.</hi> In which answere of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> we see that prouerbiall speech verified, that <hi>Great it the truth, and it shall preuale.</hi> Seeing the force and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">Esdr. 341.</note> of truth hath expressed from him in this place a confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that ouerthroweth the popish concerning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and manifestly proueth the Pope to be Antichrist. Namely, when hee confesseth according to the true interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the auncient Interpreters and Fathers of the Church, that the beast with seuen heads is the Romane Empire, &amp; that Antichrist is one of those seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heads: as also else-where he hath confessed that the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> is the citie of <hi>Rome.</hi> From hence therefore it followeth, that Antichrist shall be the head, <note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> not of the Iewes, but of the Romanes, that his chiefe seate or See shall be, not <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but <hi>Rome,</hi> that the name of the beast is <hi>Romane</hi> or <hi>Latine,</hi> that Antichrist is not one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, no more then the other sixe heads of the Romane Empire, but a state of gouernment, as the Kings were one head, and the Consuls an other, and the Emperours but one head, and the Popes and Papacie but one head, and lastly, that the head of the beast or Romane Empire, which is Antichrist, can be no other but the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> For of these seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heads S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that in his time fiue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were fallen, one was, &amp; an other was not yet come. These fiue which were fallen, were the fiue first, viz. kings, consuls, <hi>Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uiri,</hi> tribunes, &amp; dictators.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:25487:165"/>
The head that then was, out of question was the Emperours, who were the sixt head, the seuenth (which is of the Popes) was not yet come: Which then of these seuen heads doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Antichrist? surely none of the fiue first, for they were past before S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time: nor the sixt, which is the state of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, for that then was, and Antichrist was not yet come; and as the Papists confesse, that was it which hindered the reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">In 2. Thess. 2.</note> of Antichrist, and therefore was to be done out of the way before Antichrist could bee reuealed. It remaineth therefore that the seuenth head (which is of the Popes) is Antichrist. For as touching the Imperiall state renewed in the West, the holy Ghost plainely saith, that the beast which was, and is not, though it be, as being but the Image of the olde Empire, is the eight, and is one of the seuen: that is, in name and title it is the same with the sixt, as Images beare the names of those things which they doo represent. If therefore Antichrist bee one of the seuen heads of the Romane state (as vndoubtedly hee is, and as our aduersary here confesseth) then can it not be denied, but that the Pope, who is the seuenth head, is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The other interpretation, that the beast with seuen heads doth signifie the whole multitude of the wicked, is senselesse and absurd. For if the beast be the vniuersall company of the wicked, what is the world, which <hi>verse.</hi> 3. is said to wonder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beast? what are all the kinreds, tongues, nations which are made subiect to the beast, <hi>verse.</hi> 7.? who are all those inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth that do worship him? doth not the holy Ghost plainely say, <hi>verse.</hi> 8. that they are those <hi>whose names are not written in the booke of the Lambe;</hi> that is to say, the company of the wicked and reprobates? When as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore saith, that this beast signifieth either the Romane Empire, or the whole company of the wicked, wee may adde, but it signifieth not the whole company of the wicked. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth therefore that it signifieth the Romane state, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Antichrist is a head. But although Antichrist bee one head of the seuen, yet it followeth not, that the head which was as it were wounded to death, is Antichrist, but rather the estate
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:25487:165"/>
of Emperours which then was. For albeit the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ast with seuen heads doth signifie the Romane state in generall, yet in that place it seemeth to bee described as it was subiect to the sixt head. In the 17. chapter as it is renewed and subiected to the Antichristian state. For the beast (which he there speaketh of) which was, and is not though it be, was after to arise <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and being the eight in order, was in name one of the seuen: on which beast as also vpon those waters, that is, nations wherof the old Empire did arise, the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is meant the Antichristian state) sitteth, that is, ruleth and raigneth as a Queene.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And that it may appeare that there is no necessitie that we should vnderstand this wound of Antichrist, let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what wounds the Romane state had receiued, and was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereof. First therefore by the death of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and the ciuill warres therevpon ensuing, the Romane Empire recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as it were a deadly wound, &amp; yet recouered it so againe, as that in <hi>Augustus</hi> and some of his successors, it flourished more then euer before. And this some thinke to be the wound of the beast which was cured, whereof the holy Ghost here spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, describing the beast by that which was knowne to haue bene done in the Romane state. The second wound which the Romane Empire receiued, was at the death of <hi>Nero,</hi> in whom the stocke of the <hi>Caesars</hi> ended: which being cut off, the succession of the Imperiall Crowne was vncertaine, and by the vncertaintie of succession the like desolation threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that Empire, which happened to the Graecian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy after the death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great; the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left as a prey for the mightiest. Neither was this wound cured vntill <hi>Uespasian</hi> obtained the Empire. For after <hi>Nero, Sergius Galba</hi> seized vpon the Empire, and enioyed the same but seuen monethes and seuen dayes. And albeit to establish the succession, hee had adopted <hi>Piso,</hi> yet was hee murdered by <hi>Syluius Otho,</hi> who succeeded him, and <hi>Otho</hi> after three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths and fiue dayes was slaine by <hi>Uitellius,</hi> who also after eight moneths was deposed and put to an ignominious death by <hi>Uespasian:</hi> In whom the Empire which since the death of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:25487:166"/>
                  <hi>Nero</hi> had bene <hi>incertum &amp; vagum,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith, was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, and as it were cured of the former wound, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers learned men thinke to be vnderstood in this place. Others rather expound this deadly wound of the dissolution of the Empire in the West, <hi>Augustulu;</hi> being ouercome by the Gothes, and the Empire in the West lying voyd vntill <hi>Charles</hi> the great, in whom this wound was after a sort cured. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although Antichrist be one of the heads of this beast, yet seeing he is but one of the seuen, and the holy Ghost speaketh of this Empire especially, as it was ruled by the sixt head, that is to say, the Emperours; there is no necessitie, nay, no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie that by the head which was wounded wee should vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Antichrist, especially seeing Antichrist is afterwards described at large, and that by these notes among others, that he causeth men to worship the former beast, whose mortall wound was healed, <hi>verse.</hi> 13. and caused an Image to be made to the beast which had the deadly wound, <hi>verse.</hi> 14. which as appeareth also by the Image, was the Romane state vnder the Emperors; for thereof the Empire renewed is an Image.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But now suppose that Antichrist were this head which was wounded and cured as he is not, yet how doth it follow that therefore Antichrist shall faigne himselfe to die and rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, seeing he speaketh not of a particular mans death and resurrection, as the Papists imagine, but of the wounding and curing of a state signified by the head. Neither speaketh he of death and resurrection, but of wounding and curing: neither is the wound and the cure counterfeit and faigned, but the wound is truly inflicted and truly cured; such, as was both the wound of the Romane Empire, either at the murther of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> or death of <hi>Nero,</hi> or vanquishing of <hi>Augustulus;</hi> and also the cure in <hi>Augustus,</hi> in <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and as <hi>Bellarminee</hi> else-where <note place="margin">De trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>To these foure points I will answere, first ioyntly to them all, and then seuerally to euery one. For whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, that these foure thinges are read in the scriptures concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the kingdome and battailes of Antichrist, I answere, that not any one of these foure is to be found in the scriptures, and therefore that this argument as it is the last, so of least force, and that his disputation standing now as it were on the tilt, he seemeth to drawe of the lees. Notwithstanding the three first hee would faine father vpon <hi>Daniel,</hi> as though hee in the 7. and 11. Chapters had prophesied such things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Antichrist. But I answere, that these prophesies had, and according to <hi>Daniel</hi> were to haue their complement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of the Messias, and therfore that the Papists may as wel with the Iewes expect the comming of their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, as still to expect the fulfilling of these thinges in their imaginary Antichrist, the counterfeit Messias of the Iewes. Seeing as I said, these prophesies were to be fulfilled before the comming of Christ: and seeing the Iewes do stil waite for their Messias, because with the Papists they will not acknowledge
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:25487:167"/>
these prophesies (which were to haue their complement before the comming of the Messias) to haue bene fulfilled before the incarnation of Christ. The occasion of which errour of the Papists (whereat the Iewes also do stumble) hath bene an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious interpretation of some of the Fathers, who vnderstand whatsoeuer is spoken of the kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagedae,</hi> that is, the kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> (so farre forth as it tyrannized ouer the people of God the Iewes) figured by the two legges of the Image, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. and the fourth beast with tenne hornes, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. they vnderstand (I say) as spoken of the Romane Monarchy. And consequently whatsoeuer is spoken of the little horne, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 8. 11. whereby <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> is most plainely described, they expound it of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But the learned of our times haue made it cleare, although the Papists shut their eyes against the truth, that by the two legges of the Image, and by the fourth beast, is not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the Romane Empire, and by the little horne not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist properly, but <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> For these thinges which are recorded of the two legges, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. and of the fourth beast, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. do not onely sitly, but also properly and onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagedae.</hi> And those things which are written of the little horne, do wholy &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> as the Papists themselues cannot deny. <hi>Porphyry</hi> that learned, though malicious enemie of Christianitie, perceiued <hi>Daniels</hi> prophesies in the 7. 8. 11. &amp; 12. chapters, which the Papists vnderstand of Antichrist, so fully and perfectly to agree to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> that he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled against the prophesies of <hi>Daniel;</hi> affirming that they were written not before hand of <hi>Daniel,</hi> but after the fulfilling of them by some one that liued in the times of <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes.</hi> For so <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth of him: <hi>Contre prophetam Danie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem doudetimum librum scribit Porphyrius, notans eum ab ipso cuius</hi>

And yet it were a ridiculous, if not a blasphemous course, to apply to Christ whatsoeuer is recorded of <hi>Salomon, Dauid,</hi> the high Priests, or <hi>Iosuah.</hi> Neither is this without cause set downe by the Schoolemen as a rule of Diuinitie, that <hi>theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia symbolica non est argumentutina.</hi> For those things which properly are spoken of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> cannot properly be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Antichrist, (if at all) but onely allegorically, and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories proue not: and that force which they seeme to haue in prouing, is not to proue the same particular, but the like: for allegories are similitudes without notes of likenes.

But if we shall apply to Antichrist those things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the person of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and in respect whereof he was not a type of Antichrist, and from thence shall inferre not the like, which were too much, for like things are not like in all things, but the same particular which was proper to his perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we shall be ridiculously absurd. As for example, if we shall say that Antichrist shall by craft attaine, not to his kingdome, but to the same kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> because <hi>Antiochus</hi> did so: that Antichrist shal fight with the kings of <hi>Egypt, Libya</hi> &amp; <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> because in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit <hi>Antiochus</hi> did so, and such like particulars; then may we by as good right affirme, that Antichrist shall immediatly succeed in the kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> his brother <hi>Seleucus Philopater,</hi> for that is expresly noted <hi>Dan:</hi> 11. 21. <hi>and in his place, &amp;c.</hi> and consequently, that he shall be the sonne of <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> that he shall be an hostage at <hi>Rome</hi> before he be king, as <hi>Epiphanes</hi> was: that he shall make three expeditions into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in his returne homeward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery time shall hee afflict the land of <hi>Iury;</hi> especially in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond expedition, when being hindred by the shippes of <hi>Chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi>

For seeing hee confesseth that the former part of the chapter is to be expounded of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> and that in the 20. verse is described <hi>Seleucus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopator,</hi> for so hee saith on those wordes <hi>(Et stabit in loco eius vilissimus) Seleucum dicit cognomento Philopatorem, filium magni Antiochi,</hi> he speaketh of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> surnamed <hi>Philopator,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great.</p>

It is therefore most plaine, that when <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, <hi>and in his place shall stand a vile person;</hi> he speaketh of the next successour of <hi>Seleucus Philopator,</hi> meaning <hi>Antiochus;</hi> euen as in the 20. verse after he had spoken of <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> he saith, <hi>and in his place shall stand vp a sender forth of an extortioner,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Seleucus.</hi> Neither doth <hi>Daniel</hi> say any where, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, or he of whom he speaketh, shall arise of a small nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, meaning thereby the Iewes: that which he speaketh <hi>de modico populo,</hi> vers. 23. is to be vnderstood properly as <hi>Ierome</hi> himselfe expoundeth it, according to the literal, that is, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sense, of the small company wherwith <hi>Antiochus</hi> surprised <hi>Egypt:</hi> neither can there be any such allegorical sense, as he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to frame. Neither doth <hi>Daniel</hi> by the litle horne meane any other but <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who may not vnfitly in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things be said to haue bene a type of Antichrist.

The tenth, that is to say, the last of them that had dominion ouer <hi>Iudaea</hi> was, not Antichrist, but <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanes,</hi> who in crueltie towards the people of God surpassed all that went before him.</p>

If any say the Romane Empire is figured <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. by a beast with ten horns, I answer, that the ten hornes wherof <hi>Iohn</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Apo.</hi> 17. 12. are ten kings, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whom the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was to be diuided, who succeeded not one another in the same kingdome, but were rulers of so many seueral prouinces or kingdoms at the same time: but these ten horns tyrannized ouer the same kingdome of the Iewes successiuely, as they are particularly described, chap. 11. And further, he that in <hi>Daniel</hi> is supposed by the Papists to be Antichrist, is one of the tenne hornes, but in <hi>Iohn</hi> not. 4. that which is spoken in <hi>Daniel</hi> of the tenth horne, doth fitly &amp; wholy agree to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who was the tenth and last king of that kingdome, that ruled ouer <hi>Iudaea,</hi> but the same things cannot in like sort be applied to the tenth Prince of the Romanes. 5. By conference of that which is written of the little horne, chap. 7. with those thinges which are more plainly recorded of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> chap. 8. 23. &amp;c. and chap. 11. 21. &amp;c. to the end of the chapter, it appeareth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, that he &amp; no other is that litle horne. For wheras <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in the 7. chap had described 3. kingdomes besides the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian, which should tyrannize ouer the Iewes by three beasts: in the 8. chap. he figureth the same 3. kingdomes by 2. beasts. For the kingdome of the Medes &amp; Persians which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was resembled by a Beare, is here signified by the Ramme with 2. hornes: the kingdome of the Macedonians &amp; <hi>Seleuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae,</hi> which before were represented by two seuerall beasts, are heere figured by the Goate Bucke, containing them both;

                  </hi> were <hi>Iauan,</hi> that is, the Greekes, <hi>Daniel.</hi> 8. 21. And as in the 7. chapter, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Macedonians was signified by a Leopard which had foure heads: so here it is saide, that after the great horne signifying <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was broken off, there grewe foure hornes in stead thereof, meaning the foure Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom the Macedonian Monarchy was diuided. The fourth kingdom figured chap. 7. by the beast with 10. hornes, is here signified to be that kingdome which was chiefly erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one of those foure hornes, namely <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that is, the kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae:</hi> and from him, namely in the end of their kingdome ouer the Iewes, came forth a little horne, that is, the king with the impudent face, chap. 8. verse. 9. 23. which is <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who was the tenth horne of the fourth beast. And in the eleuenth chapter without figures of beastes the same three kingdomes are described, the same tenne hornes reckned vp, the same tenth horne more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deciphred. 6. The people pusht at and oppressed by these hornes, is <hi>Daniels</hi> people, the people of the Iewes yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining and inhabiting in <hi>Tzeby,</hi> that is in <hi>Iury</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> not onely before the desolation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but also before the reformation vnder <hi>Iudas Macchabaeus.</hi> But Antichrist, if we will beleeue the Papists, shall be the counterfeit Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of the Iewes, neither shall hee afflict the Iewes, but by them the Christians, and that in the ende of the worlde, &amp;c. 7. The times of afflicting the people of God assigned to the little horne, doe precisely agree to the persecution vnder <hi>Antiochus.</hi> But these times are diuersly to be reckened in respect either of the beginning, or the end of the account. For as touching the beginning, we recken either from the defection and reuolt of the people wrought by <hi>Menelaus</hi> the priest, in the yeare 142. the sixt moneth, and sixt day, vnto the restitution of Religion, in the yeare 148. and 25. day of the ninth moneth, and this space is 2300. dayes, (that is 6. moneths, 3. yeares, 18. dayes) foretold <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14. or else we recken from the pollutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the temple, and erection of the new altar, &amp; abolishing of the daily sacrifice, to wit, in the 145.

               </p>
               <p n="11">11 Thus much therefore may suffice to haue spoken of his proposition: now let vs briefly consider of the assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>The Pope</hi> (saith he) <hi>ariseth not from base estate, neither by deceit obtaineth his kingdome.</hi> As touching the former I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that although it were false of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> yet is it true of the Pope, whether you consider the meane estate of the first Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the base birth and obscure paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of diuers Popes. For that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth in commendation of the Primitiue religion, and auncient church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is but a vaine flourish, nothing appertaining to this purpose. 2. That the Pope hath not attained to his kingdome by fraude and deceit, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had rather it should be taken for graunted, then once called in question: and therefore cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly passeth it ouer with silence. But if this were set downe in the scriptures as a badge of Antichrist, to attain to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by fraude &amp; deceit, I would make it manifest, that neuer in any estate more deep policy, and diuellish deceit hath bene
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:25487:174"/>
vsed then in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherby they haue obtained their supremacy, and maintained their soueraigntie ouer the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world. Yea their whole religion of Popery and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of iniquitie, seemeth to be nought else but a packe of policy deuised by worldly men to deisie the Pope, and to enrich the popish cleargy. For wherevnto else I beseech you tended their Indulgences and Pardons, their Iubelies, their doctrines of merits &amp; supererogation, their purgatory, their trentalls of Masses, and praier for the dead, their pilgrimages and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, Images, and reliques, their licences and dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their thunderboults of excommunication, their oathe of allegeance and fealtie imposed on Princes and potentates, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to the Pope enforced vpon all sorts, as absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to saluation, their wilfull deprauations of scriptures, forgeries of Canons, counterfeit donations of <hi>Constantine</hi> and others, to proue the double supremacy of the Pope? Whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tended his often maintaining of quarelles among Christian Princes, his warres inioyned them for the recouery of the holy lande, but that they being by these meanes weakened, might be the more easily subdued vnto himselfe: his Croisades and promises of heauen, to all those that sight such battailes as like him? Haue not their cleargy come to their riches, and the Pope to his greatnes by these and such like meanes? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the comming to his greatnes by fraude and deceit, is not set downe in the scriptures as a note of Antichrist, vnlesse it be by way of type and allegory in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it passe: onely let me put you in minde that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Peter</hi> in the former respects is performed in the Pope and cleargy of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by <hi>fained words make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise of mens soules through couetousnesse.</hi> And this was <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> his first instance.</p>
               <p n="12">12 His seconde argument is thus to be framed. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall warre with three Kings, to wit of</hi> Egypt, Libya, <hi>and</hi> Aethiopia; <hi>and hauing ouercome them, shall possesse their kingdomes. But the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>hath not warred at any time</hi> (he should say, <hi>shall not warre,</hi> and that is more then hee is able to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:25487:174"/>
proue) <hi>with the Kings of</hi> Egypt, Libya, <hi>and</hi> Aethiopia, <hi>neither hauing vanquished them, hath possessed their kingdomes, therefore the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>is not Antichrist.</hi> And in this argument <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armine</hi> doth so greatly please himselfe, that after an insulting manner hee breaketh foorth into these bragges: <hi>Hoc autem maximè refellit insaniam haereticorum, &amp;c. This especially refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the madnesse of heretikes, who make the Pope Antichrist. For let them say if they can, when the Pope hath killed the Kings of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Libya, <hi>and</hi> Aethiopia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What would this <hi>Thraso</hi> do thinke you, if hee had any good argument against vs, that thus insulteth vpon a meere dotage? For where doth the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture say, that Antichrist shall sight with the Kings of <hi>Egypt, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and that hauing vanquished them, he shall possesse their kingdomes? Forsooth <hi>in the</hi> 7. <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>of Daniel. In the</hi> 7. <hi>chapter Daniel speaking of the tenne hornes of the fourth beast, he saith, verse.</hi> 8. <hi>I considered the hornes, and loe the last horne came vp, a little one among them, and three of the former hornes were pluckt vp before it. And after, verse.</hi> 24. <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the same words, hee saith: And the tenne hornes are tenne Kings of that kingdome, after whom shall arise the last</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the tenne) <hi>diuerse from the rest, and he shall abase three Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this allegation is impertinent. For I haue shewed that this fourth beast is the kingdome of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae;</hi> that the tenne hornes are those tenne Kings of that kingdome which tyrannized or ruled ouer <hi>Iewry;</hi> that the tenth or last of them that tyrannized ouer the Iewes, was <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who is therefore called little before his comming to the crowne, because of his vnlikenesse to be King. First because hee was the third and youngest sonne of <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> his elder brother <hi>Seleucus</hi> hauing also a sonne called <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius.</hi> Secondly, because he was to be a perpetuall hostage at <hi>Rome.</hi> For when as other hostages, which <hi>Antiochus</hi> the great gaue to the Romanes, were to be changed euery third yeare, he was to be a perpetuall hostage. And thirdly, because of his vile and base conditions. Now whereas it is saide that three
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25487:175"/>
hornes were to be plucked vp before him, wee are by those three hornes to vnderstand three kings, not of others, &amp; those also diuers kingdomes, as of <hi>Egypt, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> but three kings that successiuely had ruled before him in the same kingdome vsurped ouer the Iewes, as being expresly called three former hornes, <hi>viz.</hi> of the tenne, verse 8. <hi>Yea but Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus was a type of Antichrist.</hi> It cannot be proued that he was a type in this point, or if he were a type in this, we may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the same particular as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, for then those three kings mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> must be reuiued againe, that Antichrist may make them away: but the like might be inferred, <hi>viz.</hi> that as <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> to make himselfe a way to the kingdome, did make away his brother and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that went before him: so it is not vnlike, but that this should be an Antichristian practise. It is well knowne that <hi>Gregory</hi> the seuenth, who resembled <hi>Antiochus</hi> in many things, to make himselfe a way to the Papacy, made away sixe of his predecessors by poyson. And it is an ordinary practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Cardinalles of <hi>Rome</hi> that aspire to the Papacy, now and then to minister an Italian Figge to their Popes: that you may not maruell that there haue bene nine Popes in the time of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, of whom the three next predecessors of the present Pope <hi>Clement</hi> 8. were so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly pluckt vp before him, namely <hi>Urbanus</hi> 7. <hi>Gregory</hi> 14. and <hi>Innocent</hi> 9. that I suppose their names haue bene heard of fewe among vs.</p>
               <p n="13">13 But <hi>the</hi> 11. <hi>of Daniel,</hi> perhaps will proue <hi>Bellarmines</hi> assertion. That allegation will proue nothing but <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wilfull blindnesse. Hee saith that <hi>in the</hi> 11. <hi>chapter vers.</hi> 43. <hi>Daniel explaneth who those three Kings are. Hee shall stretch out his hand ouer countries, and the land of Egypt shall not escape, and he shall passe through Libya and Aethiopia,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> readeth, but according to the Hebrew, the <hi>Lubim</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shim,</hi> that is, the Libyans and Aethiopians shall be in his passages or voyages. Whence <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inferreth, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall kill three kings, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Egypt, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi>

Answere. 1. <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh not of Antichrist but of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> as I haue manifestly prooued. 2. although <hi>Antiochus</hi> were graunted to haue bene a type of Antichrist herein, yet the same particular which is proper to the person of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> may not be applied to Antichrist. For then we must dreame that the world and the kingdomes thereof, must be brought againe iust to the same passe wherein they were when <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> raigned, and the same kings to be reuiued; but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like might be applied, that as <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit, suppressed three kings, so Antichrist should be a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor of kings, which is true of the Pope: who besides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kings deposed by his meanes, hath also depressed foure Emperours at the least, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe confesseth. 3. <hi>Daniel</hi> in this place is so farre from mentioning three kings slaine by Antichrist according to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> conceit, that he neither speaketh of Antichrist, nor of three kings, nor of the killing of any one king, but onely of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Egypt,</hi> hauing in his company the Libyans and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians. Whether therefore this argument of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth reproue our madnesse, or rather proue his folly, let any indifferent arbiter be Iudge. Now if <hi>Ierome</hi> or any other of the Fathers haue let fall any such thing, we are to esteeme it as an excrement of theirs, which we are to passe by, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then with the <hi>Cacouorae</hi> the Papists, to gather it vp as <note place="margin">Cacouora, auis quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam est a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Indos, quae alteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us auis asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="14">14 And the like answere we frame vnto his third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which is not grounded vpon the scriptures; but vpon the bare coniectures of some of the Fathers. For where is there in all the scriptures any word of this which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith he readeth in the scriptures, <hi>that Antichrist shall subdue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen other kings, and by that meanes shall become the Monarch of the whole worlde?</hi> Forsooth <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Ireneus say so.</hi> But I neuer tooke their writings before to be the scriptures. Why then <hi>Ierome</hi> saith so vpon <hi>Daniel</hi> 11. 24. where <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> speaketh of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his dealings in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he did that which his forefathers neuer did; <hi>Nullus Iudaeorum abs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Antichristo in tot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:25487:176"/>
scriptures. But where do the scriptures indeede say that Antichrist shall subdue seuen of the tenne Kings? Nay, the contrary may rather bee gathered out of the scriptures. The tenne hornes whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh, were tenne Kings which successiuely raigned ouer <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as hath bene shewed. And although <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> might helpe away three of his next predecessors, yet hee could not hurt the other sixe (for there were but nine besides himselfe) which were all dead and gone before he came to yeares. Yea, <hi>but this opinion of the Fathers is plainely enough deduced out of</hi> Apoc. 17. 12. <hi>where we reade, and the tenne hornes which thou sawest, are tenne Kings; these haue one minde, and they shall giue their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to the beast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No maruell though some of the Papists call the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a nose of waxe, seeing they can frame and fashion it at their pleasure, and giue vnto it what sense they list. Doth <hi>Iohn</hi> speake of Antichrist his either killing three, or subduing seuen? Or doth <hi>Iohn</hi> speake of the same tenne hornes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Daniel</hi> doth? <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of tenne Kings which were to bee dead and gone before the comming of the Messias: <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of such as in his time had not yet attained to their kingdome. <hi>verse</hi> 12. <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of tenne Kings of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae</hi> which succeeded one an other. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of tenne Kings among whom the Romane Empire was to be diuided, who also were to haue their kingdome together with the beast. <hi>Daniel</hi> telleth vs what the little horne which was one of the tenne, should doo to three of the other nine, without mention of the rest, <hi>Iohn</hi> sheweth what all the tenne hornes should doo to Antichrist, which is none of the tenne hornes, but one of the heades of the beast. If therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can proue from hence that these are the same tenne hornes spoken of in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that Antichrist shall kill three of them, &amp; subdue the other seuen, he may hope to proue any thing,</p>
               <p>But what other scriptures hath hee? forsooth <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Cyrill.</hi> For <hi>Chrysostome</hi> on 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. saith, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall bee a Monarch, and shall succeede the Romanes in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:25487:176"/>
the Monarchy, as the Romanes succeeded the Greekes; the Greekes succeeded the Persians, and they the Assyrians. And <hi>Cyrill</hi> saith, that Antichrist shall obtaine the Monarchy <note place="margin">Catech. 15</note> which was the Romanes. I answere, that for substance these Fathers held the truth. For what Monarch hath there bene in the West these fiue or sixe hundred yeares, besides the Pope, who calleth himselfe King of Kings, and Lorde of Lords, to whom all power is giuen in heauen and in earth, who hath as they say, the double Monarchy both of spirituall and temporal power; who forsooth is Lord of the whole earth, in so much that he taketh vpon him authoritie to dispose of the new found world. And that he succedeth the Emperors in the <note place="margin">Alexand. 6.</note> gouernment of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it becommeth Antichrist, who is the second beast, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. and the 7. head of the beast, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. whereof the Emperour was the sixt, I shall not neede to proue.</p>
               <p n="15">15 There remaineth the fourth argument. <hi>Antichrist shall persecute with an innumerable army the Christians throughout the world, and this is the battell of</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Magog: <hi>but this agreeth not to the Pope, therefore the Pope is not Antichrist.</hi> I answere to the proposition, that no such thing can be proued out of the scripture. Hee alledgeth <hi>Ezech.</hi> 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 39. <hi>&amp; Apoc.</hi> 20. 7. 8. 9. 10. But <hi>Ezechiel</hi> speaketh not of Antichrist, nor of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the Christian Church by him. But hauing foretold chapter 37. the restitution of the Iewes from the Babylonian captiuitie, and also prophesied of the comming of Christ; in those chapters hee foretelleth of the afflictions and troubles which the people of the Iewes should sustaine in the meane time, to wit, after their returne out of captiuitie, before the comming of the Messias, and withall, denounceth the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God against the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> who were the kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> minor, and their adherents, who should be the chiefe enemies of the church, and people of the Iewes after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.

name. So that by the land of <hi>Magog,</hi> wee are to vnderstand <hi>Syria,</hi> and by <hi>Gog, Asia</hi> minor. And the rest of the peoples that <note place="margin">Plin. lib. 5. cap. 23.</note> are named in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> were such as assisted the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> (who were the kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> minor) in their warres, either as their subiects, or as their friends, or as their mercenary soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. And for as much as the princes and people of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> minor, were the most grieuous enemies of the Iewes, by <note place="margin">Ad Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell. &amp; Iun. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech. 38. &amp; 39.</note> whom they sustained the chiefest calamities after their returne before the comming of Christ: therefore by an vsuall speech in the Iewish language, the mortall and deadly enemies of the church, are called <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> And in this sense <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diuine vseth these names, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to signifie the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the church, meaning not the same enemies whereof <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi> speaketh, but the like enemies of the Church, which should afflict the true Christians, as <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> afflicted the Iewes. Neither doth <hi>Iohn</hi> in this place speake of the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Antichrist properly, but of Sathan (after he was loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) his inciting the enemies of the Church to battell, and of Gods iudgements against them, signified by fire. And so much shall suffice to haue answered to this argument. For after so long a Treatise I will not trouble the Reader with the tenne seuerall opinions which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reciteth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> neither yet with any further answere to his cauillations and exceptions against some of the arguments of diuers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, which he thought were more easie to answere: seeing in the former booke I haue sufficiently cleared those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby the Pope is more euidently proued to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist: neither is the controuersie betwixt vs, whether euery argument that hath bene produced by euery one, doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily conclude the Pope to be Antichrist. That discourse therefore being rather personall then reall, I let it passe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing therefore both by sufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments manifestly proued that the Pope is <note place="margin">1.</note> Antichrist, and by euidence of truth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the same assertion against the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Papists: let vs now consider in the last place, what conclusions may vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this doctrine be necessarily inferred for our further vse. For first, if this be true, that the Pope is Antichrist, as I haue proued; and the church of <hi>Rome</hi> that now is, <hi>Babylon</hi> the Synagogue of Antichrist: then all other controuersies betwixt vs and them, may be easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided: their chiefe ground being the authoritie of their church, and of the See Apostolike. For then it is to be presumed, that those doctrines which are peculiar to the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are the errours of Antichrist; yea, and as the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 2.</note> them, <hi>doctrines of diuels.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="3">3 If the Pope be Antichrist, then those that embrace that religion, and ioyne themselues to that church, acknowledging the Pope to be their head, receiue the marke of the beast. And those that do receiue the beasts marke (especially after he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed) shall drinke of the wine of Gods wrath, and shall bee punished with fire and brimstone before the holy Angels, and before the Lambe. <hi>Apoc</hi> 14. 9. This therefore must serue as a serious admonition, and necessary caueat both to reclaime all tractable Papists, and to confirme all wauering and vnstayed Protestants. The former, as they tender their saluation, so to come out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> The latter, as they will auoid their endles confusion, to keepe out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> For not onely to retaine the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:25487:178"/>
marke of the beast wilfully after he is discouered, but to reuolt from the profession of the truth vnto Antichristian religion: it also is a fearefull signe of reprobation. For it is impossible that the elect should finally be seduced by Antichrist. <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 24. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> obserueth, that Antichrist shall effectually deceiue them that perish with all deceitfulnes of iniquitie, because they haue not receiued the loue of the truth, that they might be saued. And therefore God shall send them strong delusions, that they should beleeue lies, that al they might be damned which beleeued not the truth, but delighted in vnrighteousnesse. 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10. 11. 12.

               <p n="4">4 If the Pope be Antichrist, then those that are found to be resolute Antichristians, that is recusant Papists; but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iesuites and Seminary Priests, which are sent to reconcile men vnto the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, (as hath bene proued) to set on them the marke of the beast, &amp; consequently to brand them to destruction, and all such as seeke to peruert &amp; seduce others, ought not to be fauoured or spared in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian common wealth. First, because they are limmes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and therfore by the commandement of God, we should
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:25487:178"/>
do to them as they haue done to vs. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. 6. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are enemies to God, and traitors to Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They are enemies to God, not onely because themselues are Idolaters, and consequently such as hate God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. but also because they labour to withdrawe others from the true worship of God, vnto superstition and idolatrie, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in no case ought to be spared, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 5. 8. They are trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors also to Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Princes, being sworne vassals to the Pope their capitall enemie. For hee esteemeth all Christian Princes that do not acknowledge him to be their head, as schismatikes or heretikes. And as he vseth (so oft as he dareth) to proceede <note place="margin">Antonin. sum. part. 3. tit. 22. cap. 5. §. 11.</note> against such foure wayes, viz. <hi>by excommunication, deposition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing them of their temporall goods &amp; possessions, and raising warre against them,</hi> so all Papists acknowledging the Popes suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, do hold both that he hath authoritie so to proceede against Christian Princes, and also that in his definitiue sentence hee <note place="margin">Antonin. sum. part. 3. tit. 22. cap. 5. §. 10</note> cannot erre. And therforé if they put not in execution the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their holy Father, it is not for want of treasonable will, and rebellious affection towards their Prince, but for lacke of meanes and oportunitie. As for example, when <hi>Pius</hi> 5. had sent his Bull of excommunication against our late Soueraigne <note place="margin">Cupers. pag. 182. num. 8.</note> Queene of happie memorie, therein deposing her from her crowne, and absoluing her subiects from their alleageance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, it is most certaine, that whatsoeuer many hollow hearted Papists pretended, yet fewe of them did acknowledge her for their lawfull Queene; and many of them thought it a meritorious worke to take away her life. And surely if not their persons, then much lesse ought their Antichristian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the mysterie of iniquitie, be tolerated in the Church of Christ. For what fellowship can there bee betwixt light and darkenesse? or what agreement can the Temple of God haue <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> with Idols?</p>
               <p n="5">5 If the Pope be Antichrist, and his Church Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, then can there be no reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwixt vs &amp; the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we being, as often hath bene proued, the true church of God. For what agreement can there be betwixt Christ and Antichrist? Such neuters therefore shewe themselues to

be <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>llifidians</hi> and politicke Atheists, who would perswade men that both wee and they are the true church of Christ, and that the difference betwixt vs being in words rather then in substance, may easily be composed: but they might as well say that there is but a verball difference betwixt the Gospell of Christ, and the doctrine of Antichrist.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Lastly, if the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which because of her large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, calleth her selfe the Catholike, that is to say, the vniuersall church, bee notwithstanding the Synagogue of Antichrist: What infinit thankes doo wee owe to our good and gracious God, who hath not suffred vs to be carried away with that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Apostasie, as it were an vniuersall deluge, but hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vs into the arke of his true church, making vs with the rest of his true professors his peculiar people. It remaineth therefore, that seeing God hath bene so gracious to vs, wee should not be vnthankful to him, but rather should walke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our calling, as it becommeth the children of the light, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the profession of the glorious Gospel of Christ, by a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuersation; to the ende that by the plentifull fruites of righteousnesse and true holinesse, wee may glorifie God our heauenly Father, stoppe the mouthes of our aduersaries, and gather assurance vnto our owne soules, of our iustification and saluation by Iesus Christ our bessed Lord and Sauiour; To whom with the Father and the holy spirit, be all praise and thankes-giuing, both now and euermore.</p>
