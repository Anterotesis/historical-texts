         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>The chief Cauſes, Symptoms, and Effects of the Scurvy.</head>
               <p>THIS Diſeaſe doth chiefly proceed from Melancholy bred by diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Stomach or Spleen; which being crude, ſtays in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the Arteries and Veins, and thereby doth excite grievous
Fermentation or Workings, from whence are ſent Vapors which
afflict the heart and brain, &amp;c. from all which is cauſed malignant and
contagious putrefaction of Melancholy; and thence proceed theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
<hi>viz.</hi> Giddineſs in the head, ſudden fluſhings, heat and redneſs in
the face and body, putrefaction and ſtinking of the mouth and gums,
Tooth-ach, ſtinking breath, blackneſs and looſeneſs of the teeth, want
of digeſtion, much wind, and unſavoury belchings: and by thick vapon
ariſing from the <hi>Hypocondria</hi> to the midriff, are occaſioned obſtructions of
reſpiration, or ſhortneſs of Breath, and ſtraitneſs of the Breaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
body is dull and heavy, and in the legs are ſpots, ſometimes red, purple,
black, or blue: There are alſo violent pains in the head, ſhoulders, arms,
fingers, belly, thighs, knees, legs, ancles, feet and toes: Whence ſome
who have had the <hi>Pox,</hi> (though cured) do fear the return of their old
malady. There are many thouſands have this Diſtemper, that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
they have the <hi>Gout;</hi> becauſe ſometimes it hath the very ſigns of the
<hi>Gout:</hi> which alſo is the cauſe why the <hi>Scurvy</hi> (which by miſtake is judged
the <hi>Gout)</hi> is ſo ſeldom cured. For thoſe Medicaments pertinent in the
<hi>Gout</hi> are not the very ſame in the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and conſequently cannot cure
it. Other ſigns of the <hi>Scurvy</hi> are bad ſleep, and frightful dreams, a feveriſh
heat and ſweats towards the morning. Some have riſings on their body,
as if ſtung with Bees or Waſps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others have dolors in their ſides, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
thoſe of the Spleen. And in ſhort, it doth appear to a judicious
eye, with and in the ſhape of moſt Diſeaſes; as hath been ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
not onely to my ſelf, but alſo to ſeveral other experienced Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who have traced this Diſeaſe, and made exact inſpection into its
variable dreſſes, for many years together. And it is alſo obſerved, that it
is propagated and ſpread abroad in theſe parts of the world, more than
any other Diſtemper whatſoever; and by its ſundry ſhapes hath ſeduced
many in their judgment of the Diſeaſe. For in ſome it paſſeth for a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi>
in others for a <hi>Dropſie,</hi> &amp;c. and Medicines are given accordingly,
but alas to little purpoſe, and all for want of a true knowledge of the
original of the Diſeaſe it ſelf. And here obſerve a great truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that
there are very few afflicted with any Diſtemper of long continuance, who
have not joyned with it a <hi>Scorbutick</hi> taint; which unleſs it be conſidered,
and ſome powerful <hi>Antiſoorbutick</hi> Medicaments given, the Patient is very
rarely, if ever cured.</p>
               <p>Now the concluſion of all (if the <hi>Scurvy</hi> be not timely remedied, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33374:2"/>
that it grow predominant) is ſometimes <hi>Swoonings, Apoplexies, Dropſies,</hi>
great decay of the Body, <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> and very often Death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That in ſome, the <hi>Scurvy</hi> is hereditary; and that there are ſome
few cauſes thereof, beſides thoſe here ſet down: but theſe being uſually the
chief, the other are omitted.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="disease">
               <head>The Cauſes, Signs, and Effects of the VIRGIN or MAIDEN
Diſeaſe, called the GREEN-SICKNESS.</head>
               <p>THE main cauſe of this Diſeaſe is from obſtructions or ſtoppage; and
the cauſe of ſuch obſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are evil, thick and clammy humours
which choak and ſtop the paſſage in the Veſſels, and ſpoil the making and
paſſage of the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe proceed from bad Diet; as eating of
raw Wheat, Oatmeal, much Salt, Aſhes, Clay, Chalk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> drinking of
much Vingar, or much cold Water; from too much or too little Sleep, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much raw Fruit, ſitting too long at Sewing work, Melancholy, violent
Exerciſe, great Heats or Colds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſigns of this Diſeaſe, are a pale and greeniſh colour in the Face, the
Face and Eye-lids ſwelled, eſpecially after Sleep; the Heart beats and
fainteth, the Stomach ſwell'd or pained; they loath Meat, have a tickling
cough, and their Breath ſhort; they ſometimes Vomit; they have thirſt,
Head-ach, and are often Melancholy; they are ſwell'd about their Ancles
and Feet, and care not much to ſtir, eſpecially up Stairs or an Hill.</p>
               <p>The continuance of this Diſeaſe brings long Fevers, Barrenneſs, great
watery Swellings, and the Dropſie: Some have a <hi>Schirrus</hi> or Tumour,
and waſting in their Liver; others by oppreſſion of the Heart die ſuddenly,
and many fall into <hi>Conſumptions,</hi> which end in the Grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That great caution ought to be uſed in Bleeding any Maid in the
Arm, before ſhe have had her monthly Viſits; but if an urgent occaſion
call for Blood-letting, then rather breathe a Vein in the Ancle. By fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
this advice, you ſhall moſt certainly prevent the Death of ſome,
and many Diſeaſes in others; but more eſpecially that moſt dreadful Diſeaſe
of Barrenneſs.</p>
               <p>And againſt this very Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Green-ſickneſs;</hi> and alſo to procure
the monthly Viſits in ſuch Women in whom they are wanting, there are
but few Medicines comparable to theſe PILLS, as has been often proved,
when no other means or Medicines could prevail.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="disease">
               <head>I ſhall here give ſome account concerning WORMS.</head>
               <p>OF theſe Creatures are ſeveral ſorts; but the moſt uſual are ſhaped
round and long: theſe are bred in the Guts, yet ſometimes get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Stomach. The ſecond are ſhort, and very ſmall, like threds; and
commonly lie in the right Gut, and in the end of the Fundament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is almoſt continual itching; which Worms alſo provoke the Patient very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33374:3"/>
often to ſtool. The third ſort are long and broad, of an incredible length,
but very rarely ſeen.</p>
               <p>Worms are chiefly cauſed from raw, groſs, flegmatick matter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Youth and ſuch as eat much Fruit, are ſeldom free from them: Alſo all
great Eaters are very ſubject to them; eſpecially thoſe who eat Meats that
eaſily putrifie in the Stomach, and more at once than Nature can well digeſt;
whence follow Crudities, and thence Worms; the ſigns of which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Some have unſavory belchings and a ſtinking Breath, waſting of the
Gums, heavineſs, fainting, great thirſt, vomiting, cold ſweats, and often
a Fever; a ſhort Cough, unquiet Sleep, intolerable gnawing pains in the
Stomach and Belly, loſs of Appetite, weakneſs and conſumption of the
whole Body. Many times the Patient hath an inſatiable Appetite, cauſed
by flat Worms, which devour the Food that is eaten. There are a few ſigns
more of Worms, but theſe being the moſt common, I ſhall ſay no more of
the reſt at preſent; only thus much ſhall add, that if Worms be voided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
without other excrement, in the beginning of a Diſeaſe, 'tis dangerous,
and ſignifies great Crudities; and if voided dead, ſignifies much putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
that has killed them, which probably, ſhortly after kills the Patient.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, 'tis the opinion of our Age, grounded upon experimental proofs,
that Worms and their effects, have conducted more People to their Graves,
than any one Diſtemper whatſoever. And therefore you that ſuſpect them
in your ſelves, make much of theſe PILLS, as a choice remedy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a Worm-eaten Carcaſe: and take them ere too late; by which doing
you may prolong your days in caſe and health, and be obliged to thank your Adviſer.</p>

               <head>The Cauſes, Symptoms, and Effects of DROPSIES.</head>
               <p>THE Dropſie <hi>Aſcites,</hi> is from abundance of Water heaped up between
the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> or inner-coat of the Belly, and Bowels; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the Mouth of the Stomach, doth bring great thirſt, and often a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Sometimes it begins in the Feet, and ſwells upward to the Legs,
Thighs and Cods: but at the ſame time the upper parts of the Body uſually
conſume. The cauſe of this <hi>Dropſie</hi> may be from a cold Diſtemper of the
Liver, which cannot make perfect Blood, but Flegm, Wind, and Water.
Sometimes a <hi>Dropſie</hi> may proceed from a <hi>Fever,</hi> hot Meats, and too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
drinking of Wine; whence the Liver, Spleen, and kidneys, may loſe part
of their native heat, and conſequently their ability to attrack the Water,
and eject it by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>reters.</hi> The ſame may be cauſed from the natural <hi>Flux</hi>
in Women flowing too plentifully, or from retention of the ſame: And
drinking much cold Water may diminiſh and diſperſe the native heat, and by
that means make way for a <hi>Dropſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dropſie <hi>Tympanites,</hi> is from wind ſhut up in the cavity of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33374:3"/>
or Belly, and ſometimes in the Guts. This wind is bred from crude
thick flegmatick, or Melancholy humors, which by heat having motion,
and made thin, become groſs windy Vapors. This <hi>Dropſie</hi> is never of wind
alone, but always mixt with Water. But the greateſt part of this Diſtemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
proceeding from wind, it is then called a <hi>Tympany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dropſie <hi>Anaſarca</hi> is, without controverſie, bred from a cold Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Liver, which hinders its concoction; from whence, inſtead of
good Blood, it diſperſeth flegmatick humors, and cauſeth the whole Body
to ſwell. A <hi>Dropſie</hi> may be alſo cauſed from all tumors or obſtructions of
the Liver, much bleeding, great evacuation by Stool, Sweat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> All <hi>Dropſies</hi> are dangerous, and hardly cured. Yet the Dropſie
<hi>Anaſarca,</hi> which is occaſioned by flegm ſpread over the whole Body, is
eaſieſt cured of the three; but <hi>Aſcites</hi> and <hi>Tympanites,</hi> with much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.
Notwithſtanding, I here promiſe that my Pills do very rarely fail
to give help in the moſt dangerous <hi>Dropſie;</hi> provided the Diſeaſe be within
the Power of Phyſick to remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That all the Symptoms afore-mentioned, are ſeldom in every one
that have theſe Diſeaſes at one and the ſame time (except thoſe in <hi>Dropſies)</hi>
but moſt are; and ſome have more, and ſome fewer of them.</p>

               <head>There remains now ſomething more to be ſaid of thoſe excellent Pills
afore-named; of which briefly thus.</head>
               <p>Two of the larger Boxes of them, price but ſix Shillings, are uſually
enough for perfect Cure of either of the aforeſaid Diſeaſes, except the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
be of very long continuance; and then the Perſon doth ſometimes take
a ſmall quantity more, to perfect the Cure.</p>
               <p>Theſe Pills are alſo of admirable uſe for ſuch as have the <hi>POX, Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea,</hi>
or <hi>Running of the Reins;</hi> and for ſuch as formerly have had either
of thoſe Diſeaſes, and ſuſpect an ill Cure, or dread a relapſe: and for ſuch
they are of good uſe, taken in the Spring, or Autumn, to carry off any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of the Malady that may be ſuſpected to remain.</p>
               <p>They are likewiſe one of the moſt ſure and ſpeedy Medicines in the World
againſt the <hi>Green-ſickneſs,</hi> and for ſuch young Women as want their month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Viſits. And (as I hinted before) have recovered many, who have been
brought even to the Grave with theſe Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>They are alſo of good uſe againſt Fits of the Mother, as likewiſe againſt
foulneſs, and other Diſtempers of the Womb, taking away the cauſes of
Barrenneſs.</p>
               <p>They free the Body from lumpiſh Melancholy humours, and revive droop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
Spirits even to a wonder, cure the Jaundies, and are a good Medicine
againſt heat and ſharpneſs of Urine</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:33374:4"/>
I ſhall add, That theſe Pills taken ſometimes to prevent Diſeaſes, or
more cloſely followed to cure, as need ſhall require, are a choice remedy for
all Families, eſpecially thoſe who inhabit near the Seas, ſuch (much more
than others) being liable to Obſtructions, Agues, the Scurvy, and many
other Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>They are alſo a precious Medicine for Mariners, and ſuch as uſe the seas,
to whom the Scurvy, and many other Diſeaſes, are very incident; partly
from bad Airs, Sea Fogs, ſudden Heats and Colds, much Salt Diet; and
ſometimes from exceſſive drinking of Foreign and unfrequented Liquors,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they are the more commodious for ſuch to take to Sea with
them, becauſe in the time of taking them, none is confined to keep in,
but every one may walk abroad at pleaſure (except the weather be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
ſharp, or the body very tender) for indeed they are ſo gentle, that
they are ſafely taken by all Perſons, from three Years Old, to the greateſt
Age; and at all times of the Year, even in the coldeſt or hotteſt Seaſons;
being ſo congruous to all Conſtitutions, as gently to wait Nature in her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates;
as is daily manifeſted by their ſundry and facile Operations: for in
ſome they gently move ſweat, in others much Urine, and in others they
operate effectually by Stool: and in ſome again, they work by ſweat,
Urine, and Stool. So that which way ſoever Nature is inclined to acquit
her ſelf, that very way they are ready to aſſiſt her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many more are the Vertues might truly be aſcribed to this Medicine;
but I ſhall only add, that it being taken ſome few times at Spring and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,
doth fortifie the Body againſt the aſſaults of moſt Diſeaſes; and it is
alſo found, by daily Experience, to free the Body from malignant humours,
and to reſiſt theſe Diſeaſe.</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> SC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RVY, <hi>the violent</hi> Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
Palſie, Falling-ſickneſs, Apoplexy, Lethargy, <hi>or ſleepy Diſeaſe,</hi> vertigo,
Dizzineſs, Frenzy, Madneſs, Catarrbs, <hi>or</hi> Defluctions, Aſthma, <hi>or</hi> Shortneſs
of breath, obſtructions of the Liver, Spleen <hi>and</hi> Meſentery, Agues, Quotidian,
Iertian, <hi>or</hi> Quartan, Foulneſs <hi>and Diſtempers of the</hi> Womb, Pain, and foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Stomach, <hi>putrefaction of</hi> Humors, Kings-Evil, Leproſie, Mange,
Scurf, Running Pain, Stitches, Convulſions, Gout, Sciatica, Cholicks, Stone,
Looſneſs, Fluxes, Excoriation <hi>of the</hi> Inteſtines, or Griping in the Guts, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits,
<hi>loſs of</hi> Appetite, Vomiting, <hi>&amp;c. purges groſs</hi> Tartarous humours <hi>from the
Body, thereby preventing the</hi> Gout, <hi>alſo ſweetning and purifying the whole
Maſs of Blood,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And know that it doth not only prevent theſe Diſeaſes, but doth alſo
cure the moſt of them: And, in a word, is a ſignificant and moſt Noble
Medicine againſt moſt curable Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>I ſhall alſo add, that theſe Pills do wonderfully remedy a Stinking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breath,
if the cauſe be not in the Teeth. They are likewiſe a ſingular good
remedy againſt thoſe Painful, Watery Flegmatick, or Cholerick Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33374:4"/>
incident to the Good-fellow, after drinking much, and ſitting up
late at night. Alſo the Pills being taken, to the number of Three, Four,
or Five, as the body is able, the next morning after hard drinking (and
the perſon to lie in bed two or three hours after taking them, or until they
work) do prevent <hi>Surfeits, Fevers, Gouts, Palſies, Dropſies,</hi> &amp;c. which are
often the effects of too much Wine, or ſtrong Liquors.</p>

               <p>I ſhall now inſert the Names and dwellings of ſome few <hi>(of the great</hi>
number that I might) who have been reſtored by my Pills, out of many
dangerous Diſtempers, after all other Medicines haue failed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Harding</hi> of <hi>Linnington</hi> near <hi>Warwick,</hi> being near Eighty years
of age, had been a long time troubled with a dangerous Scurvy and
Dropſie, being ſwelled as much as his skin could hold, in his feet, legs,
thighs, belly, privities, breaſt, arms, hands and head, ſo that he was
not able to ſtir out of his bed, was with ſix ſhillings worth of my Pills per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Hinton,</hi> Living near the Cock, towards the upper end of
<hi>Leather-Lane,</hi> being brought into ſuch a low and dangerous condition with
Griping in the Guts, as there was very little hopes of life, was, however,
by a Friend of his adviſed to my Pills, as the only Medicine to be hoped
in for his Recovery; whereupon he freely took them, and was thereby in
a very few days perfectly recovered.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Joſeph Seidon,</hi> Woodmonger on <hi>Mill-bank, Weſtminſter,</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
afflicted with a dangerous <hi>Dropſie,</hi> inſomuch that the print of
a ſinger would have continued a long time in his fleſh; and in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(by a ſad accident) was thruſt into the body with a Sword, and bled
much inwardly: his wounds alone were judged ſo dangerous, that moſt
gave him over for a dead man; and yet ſome perſwaded him after all to
try what my Pills would do for him, which he willingly aſſented to: And
their effects were indeed moſt wonderful, for they brought from him all the
<hi>Coagulated,</hi> or hardned blood, which was judged before would very much
haſten his death; they cauſed his wounds quickly to heal, and perfectly
cured this <hi>Dropſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> the Wife of <hi>Dennis Barnard</hi> of <hi>Butleigh</hi> in the County of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,</hi>
having been above three years troubled with a violent tormenting
pain in the left ſide of her Stomach, but more eſpecially after eating or
drinking (when, it was her conſtant uſe to tumble her ſelf on the ground,
in hopes of eaſe thereby) had the advice of many Phyſitians, and took
many Medicines they preſcribed her; but found no eaſe at all: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought exceeding low, even to the gates of death, almoſt deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

upon a Box of them was bought for her, at <hi>Yeovil</hi> in the ſaid County:
ſhe took of them as many and as oft as her body was able to bear, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33374:5"/>
they brought from her by Stool many hundreds of living Worms, of
ſtrange ſhapes; ſome about an inch in length, ſome longer, and headed like
Eels. At laſt they brought from her ſomewhat like a bag; which was
judged to be that wherein the Worms had lain. The woman upon this
recovered perfect health, look't freſh and well, and became as able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her buſineſs as in all her life; ſhe being at that time Fifty years of Age.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Griſet, of Rockshal</hi> near <hi>Warwick</hi> having been a long time ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and withal being much troubled with the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> had ſpots of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
colours on her legs, and ſuch violent pains in her joynts, that ſhe was
hardly able to go: This Gentlewoman was perfectly cured with Fifteen

               <p>
                  <hi>Matthew Griſet</hi> of <hi>Rockshal</hi> above named, being very far gone with the
<hi>Scurvy,</hi> and full of blew ſpots, and knotted in his joynts, had many great
breakings out on his body; all which with nine ſhillings worth of my Pills,
were perfectly cured.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Samuel Hookey,</hi> of <hi>Thrupe</hi> near <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> being
for a long time exceeding ſick and weak, and judged by all to be far gone

               <p>Mr. <hi>John Hall</hi> of <hi>Stowmarket</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> being extreamly afflicted with

               <p>The Wife of <hi>John Roper</hi> of <hi>Southover,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Tolpidele</hi> in
<hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> was exceedingly troubled for the ſpace of eight years with
the <hi>Scurvy</hi> and <hi>Dropſie,</hi> her legs being full of purple, red and yellow ſpots,
and ſo ſwelled, that they were ready to burſt; and ſhe was often ſo full
of pain in them, that ſhe could not go, but upon her hands and knees; ſhe
was lifted into, and out of her bed: and after the trial of all likely means
that could be heard of for her Cure proved ſucceſſeſs, ſhe had perfect help
by the uſe of my Pill, which made her ſo well, that ſhe could travel on
Foot nine or ten miles in one day, being then Fifty years of age.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Edmonds</hi> of <hi>Arundel</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> being extreamly afflicted with
the Scurvy, inſomuch that himſelf and others concluded it would in a

               <p>Mr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> of the Bank, within two miles of <hi>Sheffield</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> was

               <p>Mr. <hi>John Johnſon,</hi> ſervant to Mr. <hi>Thomas Forth,</hi> Brewer in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s in the

was in that dangerous condition, that he lay Bed-rid 20 Weeks,

He was ſo far gone with a deſperate <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and <hi>Dropſie,</hi> that he had quite

Pills, ſaying they were the ſafeſt &amp; only Remedy for my Diſtemper that could
be, and that by the uſe of thoſe Pills he himſelf had obtained a perfect Cure:
Whereupon I being willing to try any thing, which might contribute to my
recovery, I preſently applyed my ſelf to the taking of them, which wrought ſo
effectually with me, that with leſs than four half Boxes, in ſix weeks time, I
received a perfect Cure, and was able to perform as good a days work as ever
I did in all my life, and at this time am, bleſſed be God, in good health and

deſpair of Life; but being adviſed to try my Pills as the likelieſt Medicine for
her cure, ſhe accordingly did take them, and with ſuch ſucceſs, through the

he accordingly did, and by his uſe of little above three ſhillings worth of
them, he received a perfect Cure, and in their operation or working with

                     <hi>SIR,</hi> It hath pleaſed God, by the uſe of your Pills, two marvelous great
Cures have been wrought in our Town: The one was upon <hi>Thomas La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
aged ſeventy four years, who was extreamly afflicted for the ſpace of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years, with great numbers of Worms in his Fundament, ſo that it is almoſt
incredible to ſay what vaſt numbers came from him, and he having been with
many Phyſicians for help, could get none, but was given over as incurable;
however, ſome that had experienced your Pills, adviſed him to try them, which
accordingly he did, and was perfectly cured with an eighteen penny Box of them.
The other Cure was on <hi>Henry Dibble,</hi> alſo of <hi>Darking,</hi> aged above ſixty years,
who was ſo far overrun with a violent Scuroy, that his Phyſicians gave him
over as paſt all hopes of Recovery, who, notwithſtanding, was perfectly cured
with taking one eighteen penny Box of your Pills. Theſe Cures were performed,
the firſt in the Year 1680. and the latter in the Year 1681. but I thought not
fit to give you any account of them, until they had continued ſome conſiderable
time free from theſe Diſtempers, that we might be aſſured their Cures were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and confirmed, which now we ſufficiently are, without the leaſt ſign of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe.

hands were very much ſwelled with great pain, and his Body in an high Feaver;
and much infected with the Yellow Jaundies. The firſt Doſe eaſed his hands

tormenting pains in her Stomach and Bowels, and many times in all her Limbs,
with great weakneſs in all parts of her Body, ſeeming to be in a Conſumptive
condition, very much loathing her meat, not being in a capacity to eat with her
Father and Mother at their Table in ſeveral years; much hath been ſpent upon
Phyſicians and in Phyſick for her Cure, but all in vain; and ſhe continuing in
this ſad condition from ſeven years old, to the age of ſeventeen years, cauſed her
Relations to deſpair of ever getting help for her, yet notwithſtanding all ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unlikelineſs of her recovery, ſhe is perfectly cured with taking thy Pills, and
hath continued in good health ever ſince laſt Spring: and this will be Teſtified
to any that ſhall enquire, by her Father and Mother, (who are Credible Perſons)
and who alſo deſired me to give thee this account: I might alſo enform thee of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

               <head>Directions for taking of my PILLS, are as followeth.</head>
               <p>I. PErſons of a middle ſtrength are to begin with taking three or four
Pills at Bed time, about three hours after a very light Supper (but no
Supper is better.) If three or four work not ſufficiently, add one every night,
until you take the Doſe that beſt agrees with your Body: take them two or
three nights one after another (or as ſtrength will allow) then forbear
them a night, (or two nights if the Patient be not ſtrong) then take them
again as before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Thoſe whoſe Bodies are weak, or that a little Phyſick will work with,
may begin with two Pills, taken after their firſt ſleep, or very early in the
morning faſting, and lie in bed an hour, (or two, or three hours) after them
if conveniently they can.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Note,</hi> If the Pills taken at bed-time uſually work much in the night,
it will in ſuch caſe be beſt to take them very early in the morning, and to lie
in bed 2 or 3 hours after taking them; or 2 or 3 Pills more or leſs, may
be taken at night, and as many in the morning, as ſtrength will allow.</p>
               <p>IV. Women with Child, and thoſe that give ſuch, ſhould begin with
taking but one or two Pills at moſt; and afterwards may take more, as
they find convenient.</p>
               <p>V. To children about three or four years old, give half or three quarters of
a Pill, to elder children give a Pill, 2 or 3, according to their age and ſtrength:
And by the way <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> there is no better Remedy in the world againſt Worms.</p>
               <p>VI. If the Patientbe thirſty; in time of the Pills working, he may drink
a draught or two of P<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>et drink, thin Broth, or ſuch Liquors as he beſt likes,
except in <hi>Dropſies,</hi> in which, 'tis beſt to drink the Liquor made as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(if coveniently to be had.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of the tops of</hi> Green-broom <hi>ſix handfuls, of</hi> Fumitary <hi>as much,
Garden</hi> Scurvy-graſs, <hi>Common</hi> Wormwood, <hi>of each three handfuls, all can,
Bark of</hi> Elder <hi>ten Ounces,</hi> Juniper-berries <hi>bruiſed, twelve Ounces,</hi> Anniſeeds
<hi>bruiſed, ſix ounces,</hi> Horſe-raddiſh Roots <hi>three ounces;</hi> Liquoriſh <hi>four ounces:
ſlice the Roots, put them into a thin Linnen or Hair Bag, and put them into five
gallons of ſtrong Ale: when it hath almoſt done working, then within a day or
two after, the Patient ſhould begin to drink thereof three draughts in a day:
but if he drink no other Liquor it will be the better, and let him ſometimes eat
a little candied or</hi> Green-ginger, <hi>and ſtill remember, beſides the drink to
take my Pills as before appointed.</hi> Theſe Directions obſerved, the Pills ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fail to remedy any curable. <hi>Dropſie,</hi> as hath been often proved. And
note, this Drink, with my Pills, is alſo of excellent uſe for ſuch as find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very far gone with the <hi>Scurvy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. Such as care not to ſwallow Pills alone, may take them in a little
of the pap of an Apple, ſtew'd Prunes, five or ſix ſpoonfuls of Beer, Ale, or
Wine; or they may be bruiſed or cut ſmall (which indeed is the beſt way
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33374:8"/>
if they be very hard by long keeping and taken with Honey, Sugar the pap
of an Apple, Beer, Ale, or Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. Againſt the <hi>Pox, Gonorrhaea,</hi> or <hi>Running of the Reins,</hi> let the Pills
be taken in the largeſt Doſe, yet not ſo, as much to weaken the Patient.</p>
               <p>IX. <hi>Note,</hi> My Pills ſometimes give an eaſie Vomit or two; that is
when the Doſe is large, the Stomach foul, or Nature much inclined that
way; which proves very well for the Patient: For they carry forth ſuch
Choletick, Flegmatick, and other noxious Excrements, as Nature could
not well avacuate any other way, and by that means often compleat the
Cure. And if in their working the Patient chance to be much ſtomach-ſick
(which ſeldom happens) then let him drink a glaſs of Sack or Whitewine;
or if Wine be too coſtly, a draught of ſtrong Ale warm'd; either
of which uſually gives ſpeedy eaſe.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I would have no miſtake, pray obſerve, That thoſe whoſe
Diſtempers are of long continuance, cannot in reaſon expect perfect Cure with three
or four times taking my <hi>Pills,</hi> ſuch ſhould therefore take them in a Doſe as large.
as they can conveniently bear, and continue them ten or fifteen days, or longer if need
require; omitting them a day or two ſometimes, as before directed, or as the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
               <p>And that my <hi>Pills</hi> may fully anſwer every ones expectation, I do adviſe all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that ſhall ſwallow them <hi>(whole)</hi> and not find them opperate by Stool or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ways by Sweat, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as may be expected from the number of <hi>Pills</hi>
taken, that they would afterwards cut or bruiſe them pretty ſmall, and ſo take
them in the Pap of an Apple, Honey, or ſtew'd Prune, or drink them in half a
dozen Spoonfuls of Ale, Beer, or what beſt like the Patient; which is a ſure
way to make them opperate to content; they being really not at all the worſe (but
only harder) though ſeven years old.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is alſo a piece of good Husbandry, (beſides it's great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in forwarding the Cure) to cut or bruiſe them; for four or five <hi>Pills</hi> ſo
taken will be to all intents and purpoſes as ſignificant as ſix or ſeven taken whole:
alſo to drink a good draught or two in the forenoon of Poſſet-drink, thin broth,
or Ale, will very much forward and quicken their operation.</p>
               <p>But withal you ſhould note, That when not only my <hi>Pills,</hi> but any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Medicine hath been taken three or four days immediately one after another,
there cannot be matter the third and fourth times to work on, as there was as there was at the
firſt and ſecond takings. And ſo is it alſo moſt true, that half ſo many Stools,
when they have been taken three or four days as above mentioned, are as ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
to the cure of a Diſtemper, as ſo many more were at firſt taking. Now theſe
things being but throwly conſidered, and my Directions rightly followed, I am
very confident that every rational mans expectations (in the uſe of my <hi>Pills)</hi> will
be fully anſwered: But for ſuch as will not follow. Directions in taking them, it
will be much better both for them and me, that they let my <hi>Pills</hi> quite alone.
and ſo I heartily deſire them to do.</p>

               <hi>FOR</hi> above 25 years paſt, that my Pills have been made publick, they have through the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of God been attended with admirable ſucceſs in caring moſt dangerous Diſeaſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to mankind, and thence hauing deſervingly gained an high eſteem and reputation, ſome
wicked perſons out of a deſign filthy lucre, have falſely pretended they have gotten a Receipt
of them; who wandring through the Countries, have offered at under rates a ſort of dangerous
Counterſeit Pills to ſale: theſe are therefore to requeſt all my correſpondents (for ſale of my Pills)
that if they can diſcouer any ſuch perſon or perſons as about-mentioned, they will give me ſpeedy
notice thereof, that I may proceed againſt them according to Law, all ſuch pretenders being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Impoſters or Cheats deſigning only to Couzen the Countrey.</p>
            <p>WHereas it hath of late been falſely given out by ſome Perſons, that M. Bromfield the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor
