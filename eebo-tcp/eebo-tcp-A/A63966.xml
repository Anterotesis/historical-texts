            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>NOthing can be plainer to any man that is but moderately vers'd in History, than that upon any Turn of Affairs, whoever has won or lost, or whatever Party is uppermost, the great Enemy of Mankind has some way or other advanced his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and got some plausible Argument for Atheism or Profaneness. And the reason of it is evident, for those who are in the Highest Stations, by a weakness incident to most, we might perhaps say, all of Mankind, are apt immediately to conclude themselves the Beloved of Heaven, and that Providence favours only them, as it did the Jews, to the neglect, if not detriment of the rest of the World. But no sooner is the Wheel turn'd; and either by the inscrutable Providence of God, or the Wickedness of Men, or their own Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Affairs, those who are uppermost thrown out of the Helm, to make room for the next set of Governours; when those who ascend, take the same Notions with their Predecessors; while such as are gotten under, with all whom Interest, or Guilt, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice more closely united to the former Administration, grow discontented and uneasie; and if their Designs and Expectations are more and more frustrated, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose and melancholy; The more devout among 'em will be sure to call whoever Suffer in opposition to the
<pb facs="tcp:40336:4"/>
established Government, Heroes and Martyrs; and be ever prophesying of some sudden turn, and visible appearance of Heaven to confound their Enemies. But the profane or hypocritical Party, which we may without breach of Charity suppose very large on all sides, very naturally run into the other extream: They'll fly out into frets and passions; and because God does not think fit to govern the World according to their Minds, impotently pronounce, That there is no God at all, That Religion's a meer Cheat, and Heaven and Hell but Priest-craft and Fable.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding the difference in opinion, and all sides arrogating as much as possible to themselves, there are yet hardly any Men to be found so senslesly scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, as to deny the differences of Right and Wrong, Good and Evil. That it hugely alters the Case to consider, whether opposition has been made against a lawful, or unlawful Power; whether the means be legal or no, or the Reasons sufficient to countervail all the mischiefs that may arise from such undertakings: Whether such as do it have any right, or concern to warrant their Actions; whether for or against, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or opposition to the Laws of Nature and Nations: VVhether those that suffer, meet with their misfortunes in the discharge of their Duty, or opposing others in theirs. Or if the Quarrel be Religion; VVhether that Religion on which it is grounded, be a false or a true one. And 'tis from the Examination of such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as these whence 'twill appear, whether they are Patriots or Rebels, stubborn Enthusiasts, or holy Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>Now as oft as the iniquity of the Times encourages Vice, and depresses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vertue; Raises those who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to be Slaves themselves, so they may but make

others so, and trample on others, while they are kick'd themselves; while it industriously opposes the very sparks of Ingenuity and Liberty, and takes off as fast as possible, either by Clandestine Plots, or open Cruelty, whoever dare be any braver, or better, or honester than their Neighbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs; while Providence all the while seems to nod, and sit an unconcerned Spectator of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage that's made in the VVorld; then there's no little danger, lest even those who are truly, though weakly religious and virtuous, should yet be hurried away in the stream of sour and melancholy Thoughts; be tempted to think with the <hi>Royal Prophet,</hi> that all things were carried <hi>caeco impetu,</hi> that they have cleansed their Heart in vain; and be almost ready with him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Generation of the righteous.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a question whether ever any Age in the VVorld gave more advantage and colour for these kind of Thoughts than this last, wherein we have had the sad experience of Debauchery and Villany rampant and triumphant, and to all appearance, most prosperous and happy; wherein 'twas much more dangerous either to be distinguishingly vertuous, or to forsake Villany, than to continue in one, and laugh at t'other; when so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Flower of our Nobility and Gentry, either lost their Lives or Estates, or Liberties, or Country; whilst a Crew of Parasites triumphed and fluttered in their Ruins. To see a <hi>Russel</hi> die meanly and ignobly in the Flower of his Age; an <hi>Essex</hi> or a <hi>Godfrey</hi> sacrified to the insatiable ambition and revenge of their Enemies, who yet not content with their Lives, would like the <hi>Italian,</hi> stab on after Death; and tho' they could not reach their Souls, endeavour to damn their Memories. These, and too many other such melancholy Instances would be ready to make a short-sighted Man

exclaim with <hi>Hercules</hi> in the <hi>Tragoedian,</hi> That Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is but an empty Name, or at least could only serve to make its Owners more sensibly unhappy.</p>
                  <p>But altho' such Examples might a little work on a weaker Vertue; that which is more confirmed and solid can more easily resist it. 'Tis not impatient nor uneasie, but still beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It considers any Riddles in Providence as a curious piece of Opticks, which, if judged of either before 'tis finished, or by pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>VVho almost could have imagined, without some such Reflections as these, that those brave Men we have seen for some years past pick'd out, and cut off one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with as much Scandal and Obloquy as cou'd be thrown upon 'em by the ungenerous Malice of their Enemies; when the very attempt to clear their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation has been made almost Capital, and involved those who had courage enough to attempt it in little less mischief than what they themselves endured: That over these <hi>Phoenixes</hi> should rise again, and flourish in their Ashes! That so many great Pens should already have done some of 'em Justice, and the VVorld as much to all the rest! And with how much more Joy, if'twere possible, would those Heroes have received their Crowns, could they have foreseen their Deaths wou'd have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so far to work up the Nation to such a just resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as wou'd at last have so great an Influence, as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40336:5"/>But since we have yet no form'd History of all those who have suffer'd under the Cruelty and Injustice, not to use so harsh a word as Tyranny, of late years; since such a design may be of no little use, both to show what our former Discords have cost us, and to vindicate the memories of the Sufferers, as well from the malice of their Enemies, as hasty kindn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For such Reasons as these this VVork is undertaken, which, if it deserves the acceptance of the Reader, no doubt will find it; there being few good Books written which have not been favourably received in the VVorld.</p>
                  <p>If any be so weak to object, that the Subjects of this History are ill match'd, some of 'em being of one Communion, and some of another: It might be enough to send 'em to <hi>Fox</hi>'s Martyrology for an Answer (tho' some few years since 'tis granted this Objection wou'd have look'd more dreadful) wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Kindness and Gratitude of the Courts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> made no distinction between 'em; nay, not so much as to eat either of them last, but as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on served, took one or t'other. <hi>Fas est ab hoste</hi>—and since they made no difference in their Deaths, altho' they endeavour'd it as much as possible in their Lives; since there's no doubt there's none betwixt 'em now, but they all agree in Heaven: I see no Reason why any Party should envy the other that Glory, which for suffering in the same Cause, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:40336:6"/>There has been formerly some Discourse about Town of a weak or malicious Design a-foot, to publish an History of Persecutions, and charge it on one particular Party of Protestants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as such a thing wou'd be most pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Common Cause, so God knows, if it should go round, it would be endless. This design is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as 'its hoped its effects will be. 'Tis to lay the Fault where it ought to be, and make those Friends, who have been too long impos'd upon, almost to each others Ruine.</p>
                  <p>Others may be offended with the Title of Martyrs and Martyrdom, which so often occurs in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papers; both because some of those concerned were accused for Plots against the Government, and others were in actual Arms. But 'tis possible for a Person at the same time to be a Church and State Martyr. <hi>Naboth</hi>'s accusation was for speaking blasphemous VVords against God and the King. The Apostles of our Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Christians afterwards, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused as those who turned the VVorld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upside down, and Enemies of the Empire. These Answers, 'tis own'd, may be accommodated to any Party, being general things; but in the Body of the Discourse we hope to fix 'em, and to prove in particular of the Persons mention'd, that they deserv'd that great Name, both on account of the Cause, and their dying so unjustly, many ways, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the VVestern Martyrs, we intend a distinct account of 'em at the beginning of those Transactions.</p>

at least one Instance, vicious habits, and ill Life of those whom we give that high Character. But if little Failures if Heats and Weaknesses were any valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objection against the Worth or Honesty of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, 'twould be impossible to make any tolerable defence even for many of those great Men, who were the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Instruments of our Reformation: Tho it may seen an excuse dull and common, yet there's none who does not find it nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For such as liv'd ill, if there is more than one instance, this certainly will be sufficient, that they dy'd well, and gave all the tokens of a hearty repentance for their not having liv'd up to so good a Profession.</p>
                  <p>Let us then do 'em Justice now they are dead, who so nobly defended the Cause of our holy Religion while they were living, and at last so freely and joyfully at their Death, seal'd it with their dearest Blood. If in any accounts met with here, some Persons shou'd find some particular Words or Phrases not so usual with 'em, let 'em not be so weak or unjust to condemn them as Cant or Nonsense. What reason is there why every Man should not express himself in that way which likes him best, and with which he has been more acquainted? And what matters it, if I'm discours'd to in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> or <hi>London</hi> Dialect, so I talk with an honest Man, and our Sentiments agree, tho' our words may a little differ?

                     <head>Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HAD the Person who wrote that Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Libel upon Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> which he calls <hi>The Mystery of his Death,</hi> but always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd himself to as much Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as we meet with in the very first Lines of his Preface to it, he might have gone both through the World, and out of it with more Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than now he is like to do—[<hi>There will</hi> (saith he) <hi>be a time when Truth shall be believed, and the Witnesses of it justified.</hi>] But notwithstanding all his boasted Sagacity in winding Alterations at such a distance, we may safely affirm, that when he writ that Sentence, he little thought 'twould ever have been apply'd in this manner— That <hi>Truth</hi> would come to life again after all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40336:9"/>
the care he had taken to stifle it, and the highest Judicatures in the Nation in one day remove all the black dirt which so many years he had been throwing on its <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and in so Publick and authentick a manner <hi>justifie</hi> 'em again. 'Twas in the heat of those Mischiefs and Miseries which all thinking men cou'd long before easily foresee wou'd be the Consequences of such Notions as he broached, and were too greedily swallow'd, that he publish'd the book before mentioned, at such at time when he knew 'twas in one sense <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable,</hi> wherein he pretends both to confound all the Evidence given in before the Parliament, and Publick Courts of Justice for Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>'s being murthered with Papists; and over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove—That he was a self-murtherer—No better than a second running him through with his own Sword after his Death. 'Tis some plausible insinuations he has there heapt together which will make it necessary to be a little larger on him than those who came after; especially since he <hi>led the way</hi> both to the Sufferings of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and Malice of their Enemies.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey</hi> was born of a good Family; his Relations are sufficiently known, and as justly respected in the City of <hi>London:</hi> But 'tis not the intention of this Piece to write the Lives, but the Deaths of those who are the Subjects of it; at least no more of one than is requisite for describing the other.—The occasion of his Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is reported to be the good Service he did in giving Directions for quenching a Fire which happend some years past at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; which Honour the then Duke of <hi>York</hi> obtain'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40336:9"/>
for him, having been under a great Consternation at the apprehension of the danger. This very probably might be the beginning of his so great <hi>Intimacy</hi> with the Papists, which Sir <hi>Roger</hi> so often hints in his History, and which afterwards cost him so dearly.</p>
                     <p>He was a Person of known Vertues—For the Instances of his <hi>secret Charity</hi> the World is oblig'd to that Reverend and Learned Person who preach'd his Funeral Sermon. For his <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> even his worst Enemy here gives us se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Instances thereof; that particularly, when after those Prophetick bodings of his approaching Martyrdom, he took care to settle all things, and adjust Accompts exactly, and even in Parish Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to right such as he thought had formerly been injur'd. Lastly, how vigilant and careful he was in the Execution of that Office the Law had intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him with, his Death, as well as his Life may testifie—One thing cannot, without great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to his Memory, be omitted—'Tis his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Conduct and Courage in the time of the Plague in this City, whence he never stir'd all the while it rag'd so dreadfully; but reliev'd the Poor, and fed them daily with his own hands: Nor did he neglect Justice while he was exercising Mercy, but to the amazement, and almost terrour of the Beholders, pursu'd a Malefactor, who had taken Sanctuary in a Pesthouse, thinking none wou'd be so desperate as to follow him, and with his own hands fetch'd him thence, when the other Officers dar'd not venture after him.</p>
                     <p>'Twas either his Acquaintance among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, before intimated, and hence his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40336:10"/>
better known by those who were of that Party, or his industry and indefatigable care in the Discharge of his Office, or both, to which we may rationally attribute the addressing of the first Discovery of the Popish Plot to him, rather than any other.</p>
                     <p>The clearest Method for the Description of his Martyrdom, will be first to enquire into the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it and then the Manner, Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Authors; and lastly the several Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have been used to clear the Papists of that indelible Guilt which sticks upon 'em from so horrid a Villany.</p>
                     <p>For the Occasion of his Martyrdom, what was said in the Summing up the Evidence concerning him, but modestly and on supposition only, we may yet venture to affirm positively—<hi>This Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Magistrate was certainly murder'd—because he was a Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>estant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the particular and special Reasons were these following:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He had taken Examinations about the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Plot, and those not only (as the Attorny Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral said in the Trial of the Assassines) <hi>perhaps,</hi> but <hi>undoubtedly</hi> more than are now extant. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> addressed himself to him with his Depositions—he had taken them, and enquired something close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Design, as his manner was in any thing which belong'd to his Office. This the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists very well knew, and therefore found it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be rid of a troublesome busie man, who now he was engaged in the business, was likely to pierce to the bottom on't—and he being once out of the way, the Evidence might very easily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40336:10"/>
have been dispos'd of to their satisfaction</p>
                     <p>But here those, whose Interest 'tis to get clear of such a Charge, object very pertly—<hi>What need, or what advantage in taking off a Justice, when the same things were deposed in other places?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Reason or Occasion for this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will easily answer that Objection. They not only bore him Malice for what he had already done in <hi>Oates</hi>'s case, and might probably be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of those secret Passages transacted before King and Council in relation to <hi>Oates</hi>'s Depositions, —but were sensible of a deeper Reason than all this, and which brought them into more danger than the other.</p>
                     <p>See it in the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Trial, <hi>p.</hi> 22. and 24. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had received a Letter the very night on which this Gentleman was martyr'd (of which more anon) with these words in't—[<hi>This Night Sir</hi> E.B.G. <hi>is dispatch'd.</hi>]— This came from the Papists to <hi>Ewers</hi> a Popish Priest at my Lord <hi>Aston</hi>'s, who after he had read it communicated the good News to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> telling him <hi>One of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies was taken out of the way.</hi> — He being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know how things went, ask'd <hi>what was the Reason they took away his Life? Ewers</hi> tells him — <hi>There was a Message sent to Mr.</hi> Coleman, <hi>when in</hi> Newgate, <hi>to desire him that he wou'd not reveal any thing of the Plot; which Message came from the Duke of</hi> York.— To which <hi>Coleman</hi> replyed — <hi>What was he the nearer — for he had been so foolish as to reveal all to Sir</hi> E.B.G. <hi>already</hi>? But upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of <hi>Oates</hi> before Sir <hi>E.B.G.</hi> he was afraid he would come in as Evidence against him, having shewn himself eager in the business.—To which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40336:11"/>
the Duke of <hi>York</hi> sent word again, — <hi>If he wou'd take care not to reveal, but conceal it, Sir</hi> E.B.G. <hi>shou'd not come in against him.</hi>—And the next news was—that he was <hi>dispatch'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this effectually takes off the former Cavil; —and this S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r <hi>Roger</hi> cou'd not but be sensible of; and concluding so unanswerably against wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t he built so much upon, e'ne lets it fairly drop. and mentions not a syllable of it in all his Book— Which Evidence of Mr. <hi>Dugdales</hi> is beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction confirm'd by several hints unluckily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s own Depositions—<hi>pa.</hi> 187. where Mr. <hi>Wynnel</hi> deposes Sir <hi>E.</hi> told him— <hi>Coleman wou'd dye</hi>—and mention'd <hi>Consults about a Toleration</hi>—Adding further—<hi>That he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of a</hi> dangerous secret <hi>that wou'd be fatal to him.</hi> —Hence nothing can be plainer to any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, than that Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was acquainted with Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> as well as Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and knew even the <hi>minute Circumstances</hi> in those Letters which afterwards were brought against him and stood in fear of his Life for that very Reason, as for the same he afterwards lost it.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Manner</hi> of his Death, those who were Accomplices therein shou'd best know it; and the Objections against their Evidence the Reader may find clear'd, if he'll take the pains to look a little lower —After the poor Gentleman had seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days been dog'd by the Papists, as Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> unanimously swear, and which he as good as acknowledged to Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binson,</hi> as appears on the Trial of his Murtherers, they at last accomplish'd their wicked design on <hi>Saturday, Octob.</hi> 12. 1678. and under a pretence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40336:11"/>
of a Quarrel, which they knew his Care for the publick Peace wou'd oblige him to prevent, about Nine at night, as he was going home, got him into the <hi>Water-gate</hi> at <hi>Somerset-House.</hi> When he was thus trapan'd in, and got out of hearing from the Street, toward the lower end of the Yard, <hi>Green,</hi> one of the Assassines, threw a twisted <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief</hi> round his Neck, and drew him behind the Rails,—which, notwithstanding his age and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, are objected against its probability; taking him thus at a surprize, and in the dark, 'twas ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie for him to do, especially three or four more of 'em immediately falling in to assist him, there they throtled him; and lest that shou'd not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, punch'd and kickt him on the Breast, as sufficiently appear'd when his Body was found, by the marks upon it; and lest he shou'd not be yet dead enough, another of 'em, <hi>Girald,</hi> or, as I find him called in other places, <hi>Fitz-Girald,</hi> wou'd have run him through, but was hindered by the rest, lest the Blood shou'd have discover'd 'em: But <hi>Green,</hi> to make sure work, wrung his Neck round, as 'twas found afterwards on the inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Surgeons.</p>
                     <p>For the disposal of the Body, they all carried it up into a little Chamber of <hi>Hills,</hi> another of the Murtherers, who had been, or was Dr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>'s man, where it lay till <hi>Monday</hi> night, when they remov'd it into another Room, and thence back again 'till <hi>Wednesday,</hi> when they carried him out in a Sedan about Twelve a clock, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon a Horse, with <hi>Hill</hi> behind him, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, till they got to <hi>Primrose-Hill,</hi> or as some say 'tis call'd, <hi>Green-Bury-Hill,</hi> near a Publick
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40336:12"/>
House, call'd the <hi>White house,</hi> and there threw him into a Ditch, with his Gloves and Cane on the Bank near him, and his own Sword run through him, on purpose to perswade the world he had kill'd himself. Very politickly making choice of a place to lay him where they might both think he wou'd be sometime conceal'd, and near where he had been seen walking the same day, if the Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davits to this purpose in Sir <hi>R</hi>'s Book may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon.</p>
                     <p>All this Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs upon the Trial of his Murtherers, with whom he acknowledges he had several Consults before at the <hi>Plow</hi> Alehouse, and other places, concerning it. Whose Evidence is confirm'd, not only by innumerable other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, but Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Confession, who was to have been present at the Action, had not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of Conscience hinder'd him, having been engag'd by the Conspirators for a great Reward, and was afterwards to have a considerable part of it for carrying off the Body, which he swears he saw in the very Room whither <hi>Prance</hi> says 'twas remov'd on the <hi>Monday</hi> night.—But even here too he fail'd 'em—So 'twas done without his Assistance in the manner before described.</p>
                     <p>And very sure, no doubt, the great Plotters thought they had now made their Business: for we are not to fancy these little Villains attempted such an Action of their own impulse; the great Spring we had before in <hi>Dugdales</hi> Story of <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> from whence those large Sums must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed which <hi>Bedlow</hi> mentions. Now, I say, they thought the Business was as sure as the Jews had made the Sepulchre—having seal'd all the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40336:12"/>
mouths of the Parties concern'd, with Oaths and Sacraments, Solemnities commonly abus'd by their Party to the foulest Villanies.—But neither that, nor the darkness of the night, nor the distance of places, cou'd hinder the Divine Justice from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through and discovering the Villains concern'd, and bringing 'em to Punishments worthy their Wickedness —The manner thus,—His Body being found by some who accidentally walk'd that way, and generally suspected from his former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and many probabilities; that he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by the Papists, the King issued out a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with a promise of Indempnity and 500 <hi>l.</hi> reward to any who wou'd discover it. On this Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> writ a Letter to the Secretary from the Country, concerning his Knowledge of something considerable in that matter; and being sent for up to Town, reveal'd whate're he knew of the Business. And a little after, <hi>Prance</hi> being acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally seiz'd by a Constable, and then in the House of Lords <hi>Lobby,</hi> was known by Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> having seen his Face on that <hi>Monday</hi> night, when at the same time they saw the Body; —who on Examination discover'd also what his share was in the Murther: And tho' he afterwards denied it, for fear of losing his Trade, and such other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as he himself confest, yet in a quarter of an hour he returned again to his first Evidence.</p>
                     <p>But the most difficult Task will be what yet remains—the clearing those Objections, and some of 'em plausible ones, and which have led away too many well-meaning men, against the Truth of this recited Evidence; as well as some Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions spread abroad, and made the most of to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40336:13"/>
perswade the World this worthy Gentleman was guilty of his own Death.</p>
                     <p>But here it can't be expected that a private Person, who has not the advantages of Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> to have Warrants from two K's and all Persons and Papers before him relating to that Business, and who had Wit great, and Honesty little enough to pick out, and leave in what was for his turn; that such an one shou'd be able to go through so many hundred pages as his Book consists of, and answer every Particular therein. 'Twill be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction enough to any rational man, to touch some of the Plots and Fetches made use of from one time to another to wash the Blackamoor white, and clear the Papists from this Villany: To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the main Objections against the Evidence, and bring some corroborating Circumstances for the truth on't. And lastly, To shew Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> cou'd not murther himself in that place and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is pretended.</p>
                     <p>The first of the Methods they used to sham off this Murther, was by early Reports they spread about, even before his Body was found, That he had <hi>kill'd himself.</hi> Now this Sir <hi>Roger</hi> himself can scarce have Brow enough to affirm was done by the Brothers to save the Estate; since 'twas a very odd way certainly to do that, by letting the World openly know that he was a Self-murtherer. That such Reports were spread we shall by and by prove, and that from Sir <hi>Roger</hi>'s own Book, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trouble of consulting the Paper-Office,— and who got by't, who shou'd do't, whose Interest was't to do't but the Papists, altho' the particular Authors may be unknown?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40336:13"/>Among the many Evidences of his Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known at so many distant places before 'twas publick here, there are two come up exactly to the matter in hand. The first—which was recited by the Reverend Dean of <hi>Bangor,</hi> now Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> in his Funeral Sermon, and which it seems he had of one Mr. <hi>Angus</hi> — who the same day Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was found about Five a clock on <hi>Primrose-Hill,</hi> being in Mr. <hi>Chiswell</hi>'s Shop in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard about One or Two, there was a Person unknown to him past by, and clapping him on the shoulder, ask'd him [<hi>If he heard the News that Sir</hi> E.B.G. <hi>was found dead, with his own Sword run through him.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>The second is of Mr. <hi>Goldsborough,</hi> Clerk of the House of Commons, who being in a Barber's Shop on <hi>Tuesday</hi> morning, while he was missing, a person came in open-mouth'd [<hi>That Sir</hi> E. B. G. <hi>was found</hi>;] and being ask'd where, reply'd, [<hi>He had kill'd himself upon</hi> Primrose-Hill;] where, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Thursday</hi> following in the evening the Body was indeed discover'd.</p>
                     <p>The second considerable Attempt made the same way, was by one <hi>Magrath</hi> an Irishman, the famous <hi>Celiers,</hi> who foretold both the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and a great many more after him; the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and others, who pretended to prove Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> hang'd himself, and his Clerk <hi>Moor</hi> cut him down—But being examin'd at the Council-Board, it prov'd only a malicious and false Contrivance.</p>
                     <p>'Twill be very well worth the while, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that Mrs. <hi>Mary Gibbons</hi> was one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons deeply engaged in this design among so much
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40336:14"/>

                     <p>When this Contrivance was found out by all the World to be as very a Sham as <hi>Celiers</hi> being with Child in <hi>Newgate,</hi> or some Body else in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, yet was not the indefatigable Zeal of that Party discouraged; but Mr. <hi>Farewell,</hi> a person intrusted in managing the Estates and Lands of the Jesuits; and <hi>Pain,</hi> Brother to the famous <hi>Pain</hi> who wrote St. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Elegy, set a new Project on foot to the same purpose in some Letters sent to <hi>Prance,</hi> and printed by <hi>N.

                     <p>It may be urg'd on, Here are several Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Trial of the Murtherers, and since, that invalidate the Evidence there given,—<hi>Warner</hi> and his Wife and Maid about <hi>Green—That he was at home all that Evening when he was accused for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it.</hi> —'Twou'd be enough to oppose to this their Confession to Captain <hi>Richardson— That they cou'd do him no good.</hi>—But besides this, Mr. Justice <hi>Dolbin's</hi> Observation on the Trial clears it effectually—<hi>They swore to the</hi> Saturday <hi>fortnight after</hi> Michaelmas <hi>day, which was,</hi> says the Justice, <hi>the</hi> 19<hi>th of</hi> Octob. <hi>not the</hi> 12<hi>th. on which the Murther was committed.</hi>

                     <p>But the home thrust is—[<hi>The Centinels saw no Sedan carried out</hi>—] This the printed Trial easily sets right. The Centinels were <hi>Trollop</hi> and <hi>Wright.

                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40336:16"/>The first of these from Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>'s own mouth, which has been already hinted, but shall here be farther clear'd.</p>
                     <p>'Twas indeed so notorious, that Sir <hi>E.G.B</hi> had boding thoughts, and a sort of a Prophetical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of his Death, and that by the Papists; and discours'd of so publickly and generally, that Sir <hi>Roger</hi> cou'd not deny all the Matter of Fact, but endeavours to avoid the force on't; when he says, as is witnessed by several—[<hi>On my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science I shall be the first Martyr</hi>—] This he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets —[<hi>I doubt I shan't live long.</hi>] —Sure, though he says in one place, <hi>The Man was no Fool</hi>; yet he must be supposed to be no better, any more than all the Readers, if neither he nor they made any difference between being hang'd and martyr'd. But the very reason of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nterpretation was for what Sir <hi>R.</hi> dearly loved—that he might have opportunity for a Reflection on the Parliament— <hi>He fear'd,</hi> says he, <hi>that the Parliament wou'd call him to account, and that nothing wou'd satisfie 'em but his Life for not discovering it sooner.</hi>— In oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to this, any impartial man need but consider what follows. Esquire <hi>Robinson,</hi> on the Trial of the Murderers, witnesses that he had a Discourse with Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> a little while before his Death about the Plot then newly talkt on— Says <hi>Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son —I wish the depth of the Matter be found out.</hi>— Sir <hi>E.</hi> answers, —<hi>I'm afraid it is not.—Vpon any Conscience I believe I shall be the first Martyr.</hi>— He acknowledged he had taken several Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about it, but thought he shou'd have little Thanks for his pains. The Esquire askt him— <hi>Are you afraid? [No,</hi> said he, <hi>I do not fear 'em,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40336:16"/>
if they come fairly; and I shan't part with my Life tamely.</hi>] Well, Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> Is all this the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Was he afraid the Parliament wou'd send a Party to dog him, and set upon him? and that he did not fear the Parliament, but if they came fairly, would not part with his Life tamely?— No; any Man that has but half an eye, unless that too blinded with Prejudice, may see the meaning on't; and that he apprehended danger onely from the Papists, against whom he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken several Examinations.</p>
                     <p>The next is of <hi>John Wilson</hi> the Sadler, who Swears, Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> talking with one Mr. <hi>Harris,</hi> then told this Informant, [<hi>That he was in danger for what he acted for the Discovering of the late Plot against his Majesty.</hi>] See how ingeniously this is answer'd—[<hi>His apprehension was from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, not the Papists; and for</hi> Concealing, <hi>not</hi> Discovering <hi>the Plot.</hi>] These very words Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> has in his Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 281. Now whether this is not a direct <hi>Statuimus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Abrogamus,</hi> What Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> calls <hi>Discovering,</hi> for Sir <hi>R.</hi> who knows his Mind better, now he's dead, than he himself did while alive, to tell us he means <hi>Concealing,</hi> which is quite contrary— and how fair a way of answer 'tis, let any of his best Friends be Judges.</p>
                     <p>Twou'd be tedious to bring any more, when this does effectually as to his own Judgment. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis remarkable, that these very things are Sworn upon the Trial by Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi>—that Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> had told him— [<hi>He had received Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts from great Persons for being so zealous in the Business—That he had been threatned— That he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40336:17"/>
went in fear of his Life from the Popish Party; and that he had been dog'd several days, —but fear'd 'em not if they came fairly to work.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>For other Evidences of his Murther by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, that which indeed made the greatest noise, was, his Death being heard of so far off, and in so many different places, before 'twas known in <hi>London.</hi> This Sir <hi>Roger</hi> tells us, <hi>was on purpose spread by the Brothers to throw it on the Papists:</hi> But here's this in opposition: <hi>Dugdale,</hi> against whom he makes no objection, but allows his Evidence; makes Oath in my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Trial, and other places, That this News was brought to one <hi>Ewers</hi> a Priest, in a Letter which he shew'd him, dated the very night 'twas done, —which had these words in't —[<hi>This very night Sir</hi> E. B. G. <hi>is dispatch'd.</hi>] Now I'd fain ask—Had these Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Correspondence with the Priest? wou'd they use such a word as that [<hi>Dispatch'd?</hi>—] Did they write to <hi>Ewers</hi> too, and bid him tell <hi>Dugdale,</hi> That this <hi>Sir</hi> E B.G. <hi>was a busie Man, and fit to be taken out of the way?</hi>— as <hi>Dugdale</hi> swears he did.— Cou'd <hi>Dugdale</hi> conspire with <hi>Oates</hi> so long before they knew one another; and while he was himself a Prisoner in <hi>Staffordshire</hi>; and were all those perjur'd who witness that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did report this before it cou'd be known by any but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conspirators?</p>
                     <p>That 'twas done in that very place, at <hi>Somerset-House,</hi> Providence has left strange Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The first is—<hi>Bury</hi> the Porter's refusing to admit any persons into the Gates about that time, the 12<hi>th,</hi> 13<hi>th,</hi> 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> Nay, that

he had deny'd the Prince himself admittance, (Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> I suppose it must be) and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Orders for so doing. But these Orders he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver produc'd.—And more like a true Papist, deny'd matter of Fact when charg'd with it; and tho' he had acknowledg'd to the Council he had never such Orders before, when Sir <hi>Thomas Strin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> came to witness it, positively deny'd it.</p>

Spence</hi> was a tall, black Man, much like Sir <hi>E. B.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40336:18"/>
enough of this— Let's now take notice of the next— 'Tis one <hi>John Okeley,</hi> who that very night, <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. going by <hi>Somerset-House,</hi> at the Water-gate about Nine a Clock, saw there Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> whom he knew very well, living in the same Lane with him—he past close by him, pull'd off his Hat to him, as Sir <hi>E.B.G.</hi> did to him again; —when past him, he turn'd about and look'd on him. And this he told to several persons, which witness the same.— To this, the main of what Sir <hi>R.</hi> objects is,— <hi>'Twas dark, and how shou'd he know him?</hi> Certainly, any one that knows <hi>London</hi> can't be ignorant that we have Lights in the Streets at Nine at night: and 'twas morally impossible that one who knew him so well, who look'd upon him, who put off his Hat to him, as he to him again, and who after all this look'd back upon him— that such a one shou'd be mistaken in the Person.</p>
                     <p>The last thing to be prov'd is—<hi>That Sir</hi> E.B.G. <hi>did not, and cou'd not murder himself in that place, as is pretended by his Enemies.</hi> He was first missing on <hi>Saturday,</hi> and therefore according to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, his Body must have been in the place where 'twas found till that <hi>Thur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>day</hi> night. But had it been there on <hi>Tuesday</hi> or <hi>Wednesday,</hi> the Pack of Hounds which hunted there, both of those days, must have found him. Sir <hi>Roger</hi> tells us.— <hi>They might have been on t'other side of the Ditch, or beat the place carelesly without finding it.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Faucet</hi>'s Deposition is,—<hi>That he beat that very place</hi>—which sure he was capable of knowing, having been himself there to see it after the Body was found. He repeats it, and says twice,—
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40336:18"/>
'Twas in <hi>that very place.</hi> And <hi>Harwood</hi> says as much, who hunted the day after.—One Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance there is, which makes this Evidence yet more conclusive. 'Twas depos'd in the Trial of <hi>Farewell,</hi> and several other places, that the Body stunk extreamly when 'twas found, which was but the next day after. Now I'd ask any unprejudic'd man, Whether was so much as possible that this very place shou'd be beat two days after one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Hounds not Scent the Body, even tho' the Hunters might perhaps over-see it?</p>
                     <p>But besides this, there was yet a narrower search made on another occasion in that same Field. The Story is told in a Paper, call'd, <hi>An Account of the Murther,</hi> publish'd by <hi>Thompson</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who, with another Printer, was present, and avouch'd the Matter of Fact on their own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 'Tis this—<hi>That while the Body lay at the</hi> White-house, <hi>and the Jury were about it, one of the Jury-men themselves declar'd,—That a servant of his Mother, a Butcher, and two Boys, made a very strict and narrow search in all parts of the Ground for a Calf that was lost there, and this both on</hi> Munday <hi>and</hi> Tuesday—<hi>and at that time there lay no dead Body, Belt, Gloves, or any thing else there.</hi>— But were all these too on the wrong side of the Hedge? or where did they look for this Calf? in the middle of the Field, or in the Ditches and Hedges? where 'twas impossible they cou'd have mist of the Body, had it been there.</p>
                     <p>There's one great Objection which Sir <hi>Roger</hi> makes very much of in this matter—tho' not quite so strong now as 'twas some years since; and that is—<hi>There was no Popish Plot at all, therefore no

However kindly 'twas meant, the Stroke here was not home enough, and Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> prov'd only a Confessor, tho' they intended him a Martyr. One wou'd have thought their ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in taking off one Justice of Peace, shou'd have cool'd their Fury a little, and hinder 'em from venturing upon another.— But this 'tis when men list themselves of a Religion where they must be given up to the Salleys and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a blind Zeal, and refuse the Conduct either of their Senses or Reason.</p>

                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:40336:22"/>Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> had been a vigorous Prosecutor of the Priests and Jesuits which sculkt about in his own County of <hi>Wales.</hi> This was a crime not to be forgiven, nor any ways attoned by less than his Destruction. In order to which he was assaulted by several Villains, fit for such a business, in a little dark Lane near the <hi>Temple,</hi> as he was passing through it pretty late in the Evening; and had no doubt dispatch'd him; and either found some way to make the World believe he had done it himself, as they wou'd have done in the former instance, or started some other Sham to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd the Odium from their own Party. But the Gentleman, having had apprehension of some such Accident, made better use of it than Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> before him; and having luckily a Sute of private Armour on, receiv'd several Stabs the Villains gave him, upon that, and so sav'd his life. But they finding their Attempts that way unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful, were resolv'd to take another course with him, and having got him down, with some despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate weapon or other fit for the purpose, made several Trials to cut his Throat, and gave him some dangerous wounds about that part; which while he was strugling with them to preserve, a Boy providentially goes by with a Light, which their Deeds of Darkness not being able to endure, they all ran away, and left Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> weltering in his Blood, who yet, by God's Providence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>NO Body can doubt but that 'twas now very much the Interest of the Papists to get off, if possible, that foul Imputation of a Plot which stuck so deep upon 'em; which had been confirm'd by Sir <hi>Edmond</hi>'s Murther, <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s never to be forgotten Letters, <hi>Arnold</hi>'s As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassination, and a great deal of Collateral Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which fell in unexpectedly, many of those who gave it being utterly unacquainted with the first Discoverers. After several unfortunate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts they had made to this purpose; after the <hi>Living</hi> had perjur'd themselves, and the <hi>Dying</hi> done worse, to support their desperate Cause; after Attempts to <hi>blast</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> some of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and <hi>buy off</hi> others of 'em, in both which, publick Justice took notice of, and punish'd 'em: being of a Religion that sticks at no Villany to serve an Interest, and certainly the most indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable and firm People in the World when they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40336:23"/>
set about any Design, especially where <hi>Diana</hi> is concern'd, not being yet discouraged, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to venture upon one Project more, which prov'd but too successful, to the loss of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest and best Blood in the Kingdom; and that was to Brand all those who were the steddiest Patriots, and so their greatest Enemies, of what Rank so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were, with the odious Character of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons disaffected to the Government,</hi> or, in the old Language, <hi>Enemies to</hi> Caesar: They pretended to perswade the World, that after all this great noise of a <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> 'twas onely a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> one lay at the bottom: This they had endeavour'd in the <hi>Meal-tub Intrigue,</hi> the Names of most of the worthy Persons in <hi>England</hi> being cull'd out to be sworn into it: But this miscarrying (like the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on't, Mrs. <hi>Celiers</hi> Miscarriage in <hi>Newgate</hi>) they had by this time taken breath, form'd new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and procur'd new Witnesses which might <hi>do business</hi> more effectually, and, tho' they cou'd not write nor spell their Names, and so were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well skill'd in <hi>Book-learning,</hi> yet at <hi>Buke-blaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> they were admirable; by which Character you may easily guess they were Irish-men. Nor did they want <hi>Fools</hi> to believe, any more than <hi>Knaves</hi> to manage this Design; by their continued unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Contrivances a great many <hi>easie,</hi> and some <hi>well-meaning</hi> People having by this time been wrought upon to believe almost as <hi>implicitly</hi> as they themselves, whatever the Priests wou'd have 'em. One thing, whatever happen'd, they were pretty sure of, That whether this Plot were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or no, they shou'd carry on their Intrigue by it: If 'twas, they had what they wish'd: If it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40336:23"/>
shou'd be discover'd, 'twou'd yet confound and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse Peoples minds, and make 'em so sick of Plot upon Plot, that it might make 'em almost stagger in their belief of the other. They had besides all this, a strong Party at Court to favour their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes. The King was the Duke's, and the Duke —all the World know who's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Twas necessary to flesh their Blood-hounds by degrees, to bring People on by little and little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to attempt some of inferiour Rank for a beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not split the Cause for want of good management. And who so fit as poor <hi>Colledge</hi> to be the first Victim of their Perjury and Malice; by whose Death, besides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rid of a troublesom Fellow, and breaking the Ice to make room for those to follow; they might also expect this advantage, That the <hi>middle sort</hi> of People wou'd be discourag'd in their just ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Popery and Papists, and prosecution of the Laws against them.</p>
                     <p>'Twas by such Methods as these that Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> began to signalize himself in the VVorld. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man of Courage, Industry, and Sharpness, he made it much of his Business to serve his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as far as possible, in searching after Priests and Jesuits, and hunting those Vermin out of their lurking Holes, in which he was very serviceable and successful, and for which, no doubt, they did not fail to <hi>remember</hi> him. The first time we meet with him in Publick, is, I think, in <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, where he's brought in for Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> as a Collateral Evidence. But by that time the VVind was a little upon turning, and the <hi>Tide</hi> of Popular Aversion not quite so strong against Popery, being by the cunning of our common Enemy diverted

into little Streams, and private Factions; and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power driving on, as the best way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the Designs of <hi>Rome</hi>; to which the <hi>City of London</hi> in a particular manner made a vigorous Resistance; which displeasing the grand <hi>Agitators,</hi> no wonder they endeavour'd, as much as possible, to do it a mischief; their kindness to it having been sufficiently experienced in 66. and even since, In order to which, the K. was pleas'd, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his <hi>Ghostly Brother,</hi> to alter the common and almost constant course of Parliaments, and call one at <hi>Oxford</hi> instead of <hi>London.</hi> Many of the Members whereof, and especiall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And more ground of Suspicion they had, because, as <hi>Colledge</hi> protests in his Speech, there had been Affidavits judiciously made of a <hi>form'd Design</hi> against 'em, being besides remov'd away from the City of <hi>London,</hi> which had always so much of the English Blood in't, as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to love Parliaments, and for that reason wou'd have ventur'd all for their defence. From these, and such like Reasons 'twas, that several of the Parliament men went accompanied with some of their Friends, well arm'd and accoutred, to <hi>Oxford,</hi> of which number this Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> was one, he waiting on my Lord <hi>Clare, Paget,</hi> and <hi>Huntington</hi> to <hi>Oxford</hi>; where the Parliament, foreseeing what has since happen'd, wou'd have

gone on where they left off in former Sessions, which, causing great Heats, every body knows how abruptly they were dissolv'd not long after their meeting. 'Twas now grown the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every Coffee-House, and the Subject of every <hi>Buffoons</hi> Pamphlet to expose and vilifie <hi>Parliaments</hi> as much as possible, and the very name of it was now grown as odious to some men, as that of Protestant. Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> had, besides all his other forementioned Crimes, been, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in his Speech, a great Honourer of that august Assembly, and had been in former Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons engaged by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>All these Reasons together were more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to get him taken out of the way; and for the performance thereof, <hi>Heins, Macnamarra,</hi> and one or two of the Apostate Evidence of the Popish Plot, informed against him. Nor is it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that after so many attempts, some of those men should be prevail'd with to prove false; but rather, that under so many temptations, any of 'em resisted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or were not <hi>sooner</hi> Villains. These Persons swore such <hi>mad things</hi> against him, of taking <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and pulling the King out of it, and such other odd wild Stories, that partly from the improbability of the <hi>matter,</hi> and partly from the ill Character of the <hi>Persons</hi> who witness'd it, the Jury here in <hi>London</hi> refus'd to find the Bill, but return'd it <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> On which, contrary

to all Justice, and President, and Law, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reason, which forbids a man should be twice in danger of his Life for the same Offence; the business was remov'd to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where how little Civility or common Justice he met with in his Tryal, was then notorious to all the World: A Person being check'd, for giving him but assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and notes in the way of his calling, to make his defence, when his Life was engaged: Yet tho' even those Notes were deny'd him: None that heard the Tryal, or so much as read it, but must grant, that he made a very extraordinary Defence, and much more than could have been expected from a man of more Learning. But he might have spared all his Labour; the Business was no doubt on't resolv'd upon before, and he was found Guilty, Sentenc'd and Executed <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Order.</hi> To look back once more, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little deeper into the very original of the matter: That there was a design laid to bring in most of the worthy Patriots of <hi>England</hi> into a <hi>Sham-Plot</hi> under the odious, scare-crow name of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> not only the <hi>Meal-tub</hi>-attempt, and several other of the same <hi>Batch,</hi> makes sufficiently appear; but the late Essay of <hi>Fitz-harris</hi> above all the rest, was enough to satisfie the most preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Persons. He had conspired with some others to write a scandalous <hi>Libel</hi> against the King, which was to be laid on such as they'd call <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and this to be sent to their Houses, or conveyed into their Pockets, and there to be seiz'd, and the Persons prosecuted thereupon. This business the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament had before 'em, and began to smell out who set it on foot; and being resolv'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40336:25"/>
to find the bottom on't, lest he should be hang'd up on the sudden to prevent his Confession, (he now beginning to melt a little) as <hi>Hubert,</hi> who fir'd <hi>London</hi> formerly was, they <hi>impeached</hi> him, to keep the examination of that matter to themselves. 'Tis too long to run over the Proceedings against him, and the Court-Parties subtle contrivance, to Hang, Draw, and Quarter him, and so to hinder effectually his <hi>telling any more Tales.</hi> 'Tis sufficient to observe, that this design was prosecuted for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years after, and poor <hi>Colledge</hi> was to bear the first brunt on't, as has been already declared.</p>

                     <p>When a Criminal shall be kept a close Prisoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> without having sufficient means to make his Defence, till he come to his Trial: When, as has been said, he shall be rifled of his Notes, by which he could only save his Life, on which he depended, and that just before he came to his Tryal; though assisted therein by that very Council assigned by the Court for him: When he shall in vain demand 'em again, and call Heaven and Earth to witness, that he's meerly cheated of his Life for want of 'em: When all his redress is such a frivolous excuse, as not only a Judge, but any honest Man would be asham'd to make use of—Nay, such a sort of a one as is commonly made <hi>before</hi> the Judges, but seldom by 'em —
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40336:26"/>
That 'twas somebody else did it—That the Court, the <hi>Chief-Justice,</hi> had 'em not, nor did take 'em from him; when the very Person stood by who rob'd him of 'em; and yet he could have no reparation: When the Kings Council must whisper the <hi>Chief-Justice</hi> on the Bench, and the Court must be adjourned, on purpose to examine into those <hi>Minutes</hi> which the poor Man had got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to save his Life, and even from them get an opportunity to take it away, altering the manner of their Prosecution, strengthning and bolstering their Evidence where they found it weak or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory: When all the Evidence against him, were not only such as an honest <hi>London Jury</hi> wou'd not believe, though a Country one, directed by the Kings Council, could make a shift to do it; but were every one of 'em who witness'd any thing material, confounded by such home Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as if any thing in the World could do it, did certainly invalidate and annul their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: When one of them swears horridly, <hi>He cared not what he swore, nor whom he swore against, for 'twas his Trade to get Money by swearing.— That the</hi> Parliament <hi>were a company of Rogues for not giving the King Money, but he would help him to Money out of the Fanaticks Estates,</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by what <hi>Smith</hi> says, —<hi>That if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would not give the King Money, but stood on the Bill of Exclusion, 'twas pretence enough to swear a design to seize the King at Oxford.</hi> When this same <hi>Heins</hi> very pleasantly says, <hi>'Twas a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the King and the People, and the Irish-men's swearing against 'em was justly fallen on 'em, for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Irish of their Estates.</hi> When others of 'em
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40336:26"/>
swear, That since the Citizens deserted 'em, they would not starve; That they would have <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Blood; That tho they had gone against their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, 'twas because they had been persuaded to't, and could get no Mony else; and when they had said before t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, When the Prisoner himself very weightily objected— <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Taking all these things together, hardly ever was a man at this rate <hi>banter'd</hi> out of his Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Judicature in the World, in any place or Age that History hath left us.</p>
                     <p>Nor ought the great Service he did to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general to be ever forgotten; since not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the disadvantages he was under, the publick stream running so violently against him and his Witnesses, and the surprize which such strange Treatment, when he was on his Life, might cast him into, he yet made so strong a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40336:27"/>
by shewing what sort of Witnesses were brought against him, hindring them ever after from being believ'd, and thereby certainly saved many anothers Life, tho he could not his own.</p>
                     <p>Nor can the undaunted Courage, and firm Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty of the man be hardly ever enough admired. Since besides what he shewed in his defence, after he was condemned, as he himself said, as good as without a Tryal, he boldly ask'd, <hi>When he was to be executed?</hi> without any the least seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. And tho he had time considerable before his Execution to consider on't, refus'd to save his Life so meanly, as to make other innocent men's the price of his own; without which design they had hardly been so kind to have given him so long a Reprieve.</p>
                     <p>As for his <hi>Behaviour at his Execution</hi>: 'Twa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But finding the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Juries</hi> unmoveably honest, and no way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish their Designs on these Persons, while their Witnesses wou'd not be believ'd, and no way to get Juries fit for their turn, but by having She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs of the same stamp; and finding the Party they had gotten, after all their tricks, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those who then knew, are now ashamed of, visibly and fairly out-numbred by those who were not yet ripe for Slavery, they bethought themselves of one way to rid themselves of that Inconveniency—which was by a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> against the City of <hi>London,</hi> that they might more effectually and with less noise have what Sheriffs they pleas'd; or in effect, hang whomever they thought their Enemies, and not be forc'd almost to blush at those visible and sensible Illegalities with which they had forc'd those Officers upon the City.</p>

                     <p>Now by this time they had, after so many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fruitless endeavours, brought something of a Plot to bear; and with this Advantage above all their former, that there was really something in't, altho', as <hi>Bays</hi> says in another Case, <hi>That Truth, which was notoriously blended with Lies and Perjuries.</hi> The occasion of it, we may best meet with in <hi>Holloway</hi>'s most ingenuous Acknowledgment; [<hi>By Arbitrary and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus much for the Occasion. The Design seems to be the same with what was intended at first, by many of those great and eminent Persons, both Clergy and Laity, in their late appearance in Arms; tho' by the Providence of God, for the Security of the Nation, and Reason of State, it has since been carried farther than theirs was ever to have been.

                        </gap>e Reason of the Thing, and the Principles on which they proceeded—And their only difference is about Matter of Fact, Whether Things were then at that heighth as to need desperate Remedies. If it be objected, That such Attempts are only glossy Pretences, vali'd under the specious name of the Publick Good.— The Answer is as ready as the Objection, Is there any difference between Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and no Reason, Truth and Falshood? There is a right, and a wrong,—and if ever Liberties were invaded, and the Ends of Government va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and annulled, never were the Foundations of such a Design plainer than on this Occasion— So that 'twas indeed, what was of it, a Counter-Plot, rather than a Plot against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and that when no other Remedy could without a Miracle be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                     <p>That this was the heighth and utmost of the then Design, and that no brave good man need to be asham'd on't, I think all, or most men are by this time pretty well satisfied. But alas! this would not serve the turn of the Managers— Even this might not, nor perhaps could not be, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'twas not fairly prov'd against several, who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40336:32"/>
suffered for it. This was a thing so necessary and defensible, that there was occasion of laying fouler colours upon't, to fright and amuse the World, and let 'em stand by patiently, and see their best and bravest Patriots sink, with much such Prudence and Wisdom as the Sheep in the Fable suffer'd those bloody Mastiffs to be destroy'd, who so often broke the Peace between them and the harmless Wolves; and were afterwards in their turns handsomly worried, and justly eaten up for their Reward. 'Twas convenient to make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more of it—There must be an Assassination grafted on this Insurrection, or else all would not be worth—an Halter: 'Twas the business and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Popish Party to render their Enemies odious as possible to the people, of whom for their steddy Zeal and Love to their Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they had long been the Darlings. To accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish this, 'twas very necessary to get some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to insinuate into their Counsels, to inflame things higher, to make black and odious Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals of Assassinations, and Murders, and such bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Villanies as alarm the good-nature of an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-man with the very mentioning of 'em.— Which yet some of the honester and wiser look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon as mad hot words only, or, if any more intended, having it in their power to prevent such wickedness another way, would not yet turn Informers, nor ruin those Persons, who in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability were only Trapans to ruin them. In all the Papers relating to this matter, we shall find all Discourses of this nature center'd in <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Rumsey.

Tho' <hi>Walcot, Holloway,</hi> and all whoever heard it propos'd, receiv'd it still with the greatest Detestation imaginable, as a most base and bloody Action, which they never wou'd have their own Hands imbru'd in, nor their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity stain'd with. That all the great Persons, of Birth and Honour, were absolutely against any so foul an Action, and abhorr'd it from their Souls, we may find, even without the forc'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their worst Enemies, by the Lord <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi>'s concern when such a thing was mutter'd, and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Answer, —<hi>God so— Kill the King, I will never suffer it.</hi> The account we have of it, is from him who shou'd best know, and that's <hi>West,</hi> who in his Discourse with <hi>Hollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> on this Occasion, tells him of the <hi>New-market</hi> and <hi>Rye-house</hi> Design—That the King and Duke were to be kill'd as they came by, for which they had provided Arms for fifty Men—and were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd <hi>Rumbald</hi>'s House, which lay in the Road. When ask'd, VVho was to act it—who were to fire these Arms for fifty Men— Pistols, Carbines, and Blunderbusses? He cou'd name but two Men, <hi>Rumbald</hi> and his Brother; who certainly must have been very dexterous to have discharg'd all those dreadful Businesses themselves without As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and is much such a likely Story as <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> being so vain to attempt seizing the King by himself, without any Assistance.</p>

But if there be any thing solid in that Observation in <hi>Colledge</hi>'s Case, <hi>That a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and a Protestant won't forswear himself when he's just going out of the World</hi>; if this fair Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition may but be granted me, as I see not how it can be avoided, the matter will be clear enough; <hi>Rumbald</hi> himself in his Speech at his Execution in <hi>Scotland</hi> absolutely disclaiming and denying any hand in any such Design. See his Speech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Answer to his Indictment—[<hi>He desired all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to believe the words of a dying Man—as for having design'd the King's death, he never directly, nor indirectly, intended such a Villany; That he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd the very thoughts on't; and that he blessed God he had that Reputation in the VVorld, that he knew none had the Impudence to ask him the Question, and he detested the Thoughts of the Action, and hoped all good people wou'd believe him, which was the onely way he had to clear himself; and he was sure that this Truth shou'd one Day be manifest to all Men.</hi>] So at his Execution—[<hi>I think it necessary to clear my self of some Aspersions laid on my Name; and first, That I shou'd have had so horrid an Intention of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the King and his Brother.</hi>] VVhere he repeated what he had said to the Jury on the same Subject.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:40336:34"/>The Sum is,— If any Assassination, it must have been by the <hi>Rumbalds:</hi> if not by them, as has been proved, then not at all. If no assassina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Plot, then nothing is left of malignity in it, but a lawful and laudable opposition to the breach and ruine of our good Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and even that, as will be proved, not proved against most of those that by the iniquity of the times, suffer'd for the same.</p>
                     <p>We have been forced to give this fair and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Scheme or Idea of that design which was at that time represented so formidable and dreadful, before we could handsomly proceed to the Death of this Noble Lord, or those others that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and that as well from the order of the History, as for his Vindication. And as has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd, 'Twas necessary for that Party who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd our ruine, that the forementioned business of the Assassination should be believed, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a real one actually performed, to gain Credit to a feigned one onely pretended: For what could be a greater Argument that there was some black wickedness at the bottom, some sin of an extraordinary stain, like the Murder of Princes, bearing too hard on his Conscience, could possibly induce so great a Man to so unchristian an attempt on his own Person? Hence they might, and no doubt did argue— Hence the very rabble may easily reason—Certainly there was more in it than onely just consultations, and necessary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures taken for the Publick Safety by the Peers of the Realm— by the King and Kingdoms best Friends, to deliver his Majesty from those Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars that haunted him. There was more than
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40336:34"/>
this, and this Lord was conscious of it, or else certainly he had never acted what he has. Now this would effectually excite that aversion which must necessarily follow from all honest Men to a Party who could be guilty of such horrid designs. This must of necessity, as in effect it did, sway much with those Juries who were to sit upon the Lives of any accused or concerned in the same business, had there not been more weighty reasons to be produced below towards the finding 'em guilty. Altho 'tis certain, by their own confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the best excuse they could make for Innocent Blood, particularly in <hi>Russel</hi>'s Case, was that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation they had to the Evidence sworn against 'em' by <hi>Essex</hi>'s Murder. Besides, There might be a barbarous kind of a pleasure, in opening this Plot with a Scene so like that which began the Popish one; and that in all probability, by the same Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors whose hands were deep in the others.</p>
                     <p>There was a Gentleman kill'd, which contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very much towards the credit of that Plot, tho in another way. <hi>Here</hi> must be one to undergo the same Fate for the same reason. And both of 'em too pretendedly to kill themselves— Just one as much as another.</p>
                     <p>These Preliminaries being cleared, 'twill be now time to come to the Person of this Noble Lord, his Family, and former manner of Life.</p>
                     <p>Every one knows he was of the Illustrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Capels,</hi> whose Father dy'd for a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whence he deserved better Treatment for his sake, and had received it, had he not fallen into the Hands of Popish Gratitude and Mercy; which his Enemies knowing too well, and doubting the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40336:35"/>
Sweetness of temper which all the world ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second would not give him over to their publick Revenge, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, resolved to take a shorter course with him. He had been some years before in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est place under the King in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himself with that Wisdom and Candor, inseparable from all the actions of his Life — and lived above Blame, though not above Envy: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recalled thence unexpectedly, and dealt with not very handsomly; which yet he bore with a Spirit like a brave man, and a Christian.</p>
                     <p>My <hi>Lord of Essex</hi> was a Person, whom, 'twas no doubt the highest <hi>Interest</hi> of the Popish Faction to have gotten out of the way, even tho' there had been no such extraordinary Reason as has been mentioned. He had large Interest, a plentiful Estate, a great deal of Courage, understood the World, and the Principles and Practices of the Papists as well as any man, having been of several <hi>Secret Committees</hi> in the Examination of the Plot, on which very reason there was as much necessity for his dying as Sir <hi>E. B. Godfrey</hi>'s. He was besides all this, they very well knew, of <hi>Inflexible</hi> Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and so true a greatness of mind, they could no more expect to gain him, than Heaven it self to be on their side</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40336:35"/>
Murders, especially of that magnitude, don't use to be committed in the face of all the world, and at Noon-day. When Power is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in any Villany, when the same Power is still continu'd or encreas'd, and can be easily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in taking out of the way the <hi>Traytors,</hi> tho' it loves the <hi>Treason</hi>; and when so many years have interven'd since the Fact; 'tis no wonder at all if things are more in the dark, than they would have been, had at that very instant Liberty been given to have enquired into it, which was so loudly and passionately demanded. But this we are yet certain of, tho' no more be yet publickly known in this matter than what has formerly been Printed; and tho' there may be several rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, both of State and Decency, which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make it convenient that things should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be as they are; yet there are already such <hi>violent</hi> probabilities, both that he was murthered, and murthered by Papists; And of the other side, such at least next to impossibilities, in his acting it himself, that as long as the World stands, no modest man will be able either to get by 'em or over 'em; nor the most impudent or cunning, to out-face, or give them an answer.</p>
                     <p>For the probability that he was murther'd by Popish Contrivement, besides those already na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Why</hi> they should do it; here are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments, <hi>That</hi> they did it; Their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples too openly known to be deny'd: Their <hi>Practices</hi> in all Ages, and this present,—Sir <hi>E.B.G.</hi> the very <hi>Prototype</hi> of <hi>Essex, Arnold</hi>; all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Legal</hi> Murders, all that has since happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed —But if 'tis said, some Papists are <hi>better</hi> and

                        <hi>braver</hi> than others. Let's come nearer. Would those that formerly burnt <hi>London</hi>; those who have since broke all the Obligations of Gratitude and Good Nature, nay, Publick Faith, and the most solemn <hi>Oaths</hi> which 'tis possible for a man to take —Who, if the Testimonies of such as have confirmed it with their dying <hi>Breaths,</hi> and last drop o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Blood,</hi> may be credited, who have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, hired, paid men for attempts to be made on the lives of their nearest, and too tender Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; Would such as these stick at a single mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a small <hi>Venial Villany</hi> to advance their Cause, and merit Heaven into the Bargain; When pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Justice, necessity of Affairs, Reason of State, and so many more such weights might be thrown into the Scales? More than all this— When such Persons as these were <hi>actually</hi> in the place where this Murther was committed, at the very instant 'twas done? All these together, with what is yet to follow, amount to as strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and <hi>pregnant</hi> Circumstances as the nature of the thing will bear, and mark out the Murtherers as plainly and visibly, as if they had come out of his Chamber with <hi>white Sleeves,</hi> and a long <hi>Knife</hi> in their Hands, bloody all over.</p>
                     <p>And indeed there seems need of little more than relating bare, simple, indubitable matter of Fact, and such as hardly any body will deny, to satisfie any cool rational man in the business.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Throat was cut in the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> about Eight or Nine in the Morning, at which time the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Papist, his known bitter Enemy, was there present.

sixty miles from <hi>London,</hi> the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the first day of his Imprisonment, and as common Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk in every bodies mouth, as Sir <hi>E.B.G</hi>'s at the time of his murther, and told a Person travelling on the Road near the same place, which was witnessed before, <hi>even a Jeffreys,</hi> in a publick Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature. A <hi>Deputy</hi>-Coroner present at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest instead of a <hi>Legal</hi> one; none of the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to attend the Inquest. The Body remov'd from the place where 'twas first laid, stript, the Clothes taken away, the Body and Rooms wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the Blood, the Clothes denied the view of the Jury. The principal Witnesses examin'd, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Bomeny</hi> his man, and <hi>Russel</hi> his Warder, who might be so justly suspected of being privy to, if not Actors in it. That the Jury hasten'd and hurried the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict when so great a man, a Peer of the Realm, and such a Peer was concern'd, who was the King's Prisoner. When Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> had been before murther'd in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and his Jury brought in an unrighteous Verdict; when even Sir <hi>E. B.

This at a time when the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was to be try'd for a share in a Plot in which the Earl was also accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of being concern'd. One Branch of which Conspiracy, and which 'twas so much the Papists Interest to have the belief on't fix'd, was a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Murther of the Duke and King; when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cou'd so immediately, and critically tend to that noble Gentleman's ruine; when the News was instantly, with so much diligence, convey'd from the <hi>Tower</hi> to the <hi>Sessions-house, Bench, Bar,</hi>

After this, the very Centinel, who that Day stood near the place, found dead in the <hi>Tower</hi>-Ditch, and Captain <hi>Hawley</hi> barbarously murther'd down at <hi>Rochester</hi>; and ill methods us'd to prevent the truth of all from coming to light. Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> harass'd, prosecuted, jayl'd and fined for stirring in it. On the fair and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Consideration but of these things, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of which but is notorious Matter of Fact, granted by all sides—What <hi>can</hi> a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the whole, but whether he will or no— That this noble Lord was certainly murthered by the Popish Party?</p>
                     <p>But there's yet more Evidence,—If he could not Murther himself in that manner, who then should do it but those on whom the Guilt on't has been justly charged? And this from the manner of it. His Throat was cut from one Jugular to the other, and by the <hi>Aspera Arteria</hi> and Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe to the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, both the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars being throughly divided. How often has it been ask'd, and how impossible it should ever receive an Answer,—<hi>How could any Living Man, after the prodigious flux of Blood which must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow on the dividing one Jugular, as well as all those strong Muscles which lye in the way, how cou'd he ever have strength to go through, all round, and come to the other, without fainting?</hi> One cou'd as soon believe the Story of the Pirate, who after his Head was cut off, ran the whole length of his Ship; or that of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> which was no doubt grafted on the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:40336:37"/>Nor is it rendered less impossible from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument with which those who did it wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the World 'twas perform'd by himself A little <hi>French Razor.</hi> Had <hi>Bomeny</hi> held to the <hi>Penknife,</hi> it had been much more likely. But here was nothing to <hi>rest</hi> or <hi>bear upon</hi> in the cutting, it having no <hi>Tongue</hi> to hold it up in the <hi>Haft:</hi> And as 'tis observ'd in the Prints on that Subject, he must therefore, supposing he had done it himself, have held his hand pretty far, upon the very Blade, and so with about <hi>two inches and a half</hi> of it, <hi>whittle</hi> out a wound of four inches deep and all round his Neck, as if he had intended to have been his own <hi>Headsman</hi> as well as <hi>Executioner,</hi> out of Remorse of Conscience for his <hi>Treason.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, His <hi>Character</hi> makes it morally impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible he should be guilty of so <hi>mean</hi> and little an Action. 'Tis for Women, and Eunuch's, and Lovers, and Romantick Hero's to <hi>kill themselves</hi>; not Men of known Virtue, Temper, Wisdom, Piety and Gravity; who had formerly digested as great <hi>Affronts</hi> as cou'd be put upon à Man, with a candor and calmness so worthy a Man and a Christian, who had been so far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending so barbarous and unmanly a thing as Self-murther, as is suggested, that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther express himself with Detestation concerning it.</p>
                     <p>And as he <hi>ought</hi> not, and <hi>cou</hi>'d not be hurried into so fatal an Action by a false mistaken <hi>Greatness of Mind</hi>; as no such thing, or so much as the least Footsteps of it appear'd in the whole <hi>course</hi> of his Life; so from all his Actions in the <hi>Tower</hi> before his Death, we may fairly deduce the quite
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40336:38"/>
contrary to what his Enemies have asserted; and by observing his <hi>Conduct</hi> there, discover plainly that no such black Intention ever enter'd into his Mind. This appears from his ordering his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have his own Plate sent for out of the Country to dress his Meat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable parcel of Wines bought and brought into the <hi>Tower</hi> for his drinking, that he might not stand to the <hi>Courtesie</hi> of his Enemies; and this sufficient to last him till he cou'd be deliver'd by due Course of Law.</p>
                     <p>I can foresee but one thing that can with the least plausibility be objected to this considerable Passage; and 'tis, <hi>That this was when he was</hi> first Committed, <hi>before he fell Melancholy, which he more eminently did when he heard my Lord</hi> Russel <hi>was to be try'd, as being griev'd and desperate for having brought so brave a Gentlemen into such unhappy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi> as <hi>Bomeny</hi> somewhere or other pretends to, on discoursing with him on that particular.</p>
                     <p>But there are two Answers which cut all the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news</hi> of this Objection: One, <hi>That this was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day before he was murder'd, that he sent both for his</hi> Wine <hi>and</hi> Silver Vessels. Now <hi>Bomeny</hi> lays the Foundation of his Melancholy, and the Intention to be his own Destroyer on the very <hi>first day</hi> he came into the <hi>Tower.</hi> For he says in his Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial, [<hi>That he had order'd his Servant two days before to provide a</hi> Penknife <hi>for him, on pretence of cutting his Nails, but with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of committing that Fatal and Tragical Act.</hi>] The Thirteenth of <hi>July</hi> was the day of his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,</hi> two days before then must be the Eleventh, the day of his Commitment: But 'twas the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40336:38"/>
day, the Twelfth of that Month, on which he took such care to eat and drink safely: whereas had there been any such design in his Head, he wou'd never have taken such Measures; and if he had had an intention to <hi>amuze</hi> his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that no such thing might have been suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he might have taken other ways, less trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and chargeable.</p>
                     <p>But what yet clears all the remaining <hi>Scruple,</hi> is his ordering his <hi>Gentleman</hi> to <hi>take Notes</hi> at my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Trial, appointing him how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage himself for the effecting it, so calmly and orderly, that he can't be suppos'd, either disturb'd, or desperate on account of his own <hi>Guilt,</hi> or <hi>Russel</hi>'s <hi>unhappiness</hi>; or to have taken this Course with <hi>himself,</hi> as <hi>Jeffreys</hi> says in <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Trial, to <hi>prevent Justice,</hi> tho' others did it with <hi>him</hi> to <hi>prevent Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One great Argument more; That, which indeed when it happen'd, did much alarm all <hi>thinking</hi> men, and make 'em shrewdly suspect <hi>foul play</hi> had been offer'd-was the ill Treatment those met with who dared but pry into these <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> and desire but in a <hi>legal</hi> way that the Business might be reviewed, and search'd to the bottom. This was granted in the Case of poor Sir <hi>Edmund,</hi> many years after his Death, and Commission given to enquire into it to <hi>L'Estrange.</hi> — But 'tis confest there was a great deal of <hi>Difference.</hi> One, as 'twas manag'd, tending to root up all belief of a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Plot</hi>: T'other if it had been honestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd, might have done as much in reality to a <hi>Protestant</hi> One. The great <hi>tenderness</hi> of some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in this Case, and their huge aversion and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40336:39"/>
unwillingness to be <hi>touch'd</hi> thereabouts; made People more than suspect, that there was some <hi>Sore</hi> or other in the Case which wou'd not endure it. Mr. <hi>Braddon</hi> had heard of a Boy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing playing before <hi>Essex</hi>'s window that Morning, saw a bloody Razor thrown out of the window; he thought he shou'd do the King Service to make a Discovery if any Injury had been offer'd to one of his Subjects, especially so great and good a Person. He brings the Boy with him to my L. <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and for his Reward is himself brought before the Council, severely <hi>Reprimanded,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Bail to Answer an Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Suborning</hi> the Boy to say what he did.

                        <head>His Character.</head>
                        <p>IT must be confessed, 'tis a bold and dangerous thing to attempt the Character of one of the greatest Men which our Age has produc'd espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for one who had not the honour of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal intimacy with him. All that's to be done is from what has been already said and what other <hi>Memoirs</hi> are left of him, to endeavour at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so <hi>like</hi> him, that any one who sees it, may say 'twas <hi>meant</hi> for the <hi>Picture</hi> of the Great <hi>Essex,</hi> how infinitely soever it must of necessity be <hi>short</hi> of its <hi>Original.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The first thing then remarkable in him, and which alone would sufficiently <hi>distinguish</hi> him, is, That he was a Person of <hi>strict Morals,</hi> and <hi>severe Piety</hi>; and that in the midst of a Court and Age not very famous for either. Nor did this dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into Superstition or Weakness. He was a refin'd Politician, without what some will say 'tis impossible to be so, and that's <hi>Dissimulation.</hi> When Affronts were offer'd him, he did not, as others, dissemble 'em, but, like himself only, scorn and conquer 'em; even tho' of the highest nature, and which generally pierce deepest into Persons of his Figure and Character. He was, as all the rest here commemorated, a firm Lover of his Country and Religion, the true Character of a true English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and engaged on their sides against the then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and other Ministers, not from any mean pique or little discontented Humour, which he was very much above, but meerly from the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40336:40"/>
true respect he had for 'em, and a sense of that imminent Danger they were in, which his pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Judgment and long Experience made him more sensible of, and his Courage and Vertue more concern'd at, than others; not only those who sat unconcern'd Spectators, or shar'd in their Ruins; but even then most of them who were engag'd with him in the same Common Cause of their Defence and Preservation. Nothing of such an impatience, or eargerness, or black melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly cou'd be discern'd in his Temper or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, as is always the Symptom or Cause of such Tragical-Ends, as his Enemies wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us he came to.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, What may be said of most of the rest, does in a more especial and eminent manner agree to the illustrious <hi>Essex</hi>; and than which nothing greater can be said of Mortality, <hi>He liv'd an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, and dy'd a Martyr.</hi>

                     <p>THE next who fell under their Cruelty, and to whose Death <hi>Essex</hi>'s was but the <hi>Prologue,</hi> was my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> without all Dispute the finest <hi>Gentleman</hi> one of 'em that ever <hi>England</hi> bred, and whose pious Life and Virtue was as much <hi>Treason</hi> against the Court, by affronting 'em with what was so much hated there, as any thing else that was sworn against him. His Family was <hi>ancient,</hi> tho' not rais'd to the Honours it at present enjoys, till King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, when <hi>John Russel,</hi> a <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire</hi> Gentlemen, who had done many Services, and receiv'd many favours from the Crown, both in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, being by the latter made Lord High Admiral, and at his Death Lord High Steward of <hi>England</hi> for the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of the Coronation; obtain'd such a Victory for his <hi>young Master</hi> against his Rebels, as was rewarded with the Title of <hi>The Earl of Be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> The Occasion of it thu—Idolatry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition being now rooting out by the Publick Authority, and <hi>Images</hi> every where <hi>pulling</hi> down, the <hi>Loyal</hi> Papists mutined, and one of their Priests stabb'd a Commander of the Kings, who was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his Orders, and ten thousand of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Rabble rise in the Defence of that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Action, and their old Mass and Holy-water.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40336:42"/>
Against whom this fortunate Lord was sent with an Army, who routed 'em all, relieved <hi>Exeter</hi> which they had besieg'd, and took their Gods, Banners, Crucifixes, and all the rest of their <hi>Trumpery,</hi> wherein the deluded Creatures trusted for Victory. Thus the Family of the <hi>Russels</hi> were early Enemies to the <hi>Romish Superstition,</hi> tho' this brave Gentleman only paid the Scores of all his Ancestors. The Son and Heir of this <hi>John</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was <hi>Francis,</hi> second Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who was as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Crown, as his Father, an Enemy and Terror to the <hi>French,</hi> and a Friend to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion,</hi> as may appear by the <hi>Learned Books</hi> of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> which he collected, and at his Death bequeath'd to a great Man, who he knew wou'd make good use of 'em. His eldest Son <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> the present Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known to every true English-man, and his Person and Memory will be honoured by them as long as the World lasts. But 'tis necessary good men should not be immortal— if they were, we should almost lose their Examples, it looking so like Flattery. But to do 'em Justice while they are living, with more safety, and less <hi>censure,</hi> we may discourse of that Noble Gentleman, his Son and Name-sake <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> who made so great a Figure in our Courts and Parliaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was sacrificed to the Cruelty and Revenge of his Popish Enemies. If we'd find his first Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which lay behind the Scene, and was indeed the Cause of his Death, though other Colours were necessary to amuse the Publick, we must look some years backward, as he himself does in his last Speech, wherein he tells the World, [He
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40336:43"/>
cannot but think his Earnestness in the matter of the Exclusion had no small influence on his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sufferings.] Being chosen Knight of the Shire for <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> where the evenness and sweetness of his Behaviour; and his virtuous Life made him so well-beloved, that he'll never be forgotten. He began sooner than most others to see into that danger we were in from Popery, and all those fatal consequences which have since happened; and described them as plainly as if he had more than the ordinary inspection of a prudent man into <hi>Futurities.</hi> Thus in his first Speech, on the Discovery of the Popish Plot in 78. He has these words, [<hi>I am of Opinion that the Life of our King, the Safety of our Country, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, are in great danger from Popery; and that either this Parliament must suppress the power and growth of Popery, or else that Popery will soon destroy not only Parliaments, but all that is near and dear to us.</hi>] And lower [<hi>I humbly move, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to take into our consideration in the first place, how to suppress Popery, and prevent a Popish Successor, without which all our endeavours about this matter will not signifie any thing.</hi>] And how much he was in the right as to all these Guesses, which then no doubt were nick-named <hi>Groundless and Factious Fears and Jealousies,</hi> all the World is now satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Nothing can be more handsom than what he says on this Subject in his <hi>last Speech,</hi> which gives the reasons of his acting at that time, and being so earnest for the Bill, in which indeed is as fair a <hi>State</hi> of that great Question as we shall any where find in so little a compass. [<hi>I cannot</hi> (says he) <hi>but give some touch about the</hi> Bill of Exclusion, <hi>and shew
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40336:43"/>
the reasons of my appearing in that business, which in short is this: That I thought the Nation was in such danger of Popery, and that the expectation of a</hi> Popish Successor <hi>(as I have said in Parliament) put the Kings Life also in such danger, that I saw no way so effectual to secure both, as such a Bill. As to the Limitations which were proposed, if they were sincerely offer'd, and had pass'd into a Law, the Duke then would have been excluded from the Power of a King, and the Government quite alter'd, and little more than the name of a King left: So I could not see either sin or fault in the one, when all People were willing to admit of the other: But thought it better to have a King with his Prerogative, and the Nation easie and safe under him, than a King without it, which must have bred perpetual Jealousies, and continual struggle.</hi>] Thus far that Noble Lord, with whom concurred at that time very many great and good Men, as true Lovers of the Regulated Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> as of the Protestant Religion; and indeed all were at that time unanimous in the House of Commons, and other places, except some <hi>honest Men,</hi> who despaired of obtaining his Exclusion: Others who strained their Charity almost as far as <hi>Origen,</hi> who hoped well even of the Devil, and they came not far short, believing a Papist would be honest or grateful. Some who were indifferent—Their private Obligations to the Duke byassing their Judgments too much on his side. Others fearful that the contrary Tide ran so strong, they could have no safety but under his Protection— and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more than all these others, who fairly <hi>bought</hi> and <hi>sold</hi> their Religion and Liberties— the Blood and Souls of themselves and honester

men; whom 'tis not doubted but our Chronicles will <hi>mark</hi> as long as our Nation has any in't that can but write themselves, or read what others have written.</p>
                     <p>The Reader will pardon this little Digression, and go on with me to remark some <hi>strange Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> in another Speech of his. 'Twas on a Debate in the House for Mony to be given for the Relief of <hi>Tangier. [Doth not</hi> (says he) <hi>the Dukes Interest indanger the Kings Life? and are not our Lives and Fortunes in danger to be snatch'd up by his Power? —and shall we yet make him stronger by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mony into his hands?</hi>] And a little lower, [<hi>When his Majesty shall be pleased to free us from the danger of a Popish Successor, and remove from his Council, and Places of Trust all those who are for his Interest, because there can be no distinction made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Dukes Interest and the Popish—Then I shall conclude, that what Mony we shall give, will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of according to his Majesties own Royal Pleasure, and for the true Protestant Interest, and I shall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give, even</hi> all that I have in the World, <hi>if his Majesty shall have occasion for it.</hi>] I have been the larger in this, to undeceive the World as to that <hi>clamouring</hi> against those Parliaments for not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>King</hi> Mony, the true reason of which we may here plainly perceive.</p>
                     <p>But there is one passage so very remarkable, and I know not how to call it less than <hi>Prophetical,</hi> in the beginning of this same Speech, that it must by no means be omitted; 'tis as follows. [<hi>If ever there should happen in this Nation any such Change, that I should not have Liberty to</hi> live <hi>a</hi> Protestant, <hi>I am resolv'd to</hi> die <hi>one.</hi>] And I think he was as good
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40336:44"/>
as his Word—For being mark't out, and among others, appointed for the Slaughter, he was taken up and imprisoned for that end and purpose in the Tower, and brought to his Tryal above all days in the year, on <hi>Essex</hi>'s day, the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> 1683. He was brought to the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> arraigned, and the <hi>same morning</hi> tryed for High Treason. He earnestly desired he might have respite, and might not be tryed <hi>that day,</hi> since he had some Witnesses that could not be in Town till the Night; nay, they were in such post-hast, and so hot a scent for his Blood, that on his earnest desire, they would not stay so much as till the Afternoon, pretending 'twas against President, and they could not do it without the Attorney General's Consent; tho 'tis notorious, that both <hi>Plunket,</hi> the titular Irish Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> before spoken of, were both of them try'd a whole Term after they were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd; tho in both Cases the Attorney oppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d it; and even here in the case of Treason, at the <hi>Old-Baily</hi> too, <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s Tryal was put off to another Sessions. If 'tis pleaded, The Case is different, and that there was reason for the one, but not for the other: 'Twill be readily granted, —Tho my Lords Evidence were not ready, theirs was— They had concerted business better, and just at that time News was brought hot into the House, That my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> had this Morning prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Justice, as has been before remarked in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Essex</hi>; as also, That several of the Jury had said, They had never found <hi>Russel</hi> Guilty, had it not been for that Accident. And indeed, were that all in the Case, there would be still room for a great deal of Charity: For though that was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40336:45"/>
no proper Evidence against the Prisoner, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few Persons in the World, perhaps, could have been found, whose Minds would have been so firm, and Reason so clear, as not to be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they wou'd or no, <hi>hing'd</hi> and <hi>byass'd</hi> by such a sudden report as this brought in among 'em, when they had no time to consider calmly of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and this, no doubt, was very well known by those who order'd things in the manner before-noted. But I say, 'twere to be wished, for the Honour of the English Nation, that this had been <hi>all the foul play</hi> in the case, and that there had not been so many Thousand <hi>Guinea's</hi> imployed in this and other Tryals, as the great <hi>Agitators</hi> thereof have lately confess'd to have been. The Names of his Jury, as I find them in Print, are as follow:

of the Nation. His <hi>Indictment</hi> ran in these words, [<hi>He did conspire and compass our Lord the King, his Supreme Lord, not onely of his Kingly State, Title, Power, and Government of this his Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>to deprive and throw down; but also our said Soveraign Lord the King</hi> to kill, and to Death to bring and put, <hi>and the ancient Government of this Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>to change, alter, and wholly subvert, and a miserable Slaughter among the Subjects of our said Lord the King, through his whole Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>to cause and procure, and Insurrection and Rebellion against our said Lord the King, to move, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and stir up within this Kingdom of</hi> England.] And lower, [<hi>He and divers others did consult, agree, and conclude Insurrection and Rebellion against our Sovereign Lord the King, to move and stir up, and the Guards for the preservation of the Person of our said Soveraign Lord the King, to seize and destroy.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Now that all this was not intended as matter of Form only, we may see by the Kings Councils opening the Evidence. The first says —[He was indicted for <hi>no less</hi> than conspiring the <hi>Death of the Kings Majesty</hi>; and that in order to the same, he and others did meet and conspire together, to bring our Sovereign Lord the King to Death, to raise War and Rebellion against him, and to Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre his Subjects—And in order to compass these wicked Designs, being assembled, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to seize the Kings <hi>Guards,</hi> and his Majesties Person: And this (he tells the Jury) is the charge against him.</p>
                     <p>The Attorney General melts it a little lower, and tells 'em the meaning of all these Tragical Words, were <hi>A Consult about a Rising</hi>—about
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40336:46"/>
seizing the <hi>Guards,</hi> and receiving <hi>Messages</hi> from E. of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> concerning an Insurrection.</p>
                     <p>Nor yet does the proof against him come up so high even as this, though all care was used for that purpose, and kind Questions put very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to lead and drive the Evidence; but one of them Witnessing to any one Point.</p>
                     <p>The first of whom was Col. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> who swears, <hi>That he was sent with a</hi> Message <hi>from</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>who lay concealed at</hi> Wapping, <hi>to meet Lord</hi> Russel, Ferguson, <hi>&amp;c. at</hi> Shepherds<hi>'s, to know of them what Resolution they were come to about the Rising design'd at</hi> Taunton— <hi>That when he came thither, the Answer was made,</hi> Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had fail'd 'em, and no more would be done in that business at that time. <hi>That Mr.</hi> Ferguson <hi>spoke the most part of that Answer; but my Lord</hi> Russel <hi>was present, and that he did speak</hi> about <hi>the Rising of</hi> Taunton, <hi>and</hi> consented <hi>to it. That the Company was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing also of viewing the</hi> Guards, <hi>in order to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize 'em, if the Rising had gone on; and that some undertook to view 'em; and that the Lord</hi> Russel <hi>was by when this was undertaken.</hi>] But this being the main Hinge of the business and this Witness not yet coming up to the purpose, they thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to give him a Jog, to Refresh his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Asking him. [Whether he found my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> averse, or <hi>agreeing</hi> to it.] Who, no doubt, answer'd, <hi>Agreeing.</hi> But being afterwards in the Tryal ask'd, Whether he could Swear positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> heard the <hi>Message,</hi> and gave any Answer to it? All that he says is this, [That when he came in, they were at the Fire side, but they all came from the Fire-side, to hear what he said.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:40336:46"/>All that <hi>Shepherd</hi> witnesses is, That my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> &amp;c. being at his house, there was a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of surprizing the Kings Guards; and Sir <hi>Thomas Armstrong</hi> having viewed them when he came thither another time, said, They were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, and the thing was feizible, if there were Strength to do it, and that (upon his being que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd too, as <hi>Rumsey</hi> before him) Whether my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was there? He says, He was, at that time they discours'd of seizing the Guards.</p>
                     <p>The next Witness was the florid Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who very artificially begins low, being, forsooth, so terribly surprized with my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Death, that his Voice fail'd him, till the Lord Chief Justice told him, the <hi>Jury</hi> could not hear him; in which very moment his Voice returned again, and he told the reason why he spoke no louder. After a long Harangue of <hi>Tropes and fine Words,</hi> and dismal General Stories, by which, as my Lord complains, the Jury were prepossessed against him, he at last makes his Evidence <hi>bear</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon the point for which he came thither— And swears, [That after my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> went away] their Party resolved still to carry on the design of the Insurrection without him; for the better management whereof they erected a little Cabal among themselves, which did consist of Six Persons, whereof my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> and himself were two: That they met for this purpose at Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi>'s house, and there adjusted the place and manner of the intended Insurrection: That about ten days after they had another meeting on the same business at my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s, where they resolved to send some Persons to engage <hi>Argyle</hi>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:40336:47"/>
and the <hi>Scots</hi> in the design—and (being ask'd too) that he was sure my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was there.] Being ask'd whether he said any thing, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, [That every one knew him to be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of great Judgment, and not very lavish of Discourse.] Being again goaded on by <hi>Jeffreys</hi> with a— <hi>But did he consent?</hi> [We did (says he) put it to the Vote, it went without contradiction, and <hi>I took it</hi> that all there gave their consent.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>West</hi> swears, That <hi>Ferguson</hi> and Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> told him, That my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> intended to go down and take his Post in the <hi>West,</hi> when Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> had fail'd 'em. Whose hear-say-Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence being not encouraged, <hi>Jeffreys</hi> ends very <hi>prettily,</hi> telling the Court, they would not use any thing of <hi>Garniture,</hi> but leave it as it was.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Rumsey</hi> the first Witness: As to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>—My Lord <hi>Candish</hi> prov'd on the Trial, that my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> had a very ill opinion of him, and therefore 'twas not likely he would entrust him with such a Secret.</p>
                     <p>As to his <hi>Evidence,</hi> squeez'd out of him as it was, in both branches of the Design, seizing the Guards, and the Rising of <hi>Taunton,</hi> he says in gross and general, That he was <hi>agreeing</hi> to one, and <hi>spoke about</hi> and <hi>consented</hi> to the other. For his <hi>agreeing</hi> to the seizing the Guards, he might think as the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> does after, that <hi>Silence</hi> gives <hi>consent</hi>; for it appears not, nor does he swear, that my Lord <hi>spoke</hi> one word about it. But he himself, in his last Speech, which was not a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi>'s, &amp; which we have all the reason in the world to believe exactly true, since, as he himself says in it, [<hi>He always detested Lying, tho' never so much
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40336:47"/>
for his advantage; and hoped none would be so unjust, or uncharitable to think he'd venture on it in thee his last words, for which he was so soon going to give an account to the great God, the Searcher of Hearts, and Judge of all things.</hi>] In this last Speech he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests, that this time of which <hi>Rumsey</hi> swears, there was no <hi>undertaking of securing and seizing the Guards,</hi> nor none appointed to view or examine them, only some discourse there was of the <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zibleness</hi> of it: He had heard it mentioned as a thing <hi>might</hi> easily be done, but <hi>never</hi> consented to as a thing <hi>fit</hi> to be done. Now I'd ask any man of Sense and Honour, who did but know my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> let 'em be never so much his Enemy (if there were any such) which of these two they really judge most worthy to be believed? There is but <hi>one</hi> against <hi>one. Rumsey,</hi> who either swore upon liking, for saving his Life, or was a <hi>Trapan,</hi> [That he was consenting to the seizing the Guards] or my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> on his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> solemnly affirming, [That he was so far from <hi>consenting</hi> to any such thing, that there was not so much as any such Undertaking mention'd in the Company while he was with 'em.] Especially when 'tis observable, that <hi>Rumsey</hi> never instances in the terms in which he gave his <hi>Consent.</hi> The same is to be said of the other Branch of his Evidence as to the Message of the <hi>Insurrection,</hi> which he says he brought into the Room, found the Lord <hi>Russel</hi> and the rest by the Fire; whence they all came to him, and heard his Message, and the Lord <hi>Russel discoursed</hi> of the subject on't, and <hi>consented</hi> to't. To all which let's again oppose not only what he answer'd in his Trial, wherein
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40336:48"/>
he says, That he would <hi>swear</hi> he never heard, or knew of that Message which <hi>Rumsey</hi> says he brought to them; but also what he says in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof in his Speech, [<hi>I shall aver, that what I said of my not hearing Col.</hi> Rumsey <hi>deliver any Message from my Lord</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>was true.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>And a little before, [<hi>When I came into the Room I saw Mr.</hi> Rumsey <hi>by the Chimney, tho' he swears he came in after.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>One thing more is observable, That when <hi>West</hi> came to give in his <hi>Garniture-Evidence,</hi> he runs in a <hi>Length</hi> further than <hi>Rumsey,</hi> and remembers <hi>Rumsey</hi> had told him, what it seems he himself had forgot, That on Mr. <hi>Trenchards</hi> failing 'em, my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> was to go in his place, and take up Posts along in the <hi>West.</hi> And indeed had not <hi>West</hi> miss'd his <hi>Cue,</hi> and by imitating my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, begun first with <hi>Hear-say,</hi> he had made as stabbing an Evidence as e're a one of the other— Or had they but let him run to the end of his third, and take things methodically, as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship did before him.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Shepherd,</hi> all must grant he says not a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to the purpose, or any thing which affects my Lord. He can hardly tell whether he was there when there was the discourse of seizing the Guards, but speaks not a word of my <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or in the least-wise <hi>consenting</hi> thereunto.</p>
                     <p>As for my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Evidence, we may, without <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> affirm that every <hi>Lord</hi> is not fit to make a <hi>Privy-Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nsellor</hi>; no, nor every <hi>witty Lord</hi> neither, especially in a Business of such a Concern. He does very well to say, the <hi>Council of six</hi> all <hi>chose</hi> themselves; for had not he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40336:48"/>
given his own Vote for himself, hardly any body else wou'd have done it, since his <hi>Character</hi> is so notoriously different from that which he himself gives of my Lord <hi>Russel, [whom,</hi> he says, <hi>every one knew him to be a Person of great Judgment, and not very lavish of Discourse.</hi>] For his Evidence, he too is so happy to have a better Memory than <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey,</hi> as well as <hi>West</hi> had; and says, <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>told him,</hi> Rumsey <hi>had convey'd my Lord</hi> Russel <hi>to</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>on whose perswasion the Insurrection was put off about a Fornight longer.</hi> Of this <hi>Rumsey</hi> himself says not a Syllable.</p>
                     <p>He says further, <hi>That when they had enquir'd how Matters stood in the Countrey, and the Duke of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth <hi>had found</hi> Trenchard <hi>and the West-Country fail'd them, on this 'twas put off again— and this about the</hi> 17<hi>th or</hi> 18<hi>th of October.</hi> Now this same Action <hi>Rumsey</hi> speaks of, but takes a larger Scope as to the Time, the end of <hi>October,</hi> or beginning of <hi>November,</hi> far enough from the 17th or 18th of the Month before. <hi>Rumsey</hi> says, <hi>On this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of the</hi> Taunton <hi>men and</hi> Trenchard, Shaftsbury <hi>resolv'd to be gone.</hi> Lord <hi>Howard,— That he was so far from it, that he and his Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to</hi> do it without the Lords, <hi>and had set one time and t'other, and at last the</hi> 17<hi>th of</hi> Novemb. <hi>which also not taking effect, then</hi> Shaftsbury <hi>went off.</hi> As to his Evidence, which was closer—the Story of the <hi>Council of Six,</hi> besides the former Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that he among all the men in <hi>England</hi> shou'd be chosen one of 'em; 'tis remarkable, that in their former greater Consults at <hi>Shepherds,</hi> which he and <hi>Rumsey</hi> mention, the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was never present, nor so much as touches on't in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40336:49"/>
his Evidence; tho' here, if any where, the grand Affair of seizing the Guards, and the Answer to <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> about <hi>Taunton</hi> was concerted. All that appears of truth in the Matter, seems to be what my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> acknowledges,—<hi>That those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons named met very often —that there was no form'd Design, but onely loose talk about those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ns. That there was no Debate of any such thing as was sworn, nor putting any thing in a Method: but my Lord</hi> Howard <hi>being a Man of a Voluble Tongue, and one who talkt very well, they were all delighted to hear him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor indeed does my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> positively Swear, even supposing this form'd Consult to be true, that my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> actually consented to it, or discoursed of it.

                     <p>'Tis a very ill Cause that needs either a <hi>Lye</hi> or a <hi>Cheat</hi> to defend it. My Lord <hi>Russel</hi> himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so ingenuous to acknowledge whatever of Truth, any that knew him will believe to be in his part of the Design, 'twould be an Injury to his Memory to do any otherwise. It appears then from his own acknowledgment, that <hi>Howard, Armstrong,</hi> and such others, had sometimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of ill Designs and Matters in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: And, as he says in his Speech, [<hi>What the Heats, Wickedness, Passions, and Vanities of other Men had occasion'd, he ought not to be answerable for, nor cou'd be repress 'em.</hi>] Nay more, he did suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently disapprove those things which he heard discours'd of with more Heat than Judgment. But for himself, declares solemnly again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

                        <hi>That he was never in any design against the King's Life, or any Man's whatsoever, nor ever in any Contrivance of altering the Government.</hi> If so, what then becomes of all the Story of the <hi>Council of Six?</hi> and is't not to be thrown among the same Lumber with the old famous <hi>Nagshead Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> Business? 'Twill be still said he was an Ill Man, in being Guilty by this very Confession, of <hi>Misprision of Treason.</hi>—Supposing this true— That was not Death, and he dy'd, as he says, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the Crime he stood condemned for.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, every Lord has not Brow hard enough, nor Tongue long enough, nor Soul little enough to make an Informer against others to save his own Life? [<hi>I hope,</hi> says he, <hi>no Body will imagin that so mean a thought could enter into me, as to go about to save my Life by accusing others. The part that some have acted lately of that kind, has not been such as to invite me to love Life at such a rate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all this does not depend on his naked word, since the Evidence who swore against him, being such as were neither <hi>credible,</hi> nor indeed so much as <hi>legal</hi> Witnesses, the Accusation of it self must fall to the ground. If <hi>legal,</hi> they were not <hi>credible,</hi> because, as my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> observes in this Case, they had no Pardons, but hunted as the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant</hi> does, with strings about their Necks, which <hi>West,</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Letter, ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously acknowledges; and says, [<hi>'Tis through God's and the King's Mercy he was not at the apparent point of Death.</hi>] That is, in a fair construction, was not just turning over, but was upon trial, to see whether he'd do Business, and deserve to scape hanging. Much such an honourable way of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Pardon, as the Fellow who sav'd his own neck by turning <hi>Hangman,</hi> and doing the good Office to his own Father.</p>
                     <p>Nor indeed was the great Witness, the <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord,</hi> who <hi>cast</hi> this Noble Person, so much as a <hi>legal,</hi> any more than a <hi>credible</hi> Witness. No Man alive has any way to clear himself from the most perjur'd Villains Malice, if he swears against him Point-blank, but either by Circumstance of Time, or invalidating his very Evidence. Let any think of another way if they can. The first of these was precluded. 'Twas that which had before been made use of to <hi>sham off a truer Plot,</hi> and much more valid Evidence. But here <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> and the rest came to no determinate Time, but only <hi>about such a time; about</hi> the end of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> or beginning of <hi>November:</hi> and others <hi>cloud</hi> the precise time in so many words, that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to find it. All then that could be done, was as to the <hi>Person.</hi> Now what thing can be invented, which can more <hi>invalidate</hi> the Evidence any person gives, than his solemn, repeated, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Oath, indubitably prov'd against him, that such a Person is innocent of that very Crime of which he afterwards accuses him? If this be the Case or no here, let any one read the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Depositions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make an indifferent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My Lord <hi>Anglesey</hi> witnesses, <hi>He was at the Earl of</hi> Bedford<hi>'s, after his Son was imprisoned, where came in my Lord</hi> Howard, <hi>and began to comfort him, saying, He was happy in so wise a Son, and worthy a person; and who could never be in such a</hi> Plot <hi>as that. That he knew nothing against him, or any body else, of such a barbarous Design.</hi> But this was not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40336:50"/>
upon Oath, and onely related to the Assassination, as he says for himself in his <hi>paring-distinction.</hi> Look then a little lower to Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> whom the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> was with the night after the Plot broke out, and then, as well as once before, with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, did say, <hi>He</hi> knew <hi>nothing of</hi> ANY Plot, <hi>nor</hi> believ'd ANY. Here's the most solemn Oath, as he himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses voluntarily, nay unnecessarily, tho' perhaps in my Lord <hi>Bedford</hi>'s Case, Good-nature might work upon him. Here's the <hi>paring of his Apple</hi> broke all to pieces. No shadow, no room left for his Distinction between the <hi>Insurrection</hi> and <hi>Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sination,</hi> but without any guard or mitigation at all, he solemnly swears, he <hi>knew</hi> not of <hi>ANY Plot,</hi> nor <hi>believed ANY.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But 'twas no great matter, for the <hi>Jury</hi> were resolv'd to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> it, whether he did or no.</p>
                     <p>There's but one little <hi>Subterfuge</hi> more, and the Case is clear. All this Perjury, all these solemn Asseverations he tells us were only to <hi>brazen</hi> out the Plot, and to <hi>out-face</hi> the Thing for himself and Party. This he fairly acknowledges; and let all the World be the Jury, whether they'd destroy one of the bravest Men in it, on the Evidence of such a Person? But there's yet a farther An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. His Cousin, Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> who was my Lord's intimate Friend, who secur'd him in his House, to whom he might open his Soul, and to whom it seems he did, he having made Application to <hi>Ministers of State</hi> in his Name, that he was willing to serve the King, and give him <hi>Satisfaction</hi>;— To him, I say, with whom he had <hi>secret Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:40336:51"/>
and that of such a Nature—will any believe that he wou'd <hi>out-face</hi> the Thing here too? That he wou'd <hi>Perjure</hi> himself for nothing, where no danger, no good came on't? No certainly, his Lordship had more Wit, and Conscience, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; he ought to be <hi>vindicated</hi> from such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, even for the credit of his main Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> he tells us, <hi>was left out of their Councils for his</hi> Immoralities; <hi>and had he himself been such a sort of a Man, those</hi> piercing <hi>Heads in the Council wou'd have certainly found him out before, and never admitted him among them.</hi> As for the very Thing, Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> tells it as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and with as much honest Indignation as possible, in spite of the Checks the Court gave him. [<hi>He took it,</hi> says he, <hi>upon his</hi> Honour, <hi>his</hi> Faith, <hi>and as much as if he had taken an Oath before a Magi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>After all this, 'twoud be almost superfluous to go any further, or insert the Evidence given by Dr. <hi>Tillotson, Burnet, Cox,</hi> and others, not onely of his vertuous and honourable Behaviour, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

                        <p>As to his share in the prosecution of the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> he declares he acted sincerely in it, as really believing, as he still did, the truth of such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,</hi> and disclaims his knowledge of any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices with the Witnesses which he protests against as abominable, and disowns <hi>Falshood</hi>

or <hi>Cruelty</hi> ever to have been in his Nature.</p>
                        <p>He persists in his Opinion, that <hi>Popery</hi> was breaking in upon the <hi>Nation,</hi> and grieves to see <hi>Protestants</hi> instrumental to it; declares his fears of the sufferings the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> was like to undergo, and bewails the <hi>publick and shameless Impiety</hi> that abounded, and modestly admonishes all persons, and particularly his Friends, well-wishers to the <hi>Protestant Cause,</hi> that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, to live up to its Principles. Then he declares his <hi>Submission to God's pleasure,</hi> freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and desires his <hi>Friends</hi> to seek no <hi>Revenge</hi> for his <hi>Blood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After which, he looks back, and gives some little touches concerning his past behaviour, and the manner of his Treatment at his <hi>Trial.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He confesses, he moved much for the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Exclusion</hi> as the only effectual <hi>Remedy</hi> to secure both the <hi>King</hi>'s Life, the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the Frame of the <hi>Government,</hi> He thinking none of them could be safe so long as there was any hopes of a <hi>Popish Successor</hi>; and that the <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> proposed to Bind the <hi>Duke</hi> were effectual Remedies against those fears, because the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> could never be easie and safe under a <hi>King</hi> without a <hi>Prerogative</hi>: But yet imputes his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sufferings</hi> to the <hi>Revengeful Resentments</hi> some <hi>Persons</hi> retained for his <hi>Earnestness</hi> in that matter.</p>
                        <p>Next as to his conspiring to seize the <hi>Guards,</hi> he disowns that ever he was concerned in any such Design or ever heard talk of any such thing as designed, but only once, as of a thing feazible, against which likewise he warmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself, and said, the consequence of it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40336:55"/>
was so like to end in <hi>Massacring</hi> the <hi>Guards</hi> in cold Blood, that he could not but abhor the thoughts of it, as approaching too near the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Practice,</hi> at which the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him by the hand, cried out affectionately, that he saw, they were both of a temper; he adds on that occasion, that he always observed in that <hi>Duke,</hi> an <hi>abhorrence</hi> to all <hi>base things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He proceeds to shew how he went to the Meeting at Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s, at the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s earnest request, chiefly to endeavour to prevent any such disorderly proceedings as the <hi>Duke</hi> feared would be otherwise put on by some hot men, whose rash courses he did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly most vigorously oppose, and yet was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned only for not discovering them, though he endeavoured to reform them, because he would not stoop to so mean a thought, as that of going about to save his Life by accusing others for Crimes that they only talkt of, and <hi>that, as we may partly gather from his discourse, he had effectually disswaded them from too,</hi> so that his Intention was good, and his part in that Transaction, even in the strictest sense of <hi>Law,</hi> but a <hi>Misprision</hi> of <hi>Treason,</hi> and therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he cannot but think the Sentence of Death past against him to be very hard, and he by a strange <hi>fetch,</hi> brought within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Treason,</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He moreover adds, that he had so convincing a sense of his own <hi>Innocence</hi> in that Case, that he would not betray it by flight, tho' much pressed to it. He next excuses his saying so
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40336:56"/>
little at his <hi>Trial,</hi> saying, he hoped it lookt more like <hi>Innocence</hi> than <hi>Guilt:</hi> Adding, that he was advised not to confess Matter of Fact too plainly, because it would certainly have brought him within the guilt of <hi>Misprision,</hi> and so he thought it better to say little, than by departing from the Ingenuity he had always practised, by using little Tricks and Evasions, to make the last and solemnest part of his Life so notably different from the preceding course of it, as such a Conduct would have made it. He farther subjoyns, that he never pretended great <hi>Readiness</hi> in <hi>Speaking,</hi> and advises those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> that have it, to use it more conscientiously, and not to run men down, and impose on <hi>Easie</hi> and <hi>Willing Juries</hi> by <hi>Strains</hi> and <hi>Fetches, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Killing unjustly by Law, being the worst of Murthers.</hi> He then, as in several other places, repeating his wishes, that the <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> of some men, and the <hi>partiality</hi> of <hi>Juries,</hi> may be stopped with his <hi>Blood,</hi> and so, after a small hint, how by the importunity of his <hi>Dearest</hi> and most <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Lady,</hi> and some other <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> he had been prevail'd upon against his <hi>Inclinations,</hi> to <hi>Address,</hi> tho' ineffectually for his <hi>Life,</hi> he concludes with a fresh <hi>Protestation</hi> of his <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> and a Devout Prayer to God, suitable to that sad occasion.</p>

                     <head>Captain <hi>WALCOT,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>CAptain <hi>Walcot</hi> and his Fellow-sufferers, in order of time, should have gone first, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convicted before my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> and executed the <hi>Friday,</hi> as he on <hi>Saturday.</hi> But my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Fate having so immediate a dependance on the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s, and all the Plot hanging on him; especially they two making the greatest <hi>Figure</hi> of any who suffer'd on this occasion; it look'd more <hi>proper and natural</hi> to begin with them, and reserve the other to this place. Captain <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot</hi> was a Gentleman of a considerable Estate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but more remarkable for the rare Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of having Eight Children all at once living, and most of all, for his Love to his Country, which cost him his Life. We can have but little dependance, as has been before hinted, on the publick Papers relating to these concerns; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his Case, where <hi>Cartwright</hi> was engaged. What appears to us, and we may believe most reasonable, and what's agreed on of all hands, is—'That <hi>West, Rumsey,</hi> and I think one more of 'em, had frequent <hi>Discourses,</hi> at least, of killing the King and Duke — so horrid and barbarous a thing, and so like the Practice and Principles of those worst of men, the <hi>Papists</hi>; that as every true Englishman, and good Christian must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40336:57"/>
a detestation and horror at the very mention of it; so no doubt, it will be very acceptable to such to find when the thing is enquired closely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which has partly been done before, and shall now be finished, to find no probability of any thing real in the bottom, none engaged in it, but two or three Knaves, and one Fool. No Person of Honour or Character, who had heard so much as any Discourse of it, but what immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved, or detested it, as much as every good Man ought to do: Tho' some of 'em, if there were more than <hi>Walcot,</hi> might hear such mad Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, as my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> says, the Wickedness, passions, and vanities of other men might have occasion'd; and yet not believing any thing in it more than words, nor think they were obliged to turn Informers and Hangmen; which because they did not do, they <hi>suffer'd</hi> themselves. And this any reasonable man will, I doubt not, upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle free thinking, acknowledge to be <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Case, and no further. The pretended Crime for which <hi>Walcot</hi> suffer'd, and which <hi>West</hi> and others wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against him, was — Consulting the Death of the King, and charging the Guards, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>New-market,</hi> while the dreadful Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuss was to be fired into the Coach by <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold,</hi> or some others. His Privacy to Discourses about the Kings Death was but <hi>Misprision.</hi> For his <hi>acting</hi> in it, they could not have pitch'd on a more unlikely man to command a Party in so <hi>desperate</hi> an Attempt as charging the Guards, than one that was sick and Bed-rid of the Gout, as about this time, and often besides the Captain was. Nor seems <hi>West</hi>'s pretence more likely—
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40336:57"/>
That he refused to be actual in the <hi>Assassination,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>baseness</hi> of it, but offer'd to charge the Guards, while others did it—much as wisely and tenderly, as if he had denied to cut a Man's Throat, but consented to hold his hands while others did it. This he denies with indignation in his Speech, and [Appeals to all that knew him, Whether they thought him such an <hi>Idiot,</hi> that he should not understand 'twas the same thing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Kings Guards, whilst others kill'd him; or to kill him with his own hands?] Here then 'tis plain, lies the pinch of the matter; <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Rumsey, &amp;c.</hi> had been frequently discoursing at that bloody villanous rate; <hi>West</hi> was most impatiently eager of having it done — He proposed the Lopping 'em at a Play, which he said would be [<hi>in their own calling.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>For some of those who are charged with this foul business, as Promoters, or so much as Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers thereof, were the innocent or guilty as to that particular; I can assure the Reader I have the same thought of 'em, that <hi>Juvenal</hi> had of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> and can say as he does, <hi>Nunquam si quid mihi credis, amavi.</hi> But however one may add as he does, <hi>Sed quo accidit sub crimine? Quisnam Delator? Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus indiciis? Quo teste?</hi> and almost resolve all these Questions to the same way, with a — <hi>Nil horum.</hi> Never was any Party without many ill men—This no doubt, had too many whose ill Lives both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited, and in probability, ruined the best Cause in the World, as my Lord <hi>Russel</hi> intimated in his Speech. Some of these, <hi>not having the fear of God before their Eyes,</hi> might have such traiterous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; nay, and by their own Confession, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40336:58"/>
they had so—But let's not however be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in a popular Stream, which generally runs very <hi>muddy,</hi> to condemn those, who, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever personal Faults they may have had, how tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent their Nature, or bad their Morals, or ill their Character, yet seem to be no way concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in so bloody and barbarous a Conspiracy, how home soever it might be charg'd upon 'em. <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Rumsey</hi> were the main Pillars, and almost on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Witnesses on which the Credit of that Action depended, who appear all through the great and almost sole Managers thereof, and who accuse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for being concerned in it. What and how much their Credit weighs, we have already hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but shall yet confront it with further Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies relating to this matter, and that of <hi>dying men,</hi> who could expect no pardons in this World, nor 'tother for a Falshood. Besides, <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold</hi>'s solemn Protestation; see <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Speech and Paper, wherein he as deeply affirms as a man can do, [<hi>That</hi> West <hi>bought Arms for this Villanous Design</hi> (which can't be express'd with Detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough) <hi>without any direction of his—nay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Direction, Knowledge, or Privity of his.] West</hi> says in his Answer to this, as well as in his Evidence, [<hi>That</hi> Walcot <hi>joyn'd in the direction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nature and size of those Arms; that he was very Intimate and Familiar with this</hi> Rumbold, <hi>who was to be the principal Actor in the Assassination.</hi>] But <hi>Rumbold</hi>'s Death before recited, clears himself, and <hi>Walcot,</hi> and shews us what <hi>West</hi> is. In another place he affirms—That <hi>Walcot</hi> told him <hi>Ferguson</hi> had the chief management of the intended Assassination. <hi>Rumbold</hi>'s hard-name, as has been said already,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40336:58"/>
                        <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s ill Name, and the absence of 'em both, brought 'em in all probability into the business; and <hi>Walcot</hi>'s being <hi>past answering</hi> for himself or them, made it very advisable to charge so much on him. So in the same nature <hi>Ferguson</hi> was the Author of that Expression <hi>Walcot</hi> had from <hi>West, — Ferguson</hi> undertook for the Duke of <hi>Monmouth, — Ferguson</hi> proposed to see for an opportunity between <hi>Windsor</hi> and <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi>—The Men to commit the Assassination were all provided by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guson, Rumbold,</hi> &amp;c. And I remember another of 'em, or he himself talks of <hi>fifty men</hi> engag'd for the very Action. Now as meer <hi>Good Nature,</hi> and the Love I have to my Countreymen will never suffer me to believe there could be so many <hi>Englishmen</hi> found, and Protestants too, who would consent to kill their King; never any one having acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged such a design besides poor <hi>Hone,</hi> who was so stupid, he could not give one sensible <hi>Answer</hi> to what <hi>Cartwright</hi> ask'd him at his Death: So plain Testimony, and Dint of Fact and Reason, forces me to conclude these Persons here charged were not guilty. See what <hi>Rouse</hi> says of it—He was told, they did not intend to spill so much as one drop of blood. But most particularly <hi>Holloway,</hi> [He could not perceive <hi>Ferguson</hi> knew any thing of the <hi>New-Market</hi> design, but <hi>Rumsey</hi> and <hi>West</hi> were deep in't.] Again, [<hi>Holloway</hi> ask'd <hi>West</hi> who was to act the Assassination? To which he could give but a slender Answer, and could, or would name but <hi>Two Men, Rumbold</hi> and his Brother.] Just such probable stuff as <hi>Colledges</hi> seizing the King by himself at <hi>Oxford,</hi> [So that (he goes on) we found they had but few Men, if more than two, and no
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40336:59"/>
Horses, only a parcel of Arms he shew'd at a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith's.] And lower, at another time, [<hi>West</hi> only named <hi>Rumsey</hi> and <hi>Rich. Goodenough</hi> as concerned in the Assassination—<hi>West</hi> again proposed the Assassination, but <hi>none</hi> seconded him—<hi>Rumsey</hi> was for the old Strain of killing the King, to which <hi>not one</hi> consented—He could never find above five concerned in it—He heard <hi>Walcot</hi> speak against it—<hi>I knew</hi> Ferguson <hi>to be against any such Design.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, the World is left to its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to believe, at least Three Dying Mens As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severations, against those who so plainly swore others Necks into the Halter, to get their own out, that <hi>West</hi> himself is not ashamed to own in his forementioned Answer, That he was still in danger of Death, though not so eminent as it had been; not, at the apparent point of Death. And at the close of this Paper — If it shall please the King to spare my Life for my Confession, it is a great happiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which part of his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence every body will easily believe.</p>
                     <p>From all which, here lies a fair Supposition of the Innocency of this Captain, and others, of what they were Accus'd, found Guilty, Sentenc'd, and Dy'd for; it being on <hi>West</hi>'s Evidence, and such as his, that he and others were Arraign'd and Condemn'd; the Captains Defence being much the same with what he says in his Speech. 'Tis well known, that the Witnesses against Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> swore for their own lives with Halters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Necks; and it's as true that most of the Witnesses had talkt at a mad rate, in the hearing of some of those whom they destroyed;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40336:59"/>
but see, what Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> in a most solemn manner declared with his last breath.</p>

                        <p>Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> denied any design of <hi>killing the</hi> King, <hi>or of engaging the</hi> Guards, <hi>whilst others killed him</hi>; And said, that <hi>the Witnesses invited him to Meetings,</hi> where some things were discoursed of, <hi>in order to the asserting our Liberties and Properties</hi>; which we lookt upon to be violated and invaded: —That <hi>They importuned and perpetually solicited him, and then deliver'd him up to be hang'd</hi>—That <hi>They combined together to swear him out of his Life, to save their own</hi>; and that they might do it effectually, <hi>They contrived an Vntruth.</hi> — That he forgave them, <hi>tho' guilty of his Blood</hi>; But, withal, earnestly <hi>begg'd, That they might be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Remarks might be set upon them, whether their end be peace</hi>; and he concluded (with what made Sir <hi>Roger L'Estrange</hi> a great deal of <hi>Sport,</hi> but yet <hi>Heaven</hi> has made it good) That <hi>when</hi> God <hi>hath a Work to do, he will not want</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.</p>

O Lord, we pray Thee, that thou wilt afford thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to thy poor suffering Servants at this time, O Lord, thy Servant that speaketh doth confess, that the Iniquities at his Heels have justly overtaken him; O do thou bathe each of our Souls in that Fountain set open for Sin and for Vncleanness.

every one of us, from the inward Evidence of thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to say with thy Servant</hi> Job, <hi>That we know and are assured that our Redeemer lives. O give us some inward Tasts of those Heavenly Joys that we hope through the Mercy of Jesus Christ, in a little time to have a more full Fruition of. O Lord, do thou speak Peace to every one of our Consciences; though we lie under a Sentence of Death from Man, we beg that we may have a Sentence of Life Eternal from our God; and though we meet Thee, O Lord, in a Field of Blood, we beg that Thou wilt come to meet with us in a Field of Mercy. O Lord, though we have been Prodigals, we desire to return unto our Fathers House where there is Bread enough. O enable us to come unto Thee as Children to their Parents. Lord put to thy helping Hand, Lord teach us truly to leave no Sin unrepented of in any one of our Hearts. And O Lord, we beg that with us thou wilt give us leave to recommend unto thy Care</hi> our Poor Wives and Children: <hi>Thou hast promised to be the</hi> Father of the Fatherless, <hi>and the</hi> Husband of the Widow; <hi>and thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to cast the Care of them upon Thee.

O Lord, we also beseech Thee in the behalf of these Poor Kingdoms wherein we are, that Thou wilt be merciful to them, prevent Divisions among them, heal all their Breaches, compose their Differences, make all that are thine of one Heart and Mind in the things of thee our God. Lord, favour us with thy Mercy, assure us of thy Love, stand by us in the difficult Hour, take us into thine own Care, cause thy Angels to attend us, to convey our Souls as

                     <p>THe next <hi>Victim</hi> to <hi>Popish</hi> Cruelty and Malice, was, Colonel <hi>Algernon Sidney,</hi> of the ancient and noble Name and Family of the <hi>Sidneys,</hi> deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly famous to the utmost bounds of <hi>Europe</hi>; who, as the ingenious Mr. <hi>Hawles</hi> observes, was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>talkt to death,</hi> under the notion of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths Man, and found Guilty by a Jury who were not much more proper Judges of the Case, than they wou'd have been had he writ in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick.</hi> He was arraign'd for a Branch of this Plot at <hi>Westminster</hi> the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1683. where, tho' it cannot be said the Grand Jury <hi>knew not</hi> what they did, when they found the Bill against him, since no doubt they were well <hi>instructed</hi> what to do; yet it must, that they <hi>found</hi> it almost before they knew <hi>what 'twas.</hi> being so well resolv'd on the Case, and agreed on their Verdict, that had he been Indicted for breaking up an House, or robbing on the High-way, 'twas doom'd to have been <hi>Billa vera,</hi> as much as 'twas now. For tho' the Indictment was never presented to 'em before
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40336:62"/>
they came into the Hall, yet they immediately <hi>found</hi> it: The Substance whereof was, [<hi>For a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy to Depose the King and stirring up Rebellion, and writing a Libel for that purpose.</hi>] The most part of the Evidence brought against him, was only Hearsay, as against my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>; nay, <hi>West</hi> whose Evidence was <hi>then</hi> refused, now <hi>was</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to tell a long Story of what he had from one and t'other. <hi>Rumsey</hi>'s was much of the same Nature. In the Reer came that never <hi>failing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who witnesses he was one of the <hi>Council of Six,</hi> and engaged one of the deepest in their Consults. And more than that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises his own Faculty very handsomly, in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of two Speeches Mr. <hi>Hamden</hi> made on the Occasion, which indeed were such fine things, that some might think it worth the while to swear against a man, only to have the Reputation of reciting 'em; and whom they are most like, Mr. <hi>Hamden,</hi> or my Lord's own <hi>witty self,</hi> let any man Judge.</p>
                     <p>The next Evidence was a <hi>Paper,</hi> said to be of the Prisoners writing, which was found in his Study. The Substance of which was an Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the Forms of Government and Reasons of their Decays: The Rights of the People, and Bounds of Soveraignty, and Original of Power. In which were those heinous, treasonable Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, [<hi>The King is subject to the Law of God as ae Man, to the People who made him such, as a King,</hi> &amp;c.] And Examples of evil Kings and Tyrants, whom sometimes a Popular Fury had destroy'd; at others, the <hi>Ordines Regni</hi> either reduc'd, or set them aside, when their Government was a <hi>Curse</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:40336:63"/>
instead of a <hi>Blessing</hi> to their People. VVell, what Treason to be found in all this, and a great deal more? Nothing but a Jesuits enchanted Telescope cou'd have found any in it. If there were any <hi>Mistakes,</hi> as he says in his Speech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ought to have been confuted by Law, Reason, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not Scaffolds and Axes. First, 'Twas not proved to be his Writing, nor did he confess it; Treason and Life are <hi>critical</hi> things: <hi>one</hi> ought to be as fairly prov'd, as <hi>t'other</hi> to be cautiously proceeded against. Tho' he might write it, he had the Liberty of an <hi>English man,</hi> not to accuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: the very same thing which was afterwards put in practice by those Reverend Persons, who, later than he, and cheaper too, defended their Countries Liberty with only the loss of their own. But owning he Writ it, How very few, if any things therein are not now generally and almost universally believ'd, and are the foundation of the <hi>practice,</hi> and satisfaction of the <hi>Conscience</hi> of every Man, tho' then confuted with the single Brand of Commonwealth Principles, being indeed such as all the World must, whether they will or no, be forc'd into the belief of, as soon as Oppression and Tyranny bears hard upon 'em, and becomes really unsupportable. But supposing they were <hi>now</hi> as wicked Principles as they were (call'd) then; yet what was that to the then present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours? He answer'd <hi>Filmer</hi> for his own satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or rather began to do it, many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Makers of this Plot dreamt of that, or bringing him into it: Kept it private in his own Study, where it might have lain till <hi>Dooms-day,</hi> had not they fetch'd it out to make somewhat
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40336:63"/>
on't. 'Twas suggested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Innuendo'd,</hi> that this Book was written to <hi>scatter among the people</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to dispose 'em to rebel, as 'tis in the <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But how ridiculous that is, any one will see who considers the Bulk of it, which was such, that, as he says in his Speech, [<hi>The fiftie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h part of the Book was not produced; nor the</hi> Tenth <hi>of that read, tho' he desired it, and 'twas usual; and yet after all, as it had never been shewn to any man, so 'twas not</hi> finish'd, <hi>nor cou'd be in many years.</hi>] Now is this a business likely to be calculated for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>; when it cou'd neither be finish'd till seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years after 'twas over; and besides, if it had, the <hi>Bulk</hi> made if so improper to be disperst for that purpose for which 'twas pretendedly design'd? No, those who are to poison a Nation in that manner, know better things, and more likely ways. 'Tis to be done in little <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> and Papers easily read over, understood, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, as the <hi>Declaration-Gentlemen</hi> t'other day, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well knew. But still here being not a Syllable, in these Papers of King <hi>Charles,</hi> any more than of the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> or the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> against whom they might as well have made it Treason; 'twas all supply'd by a fine knack, call'd an <hi>Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo,</hi> that is, in English, such Interpretation as they'd please to affix on his words. Thus when he writes <hi>Tarquin,</hi> or <hi>Pepin,</hi> or <hi>Nero,</hi> they say, he meant King <hi>Charles</hi>; and so, scandalously of <hi>him,</hi> as well as wickedly of the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> make a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and a Ravisher of their King, and then take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way anothers Life for doing it. There was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister I have somewhere read of, who was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for writing a Libel against Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:40336:64"/>
and her Government; and the Fact there, 'tis true, lay, as this does, upon <hi>Innuendo's,</hi> though much more plain and pregnant.— But all the Punishment inflicted on him, tho' that thought severe enough, reached not his <hi>Head,</hi> the loss of his <hi>Hand</hi> being thought sufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while with that which was left, he pulled off his Hat, and Prayed God to bless the Queen. —But this was under a mild Reign, and <hi>truly</hi> Protestant Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>As for my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Evidence, had the <hi>Jury</hi> been any but such as they <hi>were,</hi> and <hi>Sidney describes</hi> them, they would not have hang'd a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit</hi> upon the credit on't; he having, one would think, that read the Tryals, taken a pride in <hi>damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> himself deeper and deeper against every new appearance in publick, on purpose to try the <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>face</hi> of the Council in bringing him off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.—To the Evidence brought against him in my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Case, he had taken care that these following should be added.</p>
                     <p>The E of <hi>Clare</hi> witnesses, that he said, after <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Imprisonment, if question'd again, He would <hi>never plead</hi> —(Had it not been a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant thing for my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to have been Press'd to death for not speaking?) and that he thought Colonel <hi>Sidney</hi> as innocent as any Man breathing: Mr. <hi>Ducas</hi> says the same, so does my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Philip Howards,</hi> and <hi>Tracy,</hi> and <hi>Penwick,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> that he said he had not his <hi>Pardon,</hi> and could not ascribe it to any Reason, but that he must not have it till the <hi>Drudgery</hi> of Swearing was over.</p>
                     <p>But though there was no reasonable Answer
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40336:64"/>
could be given to all this; tho <hi>Sidney</hi> pleaded the Obligations my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> had to him and the great <hi>Conveniency</hi> he might think there might be in his being hang'd, since he was some Hundreds of Pounds in his <hi>Debt,</hi> which would be the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way of <hi>paying</hi> him; and had besides, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, a great mind to have the Collonel's <hi>Plate</hi> secured at his own House; tho never Man in the World certainly ever talk't stronger Sense, or better Reason, or more evidently batter'd the Judges, and left 'em nothing but <hi>Railing.</hi> —'Twas all a case with him, as well as the others; and the <hi>Petty Jury</hi> could as easily have found him Guilty, without <hi>hearing</hi> his Tryal, as the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> did as soon as e're they <hi>saw the Bill.</hi> Never was any thing more base and barbarous, than the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up the Evidence and Directions to the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who yet stood in no great need of 'em: Nor more uncivil and sawcy a Reflection on the Noble <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Sidneys,</hi> than the Judges saying—That he was <hi>born a Traitor.</hi> Never any thing Braver, or more Manly, than his <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance</hi> to the King for Justice, and another Trial: Nor lastly, more <hi>Roman,</hi> and yet truly <hi>Christian</hi> than his end. The brave old Man came up on a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as unconcern'd as if he had been going to <hi>fight,</hi> and as lively as if he had been a <hi>Russel.</hi> In his last Speech he gives almost all the substance of all those Books which have been lately writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Defence of the <hi>late Transactions,</hi> and no disgrace to 'em neither; since Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son are eternal, and one and the same from all Pens and Parties, and at all times, however there may be some times so bad, that they won't bear

                        <hi>some Reason,</hi> any more than <hi>some Doctrine.</hi>—He there says as much in a little as ever Man did— [<hi>That Magistrates were set up for the Good of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not</hi> e contra] If that be Treason, K. <hi>Charles</hi> the First is guilty on't against himself, who says the same thing.) <hi>That the Power of Magistrates is what the Laws of the Country make it: That those Laws and Oaths have the force of a</hi> Contract, <hi>and if one part is broken, t'other ceases.</hi>] And other Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the same necessity and usefulness. — He besides this, gave a full Account of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his Book, of his Tryal, and the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice done him therein; of the Jury's being <hi>packt,</hi> and important points of Law <hi>over-ruled</hi>; and ends with a most Compendious Prayer, in which he desires God would <hi>forgive</hi> his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but keep 'em from doing any more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief— And then he laid down his <hi>Head,</hi> and went to <hi>Sleep.</hi>

                        <head>TO THE KING'S Most Excellent MAJESTY The Humble Petition of <hi>Algernoon Sydney,</hi> Esquire,</head>
                        <p>SHEWETH,<lb/>
THAT your Petitioner, after a long and close Imprisonment, was on the seventh day of this Month, with a Guard of Souldiers brought into the Palace-yard, upon an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> directed to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> before any Indictment had been exhibited against him: But while he was there detain'd, a Bill was exhibited and found; whereupon he was immediately carried to the King's Bench, and there Arraign'd. In this surprize he desir'd a Copy of the indictment, and leave to make his exceptions, or to put in a special Plea, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to frame it; but all was denied him. He then offer'd a special Plea ready ingross'd, which also was rejected without reading: And being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40336:66"/>
that if he did not immediately plead Guilty or not Guilty, Judgment of High Treason should be entered, he was forc'd contrary to Law (as he supposes) to come to a general issue in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not Guilty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Novemb.</hi> 21. He was brought to his Tryal, and the Indictment being perplexed and confus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so as neither he nor any of his Friends that heard it, could fully comprehend the scope of it, he was wholly unprovided of all the helps that the Law allows to every man for his Defence. Whereupon he did again desire a Copy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an Authentick Copy of the Statute of 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. whereby 'tis enacted, That every Man shall have a Copy of any Record that touches him in any manner, as well that which is for or against the King, as any other person; but could neither obtain a Copy of his Indictment, nor that the Statute should be read.</p>
                        <p>The Jury by which he was try'd was not (as he is inform'd) summon'd by the Bailiffs of the several Hundreds, in the usual and legal manner, but names were agreed upon by Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> and the Under-Sheriff, and directions given to the Bailiffs to summon them: And being all so cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, a Copy of the Pannel was of no use to him. When they came to be called, he excepted against some for being your Majesties Servants, which he hoped should not have been return'd, when he was prosecuted at your Majesties Suit; many more for not being Free-holders, which excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he thinks were good in Law; and others were lewd and infamous persons, not fit to be of any Jury: But all was over-rul'd by the Lord
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40336:66"/>
Chief Justice, and your Petitioner forc'd to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge them peremptorily, whom he found to be pick'd out as most suitable to the Intentions of those who sought his Ruin; whereby he lost the Benefit allow'd him by Law of making his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and was forc'd to admit of Mechanick Persons utterly unable to judge of such a matter as was to be brought before them. This Jury being sworn no Witness was produc'd, who fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing beyond hear-say upon your Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, except the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and them that swore to some Papers said to be found in his House, and offer'd as a second Witness, and written in an Hand like to that of your Petitioner.</p>
                        <p>Your Petitioner produc'd ten Witnesses, most of them of eminent Quality, the others of unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd Fame, to shew the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was inconsistent with what he had declared before (at the Tryal of the Lord <hi>Russel</hi>) under the same Religious obligation of an Oath, as if it had been legally administred.</p>
                        <p>Your Petitioner did further endeavour to shew, That besides the Absurdity and Incongrui-of his Testimony, he being guilty of many crimes which he did pretend your Petitioner had any knowledge of, and having no other hope of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, than by the drudgery of swearing against him, he deserv'd not to be believ'd. And simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Hands could be no evidence, as was declared by the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Keiling,</hi> and the whole Court in the Lady <hi>Carr</hi>'s case; so as that no evidence at all remain'd against him.</p>
                        <p>That whosoever wrote those Papers, they were but a small part of a Polemical Discourse
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40336:67"/>
in answer to a Book written about thirty years ago, upon general Propositions, apply'd to no time, nor any particular case; That it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to judge of any part of it, unless the whole did appear, which did not; That the sence of such parts of it as were produc'd, could not be comprehended, unless the whole had been read, which was denied; That the Ink and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sheweth them to be writ many years ago; That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> not knowing of them, they could have no concurrence with what your Petitioner is said to have design'd with him and others; That the confusion and errors in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting shew'd they had never been so much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view'd, and being written in an Hand that no man could well read, they were not fit for the Press, nor could be in some years, tho' the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them had intended it, which did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. But they being only the present crude and private thoughts of a man, for the exercise of his own understanding in his studies, and never shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any, or applied to any particular case, could not fall under the Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which takes cognizance of no such matter, and could not by construction be brought under it; such matters being thereby reserved to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as is declared in the Proviso, which he desired might be read, but was refused.</p>
                        <p>Several important points of Law did hereupon emerge, upon which your Petitioner, knowing his own weakness, did desire that Council might be heard, or they might be referr'd to be found specially. But all was over rul'd by the violence of the Lord Chief Justice, and your Petitioner
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40336:67"/>
so frequently interrupted, that the whole method of his Defence was broken, and he not suffer'd to say the tenth part of what he could have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in his defence. So the Jury was hurried into a Verdict they did not understand.</p>
                        <p>Now for as much as no man that is oppressed in <hi>England,</hi> can have relief, unless it be from your Majesty, your Petitioner humbly prays, that the Premises considered, your Majesty would be pleased to admit him into your presence; and if he doth not shew, that 'tis for your Majesties Interest and Honour to preserve him from the said oppression, he will not complain tho' he be left to be destroy'd.</p>

and to have been byassed only by the promise of pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and makes, even tho' he had been liable to no exceptions, to have been but a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Witness: He proceeds to answer the charge against him from the <hi>writings</hi> found in his <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi> by the <hi>Kings Officers,</hi> which were pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not <hi>Lawfully evidenced</hi> to be his, and pretends to prove, that had they been his, they contained no <hi>condemnable matter,</hi> but <hi>principles,</hi> more safe both to <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> too, than the pretended high-flown plea for <hi>Absolute Monarchy,</hi> composed by <hi>Filmer,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which, they seemed to be levelled; and which, he says, all intelligent men thought were founded on wicked Principles, and such as were destructive both to Magistrates, and People too.

                        <p>First says he, if <hi>Filmer</hi> might publish to the World, That Men were born under a <hi>necessary indispensable subjection</hi> to an <hi>Absolute King,</hi> who could be restrained by no Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether he came to it by <hi>Creation, Inheritance, &amp;c.</hi> nay, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="1">1. That <hi>God</hi> had left <hi>Nations</hi> at the liberty of Modelling their own <hi>Governments.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. That <hi>Magistrates</hi> were instituted for <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and not <hi>Econtra.</hi>

                     <p>MR. <hi>Holloway</hi> was by Trade a <hi>Merchant</hi>; but his greatest dealing lay in Linnen <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,</hi> which, as appears from his Papers, he had brought to such a heighth here in <hi>England,</hi> as, had it met with suitable encouragement, would, as he made it appear, have imployed 80000 poor People, and 40000 Acres of Land, and be 200000 Pounds a year advantage to the Publick Revenues of the Kingdom. The Return of the <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> Writ calls him, [<hi>Late of</hi> London <hi>Merchant</hi>] though he lived mostly at <hi>Bristol.</hi> He seems to be a Person of Sense, Courage, and Vivacity of Spirit, and a Man of Business.— All we can have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40336:70"/>
of him is from that publick Print, call'd his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, concerning which it must be remembred, as before, that we have no very firm Authority to assure us all therein contained was his own wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and perhaps it might be thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent he should die, for fear he might contradict some things published in his Name. But on the other side, where he contradicts the other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses his Evidence is strong, since be sure that was not the Interest of the Managers to invent of their own accords; tho' some Truth they might utter, tho' displeasing, to gain credit to the rest. Taking things however as we find 'em, 'twill be convenient for method's sake to take notice first of the Proceedings against him, then of some pretty plain footsteps of <hi>practice</hi> upon him, and shuffling dealing in his Case; and lastly, of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things considerable in his <hi>Narrative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was accused for the Plot, as one who was acquainted with <hi>West, Rumsey,</hi> and the rest; and having been really present at their Meetings, and Discourses on that Subject, absconded when the publick News concerning the Discovery came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country; tho' this, as he tells the King, more for fear that if he was taken up, his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors would never let him come out of Gaol, than any thing else. After some time he got to Sea in a little Vessel, went over to <hi>France,</hi> and so to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> among the <hi>Caribbe-Islands,</hi> where much of his Concerns lay: But writing to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor at <hi>Nevis,</hi> he was by him treacherously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, and seiz'd by the Order of Sir <hi>William Stapleton,</hi> and thence brought Prisoner to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where after Examination, and a Confession
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40336:71"/>
of <hi>at least</hi> all he knew, having been <hi>Outlawed</hi> in his Absence on an Indictment of Treason; he was on the 21th of <hi>April,</hi> 1684. brought to the Kings Bench, to shew cause why Execution should not be awarded against him, as is usual in that case: He opposed nothing against it, only saying, [<hi>If an ingenuous Confession of Truth could merit the King's Pardon, he hoped he had done it.</hi>] The <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi> being call'd for, order'd the Indictment to be read, and gave him the offer of a Trial, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Outlawry,</hi> which he refused, and threw himself on the King's Mercy. On which Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was awarded, tho' the <hi>Attorney</hi> who had not so much Law even as <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> was for having Judgment first pass against him, which is never done in such cases, according to which he was executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> the 30th of <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It seem'd strange to all men, that a Man of so much Spirit as Mr. <hi>Holloway</hi> appear'd to be, should so tamely die without making any manner of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when that Liberty was granted him: It seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as strange, or yet stranger, that any Protestant should have any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hat look'd like Mercy or Favour from the Persons then at the Helm, [That they should be so gracious to him, as 'tis there call'd, to admit him to a Trial, which look'd so generously, and was so cry'd up—the Attorney calling it [<hi>A Mercy and a Grace</hi>] and the Lord Chief Justice saying, <hi>He'd assure him 'twas a</hi> great <hi>Mercy, and that it was</hi> exceeding well. Now all this Blind or Mystery will be easily unriddled, by two or three Lines which <hi>Holloway</hi> speaks just af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, [<hi>My Lord,</hi> says he, <hi>I cannot undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my self, for I have</hi> confessed <hi>before His Majesty,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40336:71"/>
that I am guilty of many things in that Indictment.</hi>] Which was immediately made use of as 'twas design'd—Good Mr. Justice <hi>Withens</hi> crying out full mouth'd, [<hi>I hope every body here will take notice of his open Confession, when he might try it if he would—Surely none but will believe this Conspiracy now, after what this man has owned.</hi>] So there's an end of all t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e Mercy—A Man who had before <hi>confessed</hi> in order to be <hi>hang'd,</hi> had <hi>gracious</hi> Liberty given him to confess it again in Publick, because they knew he had precluded all manner of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before, and this publick Action would both get 'em the repute of Clemency, and confirm the belief of the Plot. Now that there had been <hi>practice</hi> used with him, and promises of <hi>pardon</hi> if he'd take this method, and own himself guilty without Pleading, is more than probable, both from other practices of the same nature used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Greater Men,</hi> and from some Expressions of his which look exceeding fair that way. Thus in his <hi>Paper</hi> left behind him, [<hi>I had,</hi> he says, <hi>some</hi> other Reasons <hi>why I did not plead, which at present I conceal, as also why I did not speak what I intended.</hi>] Other Reasons, besides his <hi>Confession</hi> to His Majesty, and Reasons to be <hi>conceal'd.</hi> Now what should those be, but Threatnings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, to induce him to silence, and publick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of all? Which appears yet plainer from another passage, [<hi>I am satisfied that all means which could be thought on have been used, to get as much out of me as possible.</hi>] If <hi>all means,</hi> then without straining, those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
                     <p>But if he made so fair and large an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40336:72"/>
here's more Mystery still; Why wan't his Life spar'd? Let any read his Confession and Speech, or these Passages observed out of them, and he'll no longer wonder at it. He was a little <hi>squeasie Conscienc'd,</hi> and would not strain so far as others in accusing Men of those black Crimes whereof they were innocent; nay, as was before said, vindicating them from those <hi>Aspersions</hi> cast upon them, and for which some of them, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly my Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> suffer'd Death. He says, [<hi>The Assassination was carry'd on but by three or four, and could never hear so much as the Names of above</hi> Five <hi>for it—That he and others had declared their abhorrence of any such thing— That</hi> Ferguson <hi>was not in it.</hi>] And besides, speaks some things with the <hi>Liberty</hi> of an Englishman, shews the very Root of all those Heats which had been rais'd — Says what was true enough, [<hi>That the Protestant Gentry had a Notion of a Devilish Design of the Papists to cut off the Kings Friends, and stirring men in both last Parliaments; That they had long had Witnesses to swear them out of their Lives, but no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to believe 'em; That now the point about the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs was gain'd, that difficulty was over; That the King had bad Council about him, who kept all things from his Knowledge; That if things continued thus, the Protestant Gentry resolv'd to</hi> get the King from his Evil Council, <hi>and then he'd immediately be of their side, and suffer all Popish Offenders to be brought to Justice.</hi>] Hence 'twas plain, no Assassination, no Plot against the King or Government intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; only Treason against the D. of <hi>York</hi> and the <hi>Papists,</hi> who were themselves <hi>Traytors</hi> by <hi>Law.</hi> But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>et one bolder stroke than all this, [<hi>He prays the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40336:72"/>
King's Eyes might be open'd, to see his Enemies from his Friends, whom he had cause to look for nearer home.</hi>] Was a Man to expect pardon after this— no certainly, which he soon himself grew sensible of, and prepared for Death, [<hi>the Council,</hi> as he says, <hi>taking it very heinously, that he should presume to write such things.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>As for what Sheriff <hi>Daniel</hi> urges, That what he says about the King were but <hi>Glossy Pretences</hi>; He answers him very well, That 'twas far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Here was plain matter of Fact: The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in eminent danger; the Fitt just coming on, which has since so near shaken to pieces all the frame of Church and State, which has so many years been rising to this Compleatness: Ordinary ways and usual Remedies could not prevail; these Protestants were forced to betake themselves to extraordinary, in defence of the Government and Laws, and not <hi>against</hi> 'em, any more than 'twould have been to have taken Arms and rescu'd the King from a Troop of <hi>Banditti,</hi> who had got pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his Person; the <hi>Papists</hi> who had him, being as visibly and notoriously obnoxious to the Government, and as dead Men in Law, most of 'em, as publick Thieves and Robbers. Thus much of Mr. <hi>Holloway,</hi> the Popish <hi>tender</hi> Mercy towards him, his Confession and Execution.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Holloway</hi> declared, that Mr. <hi>West</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Assassination, but none seconded him</hi>—That he could not perceive that Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi> knew any thing of it; and <hi>Holloway</hi> said, <hi>It was our design to shed no Blood</hi>; He being interrogated, by Mr. <hi>Ferguson</hi>'s Friend, Mr. Sheriff <hi>Daniel,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knew <hi>Ferguson</hi>; He answer'd, <hi>That he did

                     <p>BUt the next had not so fair play, because they knew he'd make better use on't. They had this <hi>Lion</hi> in the <hi>Toils,</hi> and did not intend to let him loose again to make sport, lest the Hunters themselves should come off ill by it. He had been all his Life a firm Servant and Friend to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family, in their Exile and afterwards: He had been in Prison for 'em under <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and in danger both of Execution and Starving; for all which they now rewarded him. He had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Honour and Devotion for the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and pusht on his Interest on all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being a Man of as undaunted English Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as ever our Country produced. He was with the Duke formerly in his Actions in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and shar'd there in his Danger and Honour. His Accusation was, his being concern'd in the General Plot, and that too of Killing the King; but he was indeed <hi>hang</hi>'d for running away, and troubling 'em to send so far after him. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars pretended against him, were what the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> witnessed in <hi>Russels</hi> Trial, [<hi>Of his going to kill the King when their first design fail'd.</hi>] But this was there onely a <hi>Supposal,</hi> tho' advanc'd into a form'd Accusation, and aggravated by the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40336:73"/>
as the Reason why he had a Trial denied him, when <hi>Holloway</hi> had one offered, both of 'em being alike Outlawed On which <hi>Outlawry</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was <hi>Kidnapt</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and brought over hither in Chains, and rob'd by the way into the bargain. Being brought up, and askt what he had to say, that Sentence shou'd not pass upon him, he pleaded the 6th of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. wherein 'tis provided, [<hi>That if a Person outlawed</hi> render <hi>himself in a year after the Outlawry pronounc'd, and traverse his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, and shall be acquitted on his Trial, he shall be discharged of the Outlawry.</hi>] On which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly then and there made a formal Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of himself to the Lord Chief Justice, and ask'd the benefit of the Statute, and a fair Trial for his Life, the Year not being yet expired. If ever any thing cou'd appear plain to common Sense, 'twas his Case. The Statute allows a years time, the year was not out, he surrender'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, demands the benefit of it; and all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer he could get, or Reason to the contrary, was the <hi>positive</hi> Lord Chief Justice's, [<hi>We don't think so, and we are of another Opinion.</hi>] Nay, cou'd not have so much Justice as to have Counsel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to plead it, tho' the Point sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd it, and here was the Life of an <hi>old Servant</hi> of the King's concern'd in it. When he still pleaded. <hi>That a little while before,</hi> one, meaning <hi>Holloway, had the benefit of a Trial offered him, if he'd accept it, and that was all he now desired.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lord Chief Justice answers. <hi>That was onely the</hi> Grace <hi>and</hi> Mercy <hi>of the King.</hi> The Atturney adds, <hi>The King did indulge</hi> Holloway <hi>so far as to offer him a Trial, and his Majesty perhaps might
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40336:74"/>
have</hi> some Reason <hi>for it:</hi> The very self-same <hi>some Reason,</hi> no doubt on't, which <hi>Holloway</hi> says he had for not pleading. <hi>But Sir</hi> Thomas (the Atturney goes on) <hi>deserv'd no favour, because he was one of the Persons that actually engaged to go, on the King's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty coming from</hi> Newmarket, <hi>and destroy him by the way as he came to Town; and that this appeared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as full and clear Evidence, and as positively testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as any thing could be, and this in the Evidence given in of the late horrid Conspiracy.</hi>] Now Id fain know who gives this <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>full</hi> Evidence in the Discovery of the Conspiracy. <hi>Howard</hi>'s is meer <hi>Supposition,</hi> and he's all who so much as mentions a syllable on't that ever cou'd be found on search of all the Papers and Trials relating to that Affair. To this Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> answers in his Speech, [<hi>That had he come 'to his Trial, he cou'd have prov'd my Lord</hi> Howard<hi>'s base Reflections on him to be a notorious falshood, there being at least ten Gentlemen, besides all the Servants in the House, cou'd testifie where he Dined that very day.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>Still Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> demanded the Benefit of the Law, and no more: To which <hi>Jeffreys</hi> answer'd, with one of his usual barbarous Insults over the Miserable, [<hi>That he shou'd have it by the Grace of God</hi>; ordering, <hi>That Execution be done on</hi> Friday <hi>next according to Law.</hi> And added, <hi>That he shou'd have the full Benefit of the Law:</hi>] repeating the Jest lest it should be lost, as good as three times in one Sentence. Tho' had not his Lordship slipt out of the World so slily, he had had as much <hi>benefit</hi> the same way, and much more just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than this Gentleman.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:40336:74"/>Then the Chief Justice proceeds, and tells him, We are satisfied that according to Law, we must Award Execution upon this Outlawry: Thereupon Mrs. <hi>Matthews,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, said, <hi>My Lord, I hope you will not Murder my Father:</hi> For which, being Brow-beaten and Checkt, She added, <hi>God Almighty's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Light upon YOV.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Friday</hi> after he was brought to the place of Execution, Dr. <hi>Tennison</hi> being with him, and on his desire, after he had given what he had to leave, in a Paper, to the Sheriff, Prayed a little while with him. He then Prayed by himself; and after having thanked the Doctor for his <hi>great Care and Pains</hi> with him, submitted to the Sentence, and died more composedly, and <hi>full</hi> as resolutely as he had lived. 'Tis observable, that more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty was exercised on him than any who went before him, not onely in the manner of his Death, but the exposing his Limbs and Body: A fair warning what particular Gratitude a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> is to expect for having oblig'd a true Papist.</p>
                     <p>Another thing worth remembring, in all other Cases as well as this tho occasion is here taken to do it, is, That whereas in <hi>Holloway</hi>'s Case, <hi>Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freys's</hi> observ'd, [<hi>That not one of all concern'd in this Conspiracy had dared to deny it</hi>; and lower, <hi>to deny the Truth of the fact absolutely.</hi>] Tis so far from being true, that <hi>every one</hi> who suffer'd, did it as <hi>absolutely</hi> as possible. They were Try'd or Sentenc'd for [<hi>Conspiring against the King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>] that was their Plot; but this they all deny, and <hi>absolutely</hi> too; and safely might do it:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40336:75"/>
for they consulted <hi>for it,</hi> not conspired <hi>against it,</hi> resolving not to touch the King's Person; nay, if possible, not to shed one <hi>drop of Blood</hi> of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Holloway</hi> and others say. For the King's Life, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> says as the Lord <hi>Russel, [Never had any Man the impudence to propose so base and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous a thing to him.</hi>] Russel, and almost all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, say, <hi>They had never any design against the Government.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> here says the same; [<hi>As he never had any Design against the King's Life, nor the Life of any Man, so he never had any Design to alter the Monarchy.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>As he <hi>liv'd,</hi> he says he <hi>dy'd</hi> a sincere Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> tho' he heartily wish'd he had more strictly liv'd up to the Religion he believed. And tho' he had but a short time, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self prepared for Death; and indeed, as all his Life shew'd him a Man of Courage, so his Death, and all the rest of his Behaviour, did, a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Man, a Man of good Sense, and a good Christian.</p>
                     <p>At the place of Execution Sir <hi>Thomas Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong</hi> deported himself with Courage, becoming a great Man, and with the Seriousness and Piety suitable to a very good <hi>Christian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sheriff Daniel</hi> told him, that he had leave to say what he pleased, and should not be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>unless he upbraided the Government</hi>; Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> thereupon told him, that he should not say any thing by way of <hi>Speech</hi>; but delivered him a Paper, which he said contained his mind, he then called for Dr. <hi>Tennison</hi> who prayed with him, and then he prayed himself.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:40336:75"/>In his Paper he thus expressed himself, <hi>That he thanked.</hi> Almighty God, <hi>he found himself prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Death, his thoughts set upon another World, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>That he prayed to be allowed a</hi> Tryal <hi>for his Life</hi> according to the Laws of the Land, <hi>and urged the</hi> Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. <hi>which was expresly for it; but it signified nothing, and he was with an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Roughness condemned and made a precedent</hi>; tho' <hi>Holloway</hi> had it offered him, and he could not but think all the world would conclude his case very different, else why refused to him?</p>
                     <p>That Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> charged him for being one of those that was to kill the <hi>King; He took</hi> God <hi>to witness, that he never had a thought to take away the</hi> King<hi>'s Life, and that no man ever had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to propose so barbarous and base a thing to him; and that he never was in any design to alter the</hi> Government.</p>
                     <p>That if he had been tryed, he could have proved the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s base Reflections upon him, to be notoriously false —He concluded, that he had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and now dyed of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> in the Communion of the <hi>Church of</hi> England, <hi>and he heartily wished he had lived more strictly up to the Religion he believed</hi>: That he had found the great comfort of the Love and Mercy of <hi>God,</hi> in and through his <hi>blessed Redeemer,</hi> in whom he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trusted, and verily hoped that he was going to partake of that fulness of Joy which is in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the hopes whereof infinitely pleased him.

He thanked <hi>God</hi> he had no repining, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully submitted to the punishment of his Sins; He freely forgave all the World, even those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in taking away his <hi>Life, tho' he could not but think his Sentence very hard, he being denied the Laws of the Land.</hi>

contradict, and absolutely overthrow it in every Particular, as expresly as 'tis possible to ruin any Evidence.

What sizes the Consciences of his Jury were, let any Christian, Turk, or Jew be Judge; and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has already visibly done it on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of it, who came to an untimely end, being beaten to pieces by the Fall of some Timber at a Fire in <hi>Thames-street.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>In answer to which, let's first be persuaded fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to consider what may be said in his Defence, and most part of his Vindication is over: And first—<hi>These were most, or all of 'em, the self-same Witnesses, who in the successive Tryals,</hi> White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breads, Harcourts, <hi>&amp;c. and Mr.</hi> Langhorns, <hi>could not find Credit; and who had several Witnesses who swore point-blank contrary to what they affirmed, some of whom were dead before this last Tryal.</hi> Let's then consider what Defence <hi>Oats</hi> made for himself, which in spite of his own and <hi>Jeffreys</hi> passions, seems strenuous and unanswerable.</p>
                     <p>He had in the former Tryals produced no less than Eight Persons who swore positively to his being in Town at that very time, when the Jesuits and their Younkers would so fain had him been out of it, whose Names were Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Minister of the Church of <hi>England, Sarah Ives,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Mayo,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Barker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Page,</hi>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:40336:83"/>
Mr. <hi>Butler, William Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clay,</hi> a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Priest, four of which, <hi>Mayo, Butler, Page</hi> and <hi>Walker</hi> he now produced again at his Tryal; the two first of whom positively swore the same they did before; the Minister was too old to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and the last too fearful positively to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what they had before done.</p>
                     <p>As to the 2<hi>d</hi> Indictment, a Crowd of Witnesses, such as they were, came to testifie <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>Staffordshire</hi> when <hi>Oats</hi> swore him to be in <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this same Objection he had formerly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerd, and prov'd by the Oaths of Mr. <hi>Bedloe, Sarah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>The Judgment against him was just as merciful as could be expected from Papists, acting by a <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> part of which was, [<hi>To be whipt from</hi> Algate <hi>to</hi> Newgate <hi>on</hi> Wednesday, <hi>and on the</hi> Friday <hi>following from</hi> Newgate <hi>to</hi> Tyburn, <hi>and stand on the Pillory five times a year, and be Prisoner during Life.</hi>] Which he bore with a great deal of Strength and Courage; tho had not Providence provided him a Body and Soul, made, one would think, on purpose for it, 'twould have kill'd him, if he'd had the strength of twenty Men. He had in all above <hi>two thousand Lashes,</hi> as some that were by reckon'd em up—Such a thing as was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by any Jew, Turk, or Heathen, but <hi>Jeffreys</hi>; nay, the merciful Jews thought one less than God
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40336:83"/>
Almighty had appointed sufficient, and never gave but 39 at a time; all St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s 3 times not coming near the third part of the Doctors. Had they hang'd him, they had been merciful; had they flead him alive, 'tis a question whether it had been so much torture. How good and merciful those Persons, who will vindicate this worse than barbarous and inhumane Action, are, let the World and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Ages be Judges; in the mean while we'll safely defy all History to shew one Parallel of it either on man or Dog, from the Creation of the World to the year 1685.</p>
                     <p>But there needs no more aggravation of it, or urging what is plain enough, that the thus dealing with him, even supposing his Crime as great as they'd have it was yet the highest affront and indignity even to <hi>Humanity</hi> it self. 'Twill besides this be an unanswerable Observation,— <hi>That it had been impossible for a</hi> Man <hi>to have held out the</hi> Second <hi>Whipping after the</hi> first <hi>was over, while the Wounds were fresh about him, and every new stroke more than a double torment, either to have undergone this without Confession, or dropping down Dead with extremity of pain, had he not both had truth on his side, and also a more than common support and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from him who saw his Innocency.</hi> This Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of his being the greatest Confirmation to his Evidence that was possible to be given.</p>

an Hypocrite, or a secret Villain of any Man in the World: Nor have all his Sufferings much sunk him, tho he be a little alter'd in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. He's open and frank, and speaks what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thinks of any Persons or things in the World, and bearing himself justly enough, on his Services to his Country, is not careful to keep that Guard which others do, on his Words and Actions. He has Wit enough, a pleasant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and sufficiently divertive to those he knows, and his Learning is far from contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He has a good Library, is no mean Critick in the Greek, and well acquainted with the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Fathers. He's owner of as much Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity as any Man, and as much tenderness to any in Misery, scorning to strike at those below him; an example of which very remarkable there was in his inhumane Judges Fall, he being almost the only Person who has been heard to pity him; tho' one would have thought he should have been the last. In a word, as this present Age has now begun to do him Justice, so tis not doubted will make an end on't, and those succeeding joyn with it in making honourable mention of his Name and Services to the Protestant Religion.</p>

                        <p>NExt to the Duty which we owe to God, which ought to be the Principal Care of Men of your Profession especially (because you carry your Lives in your Hands, and often look Death in the Face;)· The Second Thing that deserves your Consideration is, the Service of your Native Country, wherein you drew your first Breath, and breathed a free English Air: Now I would desire you to consider, how well you comply with these two Main Points, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in this present Service.</p>
                        <p>Is it in the Name of God, and for his Service, that you have joyned your selves with Papists; who will indeed fight for the Mass-book, but Burn the Bible, and who seek to Extirpate the Protestant Religion with your Swords, because they cannot do it with their own? And will you be Aiding and Assisting to set up Mass-houses, to erect that Popish Kingdom of Darkness and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation amongst us, and to train up all our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Popery? How can you do these Things, and yet call your selves Protestants?</p>
                        <p>And then what Service can be done your Country, by being under the Command of French
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40336:86"/>
and Irish Papists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by bringing the Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Foreign Yoke? Will you help them to make forcible Entry into the Houses of your Country-Men, under the Name of Quartering, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right?</hi> Will you be Aiding and Assisting to all the Murthers and Outrages which they shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit by their void Commissions? Which were declared Illegal, and sufficiently blasted by both Houses of Parliament, (if there had been any need of it) for it was very well known before, That a Papist cannot have a Commission, but by the Law is utterly Disabled and Disarmed. Will you exchange your Birth-right of English-Laws and Liberties for Martial or Club-law, and help to destroy all others, onely to be eaten last your selves? If I know you well, as you are English-Men, you hate and scorn these things. And therefore be not Unequally Yoaked with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous and Bloody Papists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be Valiant for the Truth, and shew your selves Men.</p>
                        <p>The same Considerations are likewise humbly offered to all the English-Seamen, who have been the Bulwark of this Nation against Popery and Slavery ever since Eighty Eight.</p>

                        <p>THE occasion of giving your Lordship this trouble, is humbly to lay at your Lordships feet, an address to your Lordship, subscribed by many thousand Loyal Apprentices of this City.</p>
                        <p>We do humbly acknowledge to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the presumption we may seem guilty of in this matter (considering our present stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) requires a far greater apology than we are able to make. But the principal reasons that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited us, thus to address our selves to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are</p>
                        <p>To demonstrate our Loyalty to his Sacred Majesty;</p>
                        <p>Our Zeal for the Protestant Religion;</p>
                        <p>And the veneration and esteem we have, and ought to have for Parliaments.</p>
                        <p>Neither indeed, my Lord, could we think these sufficient motives to stir us up to this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick application (which better becomes graver heads than ours) had not some few of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Apprentices lately presented his Majesty with an Address (which seemed to be a gratulation for the Dissolution of the two last Parliaments) which they now report to have been the act of the majority of Apprentices of this Honourable City; Although the far greater part (as may by the subscriptions to this Address appear to your

                        <p>I have one thing more to say, my Lord, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that there is a common notion about Town that this Address hath been carried on by Faction, and that none but Dissenters have been concerned in it.

                  <head>THE INTRODUCTION TO THE Western Transactions, AND GENERAL OBSERVATIONS UPON THEM.</head>
                  <p>I Am sensible 'tis a very <hi>invidious</hi> thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any Action which has had the Publick Stream and cry long against it; with which even men of Sense, and sometimes Religion too, tho' Pride or Shame perhaps seldom lets 'em own the very truth on't, are commonly hurried away as well as others. But this is, 'tis hoped, for the general, an Age of <hi>Confession</hi> and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity; and since so many of the greatest men upon Earth have gone before, in acknowledging some Notions too far strain'd, and others mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, 'twill be no real disgrace, but an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to follow them, when so much in the right. And if once Principles and Notions are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40336:99"/>
chang'd, or limited, we shall necessarily have other thoughts of Things and Persons than we had before; and that Action we call'd <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and those Men we thought <hi>Rebels,</hi> while we had a wrong slavish Notion of Obedience; when once that's regulated, and we believe with all the World, and all Ages and Nations, <hi>That we are to obey only the</hi> lawful <hi>Commands of Superiours, and submit only to such unjust ones as will not much damage the Commonwealth; but resist and defend our selves, when all we have dear, our Religion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Lives are visibly and undeniably attack'd and invaded, either without all</hi> form of Law, <hi>or what's worse, the wrested</hi> pretence <hi>of it.</hi> Then we think truly, that such men are so far from being Rebels, that they are the worthy true Defenders of their Faith and Country: and such an Action so far from Rebellion, that 'tis highly meritorious, and praise-worthy. Most men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now satisfied in these Points, unless those whom insuperable Interest or Prejudice have poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd and rooted incorrigibly in the contrary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. And the truth and reasonableness of them having been undeniably prov'd by many worthy Persons from the Law of Nations, the Ends of all Government, and the Constitution of our Kingdom, and the Practice of former Ages, both Popish and Protestant: All the Question now must be about <hi>Matter of Fact, Whether Things were then brought to that Extremity that 'twould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be too late to make any Defence for Religion and Property, if 'twere not then made; and whether or no the</hi> Fundamental Contract <hi>were then actually violated</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:40336:99"/>This is plain, that the Protestant Religion, and all our Liberties were then most eminently in danger, publick Leagues being long before made between his Brittannick Majesty and the King of <hi>France</hi> for their Extirpation: That he who had been voted in Parliament the main <hi>Head</hi> of the Popish Cause, was now grown the <hi>Head</hi> of the Kingdom; or indeed the Popish Deputy here, as he is since the King of <hi>France</hi>'s in our Neighbouring Island; That for being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was actually a Traytor; and besides, of a Religion whose Oaths could not be depended upon, as we were then, and long before to be, and have since sufficiently felt and experienced. That on this account, he hardly <hi>could</hi> keep his <hi>Contract,</hi> as 'twas plain he actually did not, publickly and notoriously violating those Laws he swore to maintain, both before and after he had done it, by going to Mass himself, setting up Mass-houses, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Popery. As for many Grievances and Oppressions, he was then as really Guilty of 'em as ever after, tho' not in such large, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and various Instances; some of 'em are those very same which the Parliament inserted among the Proofs and Reasons of the Abdicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, particularly the issuing out <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s for Cities and Corporations; the great Cause and Counsellor of which no doubt he was, even before he <hi>actually,</hi> I mean <hi>publickly,</hi> reigned.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the securing the Protestant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in all <hi>Europe,</hi> that, and their own Liberties in <hi>England,</hi> was the main Cause why many, and most engaged in this Design. If these were in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40336:100"/>
no danger, and not violated, they were <hi>Rebels:</hi> If the safety of 'em could be expected any other way but by the Sword, they were no better. Whether things were in that Condition, or no, at that time, God and the World must be Judges. If it were so, they were not Rebels: If the Case was not so bad, and the Mystery of Iniquity not so far reveal'd, as it has been since, yet preventive Physick is necessary, especially when Death is unavoidable without it. If a prudent Man is to meet Mischief rushing upon him, and not stay for't till it overwhelms him, and take the same Course against a certain <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,</hi> as an <hi>actual</hi> Evil, why then, I think 'twill be very hard to <hi>hang</hi> People in one World, and <hi>damn</hi> 'em in another, for having as little a <hi>Foresight,</hi> and great a <hi>Faith</hi> as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p>Others there were who embark't in that Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because they really thought, how much mistaken soever they might be, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was the <hi>King's Legitimate Son</hi>; which such as had a personal Love for him might more easily believe. Now, altho' many, who engaged on the former account only, did not believe this, nor know any thing of his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being proclaim'd King, nor approved of it when 'twas done; and tho' had he been able to make out his Title, or let his Pretensions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he had not wanted in all likelyhood, a sufficient Assistance from the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, none of whom for those Reasons coming in to him; yet on the other side, 'tis hardly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that these men, who thought he had a right,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40336:100"/>
were really obliged to follow the Dictates of their Conscience, though mistaken, and do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lay in their power, to the utmost Venture of their Lives, to fix him on his Father's Throne, to which they verily believed he had a proper Right and Title. And these Men too, acting on the same Reasons with the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, for deliverance of their Country, as well as defence of him whom they <hi>thought</hi> their King; The earnest Zeal, and Concern and Love which most of 'em manifested for the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, being besides so conspicuous in their Lives and Deaths, I know not how they can, without impudence, be branded with the infamous Name of <hi>Rebels</hi>; nor think 'twill be any Arrogance to honour 'em with the just, and dear-bought Title of <hi>Martyrs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One thing there is very observable in most, if not all of those who laid down their Lives in this Cause, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that, besides that extraordinary Divine courage and chearfulness with which they dy'd, they had Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions plainly boding that great Deliverance which Providence has since that miraculously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished for these Kingdoms. 'Twould be endless to give almost all the innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it: Mr. <hi>Nelthrop</hi> says, [<hi>God had in his wonderful.

                        <p>After the Dispersing of the Dukes Army, they fled and put to Sea, but were driven back again, and with the hazard of their Lives got on shore, (over dangerous Rocks) where they saw the Country fill'd with Soldiers; and they being unwilling to fall into the hands of the Rabble, and no way of defence or escape remaining to them, they surrendred themselves Prisoners to a Gentleman, whose House was near the place they landed at, and were from thence sent to <hi>Exeter</hi> Goal, the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> where remaining some time, their behaviour was such, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing visited by many caus'd great respect towards 'em, even of those that were enemies to the Cause they engaged in; and being on the 27<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> put on board the <hi>Swan</hi> Frigate, in order to their bringing up to <hi>London</hi>; their Carriage was such, as obtained great kindness frome the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and all other Officers in the Ship, and being brought into the River, Captain <hi>Richardson</hi> came and took them into his Custody, and carryed them to <hi>Newgate,</hi> putting great Irons upon them, and put them apart from each other, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liberty for the nearest Relation to see them, notwithstanding all endeavours and entreaties used to obtain it, tho in the presence of a Keeper;

                        <p>The next Opportunity I had was at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> where they both were carried, there remaining together four days: By reason of their strait Confinement our Converse was much interrupted; but this appear'd, that they had still the same Presence and Support from God, no way discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd at the approach of their Tryal, nor of the event of it, whatever it should be.</p>

Although for our Sins God hath with-held these good things from us.</hi> But he said, God had carry'd on his blessed Work on his Soul, in and by all his Sufferings; and whatever the Will of God were, Life or Death, he knew it would be best for him.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>When I came to him the next morning (when he had received News that he must die the next day, and in order to it was to be carried to <hi>Lyme</hi> that day) I found him in a more excellent rais'd spiritual Frame than before: He said, He was satisfi'd God had chosen best for him; he knows what the Temptations of Life might have been; I might have lived and forgotten God, but now I am going where I shall sin no more. Oh! it's a blessed thing to be free from sin, and to be with Christ. Oh! the Riches of the Love of God in Christ to Sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh! how great were the Sufferings of Christ for me beyond all I can undergo?

                        <p>Afterwards he prayed for about three quarters of an hour with the greatest fervency, exceedingly blessing God for Jesus Christ, adoring the riches of his Grace in him, in all the glorious fruits of it towards him, praying for the Peace of the Church of God, and of these Nations in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, all with such eminent assistance of the Spirit of God, as convinced, astonish'd, and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Pity the Hearts of all present, even the most malicious Adversaries, forcing Tears and Expressions from them; some saying, They knew not what would become of them after Death; but it was evident he was going to great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

soon to follow, discovering then, and all along great seriousness, and sense of spiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, complaining of nothing in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Circumstances, but want of place of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to converse more uninterruptedly with God and his own Soul, saying, That his lonely time in <hi>Newgate</hi> was the sweetest in his whole Life. He said, God having some time before struck his Heart (when he thought of the hazard of his Life) to some serious Sense of his past Life, and the great consequences of Death and Eternity, shewing him, that they were the only happy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that had secured their eternal States: The folly and madness of the ways of sin, and his own Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom therein, with his utter inability to deliver himself; also the necessity of Christ for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He said it was not without terror and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement for some time, the fight of unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd sin, with eternity before him. But God wonderfully opened to him the Riches of his Free-grace in Christ Jesus for poor Sinners to flee to, enabling to look alone to a Crucified Christ for Salvation: He said this blessed Work was in some measure carried on upon his Soul, under all his business and hurries in the Army; but never sprung forth so fully and sweetly till his close confinement in <hi>Newgate.</hi> There he saw Christ and all spiritual Objects more clearly, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braded them more strongly; there he experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the blessedness of a reconciled State, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the ways of Holiness, the delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Communion with God, which remained with very deep and apparent impressions on his Soul, which he frequently express'd with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Grace of God towards him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="198" facs="tcp:40336:109"/>He said, Perhaps my Friends may think this Summer the saddest time of my Life; but I bless God it hath been the sweetest and most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of it all; nay, there is nothing else worth the name of happiness. I have in vain sought sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from the things of this World, but I never found it; but now I have foundrest for my Soul in God alone.</p>
                        <p>O how great is our blindness by Nature, till God open our Eyes, that we can see no excellency in spiritual things, but spend our precious time in pursuing Shadows, and are deaf to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations of Grace and Glorious Offers of the Gospel! How just is God in depriving us of that we so much slighted and abused! Oh! his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite patience and goodness, that after all, he should yet sanctifie any methods to bring a poor sinner to himself: Oh! Electing Love, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Grace; what great cause have I to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and adore it!</p>
                        <p>He said, <hi>What an amazing Consideration is the sufffering of Christ for sin, to bring us to God; his suffering from wicked Men was exceeding great; but alas, what was that to the Dolours of his Soul, under the infinite Wrath of God? This Mystery of Grace and Love is enough to swallow up our thoughts to all Eternity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to his own Death, he would often say, <hi>He saw no reason to expect any other; I know God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely able to deliver, and I am sure will do it, if it be for his Glory, and my Good; in which, I bless God, I am fully satisfied; it's all my desire that he would choose for me, and then I am sure it will be best, whatever it be; for truly, unless God have some work for me to do in the World for his Service and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40336:109"/>
Glory, I see nothing else to make Life desirable: In the present state of Affairs, there is nothing to cast our Eyes upon but Sin, Sorrow and Misery: And truly, were things never so much according to our desires, it's but the World still, which will never be a resting-place. Heaven is the only state of Rest and Happiness; there we shall be perfectly free from Sin and Temptation, and enjoy God without interruption for ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Speaking of the Disappointment of their expectations in the work they had undertaken, he said with reference to the Glory of God, the Prosperity of the Gospel, and the delivery of the People of God, We have great Cause to lament it; but for that outward Prosperity that would have accompanied it, its but of small moment in it self; as it could not satisfie, so neither could it be abiding; for at longest, Death would have put an end to it all: Also adding, nay perhaps, we might have been so foolish, as to have been taken with that part of it, with the neglect of our eternal concerns; and then I am sure our present circumstances are incomparably better.</p>
                        <p>He frequently express'd great concern for the Glory of God, and affection to his People, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If my Death may advance Gods Glory, and hasten the Deliverance of his People, it is enough; saying, It was a great comfort to him, to think of so great a priviledge as an interest in all their Prayers.</p>
                        <p>In his Converse particularly valuing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in those Persons where he saw most holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shining; also great pity to the Souls of others, saying, That the remembrance of our former Vanity may well cause Compassion to others in that state. And in his Converse prompting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40336:110"/>
to Seriousness, telling them, Death and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity are such weighty concerns, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the utmost intention of our Minds; for the way to receive Death chearfully, is to prepare for it seriously; and if God should please to spare our Lives, surely we have the same reason to be serious, and spend our remaining days in his Fear and Service.</p>
                        <p>He also took great care that the Worship of God, which they were in a Capacity of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, might be duly perform'd; as Reading, Praying, and Singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> in which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently took great delight.</p>
                        <p>For those three or four days before their deaths, when there was a general Report that no more should die; he said, <hi>I don't know what God hath done beyond our expectations; if he doth prolong my Life, I am sure it is all his own, and by his Grace I will wholly devote it to him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> about ten or eleven at Night, we found the deceitfulness of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, they being then told they must die the next Morning, which was very unexpected, as to the suddenness of it; but herein God glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Power, Grace, and Faithfulness, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suitable Support and Comfort by his blessed Presence, which appeared upon my coming to him at that time, finding him greatly composed; He said, <hi>Tho' Men design to surprize, God doth and will perform his Word, to be a very present help in trouble.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next Morning when I saw him again, his Cheerfulness and Comfort were much increased, waiting for the Sheriff with the greatest-sweetness and serenity of Mind; saying, <hi>Now the Will of

God is determined, to whom I have referr'd it, and he hath chosen most certainly that which is best.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Afterward with a smiling Countenance, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of the Glory of Heaven, remarking with much delight the third, fourth, and fifth <hi>Verses</hi> of the 22<hi>th</hi> of the <hi>Revelations, And there shall be no more Curse; But the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, shall be in it, and his Servants shall serve him, and they shall see his Face, and his Name shall be in their Foreheads, and there shall be no Night there, and they shall need no Candle nor Light of the Sun, and they shall reign for ever and ever.</hi> Then he said, <hi>Oh, what a happy State is this! shall we be loth to go to enjoy this</hi>! Then he desired to be read to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>For we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolv'd, we have a Building of God, a House not made with Hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens</hi>; to the tenth or eleventh <hi>verses.</hi> In all, his Comforts still increasing, expressing his sweet Hopes and good Assurance of his Interest in this glorious Inheritance, and being now going to the possession of it, seeing so much of this happy Change, that he said, <hi>Death was more desireable than Life; he had rather dye than live any longer here.</hi> As to the manner of his Death, he said, <hi>When I have consider'd others under these Circumstances, I have thought it very dreadful, but now God hath call'd me to it, I bless God I have quite other apprehensions of it; I can now chearfully embrace it as an easie passage to Glory: and tho' Death s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40336:111"/>
God convey'd to his Soul in it; saying, <hi>O what an invaluable Treasure is this blessed Word of God; in all Conditions here is a store of strong Consolation.</hi> One desiring his Bible, he said, <hi>No, this shall be my Companion to the last moment of my Life.</hi> Thus praying together, reading, meditating, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing of Heavenly things, they waited for the Sheriff, who, when he came, void of all Pity or Civility, hurried them away scarce suffering them to take leave of their Friends. But notwithstanding this, and the doleful mourning of all about them, the Joyfulness of his Countenance was encreased. Thus he left his Prison, and thus he appear'd in the Sledge, where they sat about half an hour, before the Officers could force the Horses to draw, at which they were greatly enraged, there being no visible obstruction from weight or way. But at last the Mayor and Sheriff hall'd them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards themselves, <hi>Balaam</hi>-like driving the Horses.</p>
                        <p>When they came to the place of Execution, which was surrounded with Spectators, many that waited their Coming with great sorrow, said. That when they saw him and them come with such chearfulness and joy, and evidence of the Presence of God with them, it made Death appear with another Aspect.</p>
                        <p>They first embraced each other with the greatest Affection; then two of the elder Persons praying audibly, they joyn'd with great seriousness. Then he desired leave of the Sheriff to pray particularly, but he would not grant it, only ask'd him if he would pray for the King: He answered, <hi>I pray for all men.</hi> He then requested they might sing a <hi>Psalm</hi>; the Sheriff told him, <hi>It must be with the Ropes about their Necks</hi>; which they cheerfully accepted, and sung with such heavenly joy and sweetness, that many present said, <hi>It both broke and rejoyc'd their hearts.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="203" facs="tcp:40336:111"/>Thus in the experience of the delightfulness of praising God on Earth, he willingly closed his Eyes on a vain World, to pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>Mr. <hi>Christopher Battiscomb.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>HE was another Young Gentleman of a good Family, and very great hopes, and of a fair Estate, which lay in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> somewhere between <hi>Dorchester</hi> and <hi>Lyme.</hi> He had studied sometime at the <hi>Temple,</hi> and having Occasions in the Country about the time of my Lord <hi>Russel</hi>'s Business; he was there seiz'd, on suspicion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concern'd in't, and clapt into the County Goal at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> where he behaved himself with that Prudence and winning Sweetness, and shew'd so much Wit, and innocent pleasantry of Temper, as extreamly obliged both all his Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Fellow-Prisoners, and even Persons of the best Quality in that Town. 'Tis indeed a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel well-bred place, as almost any in <hi>England,</hi>
                        <pb n="370" facs="tcp:40336:113"/>
at such a Distance from <hi>London.</hi> The Streets are fair and large, and Buildings pretty regular; two sweet plentiful Rivers running by it. It stands on a Chalky Hill, but wants not store of good Water. The Market-house is a pleasant little Pile, that very much sets off the Town. There are three Churches in't, and one in its adjoyning Parish. 'Tis endowed with several Alms-houses, a good Grammar-School well enough provided, which has had the happiness of ingenious Masters, and by their Care, produced no inconsiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good Scholars. There are two or three fine old Roman Fortifications near the Town, which <hi>Camden</hi> and <hi>Speed</hi> take notice of. The People on't are generally Civil and Gallant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if not a little on the extream that way. They knew how to value such a Gentleman as Mr. <hi>Battiscomb,</hi> and made him such frequent Visits in the Prison, till the place it self was so far from being Scandalous, that there was generally all the Conversation, and where you might be sure to meet the best Company in the Town of both Sexes. Mr. <hi>Battiscomb</hi> had the happiness not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the Fair Sex, who had as much Pity and Friendship for him as consisted with the Rules of Decency and Vertue; and perhaps their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for him did not always stop at Friendship, tho' it still preserved the other bounds inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Pity is generally but a little way from Love, especially when the Object of it is any thing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. But after he had been there some time, and nothing could be prov'd against him which could any ways affect him, he was at length, almost unwillingly deliver'd from this sort of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40336:113"/>
slavery. And when the Duke landed, appear'd with him, and serv'd him with equal Faith and Valour, till the Rout at <hi>Sedgmoor,</hi> when he fled with the rest, and got up as far as <hi>Devonshire,</hi> where he was seiz'd in a Disguise, and brought to his Old Palace, the Prison at <hi>Dorchester.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He behav'd himself there the second time in the same courteous obliging manner as he did at the first, tho' now he seem'd more thoughtful, and in earnest than before, as knowing nothing was to be expected but speedy Death; Tho' his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage never droop't, but was still the same, if it did not increase with his Danger. At his Tryal, <hi>Jeffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> rail'd at him with so much eagerness and barbarity, that he was observ'd almost to foam upon the Bench. He was very angry with him, because he was a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and could have been contented all such as he should be hang'd up without any Trial; and truly, 'twas no great matter whether he or the rest had had that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality or no. Mr. <hi>Battiscomb</hi> was as undaunted at the Bar, as in the Field, or at Execution. How he demeaned himself in Prison before his Death, take this following Account <hi>verbatim,</hi> as 'twas written by his Friends. Tho' that which occur'd most remarkable after his Sentence, must not be omitted. Several Young Ladies in the Town, among whom one, who is particularly mention'd in the Poem, went to <hi>Jeffreys</hi> to beg his Life, who repulst 'em at such a bruitish rate, as nothing with one Spark of humanity would have been Guilty of, and in a manner even too uncivil to be mentioned. The Particulars may be seen in the Petition of the Widows and Orphans of that Country.</p>

                        <p>HE was observed to be always serious and chearful, ready to entertain Spiritual Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, manifesting Affection to God's People and his Ordinances; he seem'd to be in a very calm indifference to Life or Death, referring himself to God to determin it, expressing his great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as to some Opportunities of Escape that were slipt, saying, <hi>That truly he sometimes thought the Cause was too good to flee from suffering in it, tho' he would use all lawful means for his Life; but the Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God, who is an Infinite Spiritual Being, is the only suitable Object for the Soul of Man, which is spiritual in its Nature, and too large to be made happy by all that this world can afford, which is all but sensual. Therefore methinks, I see no reason why I should be unwilling to leave it by Death, since our Happiness can never be perfected till then, till we leave this Body, where we are so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally clogg'd with Sin and Vanity, frivolous and foolish Trifles. Death in it self is indeed terrible, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Courage is too low to encounter it; nothing but an interest in Christ can be our comfort in it, he said, which Comfort I hope I have</hi>; intimating much advantage

                        <p>The day he went from <hi>Dorchester</hi> to <hi>Lyme,</hi> after he had received the News of his Death the next day, he was in the same serious cheerfulness, declaring still the same Apprehension of the desirableness of Death, and the great supports of his Mind under the Thoughts of so sudden passing through it alone from the hope of the Security of his Interest in Christ; taking leave of his Friends with this Farewel, <hi>Tho' we part here we shall meet in Heaven.</hi> Passing by his Estate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Lyme,</hi> he said <hi>Farewel Temporal Inheritance, I am now going to my heavenly, eternal one.</hi> At <hi>Lyme,</hi> the Morning that he died, it appeared that he had the same supports from God, meeting De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not that thin sort of Animal that flutters from Tavern to Play-house and back again, all his Life made up of Wig and Crevat, without one dram of Thought in his composition; but one who had solid worth, well drest and set out to the World.

His Body made a very handsom and creditable Tenement for his Mind; and 't had been pity it shou'd have liv'd in any other.

And now, Dear Sister, I have nothing more to do in this World, but to be preparing and fitting my self for this place of rest, which within a few hours I am going to. I therefore leave you and yours to the protection and blessing of God, who is able to keep and Support you under this and all other his afflictive Providences, and bring a good issue out of them; and who will in his own good time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you safe to that place of happiness, where you will meet alone for Christ sake,</p>

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:40336:121"/>
be a very great and severe Judgment; that I die in expectation of the pardon of all my sins, and of acceptance with God the Father, by the imputed Righteousness of Jesus Christ, he being the end of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believes; I thank God through Jesus Christ, that I do depart under the Blood of Sprinkling, which speaketh better things than that of <hi>Abel</hi>; God having made this Chastisement an Ordinance to my Soul. I did once as little expect to come to this place on this occasion, as any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in this place or Nation; therefore let all learn not to be high-minded, but fear: The Lord is a Soveraign, and will take what way he sees best to glorifie himself in, and by his poor Creatures; and I do humbly desire to submit to his Will, praying to him, <hi>That I may possess my Soul in Patience.</hi> The Crime that was laid to my Charge, was for entertaining a Nonconformist Minister and others in my House; the said Minister be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sworn to have been in the late Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Army; but I have been told, That if I had denied them, it would not at all have affected me; I have no excuse but surprize and fear, which I believe my Jury must make use of to excuse their Verdict to the World. I have been also told, That the Court did use to be of Counsel for the Prisoner; but instead of Advice, I had Evidence against me from thence; which though it were only by hear-say, might possibly affect my Jury; my defence being but such, as might be expected from a weak Woman; but such as it was, I did not hear it Repeated again to the Jury; which, as I have been informed, is usual
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:40336:122"/>
in such Cases. However, I forgive all the World; and therein all those that have done me wrong; and in particular, I forgive Colonel <hi>Penruddock,</hi> although he told me, that he could have taken these men before they came to my House. And I do likewise forgive him, who desired to be taken away from the Grand Jury to the Petty-Jury, that he might be the more nearly concerned in my death. As to what may be objected in reference to my Conviction, that I gave it under my hand, that I had discoursed with <hi>Nelthrop</hi>; that could be no Evidence against me, being after my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Sentence: I do acknowledg his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Favour in Revoking my Sentence; I pray God to preserve him, that he may long Reign in Mercy, as well as Justice; and that he may Reign in Peace; and that the Protestant Religion may flourish under him. I also return thanks to God and the Reverend Clergy, that assisted me in my Imprisonment.</p>

I never before but saw a Beauty in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforts, but now those seem so faded by the greater Lustre and Beauty, that I see in God in Christ Jesus, that I am astonished where I have been wandring all my days, spending my time and my mony for that which is not Bread.

                        <p>THE Providence of God hath so ordered it, that your poor and ever-loving Father is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from you in such a manner as may cast both worldly Loss and Reproach upon you; but I charge you let not this be a Stumbling-block to you in the way of God, but that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Creator in the days of your Youth: That you never neglect a day without reading the Holy Scripture, wherein you'll find your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both to God and Man; there you'll find the way to everlasting Life; there you'll find Christ Jesus instructing you, and dying for you. Seek first the Kingdom of Heaven, and all other things will be added to you: After your Duty to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:40336:125"/>
mighty, your Dying Father charges and conjures you, as you'll answer it at the great day of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of our dearest Saviour, that you be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and loving to the best of Mothers, as long as God shall continue that great Mercy to you: Hearken to her Voice, and be obedient to the Words of her Mouth, for she'll be faithful to your Souls and Bodies; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>nd remember that Obedience to Parents hath the promise of this Life, as well as of Eternal Life. Pay a great Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to your Grandfather &amp; Grandmother, Uncles and Aunt, who all of them have not only testified the greatest Love to your Dying Father, but from whom, if you carry your selves as becomes you, you may expect both the good things of this World, and Advice and Counsel for what is beyond all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Blessings. Diligence in your lawful Callings to which God shall in his Providence appoint you is both commendable, and a Duty; but let not the eager pursuit of the things of this World justle out the time allotted for better things: Prayer will bless what you get in your Employments, and so at once you obtain Gods Blessing upon worldly Mercies, and find God manifesting himself to you in his dear Son, <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> in pardon of your sins, and receiving worldly things in the Covenant. Your tender Years in which I leave you in this wicked and deceitful world, may render you subject to many Temptations; but I commit you to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Fatherless, who is able to preserve you both in Soul &amp; Body; Your poor Father hath no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy to leave you, but the blessing of the great Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, which he begs for you upon the bended Knees of his Soul. The Lord God bless you with the Dew

of Heaven, and if he sees good, give you <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Portion, Food and Raiment; and if the Lord bless you with any temporal Goods, remember they are Talents, employ them well to the Masters use: No Duty so acceptable to God as Charity, that's it which your Saviour exalts so far, that he saith, <hi>Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom, for I was an hungry and ye fed me, naked and ye cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, sick and in Prison, and ye visited me.</hi> I die and leave you, but if you keep close to God and his ways, he will never leave you, nor forsake you. The Sum of the whole is, <hi>Fear God and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Do that to all others, that you would they should do to you, is the golden Rule of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and will be a great Preservative to you from offending either God or Man. Eternity calls me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and I have neither time nor opportunity to add more: Your Duties may be various in the world, as Servants, as Masters, as Husbands, as Wives, as Parents: There is no condition of Life but hath its Comforts and its Troubles; the Lord fit you for whatsoever condition he calls you to, whether Honour or Dishonour, Riches or Poverty; But remember whatsoever it be, it is Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence orders and governs the World. Dear <hi>James,</hi> as thou art the eldest, strive to be the best, and a good Example to the rest, a dutiful and a loving Son. Whatever thou or the rest have lost by me, God can make up in this Life. My dear Babes, who have been all Pledges of my Love, by the best and most affectionate Wife; I do once more beg it of you, as my last Request, that you obey, love and honour her, who hath been the greatest worldly Blessing to your Father, and will never think any

                           </gap>plicity of my heart, without seeking any private Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to my self; but thinking it my Duty to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40336:126"/>
hazard my Life for the preservation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion and English Liberties, which I thought invaded, and both in great danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost. As to the design of assassinating the late King, or his present Majesty, it always was a thing highly against my Judgment, and which I always detested; and I was never in the least concerned in it, neither in Purse nor Person, nor never knew of any Arms brought for that intent, nor did I believe there was any such design, or ever heard of any disappointment in such an Affair, or Arms, or Time or Place, save what after the Discovery of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Design, Mr. <hi>West</hi> spoke of, as to Arms bought by him: And as to my self, I was in the North when the late King was at <hi>New-market,</hi> and the first News I had of the Fire, was at <hi>Beverly</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> As to my coming over with the late D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> it was in prosecution of the same ends; but the Lord in his Holy and Wise Providence hath been pleased to blast all our undertakings; tho there seemed to be a very unanimous and zealous Spirit in all those that came from beyond the Seas: And as to the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s being declared King, I was wholly passive in it, I never having been present at any publick Debate of that Affair, and should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have advised it, but complained of it to Col. <hi>Holmes</hi> and Captain <hi>Patchet.</hi> I believe the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and Mr. <hi>F—</hi> the chief Promoters of it. As to the temptation of being an Evidence, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either into trouble or danger the meanest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Life, upon the Account for which I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, I always abhorred and detested the thoughts of it, both when in and out of danger, and advised some very strongly against it; except when under
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40336:127"/>
my Distraction in Prison, that amongst other temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations did violently assault me; but through the goodness of my dearest God and Father, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from it, and indeed was wholly incapable, and could never receive the least shadow of comfort from it, but thought Death more eligible, and was some time asore, out of my distracted and disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted condition, wholly free from it; though not without other Temptations far more Criminal in the sight of men. I bless the Father of all Mercies, and God of all Consolations, that I find a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedness of my Will to his, finding infinitely more comfort in Death, than ever I could place in Life, tho in a condition that might seem honourable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hour seeing the Will of God in ordering this Affair more and more cleared up to me. God hath given, God hath taken, blessed be his holy Name, that hath enabled me to be willing to suffer, rather than to put forth my hand to Iniquity, or to say a Confederacy with those that do so. I am heartily and sincerly troubled for what hath happened, many mens Lives being lost, and many poor distressed Families ruin'd; the Lord pardon what of sin he hath seen in it. He in his wonderful Providence hath made me and others concerned, Instruments, not only for what is already fallen out, but I believe, for hastening some other great work he hath to do in these Kingdoms; whereby he will try and purge his People, and winnow the chaff from the Wheat; the Lord keep those that are his, faithful unto the end.</p>
                        <p>I die in Charity with all the World, and can readily and heartily forgive my greatest Enemies, even those that have been Evidences against me;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40336:127"/>
and I most humbly beg the pardon of all that I have in the least any way injur'd; and in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner humbly ask pardon of the Lady <hi>Lisle</hi>'s Family and Relations, for that my being succoured there one Night with Mr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> brought that worthy Lady to suffer Death: I was wholly a Stranger to her Ladiship, and came with Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi>; neither did she (as I verily believe) know who I was or my Name, till I was taken: And if any other have come toany loss or trouble, I humbly beg their pardon; and were I in a condition, I would, as far as I was able, make them a requital.</p>
                        <p>As to my Faith, I neither look nor hope for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey, but only in the Free-grace of God, by the Application of the Blood of Jesus, my dearest and only Saviour, to my poor sinful Soul. My distresses have been exceeding great as to my Eternal State, but through the infinite goodness of God, tho, I have many sins to answer for, yet I hope and trust, as to my particular, that Christ came for this very end and purpose, to relieve the Oppressed, and to be a Physician to the Sick. <hi>I come unto thee, O blessed Jesus; refuse me not, but wash me in thine own Blood, and then present me to thy Father as righteous! What tho' my Sins be as Crimson, and of a Scarlet Dye? yet thou canst make them as white as Snow. I see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in my self but what must utterly ruine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me, I cannot answer for one action of my whole Life, but I cast my self wholly upon thee, who art the Fountain of Mercy, in whom God is reconciling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the World, the greatest of Sins and Sinners may find an All sufficiency in thy Blood to cleanse 'em from all sin. O dearest Father of Mercy, look upon me as righteous in and through the imputed Righteousness of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:40336:128"/>
thy Son; he hath payed the Debt by his own own Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up himself for sin, and in that thy Justice is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and thy Mercy is magnified. Grant me thy Love, O dearest Father, assist me and stand by me in the needful hour of Death, give thy Angels charge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my poor Soul, that the Evil One may not touch nor hurt it. Defend me from his power, deliver me from his rage, and receive me into thine Eternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in and through the alone Merits of my dearest Redeemer, for whom I praise thee: To whom with thy self and holy Spirit be ascribed all Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Power, Might and Dominion, for ever and for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>JOB</hi> tells us, <hi>Man that is born of a Woman, is of few days and full of trouble</hi>; and I am a clear Instance of it. I shall not now say any thing of my Sentence, or escape about three years and a half ago; nor of my return, lest I may thereby give Offence, or be tedious: Only being to end my days in your Presence, I shall, as some of my last Words, assert the truth of the matter of Fact, and the Sincerity of my Intentions, and Professions that are published.</p>
                        <p>That which I intend mainly now to say, is, To express my humble, and (I thank God) chearful Submission to his Divine Will; and my willingness to forgive all Men, even my Enemies, and I am heartily well satisfied there is no more Blood spilt, and I shall wish the stream thereof may stop at me: And that (if it please God) to say, as to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> Zech. 4.6. <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I know Afflictions spring not out of the dust: God did wonderfully deliver and provide for me, and has now by his special Providence brought me to this place; and I hope none will either insult, or stumble at it, seeing they ought not; for God Almighty does all things well, for good and holy. Ends, tho we do not always understand it. Love and hatred is not known by what is before us, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.1. and 8.11, 12, 13.</p>

                        <p>We are neither to despise our Afflictions, nor to faint under them; both are extreams.</p>
                        <p>We are not to suffer our Spirits to be exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated against the Instruments of our trouble; for the same Affliction may be an effect of their Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet sent by God to punish us for sin: Tho 'tis a comfort when we may say to them, with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 59.3. <hi>Not for my transgession, nor for my sin, O Lord.</hi>

shift that might be in the least sinful: I did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and yet do judge it better to suffer Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; therefore I am come hither to lay down my life; I bless the Lord I dye not as a Fool dyeth, though I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I have nothing to boast of in my self: Yea I acknowledge I am a sinner, and one of the chiefest that hath gone under the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor of Religion; yea amongst the unworthiest of those that have preached the Gospel; my Sins and Corruptions have been many, and have defiled me in all things; and even in following and doing of my Duty, I have not wanted my own sinful Infirmities and Weaknesses, so that I may truly say, I have no Righteousness of my own, all is evil and like filthy Rags; but blessed be God that there is a Saviour and an Advocate, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the Righteous, and I do believe that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is come into the World to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am the chief, and that through Faith and his Righteousness I have obtained Mercy; and that through him, and him alone, I desire and hope to have a happy and glorious Victory over sin, Satan, Hell, and Death; and that I shall attain unto the Resurrection of the just, and be made Partaker of Eternal Life. I know in whom I have believed, and that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. I have according to my poor Capacity, preached Salvation in his Name; and as I have preached, so do I believe, and with all my Soul have commended it, and still do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all of you the riches of his Grace, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:40336:138"/>
Faith in his Name, as the alone and only way whereby to come to be saved.</p>
                     <p>It may be many may think (but I bless the Lord without any solid ground) that I suffer as an Evil-Doer, and as a busie body in other mens matters; but I reckon not much upon that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Testimony of my own Conscience for me. It was the lot of our blessed Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and also the lot of many of his eminent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servants and People to suffer by the World as Evil-doers: Yea I think I have so good ground not to be scar'd at such a Lot, that I count it my <hi>non-such honour</hi>; and Oh what am I that I should be honoured so, when so many Worthies have panted after the like, and have not come at it: My Soul rejoyceth in being brought into Conformity with my Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lord, and Head, and so Blessed a Company in this way and lot; and I desire to pray that I may be to none of you this day upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and blessed is he that shall not be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Christ and his poor Followers and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, because of their being Condemned as Evil-doers by the World.</p>
                     <p>As for these things for which Sentence of Death hath past against me, I bless the Lord my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science doth not condemn me, I have not been Rebellious, nor do I judge it Rebellion for me to have endeavoured in my Capacity what pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly I could for the born-down and ruined in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of my Lord and Master, and for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of my poor Brethren afflicted and persecuted, not only in their Liberties, Priviledges, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:40336:138"/>
but also in their Lives; therefore it was that I joyned with that poor handful; the Lord knows, who is the searcher of Hearts, that neither my design nor practice was against his Majesty's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and just Government, but I always studied to be Loyal to lawful Authority in the Lord, and I thank God my heart doth not condemn me of any Disloyalty; I have been Loyal, and I do recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to all to be Obedient to higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>I have been looked upon by some, and represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others to be of a divisive, and Factious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and one that stirred up division in the Church, but I am hopeful that they will all now give me their Charity, being within a little to stand before my Judge, and I pray the Lord forgive them that did so misrepresent me; but I thank the Lord whatever Men have said against me concerning this, that on the contrary, I have often disswaded from such way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And as concerning that, for which I am condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I Magnifie his grace, that I never had the least challenge for it, but on the contrary, I Judge it my Honour, that ever I was counted worthy to come upon the Stage upon such a consideration; another thing that renders the most despicable Lot of the <hi>Christian,</hi> and mine sufferable, is a felt and sensible presence from the Lord, strengthening the Soul when most put to it, and if I could have this for my Allowance this day, I could be bold to say; O death where is thy sting! and could not but cry out Welcome to it, and all that follows upon it: I grant the Lord from an act of Soveraignty may come, and go as he pleases, but yet he will never forsake his people, and this is a Cordial to me in the Case I am now exposed unto.</p>

                        <pb n="426" facs="tcp:40336:141"/>Thirdly, The exercising and putting forth his glorious Power, is able to Transport the Soul of the Believer, and mine, above the reach of all sublunary Difficulties, and therefore seeing I have hope to be kept up by this power, I would not have you to look upon my Lot, or any other that is or may be in my C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, That I may come a little nearer to the purpose in hand, I declare before you all, in the sight of God, Angels and Men, and in the sight of that Son and all that he has Created, that I am a most miserable Sinner, in regard of my Original and Actual Transgressions. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess they are more in number than the Hairs of my Head. They are gone up above my Head, and are past numbring; I cannot but say as <hi>Jacob</hi> said, I am less than the least of all God's Mercies, yet I must declare to the exalting of his Free Grace, That to me who am the least of all Saints is this Grace made known, and that by a strong hand, and I dare not but say, he has loved me, and washed me in his own Blood from all Iniquities, and well is it for me this day, That ever I heard or read that faithful saying; that Jesus Christ came into the World to save Sinners, of whom I am chief.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, I must also declare in his sight, I am the most unworthiest that ever opened his mouth to preach the unsearchable Riches of Christ in the Gospel. Yea, the sense of this made me altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unwilling to fall about so great a Work, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:40336:141"/>
by the importunity of some, whose Names are precious and savoury to me and many others, I was prevailed with to fall about it, and yet I am hopeful, not altogether without s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the next place, though to many I die desired, yet I know, to not a few my Death is not desired, and it is the rejoycing of my heart, that I die in the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has loved me, and given himself for me, and in the Faith of the Prophets and Apostles, and in this Faith of there's not a Name under Heaven by which Men can be saved, but the Name of Jesus, and in the Faith of the Doctrine and Worship of the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as it is now established according to the Word of God, Confession of Faith, Catechisms larger and shorter, and likewise I joyn my Testimony against Popery, Perjury, Profanity, Heresie, and everything contrary to found Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>In the Close, as a dying Person, and as one who has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful, I would humbly leave it upon godly Ministers to be faithful for their Lord and Master, and not to hold

                        <pb n="429" facs="tcp:40336:142"/>Again, that Christians of Grace and Experience would study more streightness and stability in this day, when so many are turning to the right hand, and many to the left; he that endureth to the end shall be saved; he has appointed the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for such as continue with him in his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>

Oh! when shall we get up and run after him, till he bring us into the promised Land, let us up and after him with all our heart, and never rest till he return.</p>
                     <p>I recommend my Wife and young one to the care and faithfulness of the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>; the God that has fed me to this day, and who is the God of my Salvation, their God and my God, their Father and my Father, I am also hopeful, that Christians, Friends and Relations, will not be unmindful of them when I am gone.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I do further bear my Testimony to the Cross of Christ, and bless him that ever he count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me worthy to appear for him in such a lot as this: Glory to him that ever I heard tell of him, and that ever he fell upon such a method of dealing with me as this; and therefore let none that loves Christ and his Righteous Cause be offended in me.</p>

the Faith of it, that there will be a Resurrection of his Name, Word, Cause, and of all his Interest therein, tho' I dare not determine the time when, nor the manner how, but leave all these things to the infinitely wise God, who has done, and will do all things well. Oh that he would return to this Land again, to repair our Breaches, and take away our Back-sliding, and appear for his Work: Oh that he were pacified towards us: Oh that he would pass by <hi>Scotland</hi> once again, and make our time a time of Love, <hi>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.</hi> Himself hasten it in his own time and way.

By reason of some passages in his Life, not so defensible; 'twas thought, at first, better to draw a <hi>veil</hi> before that unfortunate Prince, and say nothing at all of him. But what allowances are made for Custom and Education, God only knows. I remember a shrewd Answer given to an Objection of this Nature, <hi>Where,</hi> said one, <hi>shou'd he learn any better</hi>? But however, where there has been any time to think soberly of past actions, or none of that nature reiterated, Charity is oblig'd to judge fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably.

He was all along true and firm to the Protestant Interest in and out of Parliament, tho abhorring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny base way of promoting it, as well as his Friend my L. <hi>Russel.</hi> This intended as a Character rather, or very short <hi>Compendium,</hi> than any History of his Life.

                        <p>AS Government was Originally instituted by God, and this or that Form of it chosen and submitted to by Men, for the Peace, Happiness and Security of the Govern'd, and not for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interest and personal Greatness of those that Rule: So That Government hath always been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed the best, where the Supream Magistrates have been invested with all the Power and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, that might capacitate them, not only to preserve the People from Violence and Oppression, but to promote their Prosperity; And yet where nothing was to belong to them by the Rules of the Constitution, that might enable them to injure and oppress them. And it hath been the Glory of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> above most other Nations, that the Prince had
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:40336:145"/>
all intrusted with him that was necessary, either for the advancing the Wellfare of the People, or for his own Protection in the discharge of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; And withall stood so limited and restrained by the Fundamental Terms of the Constitution, that without a Violation of his own Oath, as well as the rules and measures of the Government, he could do them no hurt, or exercise any act of Authority, but through the administration of such hands as stood obnoxious to be punished, in case they transgressed: So that according to the Primitive Frame of the Government, the Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Priviledges of the Subject, are so far from justling one another, that the Rights reserved unto the People, tended to render the King Honourable and Great, and the Prerogatives setled on the Prince were in order to the Subjects Protection and Safety. But all humane things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subject to perversion as well as decay, it hath been the fate of the English Government to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wrested from what it was in the first settlement and institution. And we are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly compelled to say, that all the boundaries of the Government have of late been broken, and nothing left unattempted for turning our limited Monarchy into an absolute Tyranny. For such hath been the transaction of Affairs within this Nation for several years last past, that though the Protestant Religion and Liberties of the People were fenced and hedged about by as many Laws as the Wisdom of man could devise for their Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Popery and Arbitrary Power, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath been all along countermined by Popish Counsels, and our Priviledges ravished from us
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:40336:145"/>
by Fraud and Violence. And more especially, the whole Course and Series of the Life of the D. of Y. hath been but been one continued Conspiracy against the Reformed Religion and the Rights of the Nation.

Being there,

after having set up his Horse where he used to do, often having occasion there, he was much tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to engage in the Design, but he refused it, but the next morning made haste out of Town, not seeing the Duke at all; calling for his Horse it was told him, <hi>That it was seized for the Duke</hi>'s <hi>Service.</hi> So then he took his Cane and Gloves, and walked to his own House, which was about five or six Miles, and was no more concern'd in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, than that after the Duke's Defeat at <hi>Kings-Sedge-Moore,</hi> some busie person informeth, and requireth a Warrant from a Justice of Peace for the said Mr. <hi>Bragg,</hi> who obliged himself to enter into a Recognizance to appear at the next Assizes, the said Justice accounting the matter in it self but trivial; and indeed all Men did judge him out of danger.

Mr. <hi>Hamling</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly an Inhabitant of the place, but of late years had lived two or three Miles from thence; he was a very honest, worthy, good <hi>Christian,</hi> but
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:40336:166"/>
was a <hi>Dissenter,</hi> and indeed in the judgment of some fiery men, that might be Crime enough, as did too sadly appear in divers Cases. But to our purpose: Mr. <hi>Hamling</hi> living in the Country, hearing of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s being in Town, he there came to speak with his Son, who lived in that place; where being come, he gave him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which was, <hi>That as he expected his Blessing, and Countenance, he should not at all concern himself in the matter, but submit to the VVill of God in all things.</hi> And having thus advised his Son, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns home; and two days after came again to Town on a Market day with his Wife, to buy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for his Family, and returned to his House again. And this was all the times he was in Town, whiles the Duke was there. But after the Business was over, he was brought in on Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, being a <hi>Dissenter,</hi> that was Crime enough, except Coin appear'd to a <hi>Justice</hi> of that Town, who usually did commit or dismiss as that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.

The Prisoner had many to prove this Fact, and his Honesty; but this did not avail, the Jury found him Guilty, with two more, who were presently Sentenc'd, and next morning executed for to be <hi>Examples</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It is said, that the <hi>Justice</hi> did make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to our famous <hi>Protestant Judge,</hi> and hinted some Mistake concerning him.

                     <p>There was one Mr. <hi>Gatchett</hi> executed with him, his Crime, being a Constable of the Hundred, he was surprized by a Party of the Dukes, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Warrant to bring in Provisions and other Necessaries for the use of the Army, which if he had not obeyed, was threatned to have his House burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that he was obliged to do what he did for his own preservation; but this was not sufficient, for being found Guilty he was also execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the same time and place.</p>

Secondly, The said Mr. <hi>Charles Speake</hi> had purchased some great place in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi>-or <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> which was very profitable to him; so that by his Fall there being a Forfeiture, much money may be made of it; all intercession could not avail with the L.

He was a fine Courteous loving Gentleman; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Youth, he acted the part of an old Christian Soldier at his Death, preparing himself to undergo those pains, saying very often, <q>They were nothing to his Deserts from God Almighty; but as for what I am accused of, and Sentenc'd for, I hope you will believe I am not so guilty, as my Judge and Accusers have endeavour'd to make me: If it had pleased God, I should have been willing to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved some time longer, but God's time being come, I am willing, I will be contented to drink this bitter Cup off.</q> Being at the place of Execution, the croud was so great, that I suppose he was shorter than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he would have been; but alas! how could it be? for on every side of him, as well as up and down the Town, the Inhabitants were weeping and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: <hi>Oh' tis the worst day that ever we saw in this Town!

His Father and Mother you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily judge were not a little concerned about him; but their Adversaries malice ended not here, but Father and Mother must be brought in, and how many thousands of Pounds it cost them, I think is too well known in <hi>London</hi>; and most Parts of the Kingdom have heard in the Publick Letters their names mentioned.

But the Character I had, was, <q>That he desired all not to be faint-hearted because of their fall, and to think that there was no hopes remaining.

He was apprehended near <hi>Salisbury,</hi> brought to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> where I saw him several times, and was conversant with him before his Tryal; he carried himself very moderately to all; some of divers Principles in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he continually prayed with them, advising and instructing them to those holy Duties which were necessary to Salvation: Being asked, how he could endure those hardships he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, since his being taken? Says he, <q>If this

be all, 'tis not so much; but my Friend, if you were to take a Journy in those ways you were not acquainted with, you would (I hope) desire Advice from those that had formerly used those ways, or lived near by them: Yes, says he: Then said he, The ways of Affliction which I have lately travelled in, I had Advice many a time from a Minister, who hath often told his Congregation of the troublesomness of the Road, and of the difficulty of getting through; and has given me, and hundreds of others to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the pitts and stones in the way, and how to avoid them; he has been a Man used to those Roads many years; I have taken his Advice; I am got thus far on comfortably, and I trust shall do so to the end; I am not afraid to fight a Duel with Death, if so it must be: Now I thank God I can truly say, O Death where is thy Sting? and O Grave, where is thy Victory?</q> Two or three days after their Sentence, they were drawn to Execution, but were very rudely and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briously dealt with, to the shame of those that then had the charge over them, their Rigor unto them was more like <hi>Turks</hi> than <hi>Christians.</hi> But to conclude, being come to the place of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he prayed very devoutly with them all, but by the rudeness of the Guards, there could be no Copy taken to be said to be true: All of them dyed very Couragious, especially this stout Christian Champion, who spake to them in these words, (looking on the Souldiers) saying, <q>Little do you think that this very Body of mine, which you are now come to see cutt in pieces, will one day rise up in judgment against you, and be your

Accuser, for your delight in spilling of Christian Blood; the Heathens have far more Mercy: O 'tis sad, when <hi>England</hi> must outstrip Infidels and Pagans! but pray take notice, don't think that I am not in Charity with you; I am so far, that I forgive you and all the World; and do desire the God of Mercies to forgive you, and open your hearts, and turn you from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to the Lord Jesus Christ; and so Farewell. I am going out of the power of you all; I have no dependence but upon my blessed Redeemer, to whom I commit my dear Wife and Children, and all the World.</q>

The very Beasts refused to draw them; and instead of going forward they went backwards, and could by no means make them do it, which so inraged some Persons, that they took the Coach Horses out of the Coach, and placed them to the Sledge; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the Sledge broke in pieces; then spake this worthy good Man: Pray <hi>Gentltmen</hi> you see all your strivings will not do, to draw us to Execution, I verily believe there is more in it than you are aware of; pray read about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that went out of Gods way, his Beast saw that he could not.</p>

                        </gap> (commonly called the <hi>Protestant</hi>) Religion, which is founded on the pure written Word of God only, and which I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge likewise to be comprehended in the Article of the Doctrine of the Church. This Religion I have made a reasonable and free choice of, and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:40336:178"/>
have heartily embraced, not only as it protests a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Pagan and Mahometan Religion, but against the Corruption of the Christian; and I humbly and earnestly pray to God that by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom and Almighty Power, he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not only the utter extirpation but diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, by the heighth and influence of what is contrary thereto; and for that end the Lord make the Professors of it to live up more to its Principles and Rules, and bring their Hearts and Conversations more under the Government and Power of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I die also owning my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, Non-conformity, for which I have suffer'd so much, and which doth now obstruct the King's Grace and Mercy to be manifested and extended to me: For as I chose it not constrainedly, so I appeal to God as a dying Man, not moved from sullenness or humour, or factious temper, or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Principles of Education, or from secular interests, or worldly advantages, but clearly from the Dictates of my own Conscience, and as I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be the Cause of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and to have more of Divine Truth in it than that which is contrary thereto; so now I see no Cause to repent of it, nor to recede from it; not questioning but God will own it at the last Judgment-day. If no more had been required after the late King's Restauration to qualifie Ministers for publick Preaching, than was after the first Restauration from the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the First, probably I might have satisfied my self therewith, and not scrupled Conformity thereto; but the Terms and Conditions thereof by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Law made in 1662. being not only new, but so strict and severe that I could never have
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:40336:179"/>
satisfaction in my own Conscience, after all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours used for a Complyance therewith, and a Conformity thereto: To say nothing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which I never took, but the giving my Assent and Consent, have been too difficult and hard for me to comply with. And I very well remember, that about fourteen years ago, entring into a Discourse with Mr. <hi>Patrick Heldore,</hi> an <hi>Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who was contemporary with me in <hi>Dublin,</hi> concerning Conformity, which he much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to persuade me to; I urg'd the severity of the forementioned Conditions against it, and after some Debates and Reasons with him, I told him I did believe they were contrived and designed on purpose to prevent our Publick Preaching, and to keep us out of the Church: To which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously reply'd, <hi>He judged it was so: For,</hi> said he, <hi>a Bishop in</hi> Ireland (<hi>whose Name I have forgot) told me the very same.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though I could not wade through and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer this Difficulty, yet I censure not those that did it; and I believe after all the hottest Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and most vehement Debates, and violent Contests between Conformist and Non-conformist, there are of both Parties will be glorified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hereafter. According to the 29th. Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a visible Church is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Faithful Men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, the Sacraments of the Lord duly administred, according to Christ's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and all those things that of neccessity are requisite and necessary to Salvation; so with such a Church have I held the most intimate Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with such (did I live) could hold it: I
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:40336:179"/>
would not therefore be so incorporated with any Church, as to exclude me from, and render me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of holding Communion with other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; I was never strongly bound up to any form of Ecclesiastical Government, but that under which a pure and undefiled Religion doth flourish, and that which contains and really practises Holiness, and advances the Kingdom of God in the World, that can I approve of, and willingly live under, were I to live.</p>
                     <p>I did approve of the ancient and present form of Civil Government, <hi>English</hi> Monarchy I am fully satisfy'd with, and do also declare, that it is not warrantable for any Subject to take up Arms against, and resist their lawful Soveraigns and rightful Princes: and therefore had I not been convinced by several things that I have read and heard, to believe that the late D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was the Legitimate Son of his Father <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, I had never gone into his Army, judging that without this, I could not be freed from the guilt of Rebellion, which I always resolved to keep my self clear from: And tho' his Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd he was marry'd to his Mother, I thought it might be answer'd with this; That Kings and Princes, for State reasons, often cannot be fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Subjects, affirming and denying things which otherwise they would not do, and make even their natural Affections to truckle and stoop thereto. I exhort all to abhor all Treasonable Plots, and pretences of all Rebellion, with the highest Detestation, and to take the plain Text of Sacred Scripture to walk by, in honouring and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, and living in subjection to rightful Kings,

                     <head>The Behaviour and Dying Words of Mr. <hi>Roger Satchel,</hi> who was executed at <hi>Weymouth</hi> in the County of <hi>Dorset.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis Gentleman, at the time of the Dukes land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Lyme,</hi> lived at <hi>Culliton,</hi> about five Miles <hi>West</hi> of that Town, and was supposed to be concerned in the design with the Duke. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was a great Admirer of him, which got him many Enemies among the Gentry of that County: He always hated the name of a Papist; and as it fell out, he did foresee Popery advancing, as his Words to divers of his Neighbours can testifie. As for his Disposition, he was of a very generous and Heroick Spirit. But to proceed, No sooner had he the news of the Dukes being landed, but he sets himself to work to serve him, desiring all he knew to joyn with him, and was one of the first that went to him to <hi>Lyme,</hi> and was with him to the end: But after the Rout, travelling to and fro, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himself, was at last taken at <hi>Chard</hi> by three <hi>Moss Troopers,</hi> under no Discipline, who made it their business to ruine their Neighbours in those parts; they are so well known, I need not say any more: He was from thence carry'd to <hi>Ilchester,</hi> and so secured in <hi>Ilchester</hi> Goal; and at the Bloody Assizes at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> took his Tryal, and received his Sentence with the rest: Great application was made for him; but my L. C. Justice <hi>Jeffreys</hi> Ears were deaf, and so was order'd to be executed at <hi>Weymouth.</hi> After Sentence, two of his Friends came to him, and told him, There was no hope.
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:40336:193"/>
He answer'd, <hi>My hope is in the Lord.</hi> After which he spent most of his time, before Execution, in Prayer and Meditation, and conferring with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Persons. The morning being come, he prepared himself, and all the way drawing to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution was very devout. Being come to the place, there was a Minister, I think, of that place, who sung a Psalm, and prayed with them, and would have some Discourse with this Person, which he avoided as much as possible; but he asked him, What were his Grounds for joyning in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion? who answered, <hi>Had you, Sir, been there, and a Protestant, I believe you would have joyned too; but do not speak to me about that, I am come to die for my sins, not for my Treason against the King, as you call it.</hi> So pointing to the Wood that was to burn his Bowels, he said, <hi>I do not care for that; what matters it what becomes of my Body, so my Soul be at rest.</hi> So praying to himself near half an hour, and advising some he knew never to yield to Popery, he was turned off the Ladder. He was a couragious bold spirited Man, and one of great Reason, Just and punctual in all his business, and one that did much good amongst his Neighbours.</p>
                     <p>There was at the same time and place one Mr. <hi>Lancaster</hi> executed, whose Courage and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was such, that he out-braved Death, and in a manner challenged it to hurt him, saying, <q>I die for a good Cause, and am going to a gracious God. I desire all your Christian Prayers; 'tis good to go to Heaven with Company.</q> And much more he spake concerning the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> whom he supposed at that time to be living; and
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:40336:193"/>
so praying privately for some small time, he was turned, or rather leaped over the Ladder.</p>
                     <p>If I mistake not, he said he was born or lived in <hi>Bridport.</hi>

                     <p>HE with Nine more were brought from <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> to <hi>Bridport</hi> to be Executed. Coming to the place of Execution, he held up his Hands to Heaven, and turning himself to the People, said, <hi>I am an Old Man you see, and I little thought to have ended my days at such a shameful place, and by such an ignominious Death; and indeed it is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Flesh and Blood, as well as a Reproach to Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but it would have been a great deal more, if I had suffered for some Felonious Account.</hi> Says one to him, <hi>Is not this worse do you think than Felony?</hi> He answered, <hi>I know not any thing that I have done so bad as Felony, that this heavy Judgment should fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, except it be for my sins against my God, whom I have highly provok'd, and must acknowledge have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served ten thousand times more; Lord!</hi> I <hi>trust thou hast pardoned them; Seal my pardon in the Blood of my Saviour; Lord look upon, and be with me to the last Moment.</hi>

a certain Person inform'd his Lordship that the Prisoner, then at the Bar, had Alms of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish: And that his Lordship should reply, <hi>Do not trouble your selves, I will ease the Parish of that trouble.</hi> In Prison, and at the place of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he behaved himself so to all, that many of his Enemies pitied him, and would, if it had lain in their power, (as they said) have saved him.

                     <p>THE said Mr. <hi>Gatchill</hi> was a Constable of the Hundred; he was surprized by a Party of the Dukes, and shewed a Warrant to bring in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and other Necessaries for the use of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which if he had not obeyed, was threatned to have his House burnt; so that he was obliged to do what he did for his own Preservation. But this was not sufficient, for being found Guilty, he was Executed. As he was drawn to Execution, he looked on the People, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fore he was Executed, he spake, <hi>That the Crime he was Accused of, and Condemned for, was High Treason; but he did not know himself to be Guilty of it; and that what he did he was forced to do.</hi> And further said, <hi>I am so well known to you, that I do verily believe you have Charity to think that what I speak is true. As for the Niceties of the Law, I do not well understand them.</hi> And much more to the same effect he spake. And so after Prayer with his suffering Brother, Mr. <hi>Simon Hambling,</hi> he was Executed.</p>

                        <pb n="521" facs="tcp:40336:196"/>There was also Executed at <hi>Taunton</hi> Mr. <hi>John Hucker,</hi> a very worthy Gentlman of that Town. He had some ill Friends in the Duke's Army, that cast Aspersions on him, as though he was the Person that was a Traytor to the Duke, by firing a Pistol in <hi>Sedgmoor</hi>; but I have strictly examined many on that Point, and can find it to be nothing but the worst of an Enemies Malice, to wound him after his Death in his Reputation, which he always valued highly when living. To be short, he has left the Character amongst his Neighbours, of an honest Man, a good Christian, and one that was true to the Interest of the Duke, and Sealed it with his Blood.</p>

                     <p>I bless God, I am now reconciled to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Death; it was long ere I could; but now God hath done it for me, and I thankfully submit to it from the hands of the wise God, whom I have offended: And therefore desire to accept my punishment, knowing he doth all

things well without any wrong to his Creatures.</p>
                     <p>I had lately some Discourse with two Persons, whereof one was of Quality concerning the things laid to my charge; I was told, that it was three things; One was, That I was an enemy to, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Protestant Religion; that I was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, and had acted vigorously in Elections of Members for Parliament; and upheld the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>I own my self a Protestant, and die an Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that Religion, and I pray God I do not prove a better Friend to it than those that have so industriously endeavoured the taking away my Life, and that they see it not when it's too late.</p>
                     <p>As to the Meetings, I bless God I ever was at any of them, and that I was any way instrumental to the upholding of them, and am troubled that I have, I fear, sinfully deprived my self of them, and do believe, if ever the Ordinances of God were rightly administred, and the Gospel effectually preached, it was in those Meetings that were held in <hi>Taunton</hi>; the Lord bless the Seed that was there sown.</p>
                     <p>As to Elections of Members for Parliament, I judge it my Birthright; and therefore was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious in it; but I hope never did (I am sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Some that <hi>K—</hi> caused to be hanged, he caused also their Bodies to be stript, and their Breasts to be cleav'd asunder, in the place where he caused the Executions to be done; you might have gone up to the <hi>Ankles in Blood</hi>; he also caused the Hearts of the poor Executed Men to be thrown into the Fire with a great Shout, saying, Here is the Heart of a <hi>Traytor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Captain of <hi>VV—</hi> was hang'd, and the Rope broke, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:40336:199"/>
but they took from a <hi>Market-horse</hi> a <hi>Ring-Rope,</hi> and hanged him again.</p>
                     <p>At the Assizes when the Prisoners were brought before the Bar, <hi>Jeffreys</hi> said, if any Man pleaded Not guilty, he should die.</p>
                     <p>One not concerned in <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s <hi>Business,</hi> when asked, said, <hi>Not Guilty my Lord: Jeffreys</hi> said, take him Jaylor, and let him be Executed another time.</p>
                     <p>An Honest Man was hanged for sparing for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>'s Horse three pennyworth of Hay.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Constable</hi> also was hanged for executing of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Warrant.</p>
                     <p>And many Hundreds were put in the Castle-Hall, by which it was feared they would infect the Town. <hi>Frances Burges</hi> was taken upon <hi>Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down,</hi> by the persuasion of Sir— was hang'd by fastning a Rope to a Chamber-Window, and set upon a Hoget, and so hang'd. The Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was one <hi>S—</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Parish, <hi>Exon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was, by good Report, several Scores died in <hi>Ilchester</hi> by <hi>Infectious Diseases,</hi> and in their Irons, and Hand-bolt; for if they were not hard-hearted, and us'd the extreamest Rigor imaginable, the Keepers were not counted good Subjects: One of <hi>VVelinton</hi> that was to be hanged them, was saved, supposed by Order of Sir — and one of <hi>Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> hanged in his stead; this is true, and so it was at other places: But 'twere endless to record
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:40336:199"/>
all the Cruelties exercised by <hi>K—</hi> and <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> after <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Defeat.</p>
                     <p>Now that which remains, is to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Hundreds that had fled and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up and down in Holes and Rocks, whose Friends make all Application to some great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or other to procure their Pardons; some to this, some to others, that they thought Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites with the King; but the Rewards must be ascertain'd before any Application could be made, (for Pardons were just as they were in <hi>Rome</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ability of the Person, from half a Crown to sixteen thousand <hi>Guinea's; Any Tooth good Barber.</hi> Divers Lists being sent up, and the Rewards ascertain'd, which amongst many of them put together, did amount to considerable Sums. So that it was now, who could find a Friend to relieve his distressed Relations, which were forced to <hi>wander up and down in Caves and Desarts,</hi> for fear of being taken. But this Misfortune at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Agents, that unless my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour were used by his Creatures that were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him so to do, other Applications commonly met with Disapointments.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, The solemn, serious, dying <hi>Declarations,</hi> and <hi>Christian Courage</hi> of the <hi>VVestern Sufferers,</hi> have always, out-weighed with me, the Evidence of those flagitious <hi>Witnesses,</hi> who swore these Persons out of their Lives. And I did &amp; do most stedfastly believe, that the only <hi>Plot</hi> in that day, was the same, which the <hi>Almighty</hi> has at length

                  <head>THE LIFE and DEATH OF <hi>GEORGE</hi> Lord <hi>JEFFREYS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>REader, Think it not strange if I present you with the memorable <hi>Life and Actions</hi> of a Person, so well known in this great Kingdom: And peradventure Fame has not been silent in other Countreys, especially since he has been advanced to be a Chief Minister of State, and sat as it were steering at the Helm of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Various indeed are the Changes of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs, and the Actions of Human Life, which have been more particularly exemplified in the Rise and Fall of the Person, the Subject of this Discourse; who from almost a mean obscurity, soar'd to the losty Pyramid of Honour; where for a while, like an unfixed Star he appeared to the Eyes of the wondring Nation, giving an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect lustre; till by the sudden turn and change of unsteady Fortune, he dropt headlong from his Sphere, and lost at once his Grandeur and his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. To let Mankind see how little trust there is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40336:208"/>
to be given to the smiles of flattering Greatness, especially when attained by violent and pressing motions: I now proceed to trace this unfortunate Favourite in the sundry Capacities and Stations that have hitherto made up the Series of his Life.</p>
                  <p>He was born at <hi>Acton</hi> near <hi>Wrexam</hi> in <hi>Denbigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> about the Year 1648. his Fathers name was — <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> being reputed a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in that Country, though of no large Fortune or Estate; however he lived very comfortably on what he had, improving his yearly Income by his Industry; and gain'd by his plain and honest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours a good repute amongst the Gentry of those Parts; Insomuch that it was not long before he, upon the recommendation of some Person of Interest and Ability, gain'd a Wife of a good House; and they lived very comfortably together in their <hi>rural Habitation,</hi> being far from Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or striving for Court-favour; but contented with what God had blessed them with, and the fruits of their own Industry, they found a solid Happiness in that Contentment. Nor had they lived together any considerable time, but amongst other Children, the fruits of Wedlock, God was pleased to bestow on them the Person who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Subject of this Discourse, who was in due time Baptized by the Christian Name of <hi>George</hi>; whether he had <hi>Godfathers, &amp;c.</hi> it does not occur; however, he under the care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his industrious Parents grew up, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to all that studied him, of a very prompt and ready Wit, active, and striving for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, even among his Compeers in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40336:208"/>
Age, which lively demonstrated that an Air of Ambition was inherent to his Person.</p>
                  <p>As soon as he was capable to receive Learning, he was put to a Country School, where he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with such Education as that afforded, which was not extraordinary; yet his Natural Parts set it off to the best Advantage; and growing to years of somewhat a ripe Understanding, and not very tractable, his Father by the Advice of some of his Confidents, caused him to be brought to <hi>London,</hi> and finding him not inclinable to any Trade, but rather addicted to Study, he entred him, or by his procurement he was entered into the Free-School of <hi>Westminster,</hi> where he profited much; so that he was, by the care of the worthy Master thereof, soon enabled to understand the Languages, or at least so many of them as were convenient for the study of the Law, which above other things he aimed at; tho' his Father seemed not very ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his desires; for perceiving in his Soul a more than ordinary <hi>Spark of Ambition,</hi> fearing it might kindle into a flame, and prove one day his ruine, he laboured to hinder the ways he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd most likely to bring it upon him; and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to say, (when he found he could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade him from what he purposed, gently clapping him on the back,) <hi>Ah</hi> George, George, <hi>I f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Upon the Coming in of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the restoring the Face of Affairs in the Kingdom, the Law reviv'd again, and began to flourish; the <hi>Practitioners</hi> liv'd in much Credit and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40336:209"/>
Reputation, and many of them, purchased large Estates, which served to wing the desire of this Person with impatience; and some say he was the rather incited to it by a <hi>Dream</hi> he had whilst a Scholar at <hi>Westminster</hi> School<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>viz. That he should be the chief Scholar in that School, and afterward should enrich himself by Study and Industry, and that he should come to be the second Man in the Kingdom; but in conclusion, should fall into great disgrace and misery.</hi> This is confidently reported; and some say himself told it to sundry Persons since, when he found the second part of it was fulfilled, by acquiring the <hi>Chancellourship,</hi> and standing high in the Favour of his Prince.</p>
                  <p>However, We find the latter part did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him from his purpose; for having enter'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the <hi>Inner-Temple</hi> House, one of the Chief Inns of Court, after his performing such things as are conformable to the Customs of the House, we find him call'd to the Bar, by the Interest he made with the Benchers and Heads of that Learned Society, earlier than had been usual, leaping over the Heads of elder Graduates.</p>
                  <p>This happening about the Twentieth year of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and the City of <hi>London</hi> beginning to raise her self out of her Ashes, more stately and magnificent than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she sunk in Flames, a Sacrifice to the Revenge and Malice of the Papists, as by the late Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Monument, and upon Record it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: This great City, I say, regaining her Trade, her Priviledges and Customs were kept up with great exactness, so that in the Courts at <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> there was much Business; which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40336:209"/>
by this Person as more beneficial than that at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by reason of its frequency, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried on briefer, and with less difficulty; which induced him to give his Attendance, as also at <hi>Hixes-Hall,</hi> and other inferiour Courts and Places; insomuch, that he being of a bold Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and having naturally a fluent Tongue, an audible Voice, and good Utterance, he had not pleaded often before he was very much taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; and gain'd so much Credit with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they prefer'd him before any of the younger sort of <hi>Barristers</hi>; by which means he found his Stars begin to smile upon him; so that he was in a manner Courted to take Fees, and had Breviates thrust into his Hand frequently in the middle of a Cause by Persons, when they perceived it went ill on their sides, and was like to go against them.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>flush'd</hi> with success, he now thought of nothing <hi>more</hi> than how he might climb; nor did he want an Opportunity; for the next <hi>Station</hi> we find him in, is that of <hi>Common Serjeant,</hi> to the great and honourable City of <hi>London</hi>; and so much Fortune favour'd him at this time, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman <hi>Jeffreys</hi> the great Smoaker, having often observ'd his Discourse and Actions, took such a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to him, that being of the same Name, tho' not in the least any <hi>Relation,</hi> he back'd him with his Purse and Interest, which was not inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and thereby not only enabled him to carry on his Grandeur, but to purchase as he found a conveniency or advantage, in order to his keeping it up in the World.</p>

                  </p>

This, though the King might have taken it (for sundry Reasons) as a Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon his Royal Person, yet he was so far from resenting it that way, that he only turned to one of the Lords that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>About this time the Popish Plot being discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and others, the Nation was for a while in a Ferment, and matters run extremely high in Disputes and Controversies, and he sail'd with the Current, declaring with much heat and violence against the Priests, Jesuits, and others of the Conspirators and Romish Faction; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not only by his vehement expressions in pleading against 'em, but the alacrity and little concern that was visible in his Countenance, when
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40336:211"/>
at any time, as Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> he past sentence of Death upon any of them; which he frequently did with more or less reproach, and became in a manner the terror of that Party. But no sooner he perceiving the Wind tacking at Court, and that there was some misunderstanding between King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second and his Parliament, but he began to fall off, and grow cold in prosecuting the ends of the Government, being frequently at Court, and labouring as much as in him lay, to draw the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy of the City after him; as appears more especially by one passage, <hi>viz.</hi> The King being recovered of an Indisposition, that had for some time put the Kingdoms in a fear and doubt of his Life, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate him upon his going abroad; after which, and a favourable reception, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by this Person, that they should in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wait upon his Royal Highness, then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who was not long before returned from <hi>Flanders</hi>; but perceiving no forwardness to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, he only with his Father-in-Law stayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to gain that Access. These and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings created in the City a Jealousie, that he had espoused an Interest to their prejudice, which wrought so strongly in their Conceits, that it was concluded in the Council-Chamber at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> that he should resign his Recordership; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they sent to him to deliver back the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Writings they had entrusted him with, which accordingly was done, and Sir <hi>George Treby</hi> constituted Recorder in his stead.</p>
                  <p>This so netled him, that he now openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd himself to be what before was only suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40336:211"/>
indulging his thoughts in nothing more, than how he might revenge it upon the Dissenters to whose influence on the Court of Aldermen he attributed his dismission from the Recorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and used his Endeavours to blacken them as much as he could: Yet all his Honour was not sunk: for he had prevailed for the Removal of Sir <hi>Job Charleton</hi> from the Chief Justiceship of the County Palatine of <hi>Chester,</hi> and by the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and interest of his Party at Court, gained it for himself; and took the first Possession of that Charge in much splendour, paying at that time his Father a Visit with a numerous Train, which, as 'tis reported, put the old Gentleman into such a fret, for the drinking up his Cyder, and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Provisions, that he charged him with the undertaking to ruine him, by bringing a whole Country at his heels, commanding him never to attempt the like Prodigality again with hopes of success.</p>
                  <p>Many Petitions being put up upon the dissolving the Parliament in 1682. by most of the Counties, and Burroughs, and Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> for the speedy calling another, to redress the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the Nation; and the King shewing some dislike of that manner of proceeding, this Person further to endear himself to the interest of the Court, declared in his station as vehemently against them, by saying, <hi>He abhorred that Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning,</hi> &amp;c. from which, and the discountenancing the Petitioners as much as in him lay, he gain'd the Name and Epithet of an <hi>Abhorrer</hi>; and upon the burning the Pope in Effigies at <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> upon the Birth-day of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> amongst other

Figures, the Arch-waggs had set one on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back with his Face to the Tail, and a Paper on his back, <hi>viz.</hi> I <hi>am an abhorrer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During these Transactions, the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, met at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and amongst others, this Person was called before them, for attempting to intrench upon the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and obliged at the Bar of the Commons House, (after having been heard what he could say in defence of his Proceedings by his Council) to make his acknowledgment upon his Knees, and receive the Reprimand of the Speaker; whereupon, with some sharp Rebukes, as the Censure of the House; he was discharged.</p>
                  <p>To comfort him in this affliction, that was not by a man of his haughty Spirit a little stomacked, this Parliament being dissolved, and a call of Serjeants had at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar, Westminster,</hi> he was the first in the Roll, and consequently the King Serjeant; and as it is usual to present the King with a Ring on that occasion, the Motto he agreed to was, <hi>A Deo Rex, a Rege Lex,</hi> viz. <hi>The King from God, and the Law from the King.</hi> And now the Popish Party playing their Cards with more security, <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> who had been Impeached by the Commons, and stood charged by them of High Treason; being nevertheless, upon the Dissolution, tryed at the Kings-Bench-Bar, this Person was the principal Stickler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and by his Rhetorical and florid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, wrought so powerfully with the Jury, who were somewhat in doubt what they should do in this Case, that they found him Guilty, and the Impeachment in Parliament set aside, he was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

as a Traytor at <hi>Tyburn:</hi> And soon after this, the Dissenters losing of their Esteem in the eyes of the Court-Party, and some Justices of Peace of <hi>Middlesex</hi> being sharp upon them, this Person was chosen Chair-man at the Sessions at <hi>Hick</hi>'s <hi>Hall,</hi> where he had an opportunity to make them as he found his time, see the Resentments of his Anger; but this place being held too low for a Spirit winged with so large an ambition, he aimed at higher things, resolving like <hi>Icarus</hi> to be near the Sun, tho at the hazard of melting his waxen Wings, dropping headlong into the Sea of inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ruine: Whereupon perceiving some hot Contests in the City of <hi>London,</hi> about the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Magistrates and Officers, he turned the Edge of his Fury that way, insomuch that a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> came down against the Charter of the Honourable City of <hi>London,</hi> and in fine, after much pleading and arguments, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> the Charter was surrendred, at least in consent, by those that were in Power, and the King suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Execution of the Judgment obtained, caused such Orders to be observ'd as he thought most convenient, which being so well known to the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> it would appear a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me to enter upon particulars; yet the chiefest Cavil against the City was, taking the Toll of Markets, collecting Mony to build <hi>Cheapside</hi> Conduit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor was it long after this, and the Trial of several P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

was mainly instrumental, by giving the Court an account of their respective abilities, the better to settle the Fines: but the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> dying, he succeeded him as Lord Chief Justice of the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>; in which station he was scarcely setled, but he admitted the Popish Lords to Bail, that lay under an Impeachment in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and whose bailing had been refused by the Judges his Predecessors; and now it was that he began more particularly to remember former affronts, an example of which take in the Case of <hi>Elias Best</hi> a Hop-Merchant in <hi>Thames-street,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>It so happened when this Person was <hi>Recorder</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> that a Jury, of which <hi>Best</hi> was one having contrary to his mind, acquitted a Party indicted at the Sessions of Peace in <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> for Printing and Publishing a Pamphlet, he in much heat declared, that they had gone contrary to their Consciences, and stuck not to upbraid them with Perjury; for which, as an high affront put upon the Juries of <hi>London,</hi> they prayed the Court at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> that they might prefer an Indictment against him; and herein Mr. <hi>Best</hi> was the most active: but the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Scroggs</hi> then upon the Bench, after it had been a long time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued and debated, told them, that the Sessions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost at an end, it could not be tryed, and therefore he would desire them to refer it to the next Sessions, for the Recorder being a Person of Quality, he could not suffer him to lie under the imputation of an Indictment so long; but in the interim, he resigning his Recordership, the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness fell, and came to nothing; but soon after, it seems, Mr. <hi>Best</hi> had drank an Health to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>A Country Gentleman having Marryed a City Orphan, comes and demands her Fortune, which was about 1100 <hi>l.</hi> but by all Friends that he could make, could not procure it till he goes to <hi>Jeffreys</hi> then Recorder, and gave him 10 <hi>Guineas</hi> to be his Friend to get out his Wifes Fortune, upon which <hi>Jeffreys</hi> told him, that the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would sit such a day; the Gentleman appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was call'd in, <hi>Jeffryes</hi> being present, who ask'd him, Sirrah, what's your business? Upon which the Gentleman told him, That he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a City Orphan, and desired he might have her Portion out o'th' Chamber; upon which <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He told him, No: Upon which, he call'd him Rogue, Rascal, Sirrah, you should have ask't leave from the Court for such a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. He told him, he understood not the custom o'th' City, and begg'd their pardon, being a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Gentleman. Upon this <hi>Jeffreys</hi> abus'd him again; but afterwards, gives him a Note for his Mony; his Publick Railing upon him, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to blind the Court, that they might not suspect him Bribed.</p>
                  <p>Being at a Country Assize as Judge, an Old Man with a great Beard, came to give Evidence before him, and not doing it to his mind, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cavil with his Beard, and amongst other Expressions told him, <hi>That if his Conscience was as large as his Beard, he might well swear any thing.</hi> This so netled the Old Blade, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to his Greatness, he briskly replyed,

                  <p>Among several Houses I built both in <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi> and <hi>Duke-street, Westminster,</hi> I built a great House in <hi>Duke-street,</hi> just against the <hi>Bird Cages</hi> in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park,</hi> which just as I was a finishing I Lett to the Lord Chancellor <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> with Stables and Coach-houses to it, for 300 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> After which, when he the said Chancellor came to see the House (Alderman <hi>Duncomb,</hi> the great Banker being with him) and looking about him, saw between the House and St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park</hi> an idle piece of Ground, he told me, He would have a Cause-Room built on it. I told him, that the Ground was the Kings. He told me, that he knew it was; but he would Beg the Ground of the King, and give it me: He also bid me make my own Demands, and give it him in Writing, the which I did; and unto which he did agree, and commanded me immediately to pull down the Park-Wall, and to build as fast as I could, for he much wanted the said Cause-Room. My Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him was, <hi>That he should beg of King</hi> James <hi>all the Ground without the Park-Wall, between</hi> Webbs <hi>and</hi> Storeys <hi>inclusive</hi>; which said Ground
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40336:215"/>
is Twenty Five Foot in breadth, and near Seven Hundred Foot in length (to the best of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) <hi>for Ninety Nine Years, at a Pepper-Corn</hi> per Annum, <hi>which he the said Lord Chancellour was to make over the said King's Grant to me for the said number of Years, without any Alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When I had finished the said Building, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him several times my Grant of the said Ground from the King; he often promised me, that I should certainly have it; but I being very unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie for want of my said Grant, I wrote several times to him, and often waited to speak with him, to have it done; but at last I found I could have no Access to him, and that I spent much time in waiting to speak with him, altho I liv'd just against his door; and also I consider'd, that he could not be long Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>William</hi> being just come, I got into the Parlour where he

                  <p>We Landed without any the least Opposition, and were received with all expressions of Joy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; the Duke, as soon as he jump'd out of his Boat on Land, call'd for silence, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd we would joyn with him in returning God Thanks for that wonderful preservation we had met with at <hi>Sea,</hi> and accordingly fell on his Knees on the Sand, and was the mouth of us all in a short <hi>Ejaculation,</hi> and then immediately well Armed, as many as we were, entered the Town.</p>

                     <hi>Friday,</hi> the whole day was spent in Listing of Men, which flock'd to us so fast, that we could scarce tend them with Arms.</p>
                  <p>The like on <hi>Saturday</hi> also; and then about ten of the Clock at night, 300 of our Men were sent to <hi>Bridport,</hi> about six English Miles off, to Storm that

                     <hi>Sunday</hi> also was spent in Listing, and <hi>Monday</hi> Morning; but in the Afternoon we marched out of <hi>Lime</hi> for <hi>Axminster,</hi> a little Town four Miles off; our Party was near 2000 Foot, and 300 Horse, though we Landed not full an hundred Men, and all these in the space of four days: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Miles from <hi>Lime</hi> we espied the Duke of <hi>Albermarle,</hi> with about 4000 Men, designing that Night to quart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But missing this opportunity, we march'd on for <hi>Taunton,</hi> Lodging at several small Towns by the way, which still-received us as kindly as possible, and all the way met with the loud Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the Country, praying God to succeed our Arms.</p>

Here we had a small Skirmish, our Men being in the Fields adjoyning to the Town refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves; but it lasted not long, for before he could bring word, they were fled, being not above sixty Horse-Men? They did us mischief, killed and wounded above Twenty Men, whereas we killed none of theirs, only took four Prisoners, and their Horses, and wounded my Lord <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> that it was thought mortal; they came thither, thinking it had been their own Forces; and had not our undisciplin'd Fellows been a little too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and suffer'd 'em to come a little farther on, they would have enter'd the Town, and we must have had every man of them; their Infantry was following, but on their Return came not forward.

But God saw it not fit for us, and over-ruled our Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to our own ruin; for this was in the top of our prosperity; and yet all the while, not a Gentleman more than went over with us came to our assistance.</p>
                  <p>So we march'd on to <hi>Bath,</hi> we lay before it in the Afternoon, and sent in our <hi>Trumpeter</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Town, but they refused to give us En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, having a strong Garison, it being a stout People and a strong place. Having no mind to spend time in laying Sieges, we march'd on that day to a little Town called <hi>Phillips-Norton,</hi> and there lay that night, being now <hi>Sunday</hi> the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> Old-Style; Saturday Morning preparing for <hi>Frome,</hi> We were drawing out our Baggage for our March, and on a sudden were alarmed with the appearance of the Enemy, who had entred the Town, and had lined all the Hedges, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fire on us: Here he began the briskest Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter

we yet had, and for an hour or more we had a brisk Skirmish; but at last we beat them back, killing about thirty which lay in the place, and we lost about ten in all, and a few wounded: They retreating with their whole Army, pitched within a mile of the Town; and we went out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so and pitched near them, but out of Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, playing Cannon one on another for some hours; they killed us but one man all the while, but with ours we did great execution, having the advantage of the ground; so at last they retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I have been told lost some hundreds of men in the Bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here came the unexpected News of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s being defeated, and likewise of the advance of the Kings Forces from <hi>London</hi> with considerable Baggage, and thirty Field-Pieces. On this News, tog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This was much like that Resolution of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> in the time of the Civil War with <hi>Spain,</hi> being as we then were, in despair of making bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Terms, and not daring to enter <hi>Salisbury Plain,</hi> because their Horse being so much better
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40336:221"/>
than ours, their Men being all Disciplin'd, ours not, we could not face them in so plain and open a Country, so that we retreated backward, in the mean time resolving to see what <hi>London</hi> would do, having a good opportunity offered them: The Souldiers being call'd forth, and not two thousand Men to be had for their defence if they had but attempted any thing; this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned our Men, and several of them coming home to their own Country, having felt by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the hardships of War, withdrew from us.</p>
                  <p>We came well back again to <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> and were received with wonted Love; we arrived here on <hi>Friday</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and resolved here to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, so as to hold our ground till we heard from <hi>London. Saturday</hi> in the Afternoon news was brought of the Approach of the Kings Forces within a Mile and a half of the Town where they had encamped, the Duke went up into the Tower and there took a view of them, and seeing them so careless, and their Horse at some distance from the Army, in a little Town, the Infantry being in <hi>Sedge Moore.</hi> He called a Council on it, and it was concluded on, that we should fall on them in the dead of the Night, accordingly having a Guide to conduct us on in a private way, we march'd out at about 11 of the Clock in the night, and about one fell on them in their Tents. There was a Ditch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and the Guide promised to conduct 'em over an easie fordable place, but our Men seeing the Enemy just before them, ran furiously on and lost the Guide, so that while they endeavoured to recover over that place the Enemy got on their Legs, and put themselves in Order, and now began as

fierce a Battel as perhaps ever was fought in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in so short a time; our Foot fought as well as ever Foot fought, but not a Horse came up; had our Horse but assisted, we must have beaten them out of the Field. But our Horses would not stand at the noise of Drums and Guns, so that we soon lost two of our Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ces of Ordnance, and we had but four in all, and then but one more in the Field; our Foot flung most of their Shot over, so that the Men for the most part were killed in the Rear, and that run, but the Front stood still; and had we done as much execution in the Front as we did in the Rear, the day had been our own; but God would not have it, their time was not yet come: By this time their Horses came up, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving six or eight hundred good disciplin'd Men, well mounted and well arm'd, ours neither; our Foot having shot away all their Ammunition, and our Baggage being not then in the Field, they were forced to retreat, being all in confusion.</p>
                  <p>Having no Mony left, and our Party thus unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactedly repulsed, the Duke seeing he could not hold it any longer, fled with my Lord <hi>Gray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke's Party was said to be about three thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse; we had more, at least five thousand Men and Horse, but not well Arm'd, yet in the Field. 'Tis said we lost not above three hundred, and they Foot: but after when we were routed in our retreat lost a vast many more; though they pursued not in some hours after.</p>
                  <p>The most remarkable Persons that were taken in this total Rout, were Colonel <hi>Holmes,</hi> Major <hi>Perrot,</hi> the Constable of <hi>Crookborn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40336:222"/>After the Field was clear of the Dukes Men, the Earl of <hi>Feversham</hi> marched with five hundred Foot and a Party of Horse and Dragoons to <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> where he found the Dukes Forces that were left there, fled and dispersed into several Places: When his Lordship having left these Men in the Town, under the Command of Colonel <hi>Kirk,</hi> and hearing the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was fled with about Fifty Horse, the greatest number of the Dukes Men that were left together, he sent out divers Parties in pursuit of him and others that fled the Field. When on the 7th of <hi>July,</hi> about five in the Morning, some of the Lord <hi>Lumly</hi>'s Men seized the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and another Person near <hi>Holt-Lodge</hi> in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> four Miles from the West of <hi>Ringwood</hi>; and the said Lord <hi>Lumly</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king further enquiry among the Cotts, was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by one <hi>Anna Ferrant</hi> that two men went over a Hedge, proving to be the Out-bounds of many Inclosures, some of which were overgrown with Fern, others with Pease and Oats; but Guards being set upon the Avenues, after divers attempts to escape, the <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> one of the Parties observed to enter the Ground, was taken on the 8th of <hi>July,</hi> about five in the morning, who confessing he departed from the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> about One of the Clock that morning in the Out-bounds, diligent search was made; when about Eleven of the Clock the same morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was found, by one <hi>Henry Parking,</hi> hid in a Ditch, covered with Fern, who calling others to assist him, the said late Duke was in the end taken, and together with the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> with a strong Guard brought by easie

Journies to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where they arrived on the 13th of <hi>July,</hi> and after some examination were committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> when on <hi>Wednesday</hi> the 15th of <hi>July,</hi> the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to a Warrant signed for his Execution, upon his Attaindure of <hi>High Treason,</hi> was delivered to the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> about Ten in the Morning, and conducted to a Scaffold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> where after about half an hours continuance, he laying down his head, had it stricken off by the Executioner, the which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Body, being put into a Coffin co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Velvet, were carried away in a Velvet-covered Hearse, in order to his Interment.</p>
                  <p>After the Duke was beheaded, many Prisoners taken, and those that fled by Parcels up and down, secured in divers Goals, in order to their Prosecution, as was said, according to Law; which was the occasion of this great Mans shewing his parts at that degree as he did, no one else fit to be made a Tool for such a Bloody Tragedy as he acted.</p>

                  <p>The Tryals in the <hi>West</hi> were deferred (for some time after the Fatal Blow given to the D. of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> which was the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> following) because of my Lords being at <hi>Tunbridg</hi>; but the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> he with a special Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> assisted with four other Judges, set forward with a Party of Horse, he being made by special Commission their General. The first place he came at was <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> where were divers Prisoners on suspicion; but here began the Tragedy; for the Lady <hi>Lisle</hi> was there Arraigned for <hi>High-Treason,</hi> in harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nelthrope,</hi> that had been concerned with the Duke; the Lady being on

her Tryal, the Jury were dissatisfied once and again; but my Lords Threats and other Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, so disposed the Jury, that at last they brought the Lady in Guilty; on which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Sentence of Death on her, as usual in such Cases; but she had the favour of being Beheaded; their other Prisoners were carried to <hi>Salisbury</hi>; and this was the most remarkable thing at that Assizes.</p>
                  <p>From thence they set forward for <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where were many Prisoners that had been pick'd up and down the Country, then in the Goal, the which, with those that were brought from <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> were ordered to be carried to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> there not being Evidence enough to accomplish what was then designed by my Lord; so that little of moment passed there, but to pursue the matter, proceeds from thence to <hi>Dorchester,</hi> where he with his Assistants, Gown-men, and Sword-men, arrived on the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> on which day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Thursday,</hi> the Commission was read. <hi>Friday</hi> morning was an excellent Sermon Preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Lordships, by a worthy Divine, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to a worthy Person of that Country, much tending to Mercy: It was observed, that while my Lord Chief Justice was at Church in Prayers, as well as at Sermon, he was seen to laugh, which was so unbecoming a Person in his Character, that ought in so weighty an Affair as he was then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon, to have been more serious, and have craved the help and assistance of God Almighty.</p>
                  <p>The Sermon being over, their Lordships repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Court, which by order of the Lord Chief Justice was hung with Red Cloth, a Colour

suitable to such a succeeding bloody Tragedy, being accompanied by a numerous Company of the Gentry of that County, as well as the Flower of the Neighbouring Counties of <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and then proceeded to give his Charge; in which Charge, by reason of the Severity of his Sentiments, and Positions laid down to make dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of all such as were Abettors, Aidors or Assisters to the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> on pain of <hi>High Treason,</hi> which was a great Surprize to all the Auditors, and so vehemently urged, and so passionately expressed, as seemed rather the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a <hi>Romish Inquisitor,</hi> than a <hi>Protestant Judge</hi>; and then Adjourned until Eight of the Clock next Morning, when was a Bill found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Thirty Persons, charged for <hi>High Treason,</hi> for Aiding and Assisting the late Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>; who put themselves on their Trials, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40336:224"/>
                     <hi>George Steward</hi> of <hi>Culliton</hi> aforesaid. The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of each of these, and the severity of their being found Guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be shewed in its proper place, before we take leave of this Town, and proceed on in this <hi>Western</hi> Expedition.</p>
                  <p>The said Twenty-nine being found (as before) Guilty, my Lord immediately pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death on them all, as usual in Cases of <hi>High-Treason,</hi> and did the same Night give a Warrant to the Sheriff, for the Execution of Thirteen of the Twenty-nine on Monday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which accordingly was done, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Application was made to the Lord Chief Justice by Gentlemen of the best Quality, in this and the Neighbouring Counties for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve of Mr. <hi>Bragg,</hi> to all which he was Deaf, and not to be prevailed upon; though he was assured of his Honesty, and true Conformity to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet it availed nothing. At last, it was only requested for Ten days Respite, yet that had no better effect; but on Monday, he with Twelve more of that number, were accordingly Executed at <hi>Dorchester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, this Proceeding was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to shorten Business, and to wheedle the rest that were to follow to a Confession, which without it, the tenth part of them could not be Proved Guilty. A Method was also taken without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, to entrap many poor ignorant people, by a couple of Officers that were sent into the Goal, to call over, and to take the Names of the Prisoners; on promise, if they confest, they might expect Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, otherwise not; which many did. And this was written so, that had they pleaded Not Guilty, these
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40336:225"/>
two were designed to have been Evidences against them from their own Confessions, which so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the remaining great Numbers, that all except a very few, Pleaded Guilty, which put an end to any further Trial.</p>
                  <p>The only thing remaining, was the pronouncing of Sentence on them, which were in Number 292. who received Sentence of Death all at once. One Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> put himself on Trial, but by the Jury found Guilty, whose Case was hard, his Circumstances being so small to be condemned to die; and had actually suffered, had not Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been made to my Lord's Favourites, and with the payment and securing of 400 <hi>l.</hi> preserved him from Execution.</p>
                  <p>This Matter being adjusted, and Execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to about Eighty, which were Executed, and their Quarters sent up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the dread of their Spectators, as well as the Annoyance of the Travellers; his extraordinary Whippings, though unmerciful, are not to be taken notice of; so we leave this place, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed towards the City of <hi>Exon:</hi> In their way thither, lying at an Honourable Gentlemans House, divers of the Neighbouring Parishes made their Petitions to the <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> in the behalf of some Relations concerned. It happened, that through some disorder amongst his Servants, some Pistols were fired in the Night, which gave him a Suspicion, or at least he took it, of some design upon him; on which at parting, he said, <hi>Not a man of all those Parishes that were of that Vicinitude, if found Guilty, should escape.</hi> And so we proceed and arrive at <hi>Exon,</hi> where to the number of 243 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners

being in Custody for assisting the said Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> one amongst the rest, Mr. <hi>Fower Acers</hi> pleading not Guilty, he being found by the Jury, the said Lord Chief Justice immediately pronounced the Sentence upon him, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Execution, which was done to terrifie the rest, who all Pleaded Guilty; so that these unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate People had not time to have the fairness of Trials allowed them, which is a right due by the Laws of God and Man. The remaining number he all condemned; and here was a little sparing; not so many order'd Execution as was in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther County, but those that were executed, were hung up and down in most Town<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the County, and their Quarters and Heads scattered up and down the High-ways and Publick places. An extraordinary Sentence of severe Whipping was pronounced against Mr. <hi>Samuel Staple</hi> of <hi>Thorncomb</hi> in the said County; but these are Trifles, and we shall endeavour to pursue our Design, and make as quick dispatch as we can, that time may not be lost, the King served, and this Miscreants thirst quenched with Protestant Blood, which is always well-pleasing to Inquisitors, and so proceed to the Town of <hi>Taunton.</hi> At which place being arrived, it was thought fit by the <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> to be as expeditious as might be; so that late in the Afternoon the Court sat, where the Commission being read, he proceeded to give the Charge, which was so very keen and full of sharp Invectives, as if the Country it self had not been able to make Expiation to his Lordship, to quench his Thirst in the Blood of those that ventur'd their All in Defence of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi>; and here
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40336:226"/>
we enter upon the bloodiest part of the Tragedy In this Town, and at <hi>Wells</hi> in the said County; were more than 500 Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>To begin at <hi>Taunton</hi>: The next Morning after the Charge given, the Assizes began, where some few put themselves on Trial, who were found Guilty, and immediately ordered to be Executed; of which number one Mr. <hi>Simon Hamlin</hi> was one, who was a zealous worthy good Man, and his Case no way dangerous, but on the contrary, had he had to do with a Judge of another Stamp. To proceed to the rest: This first Cruelty caused the rest to plead guilty in hopes of favour, which was only a few days to live, which those that pleaded had not. Amongst these, at <hi>Taunton</hi> were divers eminent Persons that had been taken in the <hi>West,</hi> and carried to <hi>London,</hi> and brought down there to compleat the bloody Tragedy in those parts: Mr. <hi>Parrot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hewling,</hi> the Elder, Mr. <hi>Lisle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hucker,</hi> and divers others were very eminent. To take notice of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in this Matter, will alter our Design and swell the Book to too great a Bulk, being only designed for a Pocket Companion, and useful it may be to see the Cruelty of Men when in their Power, and how the Devil stirreth up his Instruments, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue those that adventure for the Cause of God and Religion. Here were in this County Executed 239. the rest that were Condemned were Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, except such as were able to furnish Coin, and that not a little; for an account was taken of Mens abilities, according to which, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase for Life must be managed by two of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, who had a small share, the rest went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

This indeed was a glorious Design in the Eye of <hi>Mother Church,</hi> to root out Heresie by Executions and Transportations, to make room for a pack; here Expedition must be made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude at <hi>Wells,</hi> for that a great Man being fallen, our great Judge designing his Chair, which in short, he had as the Reward of so eminent and extraordinary a piece of Service as he did for the Advancement of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> Interest, which is cruel always where it prevails.</p>
                  <p>Thus we leave the Town of <hi>Taunton,</hi> after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding Execution to many there, and their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be scatter'd up and down the County, and so we proceed to <hi>Wells,</hi> where divers Prisoners that had been carried from Goal to Goal, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Evidence against them, were in Carts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Wells</hi>; in which place, to finish this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, the same Method as was at the former Assizes, was also taken here by a severe Charge, affronting the Gentlemen of this County, as he had done in all the Counties before, terrifying the Juries (when any pleaded) to make them to bring in the persons Guilty; some of which being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed, and it is doubted, contrary to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which if so, <hi>the Lord forgive them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here were many eminent and worthy persons that received the Sentence of Death, but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions of the County being put together, as you, have before seen, we make no particular Division of the Number here, and the Number at <hi>Taunton,</hi> the whole being recited before: We shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavour to be as brief as we can, to give

you what we think material, and truly matter of Fact; my Lord now being come to conclude this extraordinary Commission, and in haste to be elevated, maketh all manner of dispatch to repair to the King then at <hi>Windsor,</hi> to give an Account of his Transactions, and to receive the Reward of his meritorious service in this Butchering of Protestants, which is so acceptable to his Holiness, and his bigotted Disciples, as nothing can be more; and indeed, if you will believe them, a Work that merits Heaven at last, besides what Temporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments are thought fit in this World. If this cruel Judge were a true Protestant, his Case is much the worse, being made use of as a Tool to destroy, and carry on Popish <hi>Designs.</hi> Thus the Affairs being ended, the Country filled with Heads and Quarters of those that were Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, the rest that had not wherewith to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase their Lives, left in Custody in order to Transportation.</p>

                     <p>I Am, by the Mercy of God, come to this great and populous City, a City that boasts both of its Riches and Trade, and may justly indeed claim the next place to the great and populous Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis of this Kingdom. Gentlemen, I find here
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40336:227"/>
are a great many Auditors, who are very intent, as if they expected some formal or prepared Speech, but assure your selves, we come not to make neither set Speeches, nor formal Declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor to follow a couple of <hi>puffing Trumpeters</hi>; for, Lord, we have seen those things Twenty times before: No, we come to do the King's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; a King who is so Gracious as to use all the means possible to discover the Disorders of the Nation, and to search out those who, indeed, are the very Pest of the Kingdom: To this end, and for this purpose are we come to this City. But I find a special Commission is an unusual thing here, and relishes very ill; nay, the very Women storm at it, for fear we should take the <hi>upper hand</hi> of them too; for by the by, Gentlemen, I hear it is much in fashion in this City for the Woman to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and bear sway. But, Gentlemen, I will not stay you with such needless Stories, I will only mention some few things that fall within my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; for Points or Matters of Law I shall not trouble you, but only mind you of some things that lately hath happened, and particularly in this City (for I have the Kalender of this City in my Pocket); and if I do not express my self in so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal or set a Declamation (for as I told you, I came not to make Declamations) or in so smooth Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as you may expect, you must attribute it partly to the pain of the Stone, under which I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and partly to the unevenness of this days journey.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, I may say, that even some of the youngest amongst us may remember the late <hi>horrid Rebellion,</hi> how men, under colour of Law, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40336:228"/>
pretext of Justice, after they had divested a most Gracious and most Merciful Prince of all his Royal Power, by the Power of the Sword; they, I say, under colour of Law, and pretext of Justice, (which added the more to the Crime, that it was done under colour of such pretended Justice) brought the most Mild and Meekest Prince (next to our ever Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, if we may but compare him to a Man) to die a Martyr, the first blessed Martyr, (pardon the expression; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our most blessed Jesu, who suffered for us on the Cross, I say, besides that Blessed Son of God) this, I say, was the first Royal Martyr; not suffering him to speak for himself, or make his defence; a Liberty which is given to the vilest Traitor; and this was done (not to descant on the number) by Forty one. The Rebels not resting here, for Rebellion is like the sin of Witchcraft, Divested the Lineal, Legal, and Rightful Heir of the Crown of all his Power and Prerogative, till the Mighty God of Heaven and Earth, God Almighty, restored him to his Just Right: And he, as if begot in Mercy, not only forgave all Offences, and pardoned voluntarily, even all that had been in actual Arms against him (excepting those accursed Regicides) but also made it a Crime for any one that should but remember, or upbraid any of their past Crimes and Rebellions. Good God! O Jesu! that we should live in such an Age, in which such a Prince cannot be safe from the seditious contrivances of Pardoned Rebels! Had we not the <hi>Rye</hi> Conspiracy, wherein they not only designed to have Murthered that Most Blessed (for so now we may conclude him to be with God
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40336:228"/>
Almighty) and Gracious King, but also his Most ever Dear and Victorious Brother? Had we not the Bill of Exclusion, which our most Gracious King told us, he could not, without a manifest Infringement of the Royal Prerogatives of the Crown (which are too sacred for us to touch) consent to? Had we not the Cursed Counsel of <hi>Achitophel</hi>? Kings are God's Vicegerents on Earth, and are indeed Gods on Earth, and we Represent them. Now when God Almighty had of his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodness, called this Blessed Prince unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he sends a Prince, who assures us he will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his Royal Brother and Renowned Predecessor in all things, especially in that of his Clemency and Mercy, and that too upon the word of a King. A King, I will assure you, that will not be worse than his Word. Nay (Pardon the Expression) that dare not be worse than his Word. Which of you all, that had a Father Murthered by another, (and that deliberately too, under colour of Justice, which added to the Crime; and your Brother, nay your selves thrust out from your Inheritanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and banished from your Country; nay, that sought your blood likewise) would not when it was in your power revenge such Injuries, and ruin such Persecutors. But here our most blessed Prince, whom God long preserve, hath not only forgiven, but will venture his Life for the Defence of such his Enemies? Has he not ventured his Life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as far as any man; for the Honour of these Kingdoms? Nay, I Challenge this City to shew me any one man of it, that perchance may not be worth a Groat, that has ventured his Life so far for the safety of these Kingdoms, as this Royal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40336:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Prince hath done. Good God! what an Age do we live in! shall not such a Prince be secure from the Sedition, Rebellion, and Plots of Men? He is scarce seated on his Royal Throne (where God Almighty grant he may long Reign) but on the one hand he is invaded by a Condemned Rebel, and Arch-Traytor, who hath received the just reward of his Rebellion. On the other hand up starts a Poppet Prince who seduces the Mobile into Rebellion, into which they are easily bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for I say, Rebellion is like the sin of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft; this man who had as little Title to the Crown as the least of you (for I hope all you are Legitimate) being overtaken by Justice, and by the goodness of his Prince brought to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, he has the confidence (good God! that men should be so impudent) to say, <hi>That God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did know with what joyfulness he did die</hi> (a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor); having for these two years last past, lived in all Incontinency and Rebellion, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goodness of an Indulgent Prince so often to pardon him; but it is just like him. Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion (as I told you) is like the sin of Witchcraft. For there was another which I shall not name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I will not trample on the dust of the Dead, but you may remember him by the words of his Speech; he tells you, <hi>That he thanks his God that he falls by the Ax, and not by the Fiery Trial.</hi> He had rather (he had as good have said) die a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor than a Blessed <hi>Martyr.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Great God of Heaven and Earth! what reason have men to Rebel! But as I told you, Rebellion is like the sin of Witchcraft; <hi>Fear God and Honour the King,</hi> is rejected by People for no other reason,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40336:229"/>
as I can find, but that it is written in St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Gentlemen, I must tell you, I am afraid that this City hath too many of these People in it. And it is your Duty to search them out: For this City added much to that Ships Loading; there was your <hi>Tyly</hi>'s, vour <hi>Roe</hi>'s, and your <hi>Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>es,</hi> men starred up like Mushrooms, Scoundrel Fellows, mere Sons of Dunghills: These men must forsooth set up for Liberty and Property. A Fellow that carries the Sword before Mr. <hi>Major</hi> must be very careful of his Property, and turn Politician, as if he had as much Property as the Person before whom he bears the Sword; though perchance not worth a Groat. Gentlemen, I must tell you, you have still here the <hi>Tyly</hi>'s, the <hi>Roe</hi>'s, and the <hi>Wades</hi>: I have brought a Brush in my Pocket, and I shall be sure to Rub the Dirt where ever it is, or on whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it sticks. Gentlemen, I shall not stand Complementing with you, I shall talk with some of you before you and I part: I tell you, I tell you, I have brought a Besome, and I will sweep every mans door, whether great or small. Must I mention Particulars? I hope you will save me that trouble; yet I will hint a few things to you, that perchance I have heard of. This is a great City, and the Magistrates wonderful Loyal, and very forward to assist the King with Men, Mony and Provisions, when the Rebels were just at your Gates: I do believe it would have went very hard with some of you if the Enemy had entered the City, notwithstanding the Endeavours that was used to accomplish it. Certainly they had and must have great incouragement from a Party within, or else why should their design be on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40336:230"/>
this City. Nay, when the Enemy was within a Mile of you, that a Ship should be set on fire in the midst of you, as a Signal to the Rebels, and to amuse those within; when if God Almighty had not been more gracious unto you than you was to your selves (so that Wind and Tyde was for you) for what I know, the greatest part of this City had perished; and yet you are willing to believe it was an Accident. Certainly, here is a great many of those men which they call <hi>Trimmers.</hi> A <hi>Whig</hi> is but a meer Fool to these; for a <hi>Whig</hi> is some sort of a subject in comparison of these; for a <hi>Trimmer</hi> is but a cowardly and base-spirited <hi>VVhig</hi>; for the <hi>VVhig</hi> is but the Journey-man-Prentice, that is hired, and set on in the Rebellion, whilst the <hi>Trimmer</hi> is afraid to appear in the Cause; he stands at a doubt, and says to himself, I will not assist the King until I see who has the best of it; And refuses to entertain the King's Friends for fear the Rebels should get the better of it. These men stink worse than the worst dirt you have in your City; these men have so little Religion, that they forget that he that is not for us is against us. Gentlemen, I tell you, I have the <hi>Kalendar of this City</hi> here in my hand. I have heard of those that have searched into the very sink of a Conventicle to find out some sneaking Rascal to hide their Mony by night. Come, come, Gentlemen, to be plain with you, I find the dirt of the Ditch is in your Nostrils. Good God! where am I, in <hi>Bristol!</hi> This City it seems claims the Priviledge of Hanging and Drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves: I find you have more need
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40336:230"/>
of a Commission once a Month at least. The very Magistrates which should be the Ministers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, fall out one with another to that degree, they will scarce Dine with each other, whilst it is the business of some cunning men that lye behind the Curtain to raise Divisions amongst them, and set them together by the Ears, and knock their Logger-heads together; yet I find they can agree for their interest. Or if there be but a Kid in the case: For I hear the Trade of Kid-napping is of much Request in this City, they can discharge a Felon, or a Traytor, provided they will go to Mr. <hi>Alderman</hi>'s Plantation at the <hi>VVest-Indies.</hi> Come, come, I find you stink for want of Rubbing. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, what need I mind you of these things? I hope you will search into them, and inform me. It seems the Dissenters and Phanaticks fare well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, by reason of the favour of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates; for example, is a Dissenter, who is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and Obstinate Offender, comes before them to be fined, one Alderman or other stands up, and says, He is a good Man (though three parts a Rebel) well then, for the sake of Mr. Alderman, he shall be fined but 5 <hi>s.</hi> Then comes another, and up stands another <hi>Goodman Alderman,</hi> and says, I know him to be an honest Man (though rather worse than the former); Well, for Mr. Alderman's sake, he shall be Fined but half a Crown; so <hi>Manus manum fricat</hi>; You play the Knave for me now, and I will play the Knave for you by and by. I am ashamed of these things: And I must not forget to tell you, that I hear of some Differences amongst the Clergy, those that ought to preach Peace and Unity to others: Gentlemen, these things must
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40336:231"/>
be looked into. I shall not now trouble you any further, there are several other things, but I expect to hear of them from you. And if you do not tell me of some of these things, I shall remind you of them. And I find by the number of your Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, this is a very large City, and it is impossible for one or two to search into all the corners of it: Therefore mind the Constables of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and call on them for their Presentments; for I expect every Constable to bring in his Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that you Present him. So Adjourn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

At last came out a General Pardon, with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, very few, if any of those that were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited for, not being excepted, were of course pardoned; but however, divers sums of Mony having been paid, no Restitution to be had, for <hi>from Hell is no Redemption.</hi> A worthy <hi>Western</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's purchase came to fifteen or sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Guinea's, which my <hi>Lord Chancellour</hi> had. Amongst the Exceptions were a parcel of <hi>Taunton</hi> Girls, some of which were Children of Eight or Ten years old, however something was to be made of them, if these Ladies were judged Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Treason for presenting the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> with Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for to preserve these from Trial, they were given to Maids of Honour to make up their <hi>Christmas Box</hi>; so that an Agent of theirs was sent down into the Country to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound

Consciences would not permit them to do, and for a time they were extreamly hot upon it. Much about this time there was a considerable Suit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending before him in Chancery, between a great Heiress and others, which was sufficiently talk'd of in the World; not without loud and deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on his Honesty and Honour: for having given the Cause for the young Lady, he very speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afterwards married her to his Son; with this remarkable Circumstance, She being a Papist, to make sure Work, he married them both ways; both by a Priest of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Divine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And here I think we may place the Heighth and Acme of his Honour and Happiness, where he's not like to tarry long; for on the News of the great Preparations in <hi>Holland,</hi> and that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly design'd for <hi>England,</hi> the determined Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils cool'd, and then quite ceas'd, so that the Church of <hi>England men,</hi> whose Cause the Prince had espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, were restored again to the Commissions and Trusts they had (by what Justice I know not) been lately deprived of; and amongst other Charters that were on this occasion restored, was that of the City of <hi>London</hi>; and that which makes it more memorable, was, that it was brought to <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> by this Person, tho he was not attended with the Shouts and Acclamations he expected, nor seem'd so florid or frolicksom as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, which some looked upon as a bad Omen; and it's reported, soon after he being ask'd by a Courtier, <hi>What the Heads of the Princes Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were</hi>? he should answer, <hi>He wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>HE was of Stature rather above a middle sort than below it; his Complexion inclining to Fair; his Face well enough, full of a certain briskness, tho' mixt with an Air a little malicious and unpleasant. He was a man of tolerable sense, and had, as of necessity he must by so long practice, and going through such Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places, got some Law, tho' as little as 'twas, more than he had occasion to make use of; since the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Power having as good as seated all Law in the Kings Breast; he by that found out a more compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous method of attaining it, than was formerly known. He had a pretty large stock of Ill Nature, and Wit, in which lay his greatest Excellency, tho' a very unenvy'd one. But in fine, His Brow and his Tongue were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the two best Accomplishments he was master of. —By the help of which, and that before mentioned, by his brisk, sudden, and sharp Interrogatories, he sometimes put falshood, and perhaps oftner, the truth it self out of countenance. But that ill-favour'd Wit which he had, lay all of the wrong side; much like that of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Animals, all whose Wit lyes in tricks and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. He spoke many pleasant things, but very few handsom ones, disgracing all with intolerable Railing, mean passions, and perfect <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> and would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly even upon the Bench it self, fall into Heats both as to words and actions, not only unworthy of a Judge, but even of any prudent man. He seem'd, without wronging him, to have a great deal of baseness, and cruelty in his Nature, having a particular delight and relish in Cruelty and Blood, and such things as give horrour and aversion to all the rest of mankind. He was in this case worse than even <hi>Nero</hi>; for whereas that monster had once so much good Nature, or at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, that when he was to sign a Warrant for the execution of a Malefactor, he is said to have wish'd, <hi>He had never learn'd to write: Jeffreys</hi> on the other side, then only seem'd in his Element, when in the midst of Destruction and Murther.
