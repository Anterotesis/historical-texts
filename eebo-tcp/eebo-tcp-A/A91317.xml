         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

paper.</p>
            <p>In the Preamble of this Anſwer, by way of Accompt,
concerning the ſecuring ſome Members, and ſecluding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
It appears by the Propoſals of the ſixth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
the late Declaration and Remonſtrance therein cited,
That this deſigne to break the Houſe by force hath been
long ſince plotted and contrived, though not executed untill
now. Which Action the General Councel of the Army in
their Anſwer ſay, <hi>We acknowledge it to be a Courſe in it ſelf
irregular, and not juſtifiable but both by honeſt intentions for
publick good, and an extraordinary Neceſſity for the ſame
end leading us thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe being the two pillars upon which is laid the whole
weight of the juſtification of the Army in this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and (we beleeve) unparallell'd courſe of proceedings;
We ſhall apply our ſelves to diſcover the weakneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs
of them both. For our more clear proceedings
herein, we ſhall firſt ſtate the Caſe which is endeavoured by
this paper to be juſtified.</p>
            <p>They are an <hi>Armie</hi> raiſed and formed by Ordinance of
Parliament of the 15 of <hi>February</hi> 1644, for the <hi>defence</hi>
of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and true <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi>
the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and to be from
time to time <hi>ſubject</hi> to ſuch <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> as they
ſhall receive from <hi>both Houſes of Parliament.</hi> And for that
end they ſtand commiſſionated by them, and receive pay
from them at this day. And beſides the Truſt they hereby
have aſſumed, they are under the obligation of a ſolemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
ſworn to Almighty God, <hi>That they will in their
places and callings; with ſincerity, reality and conſtancy, with
their eſtates and lives, preſerve the Rights and Priviledges
of the Parliament, and the Liberties of the Kingdome; and
defend the Kings perſon and Authority in the defence of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125558:3"/>
true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdom.</hi> They being
under theſe Truſts and? Obligations by and to the Houſes, with
their Arms, contrary to their Orders, marched into <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
and without any order from them, they placed ſome
of their Regiments at and about the door of the Houſe of
Commons upon the ſixth and ſeventh of <hi>December</hi> laſt, and
there (with a Liſt of the names of divers Members of the
Houſe) their Officers and Souldiers (appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
forcibly ſecluded ſome, ſeized upon, impriſoned, and
detained others from their attendance of the Houſe, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
many others to abſent themſelves. The Queſtion
now is, Whether any thing in this paper can juſtifie this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of theirs, either upon the good Intentions or Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pretended therein. This being the point in Iſſue, which
they affirm, and we deny: We ſhall now proceed to conſider
their grounds.</p>
            <p>For their good Intentions, which cannot be known to us
but by their expreſſions and actions, they referre us to their
Propoſals, Declarations and Remonſtrances: where wee
finde their deſires are to take away the Kings life, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the lives of the Prince and the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> at leaſt,
to diſ-inherit both them and all the Kings children; to put
a period to this Parliament; to ſet up a new Repreſentative,
which takes away all Parliaments; to have an elective King,
if any. Theſe are the intentions for publick good, which
muſt come in to help their actions, that are confeſſed to be
otherwiſe irregular and unjuſtifiable. We think the very
naming of them doth manifeſt, that they are apparantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Laws of God, and the Laws of the Kingdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they live, and have no juſtification for themſelves,
much leſſe any to ſpare for their actions; whereof we leave
the whole Kingdome (for whoſe good, as ſaid, theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
are) to be judges. And we ſhall produce no other
witneſſe to prove this, but themſelves. On the 15 of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
1647, the paper called <hi>The Agreement of the people,</hi>
which is ſomewhat lower then theſe which they call Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for publick good, was condemned by the Army; the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125558:4"/>
promoting of it judged capitall, Colonel <hi>Rainſhorough</hi> and
Major <hi>Scot</hi> complained of by them to the Houſe for appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it, and the paper it ſelf then adjudged by the Houſe
deſtructive to Government, and the being of Parliament.
And upon this their evidence againſt themſelves we leave
this point.</p>
            <p>And to proceed to the other ground of their juſtification,
<hi>viz.</hi> Extraordinary <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> which is laid down in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
thus: After they have brought in their <hi>good intentions</hi>
for their juſtification, (and what thoſe are, we have cited out
of their own papers, to which they refer us,) it is then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>And an extraordinary Neceſſity for the ſame and leading
us thereunto.</hi> It appears in the firſt opening of this neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of what nature it is, that tends to ſuch ends as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it. But for the better diſquiſition thereof, before we
come to the particulars to ſet forth this neceſſity in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
we ſhall lay down ſome generall Obſervations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
concerning this their Plea.</p>
            <p>1. The Army made the very ſame plea of extraordinary
neceſſity in their Remonſtrance <hi>June</hi> 23. 1647, that now
is made in this paper, upon quite contrary grounds then
what they expreſſe now; and both to juſtifie the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
violent proceedings againſt the Parliament: dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
onely in degrees, this later worſe then the former.
Then when the King was ſeized upon by a party of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
without Order from the Houſe, and the Army advanced
againſt the Parliament, they ſay in their Letter to the Houſe
<hi>July</hi> the 8, 1647, <hi>There have been ſeverall Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
upon ſeverall occaſions ſent to his Majeſtie: The first, to
preſent to him a Copy of the Repreſentations; and after that, ſome
others to tender him a Copie of the Remonstrance: upon b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th
which the Officers ſent were appointed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leer the ſenſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of any thing in either paper whereupon his Majeſtie might
make any queſtion.</hi> There they treated with the King; and
now they offer violence to the Parliament for treating with
the King. Then in their Remonſtrance <hi>Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 23. 1647, it is
ſaid, <hi>We ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rly profeſſe, we do not ſee how there can be any peace
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125558:4"/>
to this Kingdom firms or laſting, without a due conſideration of,
and proviſion for the Rights, quiet and Immunities of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Royall Family, and his late partakers.</hi> Now they judge
the Majority of the Houſe corrupt, and proceed violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them for moving one ſtep towards a peace with the
King, though he hath granted more then all their Propoſals,
and make this a neceſſity ſharp enough to juſtifie the uſing
of their ſwords contrary to their Commiſſions. This were
cauſe enough to make the unſoundneſſe of this plea of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
appear to all the world, and even to be ſuſpected by
themſelves, that ſerves to juſtifie contradictions which they
are put to, by making themſelve Judgess of thoſe things they
have no calling to meddle with; and taking them out of thoſe
hands to whom of right it belongs to judge them.</p>
            <p>2. This plea of neceſſity which is made in this paper, is
deſtructive to all Government. For by the ſame reaſon that
the General Officer urgeth neceſſity for acting againſt the
command and perſons of his Superiours, and makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Judge of that neceſſity; the inferiour Officer may urge
the ſame neceſſity in his judgement to act againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of his Generall; and the Souldiers may urge the
like for acting againſt their Officers; and any other 20000
men in the Kingdom to act againſt the Army; and this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to act (as againſt this Parliament, ſo) againſt any other
Government of Repreſentative that ſhall be ſet up; and
ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Did the Members of Parliament proceed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
contrary to their truſt in the judgement of thoſe that
did elect them: yet it is manifeſt, that the power of adviſing,
voting and acting being placed in the Members of Parliament
by the Law of the Land, and ancient Rights of Parliament,
they are not accountable, much leſſe cenſurable for the uſe of
it according to their own judgment and conſciences, though
contrary to theirs that choſe them. They are only in ſuch
caſes accountable to, and cenſurable by the Houſe; which
they could not reaſonably be, if they were cenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rable by the
people that ſent them. For then the Parliament might judge

the Electors may judge that evill which the Houſe may
judge to be good; and ſo no man can be ſafe or free in the
ſervice of the Parliament. But were power and truſt placed
in the Members of Parliament by law, only to be uſed or not
uſed, valid or null, at the Electors judgment; yet in ſuch caſe
the Members of Parliament were only accountable to the
Counties, Cities or Boroughs for which they ſerve; and not to
Strangers: and in no caſe are they accountable to the Army;
who are ſo far from being thoſe from whom they received
their Truſt, that they are only perſons in a ſubordinate Truſt
under them, for their defence from force. Which how well
they have performed, we leave to the judgment of all thoſe
who obſerve their preſent proceedings.</p>
            <p>4. Theſe actions, which they undertake to juſtifie, are
contrary not onely to their truſt, but to the expreſs letter of
the Covenant and Proteſtation which they have taken. And
breach of Oath being a morall evill, it is not to be juſtified
by neceſſity and good intentions. <hi>Saul,</hi> though a King and
thereby qualified to do juſtice;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21 2, 3.</note> yet for executing the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
againſt a Covenant made many hundred yeers before,
and gained ſubtilly by the Gibeonites, who were not of the
children of Iſrael, but of the remnant of the Amorites (with
whom he might preſume to be more bold;) and though he did
this in his zeal to the children of Iſrael and Judah; yet this
neceſſity in his judgment, for publick good, could not warrant
him; God brought a Famine upon the Land for this breach
of Covenant, which ceaſed not untill it was expiated by the
death of ſeven of his ſons that did commit it. See here by
this inſtance what legacy they by their preſent actions may
leave to their poſterity.</p>

wherein are uſed many words to ſhew how the <hi>Majority</hi> of

of ſome whom they call old Malignant Members, and by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
uſed in the new Elections, there came in a flood of new Burgeſſes,
that either are Malignants or Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what is done by the majority of the Houſe, it is the act of the
whole Houſe; ſo what is done againſt the majority of the Houſe
is done againſt the whole Houſe: And to the Charge againſt
the new <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> as it is cleer, the Ordinance for new
Elections was not carried by thoſe we call old Malignants,
(if there be any ſuch in the Houſe) except the major part of
the Houſe was alwayes Malignants, and before the new Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſo, for the Members which came in upon the new Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which are called Neuters or Malignants in generall,
without fixing upon any one particular Member, to which

               </gap> all in generall were ſufficient: Yet we ſhall further
adde, that of all thoſe Members of the new Election, that
are ſecluded or impriſoned, we know none but whoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are allowed by the Houſe, and who are proper Judges
thereof; and who either by their ſervices as Souldiers for the

            <p>Theſe were ſuch teſtimonies of his reality to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
long after the Lord <hi>Liſles</hi> coming out of <hi>Munster;</hi> that
the Houſe did not call it into queſtion, and nothing to the
contrary appeared to the Houſes untill the third of <hi>April</hi>
1648. The Army here having diſputed the Parliaments
Commands, the Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> began to enter into Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
and engagements againſt the Parliament, for which
he made the Remonſtrances, Engagements and Declarations
of the Army the Summer before, both the Cauſe and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;

to prove us herein a right majority, as in other parts of

a corrupt majority: The Charge here lying onely in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and not fixed upon any particular. Yet for our
further cleering, beſides the Teſtimony we have given
againſt the bringing in the King upon any ſuch tearms,

ſay, that though they <hi>advanced hither to attend Providence for
the opening ſome way to avoid the preſent evils deſigned, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the deſired good into the Kingdome; yee they ſaid nor acted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

by that Vote paſſed Decemb.</hi> 5. <hi>they found the corrupt majority ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly
bent to compleat their Deſign in bringing in the King, &amp;c.</hi>
Doe they call their threatning Remonſtrance ſent to the
Houſe, and the Declaration then publiſhed to explaine the
meaning thereof divers dayes before this, a ſaying nothing
in relation to the Parliament? and their Marching up to
the Citie of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with ſo many Regiments
of the Army, contrary to the Order of the Houſe, a doing
nothing in relation to the Parliament. By this it ſeemes
the paſſing of this Vote is the very point of that neceſſity,
which they take to juſtifie all their preſent actings, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Parliament. For before that paſſed, they ſay
<hi>they acted nothing;</hi> therefore We ſhall be more large upon
this Subject.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore firſt ſtate the matter in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Propoſitions of the Houſes and the Kings An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.
As the Propoſitions to the King in the Iſle of <hi>Weight</hi>
contained in them all that ſecurity which the Houſes have
judged neceſſary to propoſe for themſelves, thoſe that have
adhered to them in the Warres, and for the peace of the
whole Kingdome; ſo the King granteth all thoſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in which the main ſecurity reſteth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſtie granted the firſt Propoſition for taking off
Declarations, &amp;c. as was deſired.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie granted the third Propoſition concerning
the Militia, as was deſired.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie conſented to the Propoſition of <hi>Irela.</hi> limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the time of the Parliam. diſpoſing Offices to 20. yeers.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty conſented to ſuch Acts for Publike Debts
and Publike uſes as ſhould be preſented within two yeeres,
and incurred within the time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:125558:9"/>
His Majeſty granted as it was deſired to the Propoſition
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncerning Peers.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty granted the diſpoſing of Offices in <hi>England</hi> to
the Parliament, ſo that the time limitted exceed not twenty
yeares.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty granted the taking away the Court of Wards,
having 100000l. <hi>per annum</hi> allowed in leiw thereof, to bee
raiſed as the Parliament ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty granted to declare againſt the Earl of <hi>Ormonds</hi>
power and proceedings after an agreement with his Houſes.</p>
            <p>The onely difference remaineth upon two Propoſitions:
that concerning Delinquents, and that concerning the
Church.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, wee ſhall here ſet down that part of
the Kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>all anſwer, wherein the difference lieth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And his Majeſty doth conſent,</hi> that the ſeverall perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in the ſaid Propoſitions ſhall ſubmit to moderate Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
according to ſuch r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes and proportions as they and the
two Houſes ſhall agree upon. The particulars whereof, his Majeſty
leaves wholy to ſuch agreement, deſiring only that the rates and
value may be mittigated and reduced to a more moderate propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and his Majesty will give way that the perſons inſisted
upon by his two Houſes, ſhall be removed from his Councell,
and be reſtrained from comming within the verge of the King,
Queenes, and Princes Court; and that they may not beare any
office or have any imployment in the State or Common-wealth,
without advice and conſent of both his Houſes of Parliament.
But his Majeſty cannot agree that thoſe who do the contrary ſhall
incurre ſuch ſevere penalties, as to be guilty of high Treaſon and
forfeit their lives and eſtates without any capacity of pardon,
as in the ſaid Propoſition is contained there being a penalty le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
implied upon the breach of any Act of Parliament, which
his Majeſty intends not to diſponce withall. As to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
perſons mentioned in the ſaid Votes to bee excepted, his
Majeſty for the peace of the Kingdom will conſent that they
may abſent themſelves out of the Kingdom for ſuch time us
the two Houſes ſhall think fit, deſiring nevertheleſſe that they
may be admitted to Compoſition for their Estates; and if any
of them ſhall be proceeded againſt according to the ancient and
eſtabliſhed Law of the Kingdom, his Majeſty will not interpoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:125558:10"/>
to hinder any legall proceedings thereupon; but that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhould joyne in any Act for the taking away of the life or
estates of any that have adhered to him, his Majesty cannot with
Iuſtice and Honour agree thereunto.</p>
            <p>As to all other perſons mentioned in the Propoſitions, his
Majeſty will further conſent, that they ſhall not ſit or vote as
Members or aſſiſtants in either Houſe of Parliament, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
nor bee of his Majeſties privy Councell, Officers of State,
or Iudges, or in other Offices without conſent of both Houſes.</p>
            <p>As for all Clergy men against whom any ſcandalous
life can be proved, or other legall Charges, his Majeſty
wlll remit them to the Law. But for all others who ſhall
conforme to what his Majeſty and his two Houſes ſhall
agree upon, his Majeſty conceives fit where their livings
are void they may be reſtored to them, and where any other
is incumbent in any of their preferments, that the party
now outed of his living may receive a third part of the
profits, unleſse he be otherwiſe provided, that thus the one
may not want a livelihood, nor the other be outed of any
living, untill ſome fitting preferment be found for eithor.</p>
            <p>In this anſwer, though the King doth not fully grant what
the Houſes deſire, yet he conſents to joyne with the Houſes
in making them incapable of bearing any Office of publique
truſt without the conſent of the Houſes.</p>
            <p>And for theſe, whom the Houſes propoſe to compound with
the King leaves them to ſuch Compoſitions as they and the
Houſes ſhall agree on, which is the conditioo they are now in;
the Houſes forceing compoſition upon none but by ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their eſtates, which continues untill they compound.
And for theſe whom the Houſes propoſed to proceed againſt
capitally, the King leaves them to a legall tryall, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
<hi>that he will not interpoſe to hinder it</hi> which ſatisfied,
the maine grievance of the Parliament (as we conceive) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared
in the beginning of their War concerning Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
which was not for that the King refuſed to joyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with the Houſes puniſhing of Delinquents, but for that the
King by force of Armes protected Delinquents from juſtice;
and all that the Houſe did deſire in the Propoſition concerning
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:125558:10"/>
Delinquents preſented to the King at <hi>Oxford, February</hi> 1642. was
<hi>that your Majeſty leave Delinquents to a legall tryall and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Parliament.</hi> And wee ſee not what evaſion from Iuſtice is
left to ſuch as have made War againſt the Parliament and Law of the
land, when the King firſt by a Law declares the Parliaments war to be
juſt, and afterwards leaves theſe that had fought againſt them to the
judg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>awes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Propoſition wherein the onely materiall difference
reſteth, is that of the Church, which ſtandeth thus,</hi> viz. The Houſes
propoſed that a Bill be paſſed for the utter aboliſhing of Arch-Biſhops,
Biſhops, &amp;c. and for ſale of Biſhops Lands, That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Religion bee ſetled by Act of Parliament in ſuch
manner as both Houſes have agreed or ſhall agree upon: To
which the King anſwers,</p>
            <p>That it is his judgement and conſcience, that he cannot (as he
ſtands yet informed) aboliſh Epiſcopacy out of the Church; yet
becauſe he apprehends how fatall new diſtractions may be to this
Kingdom, and that he beleeves his two Houſes will yeeld to truth
if that ſhall bè manifeſted to them, if convinced, his Majeſty
doth again deſire that there be a Conſultation of Divines as he
hath formerly propoſed, and his Majeſty will ſuſpend the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
power as well in point of Ordination of Ministers, as in that
of Iuriſdiction, untill he and his two Houſes agree what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall be eſtabliſht in the future.</p>
            <p>As for the Biſhops Lands, though hee cannot conſent to the
abſolute alienation of them from <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Church, yet he will agree
t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at the propriety and inheritance ſhall by Act of Parliament
be ſetled in the Crowne to be declared in truſt for the uſe of the
Church-men, to be imployed by his Majeſty, his heires and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours
with advice of his two Houſes for the uſe aforeſaid, and
that Leaſes ſhall be made for lives or years (not exceeding 99
years) for the ſatisfaction of the Purchaſors and Contractors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his former anſwers, or reſerving the old rents or other
moderate rents for the maintenance of them to whom they did
formerly belong, and for the future benefit of the Church: And
in all things elſe, his Majeſty refers himſelfe to his former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:125558:11"/>
And in his former anſwers dated <hi>October</hi> 21. 1648.
He conſents to the taking away all Arch-biſhops, Chancellours,
Commiſſaries, Deans and Sub-deans, and Chapters, Arch deacons,
Cannons, and Prebendaries, and all Chanters, Chancellours, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers,
Succentours, Sachriſts, old Vicars, new Vicars of any
Cathedrall Church, and all other their under officers, out
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Church
of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe anſwers (as wee conceive) the King takes away the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church by Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. by his taking
away their Courts; the Biſhops having no authority to convent any
perſon, ſend for any witneſſe, heare any cauſe, paſſe any cenſure or
judgement, or exerciſe any Acts of Church Government, but by
and in their Courts, which being by this anſwer aboliſht, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
fals. And for their power of Ordination; though it bee
not abſolutely taken away, yet the exerciſe of it is ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nded, ſo
as it is equivalent, for the Biſhops can never exerciſe that power
againe in <hi>England,</hi> untill they be reſtored hereunto by Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament;
And if that power had been abſolutely taken away, yet if
the King and both Houſes of Parliament reſtore it, it is againe eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht:
So that the maine deſect in this anſwer is, in that the King
agree<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and of what we ſhall uſe our beſt endeavours fully to effect according

which as it doth appeare by the Words of the Vote it ſelfe; ſo
it is alſo manifeſt to bee the full purpoſe and ſenſe of the

their judgements thereupon againſt a breach with the
King, and continuance of this unnaturall Warre betwixt the
King and his people, upon the difference at laſt by the bleſsing
of God brought into ſo narrow a compaſſe. And this being a
true ſtate of the matter then in debate, and Our ſenſe in the
Vote that paſſed thereupon, Wee judged it moſt conſiſtent
with Our duties as Chriſtians, and our Truſt as Members of

Us) towards the happy ſettlement of thi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

God and Man being appealed unto therein. We ſhall here lay
down ſome of the Conſiderations both on the one hand and
on the other, which carryed our Iudgements to the paſsing
this Vote.</p>
            <p>1. The advantages by this proceeding towards a cloſe with
the King upon what hee hath granted, are the ſaving of the
Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> out of the hands of the bloudy Popiſh
<hi>Rebels,</hi> and preſerving it to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining

               </gap>ed Government
of this Kingdome, the honour of Parliament in making
Peace after ſo troubleſome a Warre; and in a word, the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the moſt ſad iſſue of <hi>Engliſh</hi> bloud that ever was opened
in this Nation; and the putting of the people of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
into poſſeſsion of greater ſecurity of their Lawes and
Liberties againſt the over growing power of the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:125558:12"/>
then ever any of Our Anceſtors in the greateſt of
their ſucceſſes could ever attaine unto.</p>
            <p>The conſequences viſible in our eyes, if we ſhould upon the
matter in difference have made a breach with the King are:</p>
            <p>1. The depoſing, if not the taking away the life of the King;
what miſeries upon either of theſe have formerly enſued to
this Kingdome our own Hiſtories tell Us. Although for the
latter (which Wee unwillingly mention) there was never
any preſident for it in this Kingdome, nor ever made by any
Proteſtants in the World; and We deſire it may never bee
done by any in this Kingdome, being that, which from our
harts We doe deteſt and abhorre. We cannot but remember
in the end of our Warre the day wherein God hath given Vs
proſperity, the Declarations which We made in the beginning
of Our Warre, and the obligations which We laid upon our
ſelves and the Kingdome when we were low.</p>

Wee had conſideration of the vaſt debts which the

to this Army, and to all the Souldiers in the Kingdom? What
multitude of extream ſufferers in this City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in every
County of the Kingdome, by what they have lent to, and loſt
for the Parliament? Who by the continuance of the Warre
are onely like to bee paid with more ſufferings and

to recede. By Which this Paper ſeems</hi> to glance at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

            <p>But for the Covenant, wee ſay the Kings Anſwer
takes away Church Government by Arch Biſhops, Biſhops,
&amp;c. by taking away their Courts, and ſo farre takes
away their Power of Ordination that it can never be
revived again, but by an Act of Parliament: ſo that
Epiſcopacy is diveſted of any actuall being by the Law
of the Land, and inſtead thereof the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is put into poſſeſſion by a Law for three
yeares. And wee ſay, that the King having granted
the reſt of the Propoſitions and ſo much in this, the
Covenant doth not oblige us to make Warre upon
this point to gaine what wee deſired after the three
yeares, <hi>and ſhall really and conſtantly endeavour to obtain
in our places and Callings.</hi> Nothing could have made the
Kingdome more irreconſileable to the Presbyterie

put out the eye of our reaſon) that beſides the hope we
might have of His Majeſties comming neerer to us in
this point, and in the Covenant it ſelfe, upon our
comming neerer to Him in the abſolute concluding and

               </gap>ng of Peace; the Parliament, by what is
granted already, is put into a better capacity for ſetling
Presbytery by a perpetuall Law, then (as things now
ſtand) they can reaſonably preſume of by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Warre. The power of the ſword apparently
threatning not only the deſtruction of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the being of the Church (if
Almighty God prevent not) by ſtriking at the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Faith, contemning conſcientious Miniſters
and Miniſtery it ſelf, taking away their Maintenance; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
the Reformation of the Univerſities; ſlighting
of learning; and profeſſedly promoting a moſt licentious
Toleration for all manner of Errors, Hereſies, Schiſmes and
prophaneſs in the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This being our preſent condition, we hope we ſhall be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

               </gap> it is the laſt to get a full confirmation thereof,

further. And now we appeal to the Purchaſers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
whether we ought to have made an abſolute breach
upon this point, or thereby ſhould have performed our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Faith to the whole Kingdome and themſelves.</p>
            <p>As to what is ſaid, <hi>that the corrupt majority would not lend an
Eare to admit a thought towards the laying down their own power, or
rendring it back to the People from whom they received it.</hi>
Wee anſwer, that this is an unreaſonable objection, by
them who endeavours to perpetuate an Army upon the
Kingdome: Nor is the continuance of this Parliament ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
at large: but <hi>that we are not willing to render our Power
back again to the People,</hi> by which means (as their other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and actions tell us) <hi>a new Repreſentative</hi> made by the
Army; ſo that the complaint in effect is, that we are not
willing to render the power put into us for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdome, into the hands of the Army;
which, wee con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſe, wee think wee ought not to doe.
But as there is little doubt to be made that before an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
concluſion of Peace with the King, an Act might
have been had for putting a Period in ſhort time to
this Parliament: We for our parts, when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſhould had been in quiet poſſeſſion of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
by Acts of Parliament, upon the concluſion
and ſettlement of Peace; There are no perſons living
would be more deſirous then our ſelves to put a Period
to our ſervice in Parliament, and leave it to the
care of ſucceeding Parliaments to preſerve what, this
hath gained to our Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhould have ended this point here, but for one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
more; which is made by their other Papers againſt
any Agreement with the King, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That whatſoever the King grants in this Treaty hee may
plead force to breake it, and that for any thing can bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
hee is like to uſe his endeavours to ſpoile us,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:125558:15"/>
by policy of what we have gained by the expence of ſo much
bloud.</hi> For anſwer hereunto: We ſay firſt, That this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lies againſt any agreement with the King, though hee
granted all the Houſes deſired or could deſire; and againſt
any agreement betwixt King and people after a Warre made.
It can hardly be imagined, after ſuch differences, but that for
ſometime animoſities will remain, and a diſpoſition in thoſe
who thinke they have loſt any part of their power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
it) It being naturall to all men in power to increaſe
their power) That this objection lay as ſtrong againſt all
former Treaties with His Majeſty for Peace after the
Warre began, and againſt the declared end of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Warre, (and of all juſt Warre) a good Peace with
His Majeſty.</p>
            <p>But more particularly wee ſay, That the weight of this
objection, depends only upon an uncertain conjecture
of what may or may not bee hereafter, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
experience, which this Kingdome hath had in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
ſuch Agreements, made in the heat of former
differences, ſtrengthened us againſt the feare of the
danger of it. And though ſometimes the Kings of this
Realme, and particularly this King, have adventured
to weaken their owne Grants for a time, yet they have
ever beene regained with advantage, obtained and enjoyed
in the times of peace.</p>
            <p>The uſuall means whereby any of the Kings of this
Land have made encroachment upon the good Laws granted
to the people, and their own agreements, have been either by
placing corrupt Judges, or other Miniſters in the Courts of
Juſtice. Who, though they could not abrogate the Law: yet
they have made it ſpeak againſt it ſelf, and their good for
whom it was made, or elſe by the power of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
corrupt Courtiers to honour and profit, to
ſtop the courſe of Juſtice by the Councell-Table for a time.
Both theſe meanes are taken away from this King, by
what is agreed on in this Treatie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:125558:16"/>
The firſt, in the Propoſition placing the choice of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in the Parliament; whereby as they have the Lawes
they deſire, ſo they have the choice of the Judges and Officers
that muſt adminiſter them.</p>
            <p>And the ſecond, in the Propoſition barring the King
from making any new Lords for the future to Vote in the
Houſe of Peeres, without the conſent of the Houſes. Which
are a ſtrong ſecurity againſt a politicke, as the M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>litia in the
Houſes is againſt a forceable breach of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we ſay, That it cannot be expected of any Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould be made for peace ſettled after ſuch a Civil War,
without ſome hazard of violation or interruption. But
whether the hazards and dangers be a breach upon ſuch
termes as are now in difference betwixt the Houſes Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and the Kings anſwer, be not more and greater, and
whether (in caſe endeavours ſhould be uſed hereafter to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
this agreement) the Parliament might not then with
more Juſtice, and greater advantage draw the Sword, then
they can now keepe it unſhathed upon the matter in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
Wee leave it to all ſober minded men to judge.
And to what is ſaid, <hi>That they wanted not good intelligence, that
had they been ſuffered to meet all in the Houſe but once more, it was
deſigned to have paſſed ſome higher reſolutions to lay further foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of ſuch new quarrell, ſo as to carry therein the name and
countenance of Parliamentary authority together with the Kings,
and acceptable pretence of peace, to draw men in, and then to have
adjourned the Parliament for a long time, the excluſion of all remedy
in the caſe but by another Warre.</hi> Wee ſay the Houſe at the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Vote upon the Kings Anſwers immediately appointed a
Committee to goe to the Generall and conferre with him
and the Officers of the Army, to keepe a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betwixt the Houſe and the Army. Which ſhewed the
full intent of the Houſe to proceed by all amicable wayes
with them, not by force, but by reaſon. Which they were
ſo far from attending unto, (as in duty and conſcience they
ought to have done, and to which the Lord Generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
his readineſſe, however it was hindered afterwards.)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:125558:16"/>
That they ſeized upon one of the Commiſſioners appointed
to Treat with them; affronted another of them, and left no
way for any conference, that might have given them the
the grounds of the Houſes proceedings; which gives grounds
of ſuſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion, that they were reſolved to do what they had
deſigned, whatſoever the Houſes had endeavoured to the

            <p>Thus we have the more largely opened the thoughts of
