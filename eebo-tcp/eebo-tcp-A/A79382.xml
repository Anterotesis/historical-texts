            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROCLAMATION Touching the Election Of fit Perſons to ſerve in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <head>By the King.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving occaſion at this time to deliberate upon divers great and weighty Affairs, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tending to the continuance and further ſetling of the peaceable Government and Saſety of this our Kingdom, whereof God hath given us the Charge, We have thought good according to the laudable Cuſtome of our Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to crave the Advice and aſſiſtance herein of our well affected Subjects, by calling a Parliament. And though there were no more to be had in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration but the preſent face of Chriſtendom ſo miſerably and dangerouſly diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at this time, beſides a number of other great and weighty Affairs that we are to reſolve upon; We have more then ſufficient reaſon to wiſh and deſire (if ever at any time, eſpecially at this) that the Knights and Burgeſſes that ſhall ſerve in Parliament, be, according to the old Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, choſen of the graveſt, ableſt, and beſt affected minds that maybe found: And therefore out of our care of the Commom Good, whereof themſelves are alſo participant, We do hereby admoniſh all our loving Subjects that have Votes in the Elections, that choice be made of Perſons approved for their ſincerity in Religion, and not of any that is noted either of ſuperſtitious blindneſs one way, or of turbulent Humours another way, but of ſuch as ſhall be found zealous and obedient Children to their Mother-Church.</p>
            <p>And as to the Knights of <hi>Shires,</hi> That they caſt their eyes upon the worthieſt men of all ſorts of Knights and Gentlemen, that are Guides and Lights of their Countryes, of good experience, and great Integrity, men that lead an honeſt and exemplary life in their Countryes, doing us good ſervice therein; And no Banckrupts or diſcontented perſons that cannot fiſh but in troubled waters. And for the Burgeſſes, That they make choice of them that beſt underſtand the ſtate of their Countryes, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Burroughs: And where ſuch may not be had within their Corporations, then of other grave and diſcreet men fit to ſerve in ſo worthy an Aſſembly. For we may well fore-ſee, how ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the bad choiſe of unfit men may produce, if the Houſe ſhould be ſupplyed with Banckrupts, and neceſſitous perſons, that may deſire long Parliaments for their private Protections, or with young and unexperienced men, that are not ripe and mature for ſo grave a Counſel; or with men of mean Qualities in themſelves, who may only ſerve to applaud the Opinion of others on whom they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; or yet with curious and wrangling Lawyers, who may ſeek reputation by ſtirring needleſs Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. But we wiſh all our good Subjects ſo to underſtand theſe our Admonitions, as that we no way mean to barre them of their lawfull Freedom in Election, according to their Fundamental Laws and laudable Cuſtomes of this our Kingdom, and eſpecially in the times of good and ſettled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
