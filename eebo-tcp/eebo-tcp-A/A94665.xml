            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

had and obtained Writts of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> out of the Courts of
Common-Law and Chancery, to go abroad to proſecute their Law
ſuites, and compound with Creditors, and to provide for ſubſiſtance:
Which Writts have beene granted ſucceſſively by the moſt learned Judges, as alſo
by the Lord Chancellours and Lord Keepers of the great Seale in their ſeverall times
without in termiſſion, untill now of late that the Iudges of the Common Pleas have
refuſed to grant the ſame, which will tend to the utter undoing of many of your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners,

inclination towards the afflicted and diſtreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore your Petitioners are moſt humble Suitours to your Honours that your ſaid

            <head>Breife Reaſons for granting Writs of Habeas Corpus to Priſoners
in Execution, eſpecially in the Fleet.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ANtiently the Warden of the Fleet might without Writ ſend any Priſoners
abroad with their Keepers upon all occaſions, till the Statute of 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.
<hi>Cap.</hi> 12. reſtreyned him, unleſſe he had the Kings Writ or command for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are Prerogative Writts or Writts of Grace which the King never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
to any of his diſtreſſed Subjects upon juſt occaſions: Either for his owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
or for their preſervation aſwell in their Perſons as Eſtates. And therefore the
Exchequer frequently granteth them to the Kings Accomptants Debtors and Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
in Execution, for the raiſing and levying of His Majeſties Debts and Revenues.
And the Chancery awardeth them to remove Priſoners into the Countrey out of the
Fleet when the infection is in <hi>London;</hi> and when they have Law Suits, to Solicite
their owne cauſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Fleet is a ſpeciall Priſon of the Kings for civill matters, As the Tower of
<hi>London</hi> is for Criminall, and thither are men committed for Debts to the King and
for contempts of Orders and Decrees in Chancery and all other Courts of Equity.
And if any other Priſoners for Debt be removed thither, they have ever been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the priviledge and benefit of thoſe Writts aſwell as the Kings Priſoners.</p>
