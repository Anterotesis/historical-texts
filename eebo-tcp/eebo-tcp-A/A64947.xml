         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It contains three hundred ſixty five naturall dayes, five equinoctiall houres, forty nine minutes, and ſixteen ſeconds or ſections, which are the ſixtieth part of a minute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julius Caeſar, Romes</hi> Dictator and Emperor, finding their Calender very faulty and variouſly embolized with more or leſſe intercalations, at the ignorant Augurs and Prieſts pleaſures, by advice of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This the whole Empire obſerved, which South-Brittain being a branch therof, hath kept unaltered to this day: ſo ſince his Inſtitution, 1700 years ago, have reſulted about thirteen dayes; which ſhould be ſubſtracted or taken back, to bring the times in their proper ſtations as they were then or at Chriſts birth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregorian Accompt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To correct this obliquity or aberration, <hi>P. Gregory</hi> 13. in the Council of <hi>Trent, A.</hi> 1582 by direction of <hi>Aloyſius Lilius</hi> a learned Aſtronomer, ſtruck oft ten dayes (which ſhould be two more as <hi>Lily</hi> adviſed) regulating the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation according to the times of the firſt Generall Synod at <hi>Nice, A.</hi> 325. when Sol entred Aries at the Vernal Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox, <hi>March</hi> 21. as the Records teſtifie: This alteration was made <hi>Oct.</hi> 4. and the next day inſcribed <hi>Oct.</hi> 15. The firſt Reformation is called <hi>Julian</hi> or <hi>Seſigenean,</hi> the laſt (which is no new, <hi>AEra</hi> or Accompt, but a neceſſary Note or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſion on the former) the <hi>Gregorian</hi> or <hi>Lilian</hi>: but both Romane (one Imperial, the other Papal) and both ſomewhat erroneous, as is premonſtrated. This latter all Chriſtendome (except <hi>England</hi>) obſerves, being no point of Religion, but civil computation, which ſome Parliaments have conſulted to do; but becauſe ten or twelve days defalked at once, may breed much alteration in Conrracts, Bonds, and payment of Rents, they refuſed to alter or amend it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manner of reforming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit an eaſier way will do it without the leaſt inconvenience to any, if all Biſſextil years be barred for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four together (when we ſhall meet with the Forren Accompt, which will then be eleven dayes before us, by omitting one Leap year, <hi>A.</hi> 1700.) or fifty two to ſubſtract thirteen dayes, and be two dayes before them, which is righteſt; for what prejudice can accrue, if all years ſo long run equall, ſans adding one day every fourth: The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine Fathers decreed to forbear a Leap year at end of each Century (as <hi>A.</hi> 1700. 1800. 1900. but none <hi>A.</hi> 2000) becauſe in one hundred thirty four years reſults one day, which in four hundred makes about three, and this will keep it right in their cue or courſe for ever. The like Proviſo by Act or Edict will do it here, if the State pleaſe, that no Biſſextil or Leap year be kept in <hi>England</hi> for forty four years next inſuing (which will jump with them) or fifty two (which will fully reform) but afterward to be held every fourth year, except at end of each hundred thirty and fourth year for ever: Or elſe thus, Except at end of every hundred year for three hundred years together, and at end of each four hundred year, to be kept againe as before.</p>

               <p n="1">I. AS Creation according to our <hi>Julian</hi> Engliſh year, the Vernal Equinox (now <hi>March</hi> 10.) befel <hi>April</hi> 21. and the Autumnal (now <hi>Sept.</hi> 13.) on <hi>Oct.</hi> 25. So the Eſtivall Solſtice (now <hi>June</hi> 13.) on <hi>July</hi> 23. and the Hyemal, (now <hi>Dec.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.) on <hi>Jan.</hi> 23. for the ſeaſons in 5686. years paſt to this year 1656. have anticipated 42 days and ten hours from <hi>Caeſars</hi> reformation twelve daies and ſixteen hours; ſince Chriſts Incarnation twelve daies and eight hours, as all Artiſts by exact calculation ſhal find true; becauſe in every forty five years there reſult eight hours compleat, and in a hundred thirty four years, one entire day, as is fore-ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. From this deformity or obliquity ariſe two maine incongruities, 1. That the twelve laſt daies in every moneth ſince Chriſts time, uſurp the room of the twelve firſt in the next; ſo about 2500 years hence (if the World ſhall ſo long laſt) every one wil wholly poſſeſs the place of his next neighbour; which is a Turkiſh Solaeciſme in Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whoſe Summer moneths in very few years take up their Hybernals in the Winter rooms; and contrarily, not caring in what ſeaſons they celebrate their Pſeudo-Feſtivals. 2. That our Chriſtian Feaſts are not obſerved in the ſame ſet ſeaſons they ſhould be, but twelve daies too late; for Chriſt is ſtoried to be borne on the ſhorteſt day (as his Fore-runner <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt on the longeſt) when Sol entred Capricorn, which befell <hi>Dec.</hi> 25. but now by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of twelve daies fals on <hi>Dec.</hi> 13. ſo by right, Chriſtmas day ſhould be ſet where <hi>Dec.</hi> 13. ſtands, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany in place of it; the like obliquity occurs in all other Feſtivities, which ſome Sects no more regard then Infidel <hi>Mahometans</hi>; but theſe incongruities will eaſily be redreſſed by barring of Leap years for fifty two years.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A conformity to the common Calender current in all Chriſtendome, by prohibiting Leap year but 44 years wil much facilitate commerce with Forren Nations, and cut off the duple difference of <hi>Stilo veteri &amp; novo,</hi> which makes much confuſion in letters, accompts, and tranſactions among Merchants, to their ineffable benefit.</p>
