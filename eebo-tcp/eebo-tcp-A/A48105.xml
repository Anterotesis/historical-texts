            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Undertakers of theſe two Lotteries have joined their Books cut out and their Intereſt together, for the more ſpeedy and full drawing of the ſame, which now cannot be doubted but it will be done in few days: of which notice ſhall be given, and the Adventurers in the <hi>Triple Adventutre</hi> are deſired forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to change their Tickets, for others in the <hi>Ladies Invention.</hi> Monies are now actually paying into the Goldſmiths, and all things are preparing for the drawing the ſaid Lottery.</p>
            <p>The Truſtees of the <hi>Ladies Invention</hi> thought this Method much more advantageous, and ſatisfactory to the Adventurers than to draw that Lottery two Thirds full on the 8th of <hi>December</hi> Inſtant, which the Undertakers muſt have been conſtrained to do, if then drawn.</p>
            <p>All other Lotteries have either propoſed great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, or Abatements (which is not allowed in this) or elſe have propoſed ſuch vaſt and unreaſonable Diſadvantages, as near 1700 <hi>Blanks to one Prize,</hi> that they ſeem rather to be a great Diſcouragement to any Adventurer, than to deſerve the Name of a <hi>Fair Lottery.</hi>

            <p>Now the Prizes here are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove treble the number than are generally propoſed, <hi>viz. 3555,</hi> and among them very conſiderable Ones, as you ſee; ſo that tho the Diſadvantage is 140 Blanks to one Prize in this, yet the vaſt Advantages made up by great Prizes, as 100, 500, 100, 50,  and thoſe numerous too, makes a full amends to the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and conſequently muſt be deemed the <hi>Faireſt Lottery ever yet ſet on foot;</hi> eſpecially ſeeing that 1555 Prizes are now added to the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals.</p>
            <p>Thus for Six pence Adventure only, there is a fair proſpect of getting a Thouſand Pounds, which is forty Thouſand times as much in real value as your Adventure, and twenty Thouſand times as much in other Lots, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Advantage in this Lottery above others, is, that the Stake you lay down, or Adventure you make, is ſo little in proportion to the vaſt Gains the Fortunate may obtain, that 'tis preferable to any other.</p>
            <p>And for Satisfaction of ſuch Perſons as ſhall be Adventurers, the following Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths are appointed to be Caſheers; in whoſe Hands the Monies arſiing from the ſeveral Books will be depoſited: And every Benefit, or Prize, after compared with the Books will be paid by Mr <hi>Benj. Tudman</hi> at the <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>Lombardſtreet;</hi> Mr <hi>Rich. Hoare,</hi> at the <hi>Golden Bottle</hi> in <hi>Fleetſtreet;</hi> Mr <hi>John Pearſon</hi> at the <hi>Unicorn</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> Goldſmiths.</p>
            <p>The Undertakers becauſe they would have it drawn compleatly full, have been at vaſt Charge and Expence to ſend Books into the Country, which has been ſeldom, or never done before, ſo that the Trouble and Expence in managing this, is, and will be of neceſſity greater than any other.</p>
            <p>Theſe Worthy Gentlemen have been pleaſed to promiſe the Undertaker to ſee the fair Dr wing of it; which will be done at <hi>Frank</hi>'s Coffee Houſe behind the <hi>Royal Exchange.</hi> The Honourable Mr <hi>O Brien,</hi> Sir <hi>Benjamin Titebburn,</hi> Kt; <hi>James Iſaackſon,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Dr <hi>William Coward,</hi> Captain <hi>John Knap, Richard Halton</hi> Gent.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Engine is preparing for that purpoſe, which be after a new Mode, made of Glaſs, that the Billets may be viſible to every Spectator, with 4 Doors out of which the Tickets will be drawn; ſo that it will be impoſſible to have any thing mdre fairly and equally Performed.</p>
            <p>And every Book-keeper for the Satisfaction of all his Friends that take Tickets from him, ſhall have liberty to roul up and ſow the middle Billets in the Book, and put them into the Engine with his own Hands: The Prizes ſhall be daily printed as drawn, and ſigned by the Undertakers and Truſtees.</p>
            <p>And for a further Incouragement, and Satisfaction to all the Adventurers in this Lottery, the Undertakers do promiſe that as ſoon as the Prizes are all drawn, all the Blanks remaining in the Engine ſhall be duly taken out, Regiſtred and Filed, in order to be ſearched, that every Adventurer that pleaſes may there find his Number Tickets.</p>
