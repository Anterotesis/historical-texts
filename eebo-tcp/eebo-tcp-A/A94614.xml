            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat your Petitioners, their Husbands, their Children, and their Families, amounting to many
thouſand ſoules; have lived in plentifull and good faſhion, by the exerciſe of ſeverall Trades, and
venting of divers workes: For learning whereof, many of them have ſerved Apprentiſhips, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
taken houſes and ſhops both in the Citie and Suburbs, and alſo in the Exchanges at very
great rents: All depending wholly for the ſale of their commodities, (which is the maintenance
and very exiſtence and beeing of themſelves, their husbands, and families) upon the ſplendor and
glory of the Engliſh Court, and principally upon that of the Queenes Majeſty; By occaſion of whoſe Royall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
we have hitherto had ready utterance for our commodities, and were thereby enabled to pay our rents, and
live in good repute: But upon late notice that her Majeſtie is reſolved inſtantly to depart the Kingdome, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but thereby fore ſee an utter ceſſation and decay of all our trading; So ſhall we become utterly diſabled to pay
our rents, ſupport our ſelves, or our families; and can apprehend nothing but diſtraction, penury, and ruine:
Or that our eminent and inevitable neceſsities will produce ſome violent effect. And your Petitioners have cauſe
to feare that this ſudden reſolution in her Majeſtie is occaſioned by ſome juſt diſtaſte taken at divers unuſuall and
tumultuous aſſemblies, to the affright of her Royall Perſon, and at the unpuniſht printing of many licentious and
ſcandalous Pamphlets; ſome covertly, ſome plainly, wounding her ſacred Majeſtie in the opinion of the vulgar, as
an Abbettor or Counſellor of ſuch deſignes, which are pretended to diſturbe the peaceable government both of
this Kingdome and <hi>Ireland:</hi> Whereas your Petitioners are confident She was not onely a ſolicitous Mediator for
the aſſembling of this gracious Parliament, but that ſince Her comming into this Kingdome She never did ill office
to any particular Subject, but hath oft beene an Inſtrument of many Acts of mercy and grace to multitudes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
people.</p>
            <p>And your Petitioners likewiſe conſidering the great happineſſe brought to this Nation in her Princely Iſſue, of
which native comfort this Nation hath beene barren now almoſt a hundred yeares; are the more encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humbly to pray,</hi> That this Honourable Aſſembly would give ſome ſpeedy aſſurance to Her Majeſtie, that the
Authors and Inſtigators of ſuch ſeditious tumults and ſcandalls ſhall be ſtrictly enquired after, and puniſht;
and that She may receive ſuch publique vindication by the Parliament, againſt all ſuch calumners of Her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

Petition for Her continuall reſidence amongſt us: whereby She receiving full aſſurance of the love and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
