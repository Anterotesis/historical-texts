            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough Mathematicall ſtudies
have for theſe many years been
much neglected, if not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet have there been ſo
many rare inventions found,
even by men of our own Nation, that nothing
now ſeems almoſt poſſible to be added more:
as in other ſtudies ſo may we ſay in theſe,
<hi>nil dictum quod non dictum prius.</hi> We at
the leaſt muſt needs acknowledge that in this
we have preſented thee with nothing new,
nothing that is our own. <hi>Ex integrâ Graecâ
integram Comoediam, hodie ſum acturus,
Heautonti morum enon,</hi> ſaith <hi>Terence,</hi> that
famous Comoedian: tranſlation was his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
tranſcription and collection ours: this
<pb facs="tcp:60119:3"/>
only we have endeavoured, that the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and foundations of theſe ſtudies (which
until now were not to be known, but by being
acquainted with many Books) might in a due
method and a perſpicuous manner, be as it
were at once, preſented to thy view, and ſerve
as a perfect <hi>INSTITUTION MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEMATICAL,</hi>
unto ſuch as have as
yet learned nothing but Arithmetick.</p>
            <p>To that purpoſe we have firſt laid down
ſuch propoſitions Geometricall, out of <hi>Euclide,
Pitiſcus,</hi> and others, as muſt be known to ſuch
as would underſtand the nature and menſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all Triangles. Next we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the affections of Triangles in the
generall, and thence to the compoſition of
the <hi>Sines, Tangents,</hi> and <hi>Secants</hi> Naturall,
in which we have for the moſt part followed
the Rules preſcribed by <hi>Pitiſcus,</hi> in ſome things
we have taken the direction of <hi>Snellius,</hi> and
in the triſection and quinquiſection of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
we have proceeded Algebraically, with
thoſe two famous Mathematicians of our age
and Nation, <hi>Brigges,</hi> and <hi>Oughtred;</hi> and
becauſe the Algebraicall work is of it ſelfe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe
and intricate, to thoſe that are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, we have inſiſted the more
upon it, and by our explanation we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make it plain and eaſie; and
<pb facs="tcp:60119:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that nothing may be wanting, which either
former ages or our own (by Gods bleſſing and
their induſtry) have afforded to us, we have
to the compoſition of the Natural Canon, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
out of <hi>Briggs</hi> and <hi>Wintage</hi> the conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>Logarithms</hi> of any numbers, and
conſequently how to make the <hi>Logarithms</hi> of
the Naturall <hi>Sines, Tangents,</hi> and <hi>Secants.</hi>
This done, the proportions in the uſuall Caſes
of all <hi>Triangles</hi> both Plain and Sphericall,
we have firſt cleared by Demonſtration out of
<hi>Pitiſcus, Gelibrand, Norwood,</hi> and others;
and then explained the manner of the work in
<hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Artificial</hi> Numbers both, and ſo
conclude the firſt Part of our <hi>Inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the ſecond Part we have made our
application of all the former unto <hi>Aſtronomie</hi>
firſt, and then to <hi>Dialling</hi> and <hi>Navigation.</hi>
In our application to <hi>Aſtronomie,</hi> we have
furniſhed you with a Table of the <hi>Suns Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
whereby to calculate his <hi>place</hi> in the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac</hi>
in <hi>Decimal numbers,</hi> and without which
moſt of the other <hi>Problemes</hi> would be found
(if not uſeleſs) yet very intricate and obſcure,
that being, for the moſt part, one of the three
terms ſuppoſed to be given in <hi>Aſtronomical
computations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Dialling,</hi> you have the
<hi>Sphears projection,</hi> according to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:60119:4"/>
of <hi>Wels,</hi> in his <hi>Art of Shadows,</hi> and how
to draw the houre-lines of all the ſeverall <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi>
which he hath contrived from thence, we
have briefly ſhewed; and in the finding of all
the arches in theſe Caſes neceſſary, we have
kept our ſelves to our own <hi>CANON,</hi>
which doth exhibit the degrees of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant</hi>
in <hi>Centecimal parts</hi> or <hi>minutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Navigation,</hi> you have
firſt the diviſion of the <hi>Sea-mans Compaſſe,</hi>
next the deſcription and making of the <hi>Sea-Chart,</hi>

thereunto a <hi>Table</hi> of <hi>meridionall
parts,</hi> and other <hi>Tables</hi> uſefull as well in
<hi>Dialling</hi> as in <hi>Navigation,</hi> and all theſe in
<hi>Decimall numbers,</hi> it being indeed our aim
(as much as in us lieth) not only to promote
theſe ſtudies by this our <hi>Compendium</hi> of the
firſt rudiments of <hi>Mathematical learning,</hi> as
in relation to the matter therein to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

<pb facs="tcp:60119:4"/>
then that which is performed by <hi>Decimal
numbers;</hi> fully to explicate the manner and
worth whereof were matter enough for a whole
<hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and therefore not to be expected in a
ſhort <hi>Epiſtle:</hi> It would indeed be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to intermeddle any further with it
here, then in our <hi>Inſtitution</hi> it ſelfe is already
explained, in which thou maiſt perceive <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Subtraction</hi> of <hi>Degrees, Minutes,</hi>

two principall kindes, <hi>Number</hi>
and <hi>Magnitude</hi>; and each of
theſe hath his proper Science.
The Science of <hi>Number</hi> is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,</hi>
and the Science of <hi>Magnitude</hi>
is commonly called <hi>Geometry,</hi> but may more
properly be termed <hi>Megethelogia,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
all Magnitudes whatſoever,
whereas <hi>Geometry,</hi> by the very Etymologie
of the word, doth ſeeme to confine this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Land-meaſuring only.</p>
                     <p>Of this <hi>Megethelogia Geometry,</hi> or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60119:6"/>
of Magnitudes, we will ſet down ſuch
grounds and principles as are neceſſary to
be known, for the better underſtanding of
that which follows, preſuming that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hereof hath already gotten ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
knowledge in <hi>Arithmetick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning then this Science of <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
two things are to be conſidered: Firſt,
the ſeverall heads to which all <hi>Magnitudes</hi>
may be referred: And then ſecondly, the
terms and limits of thoſe <hi>Magnitudes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All <hi>Magnitudes</hi> are either <hi>Lines, Plains,</hi>
or <hi>Solids,</hi> and do participate of Length,
Breadth, or Thickneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A <hi>Line</hi> is a ſuppoſed length, or a thing
extending it ſelf in length, without breadth
or thickneſs, whether it be a right line or a
crooked; and may be divided into parts in
reſpect of his length, but admitteth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diviſion: as the line AB.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p n="2">2. The ends or limits of a line are points,
as having his beginning from a point, and
ending in a point, and therefore a <hi>Point</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60119:6"/>
hath neither part nor quantity, it is only
the term or end of quantity, as the points
A and B are the ends of the aforeſaid line
AB, and no parts thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A <hi>Plain</hi> or <hi>Superficies</hi> is the ſecond kind
of magnitude, to which belongeth two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions,
length, and breadth, but not
thickneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As the ends, limits or bounds of a line
are points confining the line, ſo are lines
the limits, bounds and ends incloſing a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies;
as in the figure you may ſee the
plain or Superficies here incloſed with four
lines, which are the extreams or limits
thereof.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p n="5">5. A <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Solid</hi> is the third kinde of
magnitude, and hath three dimenſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60119:7"/>
to it, length, breadth, and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And as a point is the limit or term of
a line, and a line the limit or term of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,
ſo likewiſe a Superficies is the end
or limit of a Body or Solid, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the eye the ſhape or figure thereof.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. A <hi>Figure</hi> is that which is contained
under one or many limits, Under one
bound or limit is comprehended a Circle,
and all other figures under many.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A <hi>Circle</hi> is a plain figure contained
under one round line, which is called a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
as in the Figure following, the
Ring CBDE is called the circumference
of that Circle.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Center</hi> of a Circle is that point
which is in the midſt thereof, from which
point, all right lines drawn to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
are equal the one to the other; as
in the following figure, the lines AB, AC,
AD, and AE, are equal.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Diameter</hi> of a Circle, is a right
line drawn through the center thereof, and
ending at the circumference on either ſide,
dividing the Circle into two equal parts,
as the lines CAD and BAE, are either
of them the diameter of the Circle BCDE,
becauſe that either of them doth paſſe
through the center A, and divideth the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60119:7"/>
whole Circle into two equal parts.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of a Circle is half
the Diameter, and is contained betwixt the
center and one ſide of the Circle; as the
lines AB, AC, AD, and AE, are either
of them the Semidiameters of the Circle
CBDE.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. A <hi>Semicircle</hi> is the one halfe of a
Circle drawn upon his Diameter, and is
contained by the half circumference and
the Diameter; as the Semicircle CBD is
halfe the Circle CBDE, and contained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Diameter CAD.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p n="12">
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60119:8"/>
12. A <hi>Quadrant</hi> is the fourth part of a
Circle, and is contained betwixt the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter
of the Circle, and a line drawn
perpendicular unto the Diameter of the
ſame Circle, from the center thereof, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Semicircle into two equal parts,
of the which parts the one is the Quadrant
or fourth part of the ſame Circle. Thus, the
Diameter of the Circle BDEC is the line
CAD, dividing the Circle into two equal
parts, then from the center A raiſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
AB, dividing the Semicircle
likewiſe into two equal parts, ſo is ABD,
or ABC, the Quadrant or fourth part of
the Circle.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. A <hi>Segment</hi> or portion of a Circle is a
figure contained under a right line and a
part of the circumference of a Circle, either
greater or leſſer than the Semicircle; as in
the former figure, FBGH is a ſegment or
part of the Circle CBDE, contained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the right line FHG leſſe than the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
CAD.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. By the application of ſeveral lines

made Parallels, Angles, and many ſided
Figures.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. A <hi>Parallel</hi> line is a line drawn by the
ſide of another line, in ſuch ſort that they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60119:8"/>
may be equidiſtant in all places, and of
ſuch there are two ſorts, the right lined pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
and the circular parallel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Right lined Parallels</hi> are two right lines
equidiſtant in all places one from the other,
which being drawn to an infinite length
would never meet or concur; as may be ſeen
by theſe two lines, AB and CD.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>A <hi>Circular Parallel</hi> is a Circle drawn
within or without another Circle, upon the
ſame center, as you may plainly ſee by the
two Circles BCDE, and FGHI, theſe
Circles are both of them drawn upon the
ſame center A, and therefore are parallel
one to the other.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. An <hi>Angle</hi> is the meeting of two lines
in any ſort, ſo as they both make not one
line; as the two lines AB and AC incline
the one to the other, and touch one another
in the point A, in which point is made the
angle BAC. And if the lines which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the angle be right lines, then it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a right lined angle; as the angle BAC.
A crooked lined angle is that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of crooked lines; as the angle DEF:
and a mixt angle is that which is contained
both of a right and crooked line; as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
GHI: where note that an angle is (for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60119:9"/>
the moſt part) deſcribed by three letters, of
which the ſecond or middle letter repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the angular point; as in the angle BAC,
A repreſenteth the angular point.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p n="17">17. All <hi>Angles</hi> are either Right, Acute,
or Obtuſe.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. When a right line ſtandeth upon a
right line, making the angles on either ſide
equal, either of thoſe angles is a right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
and the right line which ſtandeth erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is a perpendicular line to that upon
which it ſtandeth. As the line AB (in the
following figure) falling upon the line
CBD perpendicularly, doth make the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
on both ſides equal, that is, the angle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60119:10"/>
ABC is equal to the angle ABD, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thoſe angles is therefore a right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p n="19">19. An acute angle is that which is leſſe
than a right angle; as the angle ABE is an
acute angle, becauſe it is leſs than the right
angle ABD, in the former figure.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. An <hi>Obtuſe Angle</hi> is that which is
greater than a right angle; CBE in the
former figure is greater than the angle ABC
by the angle ABE, and therefore it is an
obtuſe angle.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. The meaſure of every angle is the
arch of a Circle deſcribed on the angular
point, as in the following figure, the arch
CD is the meaſure of the right angle CED.
The arch BC is the meaſure of the acute
angle BEC. And the arch BCD is the
meaſure of the obtuſe angle BED. But of
their meaſure there can be no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
unleſſe the quantity of thoſe arches

                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60119:10"/>

                     </p>
                     <p n="22">22. Every Circle therefore is ſuppoſed
to be divided into 360 equall parts, called
Degrees, and every Degree into 60 Minutes,
every Minute into 60 Seconds, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
This diviſion of the Circle into 360
parts we ſhall retain, but every Degree we
will ſuppoſe to be divided into 100 parts or
Minutes, &amp; every Minute into 100 Seconds:
and thus all Calculations will be much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier,
and no leſſe certain.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. A <hi>Semicircle</hi> is the halfe of a whole
circle containing 180 degrees. A Quadrant
or fourth part of a circle is 90 degrees.
And thus the meaſure of the right angle CED
is the arch CD 90 degrees. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the acute angle BEC is the arch
BC 30 degrees. And the meaſure of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe
angle BED is the arch BD 120 degrees.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. The complement of an angle to a
Quadrant is ſo much as the angle wanteth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60119:11"/>
of 90 degrees, as the complement of the
angle AEB 60 degrees is the angle BEC
30 degrees; for 30 and 60 do make a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant

                     <p n="25">25. The complement of an angle to a

As if in the circle ABC the circumference
BC be 120 degrees, then the angle BAC
which is oppoſite to that circumference ſhall
be 60 degrees. The reaſon is, becauſe the
whole circle ABC is 360 degrees, and the
three angles of a plain triangle cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
180 degrees, or two right angles, by the
laſt aforegoing, therefore, as every arch is
the one third of 360, ſo every angle oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to that arch is the one third of 180, that
is 60 degrees.</p>

be drawn the diameter BED, and from

ABE and BAE are equall, becauſe
their Radii AE and EB are equall, and
alſo the angle AED is equal to the angles
ABE and BAE added together, for if you

FED ſhall be equal to the angle ABE
by the 9<hi>th.</hi> hereof; and by the like reaſon
the angle AEF is alſo equal to the angle
BAE. and therefore the angle AED is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

of Radius, that is, I adde 30 ciphers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and for the better proceeding in the

inlarged by multiplication into little cubes,
ſetting a point between every third figure
or cipher, beginning with the laſt firſt, and
then the ſubtenſe given will ſtand thus:
517.638.090.205.040.000.000.000.000.000
000.000.000.000.000. And ſo many points
as in this manner are interpoſed, of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

too many figures to be placed in ſo narrow

as will be neceſſary for our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
as namely, the 15 firſt figures, which
being ordered, according to the rules of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimal

cubes, beginning with the firſt figure,
but then you muſt conſider whether the

you muſt ſet your point after or over

place as many ciphers before the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60119:42"/>
of a circle, the which, as hath been ſaid
doth conſiſt of 16, and the ſubtenſe given

diſtinguiſh that cipher from the ſubtenſe

done, I place my diviſor thrice Radius

ſuppoſing ciphers to be thereunto annexed)
as in common diviſion under the firſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the ſubtenſe given, that is, as we
have now ordered it under the cipher, and
ask how often 3 in nought, which being
not once, I put a cipher in the margine, and
move my diviſor a place forwarder, ſetting
it under 5, and ask how often 3 in 5, which
being but once, I place one in the quotient,
and the triple thereof being 3, I place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
3 my diviſor, and the cube of the figure
placed in the quotient, which in this caſe is
the ſame with the quotient it ſelf, I ſet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

there doth remain 299, which is my diviſor

being but once, as before, the former work
muſt ſtand, &amp; this diviſor corrected muſt be

218, I draw down 638, the figures of the next

I ask, how often 3 in 21, which being 7
times, I put 7 in the quotient, and under
the firſt figure of this ſecond cube, that is,
under 6 I ſet the triple ſquare of the firſt
figure in the quotient, that is, 3, for the
quotient being but one, the ſquare is no
more, and the triple thereof is 3; under
the ſecond figure of this ſecond cube I ſet
the triple quotient, the which in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

do make 33, which being ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

ſet the triple of the figure laſt placed in the

                     <p>In the annexed Diagram, twice ET more
CB is equall to OE, becauſe OE is the

and by letting fall the perpendicular CT,
the right line OT doth anſwer to three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
arches, AO, AB, and BC; and
therefore ET doth anſwer to the other two:
now if you deduct the right line CB from
the right line OT, the remainer muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to ET, and ſo it followes, that 2 ET
+ CB = OE. And the triangles OBM
and OCT are equiangled, becauſe of their

                     <p>Let the ſubtenſe of 10 degrees be given,

leſſe then the Rad. by one place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60119:49"/>
I have ſet one cipher before, and have
diſtinguiſhed it from the ſubtenſe given by
a point ſet between, the which is all one, as
if it had been put over the head thereof:
next you muſt diſtinguiſh the ſubtenſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into little cubes, &amp; into quadratocubes,
which may be conveniently done thus;
having found the place of the firſt point,
which is alwayes the place of the Radius,
the ſubtenſe given muſt be diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
little cubes, by putting a point under e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
third figure, as in the triſection of an
angle: thus in this example the firſt cubick
point will fall under the figure 4, and the
ſubtenſe given muſt be diſtinguiſhed into
quadrato cubes, by ſetting a point over the
head, or elſe between every fift figure from
the place of the Radius: thus in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
the firſt quadrato cubick point muſt
be ſet over the head, or after the figure of
1, the ſecond after 4, as here you ſee.</p>
                     <p>After this preparation made, you muſt
place your two diviſors, 5 roots and 5 cubes
in this manner, the firſt as in ordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
under the firſt figure of the ſubtenſe
given, the other 5 under the firſt cubick
point, and they will ſtand as in the work
you ſee; then ask how often 5 in one,
which being not once, I put a cipher in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60119:50"/>
quotient, and remove my firſt diviſor a
place forwarder, as in ordinary diviſion,
but the other 5 I remove to the next cubick
point, then, as before, I ask how often
5 in 17, which being 3 times, I ſet 3 in the
quotient, and of this quotient I ſeek the
quadrato cube, and finde it to be 243, the
laſt figure whereof, namely, 3, I ſet under
the laſt figure of the ſecond quadrato cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick
point (becauſe there are but 3 figures
between my diviſor 5 and the firſt cubick
point, whereas there muſt be alwayes four
at the leaſt) then I multiply the figure 3
placed in the quotient by my diviſor 5, and
the product thereof is 15, the firſt figure
whereof I place under my ſaid diviſor 5, to
which having annexed ciphers, or at leaſt
ſuppoſing them to be annexed, (as to the
triple root in the triſection) I draw the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drato
cube of the figure in the quotient,
and theſe 5 roots or 5 quotients into one
ſumme, the which is 1500000243, under
this ſumme I draw a line, ſo have we five
roots more one quadrato cube, from which
I muſt ſubtract 5 cubes, I therefore ſeek the
cube of 3, the figure placed in the quotient,
and finde it to be 27, which multiplied by
5, the product will be 135, the laſt figure of
theſe five cubes, <hi>viz.</hi> 5, I ſet under my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60119:50"/>
5 or cubick diviſor, and ſubſtracting
theſe 5 cubes from the 5 roots more one

and ſo have I wrought once.</p>
                     <p>To this remainer of the two firſt quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
cubes, I draw down 95316, the figures of
the next quadrato cube, and ſetting my firſt
diviſor a place forwarder, I ask how often 5
in 24, which being four times, I ſet 4 in the
quotient, not knowing yet whether this be
the true quotient or not, but with this I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to correct my diviſor, and firſt I ſeek
the quadrato quadrat of 3, the firſt quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and finde it to be 81, this multiplied
by 5, will make 405, this product I ſet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my diviſor, and 5 the laſt figure thereof
I ſet under 9, the firſt figure of the 3 qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drato
quadrate; next I ſeek the cube of 3,
&amp; finde it to be 27, which being multiplied
by 10, the product will be 270, and this I
ſet a place forwarder under the former
product: thirdly, I ſeek the ſquare of 3
which is 9, and this multiplied by 10 is 90,
which I ſet a place forwarder under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
product 270. Laſtly, I multiply 3,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60119:51"/>
the figure in the quotient by 5 my diviſor,
this product which is 15, I ſet a place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
under 90, the third product, and
now theſe 4 products together with my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſor
and ciphers thereunto annexed, being
gathered into one ſumme, will be 500000|432915,
under which I draw a line. And
thrice the ſquare of 3, multiplied by 5,
which is 135, I ſet under this ſumme, the
laſt figure thereof 5, under the firſt figure
of the third cubick point, that is, under 4,
and the triple of 3 multiplied by 5, which
is 45, I ſet under the former ſumme 135, a
place forwarder, and my cubick diviſor 5
under the laſt ſumme a place forwarder,
that is, under the third cubick point, theſe
drawn into one ſumme will be 13955, and
being ſubſtracted from the former ſumme
500000432915, the remainer 498.60493. + 2915
is my diviſor corrected, and yet I
know not whether I have a true quotient or
not; under this remainer therefore I
draw a line, and work with 4, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to be the true quotient in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
and that the manner of the work
may be the more perſpicuous, (as in the

quadratick, and 5 my ſecond diviſor,
I note with <hi>cc,</hi> becauſe the diviſor it ſelf is
cubick: theſe things premiſed, I proceed
thus: Firſt, I multiply 405, which is 5 <hi>aaaa</hi>
or 5 times the quadrato quadrate of 3 by <hi>e,</hi>
that is, by 4, and the product thereof 1620,
I ſet under my diviſor corrected, ſo as the
laſt figure thereof may ſtand under the firſt
figure of the third quadrato cubick num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and againſt this number I put in the
margine 5 <hi>aaaae,</hi> that is, five times the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drato
quadrate of 3 multiplied by 4: next
270, ten times the cube of 3, by 16 the
ſquare of 4, and this product 4320, I ſet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the former a place forwarder, and 90,
which is 10 times the ſquare of 3, I multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
by 64, the cube of 4, &amp; this product 5760
I ſet under the laſt a place forwarder then
that, and 15, which is 5 times 3, I multiply
by 256, the quadrato quadrate of 4, &amp; the
product thereof 3840, I ſet under the third
product a place forwarder, and 1024,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60119:52"/>
the quadrato cube of four under that:
laſtly, I multiply four, the laſt figure placed
in the quotient by 5 my diviſor, and the
laſt figure of this product I ſet under 5 my
diviſor, and ſuppoſing ciphers to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
annexed, I collect theſe ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
into one ſumme, and their aggreagate
20000021135424, is five roots more one
quadrato quadrate, under which I draw a
line, and ſeek the five cubes to be ſubſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I multiply 135 (which is thrice the

in the quotient, and the product there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
540 I ſet under the laſt ſumme, ſo as the
laſt figure thereof may be under the firſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the third cube; next I multiply 45
that is, five times the triple of three, by 16
the ſquare of four, and this product 720 I
ſet under the former a place forwarder,
and under that 320, which is five times the
cube of 4, a place forwarder too, theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
drawn into one ſumme do make
61520, the five cubes to the ſubſtracted
from the five roots more one quadrato qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate
before found, which being done, the
remainer will be 19938501135424, and
this remainer being ſubſtracted from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60119:52"/>
figures of the ſubtenſe given over the head
thereof, the remainer will be 450.79600.
59892, and becauſe ſuch a ſubſtraction
may be conveniently made, I conclude,
that I have found the true quotient, and ſo
have I wrought twice.</p>
                     <p>The work following muſt be done in all
things like as this ſecond, onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that as in the triſection of an angle,
both the figures in the quotient are termed

found are <hi>a</hi> in the fourth work; and ſo
forward till your diviſion be finiſhed.

the product wil be 50000000000000, which

                           <hi>The Declaration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let the two arches making a Quadrant
be CD and BD, whoſe tangents are CG
and BP, and let BS be an arch made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to CD; and then SD will be the
arch of the difference of the two given
arches CD or BS, and BD. And alſo let
the tangent BT be equal to the tangent
CG, and then the right line TP will be
the difference of the tangents given CG
or BT, and BP. Laſtly, let the arches
BL and BO (whoſe tangents are BK and
BM) be made equal to the arch SD; I
ſay, the right line TP being the difference
of the two given tangents, CG and BP is
double to the right line BK, being the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of the difference of the two given
arches; or which is all one, I ſay, that
the right line TP is equal to the right
line MK.</p>

                           <hi>Demonſtration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you take equall things from equall,
the remainer ſhall be equall: but the right

                           </gap>P and MT are equal; therefore if
you take the right line KT from both of
them, the right lines TP and MK remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhall be equal; becauſe thoſe things
that are equal to one and the ſame things
are alſo equal to one another; but the
right lines KP and MT are equal to the
<figure/>
ſame right line KA, and therefore they
are equall to one another. The right line
KP is equal to the right line KA, becauſe
he angles KAP and KPA are equal. And
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60119:60"/>
that the angles KAP and KPA are equal
to one another, thus appeareth; for that
they are equal to one and the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
DAC. The angle KPA is equal
to the angle DAC, becauſe the right
line PA is drawn through the parallel
lines MP and AC: and the angle
KAP is equal to the angle DAC, by
the conſtruction, for the arch BL is to
be made equal to the arch SD, being the
difference of the arches DC and BD.
Therefore the angle BAL or BAK is the
difference betwixt the angles BAP and
DAC. Seeing therefore that the angles
KAP and KPA are equal to the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
DAC; it followeth neceſſarily, that
they are equal to one another.</p>
                        <p>Then that the right line MT is equall to
the right line KA is thus proved; the right
line MA is equall to the right line KA, by
the work, but the right line MT is equal
to the right line MA, and therefore it is
alſo equall to the right line KA.</p>
                        <p>That the right line MT is equal to the
right line MA doth thus appear: for that
the angles MAT and MTA are equall;
and therefore the ſides oppoſite unto them
are equal, for equall ſides ſubtend equall
angles: and the angles MTA and MAT
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60119:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are equal, becauſe the angle MTA is equal
to the angle TAC, by the like reaſon,
that the angle KPA is equal to the angle
DAC; and the angle MAT is equall to
the angle TAC, by the propoſition: for
the arches CS and SO are put to be equal:
therefore it followes, that they are alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
one to another. Generally therefore,
the difference of the tangents of two arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
making a Quadrant, is double to the
tangent of the difference of thoſe arches,
which was to be demonſtrated. And by
conſequence, the tangents of two arches
being given, making a Quadrant, the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of the difference of thoſe arches is
alſo given. And contrarily, the tangent of
the difference of thoſe two arches being
given, together with the tangent of one
of the arches; the tangent of the other

4. §. Theſe things being thus cleared,
it is manifeſt, that a number of this kinde
being given, the Logarithme thereof may
be found by the Rule of three direct. For
as the ſignificant figures of the numerator
of any one of the numbers (ſigned in the
firſt column of the laſt Table by the letters
G, H, or L) are to his reſpective Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme:
ſo are the ſignificant figure of the
numerator of the number given, to the
Logarithme of the ſame number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example.</hi> The number 1.00000001021301
being given, I demand the Logarithme
thereof: I ſay then,</p>
                     <p>As 6862238, the ſignificant figures of the
numerator of the number G, are to 2980|2322,
the logarithme of the ſame number
G: ſo are 1021301, the ſignificant figures
of the numerator of the number given, to
4357281, the Logarithme ſought; before
which if you prefix 9 ciphers, to the intent
it may have as many places as the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme
in the laſt premiſed Table, (<hi>viz.</hi> 16)
the true and entire Logarithme of 1.00000|001021301,
the number given is 0.000000|004357281,
as before. And to every Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garithme
thus found, you muſt prefix as
many ciphers as will make the ſaid Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme
to have as many places as the other
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60119:70"/>
Logarithmes in the ſame table: for though
you make your Table of Logarithmes to
conſiſt of as many places as you pleaſe,
yet when you are once reſolved of how
many places the Logarithmes of your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſhall conſiſt, you muſt not alter your
firſt reſolution, as to make the Logarithme
of 2 to conſiſt of ſix places, and the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme
of 16 to have ſeven, but if the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
figures of the numerator of the
Logarithme of 2 have not ſo many places
as the ſignificant figures of the Logarithme
of 16, you muſt prefix a cipher or ciphers
to make them equal; becauſe (as hath
been ſaid, the Logarithmes of this kinde
ought all to conſiſt of equal places in the
ſame Table.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. §. Now then to finde the Logarithme
of any number whatſoever, you are firſt to
ſearch out ſo many continual means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the ſame number and 1, till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
mean that cometh neereſt 1 hath as
many ciphers placed before the ſignificant
figures of his numerator, as you intend the
Logarithmes of your Table ſhall conſiſt
of places; Again, this being done, you
are to finde the Logarithme of that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
mean: And laſtly, by often doubling
and redoubling of that Logarithme ſo
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60119:71"/>
found (according to the number of the
continual meanes produced) in concluſion
you ſhall fall upon the Logarithme of the
number given.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example.</hi> the number 2 being given, I
demand the Logarithme thereof to ſeven
places: Here firſt in imitation of that
which is before taught in the firſt rule of
this Chapter, I produce ſo many continual
meanes between 2 and 1, till that which
cometh neareſt 1 hath ſeven ciphers before
the ſignificant figures of the numerator,
which after three and twenty continued
extractions, I finde to be 1.00000008262958
This continual mean being thus found (by
the direction of the laſt rule aforegoing) I
finde the Logarithme thereof to be
0.000000035885571. for,
<list>
                           <item>As 6862238, is to 29802322:</item>
                           <item>So 8262958, is to 35885571.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Logarithme being doubled will
produce the Logarithme of the continual
mean next above 1.00000008262958, and
ſo by doubling ſucceſſively the Logarithme
of each continual mean one after another,
according to the number of the extractions
(<hi>viz.</hi> three and twenty times in all) at laſt
you ſhall happen upon the Logarithme
0.301029987975168, which is the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60119:71"/>
of 2 the number propounded: The
whole frame of the work is plainly ſet
down in the table following; for in the
firſt column thereof you have 23 continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
meanes betwixt 2 and 1, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
column their reſpective Logarithmes,
found by a continual doubling and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of 0.000000035885571, the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme
of the laſt continual mean in the

The reaſon is manifeſt, for whereas we
ſhould have abated 8 out of 11, we did not
onely not abate it, but added moreover his
complement to 10, which is 2, wherefore
the total is more then if ſhould be by 8 &amp; 2,
that is by 10; wherefore abating 10 from
it, we have the Logarithme deſired; which
rule, although it be generall, yet we ſhall
ſeldome have occaſion to uſe any other
complements, then ſuch as are the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Logarithmes given either to

                        </gap> comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
arithmetical of any Logarithme to
either of theſe numbers, is that which makes
the Logarithme given equal to either of
them. Thus the complement arithmetical
of the Logarithme of 2 <hi>viz.</hi> 0301030, is
9698970, becauſe theſe two numbers added
together, do make 10.000000, and thus the
complement thereof to 20.000000is 1969|8970:
if therefore 0301030 be ſubſtracted
from 10.000000, the remainer is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
arithmetical.</p>
                     <p>But to finde it readily, you may inſtead
of ſubſtracting the Logarithme given from
10.000000, write the complement of every
figure thereof unto 9, beginning with the
firſt figure toward the left hand, and ſo on,
till you come to the laſt figure towards the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60119:74"/>
right hand, and thereof ſet down the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
unto 10. Thus for the complement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical
of the aforeſaid Logarithme,
0301030; I write for 0, 9: for 3, 6: for
0, 9: for 1, 8: for 0, 9: for 3 again I
ſhould write 6: but becauſe the laſt place
of the Logarithme is a cipher, and that I
muſt write the complement thereof to 10,
inſtead of 6 I write 7, and for 0, 0: and ſo
have I this number, 9698970, which is the
complement arithmetical of 0301030, as
before.</p>

                     <p>In the rank produced in the laſt rule
0.301030, (the Logarithme of 2 the root)
being doubled, or multiplied by 2, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60119:77"/>
0.602060, the Logarithme of 4, the
ſquare or ſecond power, and the ſame Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garithme
of 0.301030, being trebled or
multiplied by 3, produceth 0.903090, the
Logarithme of 8, the cube or third power,
and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The truth of theſe two laſt rules may thus
be proved. In arithmeticall proportion,
when the firſt term is the common diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the terms, the laſt term being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by the number of the terms, the
quotient will give you the firſt term of the
rank: again, in this caſe, the firſt term
multiplied by the number of the termes
produceth the laſt term. So this rank 3, 6, 9,
12, 15, 18, 21 being propounded, wherein
three is both the firſt term and alſo the
common difference of the terms: I ſay,
21, the laſt term being divided by 7, the
number of the termes, the quotient is 3,
the firſt term. Contrariwiſe, 3 the firſt term
multiplied by 7, produceth 21, the laſt term;
and by the like reaſon, 0.301030 being the
firſt term, and alſo the common difference
of the termes, that is, of the Logarithmes
of 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64, the Logarithme
of 2 the firſt term, being multiplied by 6,
the number of the terms, produceth the
Logarithme of 64, the laſt term, and the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60119:77"/>
garithme of 64, the laſt term, being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by 6, leaveth in the quotient the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme
of 2 the root.</p>
                     <p>Hence it alſo followes, that if you adde
the Logarithme of 2, the common diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the termes, to the Logarithme of
any term, their aggregate ſhall be the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garithme
of the next term. Thus if I adde
0.301030, the Logarithme of 2 the root or
firſt term, to 0.903090, the Logarithme of
8, the third term, their aggregate is 1.204|120,
the Logarithme of 16, the fourth term;
and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. §. Thus having ſhewed the conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Logarithmetical Tables, the
converting of the Table of natural Sines,
Tangents, and Secants into artificiall can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be difficult, the artificiall Sines and

confine his artificiall to the Radius of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whoſe Characteriſtick is 10, but the
Characteriſtick of the reſt of the Sines till
you come to the ſine of 5 degrees and 73
centeſmes is 9, and from thence to 57
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60119:78"/>

from thence 7, till you come to 5 cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſmes,

number of the places in the naturall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
do therefore exceed the Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
in the artificiall, that ſo the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

                     <p n="16">16. §. In the Canon herewith printed,
the Characteriſtick in the artificiall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
doth exceed the number of places in
the naturall, which is not done ſo much out
of neceſſity as conveniency, for the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
numbers in this Canon might in all
reſpects have been made anſwerable to the
natural, and ſo the Characteriſtick of the
Radius, or whole Sine would have been
ſeven, the Characterick of the firſt minute
3, but thus the ſubduction of the Radius
would not have been ſo ready as now it is,
nor yet the Canon it ſelf altogether ſo
exact, and therefore as Maſter <hi>Briggs</hi>
confined the Radius of his artificiall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
to eleven places for conveniency ſake,
though he made the Logarithmes to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60119:78"/>
the Radius of ſixteen: ſo here for conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
and exactneſſe both, the ſame
Characterick is here continued, though the
naturall numbers do not require it, if any
think this a defect, I anſwer, that it could
not well be avoided here, but may be
ſupplied by Maſter <hi>Briggs</hi> his Canon, of
which this is an abbreviation: and yet
even here there is ſo ſmall a difference
between the Logarithmes of theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
numbers, and the Logarithmes in
the Canon, that any one may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the one to be nothing elſe but the
Logarithme of the other, if they do but
change the Characteriſtick.</p>
                     <q>And hence we may gather, that the
making of this Canon is not ſo

                        <p>THe meaſuring or reſolving of Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
is the finding out of the unknown
ſides or angles thereof by three things
known, whether angles, or ſides, or both;
and this by the help of that precious gemme
in Arithmetick, for the excellency thereof
called the Golden Rule, (which teacheth
of four numbers proportional one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
any three of them being given, to
finde out a fourth) and alſo of theſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>Of Triangles, as hath been ſaid, there
are two ſorts; plain and ſphericall. A tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60119:81"/>
upon a plain is right lined, upon the
Sphere circular. Right lined Triangles are
right angled or oblique.</p>
                        <p>A right angled, right-lined Triangle we
ſpeak of firſt, whoſe ſides then related to
a circle are inſcribed totally or partially.</p>
                        <p>Totally, if the ſide ſubtending the right
angle be made the Radius of a Circle, and
then all the ſides are called Sines, as in the
Triangle ABC.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Partially, if either of the ſides adjacent
to the right angle be made the Radius of a
circle, and then one ſide of the Triangle is
the Radius or whole Sine, the ſhorter of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60119:82"/>
the other two ſides is a Tangent, and the
longeſt a ſecant. Now according as the
right angled Triangle is ſuppoſed, whether
to be totally or but partially inſcribed in
a circle; ſo is the trouble of finding the
parts unknown more or leſſe, whether ſides
or angles; for if the triangle be ſuppoſed to
be totally inſcribed in a circle, we are in
the ſolution thereof confined to the Table
of Sines onely, becauſe all the ſides of ſuch
a triangle are ſines: but if the triangle be
ſuppoſed to be but partially inſcribed in
a circle, we are left at liberty to uſe the
Table of Sines, Tangents, or Secants, as
we ſhall finde to be moſt convenient for the
work.</p>
                        <p>In a right angled plain Triangle, either
all the angles with one ſide are given, and
the other two ſides are demanded, I ſay, all
the angles, becauſe one of the acute angles
being given, the other is given alſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the angles oppoſite to thoſe ſides.</p>
                        <p>As in the triangle ABC, the ſide AB is
in proportion to the ſide AC, as the ſine of
the angle at B is in proportion to the ſine
of the angle at c and ſo of the reſt.</p>

                        <p>The circle ADF being circumſcribed about
the Triangle ABC, the ſide AB is made
the chord or ſubtenſe of the angle ACB,
that is, of the arch AB, which is oppoſite
to the angle ACB. The ſide AC is made
the ſubtenſe of the angle ABC; and the
ſide BC is made the ſubtenſe of the angle
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60119:83"/>
BAC, and are the double meaſures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
by the 19 Theorem of the ſecond Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter:
therefore the ſide AB is in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the ſide AC, as the ſubtenſe of the
angle ACB is in proportion to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe
of the angle ABC, but half the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe
of the angle ACB is the ſine of the
angle ACB, and half the ſubtenſe of the
angle ABC is the ſine of the angle ABC;
now as the whole is to the whole; ſo is
the half, to the half. Therefore in all
plain Triangles, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Two ſides of a plain Triangle, with an
angle oppoſite to one of them being given,
the reaſon of the other angles is alſo given,
by this proportion.</p>
                        <p>If the ſide of a Triangle be required, put
the angle oppoſite to the given ſide in the

For the better underſtanding whereof
we will adde an example, and to diſtinguiſh
the ſides of the Triangle, we call the ſide
ſubtending the right angle, the Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſall,
and of the other two the one is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the perpendicular, and the other the
baſe, at pleaſure, but moſt commonly the
ſhorteſt is called the perpendicular,
and the longer the baſe. As in the
former figure, the ſide BC is the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothenuſal,
AC the baſe, and AB the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular.</p>
                        <p>Now then in the Triangle ABC, let
there be given the baſe AC 768 paces, and
the angle CBA 67 degrees, 40 minutes,
(then the angle ACB is alſo known, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the complement of the other) and let
there be required the perpendicular: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a ſide that is required, I put the
angle oppoſite to the given ſide in the firſt
place, and then the proportion is:</p>
                        <p>As the ſine of the angle at the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
is in proportion to the baſe: So is the
ſine of the angle at the baſe, to the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular.</p>
                        <p>Now if you work by the natural Sines,
you muſt multiply the ſecond term given,
by the third, and divide the product by the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60119:84"/>
firſt, and then the quotient is the fourth
term required, and the whole work will
ſtand thus:

as before.</p>
                        <p>Nor are we tied to this way of finding
the hypothenuſal, unleſſe we confine our
ſelves to the Tables of Sines onely; if we
would make uſe of the Tables of Tangents
or Secants, the hypothenuſal may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be found with more eaſe, but all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of a right angled plain triangle may be
alſo found ſeveral wayes, by the help of
this Axiome following.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond AXIOME.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In a plain right angled triangle, any of
the three ſides may be made the Radius of
a circle, and the other ſides will be as Sines,
Tangents, or Secants. And what proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſide put as Radius hath unto Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;
the ſame proportion hath the other
ſides unto the Sines, Tangents, or Secants
of the oppoſite angles by them repreſented.</p>
                        <p>If you make the hypothenuſal Radius,
the triangle will be totally inſcribed in the
circle, and conſequently the other two ſides
ſhall repreſent the ſines of their oppoſite
angles, that is, the baſe ſhall repreſent the
ſine of the angle at the perpendicular, and
the perpendicular ſhall repreſent the ſine
of the angle at the baſe, as in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Diagram.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="156" facs="tcp:60119:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If you make the baſe Radius, the trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
will be but partially inſcribed in the
circle, and the other two ſides ſhall be one
of them a tangent, and the other a ſecant.
Thus in the firſt Diagram of this Chapter,
the baſe BD is made the Radius of the
circle, the perpendicular D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> is the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of the angle at the baſe, and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> is the
ſecant of the ſame angle.</p>
                        <p>If you make the perpendicular Radius,
the triangle will be but partially inſcribed
in the circle, as before, and the other two
ſides will be alſo the one a tangent and the
other a ſecant. As in this example, the
perpendicular AB is made the Radius of
the circle, the baſe AC is the tangent of
the angle at the perpendicular, and the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothenuſal
BC is the ſecant of the ſame
angle.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:60119:86"/>
Hence it followes, that if you make AB
the Radius, the baſe and perpendicular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given, the angle at the perpendicular
may be found by this proportion.</p>
                        <p>As the perpendicular, is in proportion to
Radius: So is the baſe, to tang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nt of the
angle at the perpendicular; for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
being made the Radius of the
circle, it muſt of neceſſity bear the ſame
proportion unto Radius, as the hypothenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
doth, when that is made the Radius of
the circle: and if the perpendicular be the
Radius, the baſe muſt needs repreſent the
tangent of the angle at the perpendicular.</p>
                        <p>And the angle at the perpendicular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
thus found, the hypothenuſal may
be found by the firſt Axiome. For,</p>
                        <p>As the ſine of the angle at the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
is in proportion to his oppoſite ſide
the baſe; So is Radius, to his oppoſite ſide
the hypothenuſal: and thus you ſee that
the hypothenuſal may be found without the
trouble of ſquaring the ſides, and thence
extracting the ſquare root. And hence alſo
all the caſes of a right angled plain trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
may be reſolved ſeveral wayes: that is
to ſay,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In a plain right angled triangle: the
angles and one ſide being given, every of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60119:87"/>
the other ſides is given, by a threefold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
that is, as you ſhall put for the
Radius, either the ſide ſubtending the right
angle, or the greater or leſſer ſide including
the right angle.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Any of the two ſides being given, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the acute angles is given by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proportion, that is, as you ſhall put ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this or that ſide for the Radius: to
make this clear, we will firſt ſet down the
grounds or reaſons for varying of the
termes of proportion: and then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
themſelves in every caſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all the variations.</p>
                        <p>The reaſons for varying of the termes of
proportion are chiefly three.</p>
                        <p>The firſt reaſon is, becauſe the Radius
of a circle doth bear a threefold proportion
to a ſine, tangent, or ſecant; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe,
a ſine, tangent, or ſecant hath a
threefold proportion to Radius, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

                        <p>Hence it is evident, that Radius is a
mean proportional between the ſine of
an arch, and the ſecant complement
of the ſame arch; alſo between the
tangent of an arch, and the tangent
of the complement of the ſame arch.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond Reaſon.</hi>

                        <p>The ſines of ſeveral arches, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants

proportional, that is,</p>
                        <p>As the ſine of an arch or angle, is to the
ſine of another arch or angle: So is the
ſecant of the complement of that other, to
the co-ſecant of the former.</p>
                        <p>For by the foregoing Corollary, Radius
is the mean proportional between the ſine
of any arch and the co-ſecant of the ſame
arch.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, whatſoever ſine is multiplied
by the ſecant of the complement, is equall
to the ſquare of Radius; ſo that all rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
made of the ſines of arches and of
the ſecants of their complements are equal
one to another; but equall rectangles
have their ſides reciprocally pro portional,
by the tenth Theorem of the ſecond Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.

                        <p>The tangents of ſeverall arches, and
the tangents of their complements are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally
proportional, that is,</p>
                        <p>As the tangent of an arch or angle, is to
the tangent of another arch or angle, ſo is
the co-tangent of that other, to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangent
of the former.</p>
                        <p>For by the foregoing Corollary, Radius
is the mean proportionall between the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of every arch and the tangent of his
complement.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Rectangle made of any
tangent, and of the tangent of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
is equall to the ſquare of Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:
ſo that all rectangles made of the
tangents of arches, and of the tangents of
their complements are equall one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but equal rectangles, &amp;c. as before.</p>
                        <p>To theſe three reaſons a fourth may be
added. For in the rule of proportion;
wherein there are alwayes four termes,
three given, the fourth demanded: It is
all one, whether of the two middle terms is
put in the ſecond or third place.</p>
                        <p>For it is all one, whether I ſhall ſay;</p>

For the ſolution whereof we will lay down

now if you draw the lines BD and KG pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
unto AC, then ſhall the angle CBH
be equal to the two angles of the triangle
given ACB and CAB, becauſe the angle
CBA common to both is their complement
to a Semicircle, and DB being parallel to
CA, the angle DBH ſhall be equall to the
angle CAB, and the angle DBC equall
to the angle ACB, if therefore you let

the right ſines AC, DB, and KG are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
and CD, DG, and FH are equall,
and DF equal to GH, and the triangles
ACH and KGH are like, and therefore;
As AH is in proportion to HK: ſo is CH,

is in proportion to HK, their difference:
ſo is CE the tangent of the half ſumme of

be turned into angles, and the angles into

in each converſion.</p>
                     <p>It will be neceſſary to demonſtrate this,
which is of ſo frequent uſe in <hi>Trigonometry.</hi>
In the annexed Diagram let ABC be a
ſphericall triangle, obtuſe angled at B, let
DE be the meaſure of the angle at A. Let
FG be the meaſure of the acute angle at B,
(which is the complement of the obtuſe
angle B, being the greateſt angle in the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
triangle) and let HI be the meaſure
of the angle at C, KL is equal to the arch
DE, becauſe KD and LE are Quadrants,
and their common complement is LD. LM
is equall to the arch FG, becauſe LG and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60119:97"/>
FM are Quadrants, and their common
complement is LF. KM is equal to the
arch HI, becauſe KI and MH are Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants,
and their common complement is
KH. Therefore the ſides of the triangle
KLM are equal to the angles of the trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
ABC, taking for the greateſt angle
ABC, the complement thereof FBG.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>And by the like reaſon it may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
that the ſides of the triangle ABC
are equal to the angles of the triangle
KLM. For the ſide AC is equall to the
arch DI, being the meaſure of the angle
DKI, which is the complement of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe
angle MKL. The ſide AB is equall to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60119:98"/>
the arch OP, being the meaſure of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
MLK. And laſtly, the ſide BC is equal
to the arch FH, being the meaſure of the
angle LMK, for AD and CI are Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants:
ſo are AP and OB, BF and CH.
And CD, AO, and CF are the common
complements of two of thoſe arches.
Therefore the ſides of a ſpherical triangle
may be changed into angles, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
into ſides, which was to be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The three ſides of any ſpherical tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
are leſſe then two Semicircles.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The three angles of a ſpherical tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
are greater then two right angles,
and therefore two angles being known, the
third is not known by conſequence, as in
plain triangles.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If a ſpherical triangle have one or
more right angles, it is called a right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
ſpherical triangle.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If a ſpherical triangle have one or
more of his ſides quadrants, it is called a
quadrantal triangle.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If it have neither right angle, nor
any ſide a quadrant, it is called an oblique
ſpherical triangle.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Two oblique angles of a ſpherical
triangle are either of them of the ſame

                     <p n="12">12. If any angle of a triangle be neerer
to a quadrant then his oppoſite ſide: two
ſides of that triangle ſhall be of one kinde,
and the third leſſe then a quadrant.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. But if any ſide of a triangle be near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to a quadrant then his oppoſite angle,
two angles of that triangle ſhall be of one
kinde, and the third greater then a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. If a ſpherical triangle be both right
angled and quadrantal, the ſides thereof
are equall to the oppoſite angles.</p>
                     <p>For if it have three right angles, the
three ſides are quadrants, if it have two
right angles, the two ſides ſubtending them
are quadrants; if it have one right angle,
and one ſide a quadrant, it hath two right
angles and two quadrantal ſides, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the third Propoſition. But if two
ſides be quadrants, the third meaſureth
their contained angle, by the fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
Therefore for the ſolution of
theſe kindes of triangles, there needs no
further rule: But for the ſolution of right
angled, quadrantall, and oblique ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
triangles there are other affections
proper to them, which are neceſſary to be

                     <p>For the better Demonſtration hereof, it
is firſt to be underſtood, that a right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
Spherical Triangle hath five parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the right angle. As the triangle ABD
in the former Diagram, right angled at B,
hath firſt, the ſide AB: ſecondly, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
at A: thirdly, the hypothenuſal AD:
fourthly, the angle ADB: fifthly, the ſide
DB. Three of theſe parts which are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60119:101"/>
from the right angle, we mark or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by their complements to a quadrant. As
the angle BAD we account as the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the ſame angle. For AD we write
<hi>comp.</hi> AD, and for ADB we write <hi>compl.</hi>
ADB. But the two ſides DB and AB be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
next to the right angle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>
are not noted by
their complements. Of theſe five parts,
two are alwayes given to finde a third, and
of theſe three one is in the middle, and the
other two are extreams either adjacent to
that middle one, or oppoſite to it. If the
parts given and required are all conjoyned
together, the middle is the middle part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct,
and the extreams the extream parts
conjunct. If again any of the parts given
or required be diſ-joyned, that which ſtands
by it ſelf is the middle part diſ-joyned,
and the extreames are extream parts diſ-joyned.
Thus, if there were given in the
triangle ABD, the ſide AB, the angle at
A, to finde the hypothenuſal AD, there the
angle at A is in the middle, and the ſides
AD and AB are adjacent to it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the middle part is called the middle
conjunct, and the extreames are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames
conjunct; but if there were given
the ſide AB, the hypothenuſal AD, to finde
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60119:102"/>
the angle at D, here AB is the middle part
diſ-junct, becauſe it is diſ-joyned from the
ſide AD by the angle at A, and from the
angle at D by the ſide DB, for the right
angle is not reckoned among the circular
parts, and here the extreams are extreams
diſ-junct.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things premiſed, we come now to
demonſtrate the propoſition it ſelf, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of two parts: firſt, we will prove, that
the ſine of the middle part and Radius are

the ſine of AB added to the ſine of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle

the propoſition doth chance to concur with
a complement in the circular parts, you
muſt take the ſine it ſelf, or the tangent it
ſelf, becauſe the co-ſine of the co-ſine is
the ſine, and the co-tangent of the co-tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
is the tangent.</p>
                     <p>As in the following triangle ABC, let
there be given the baſe AB, and the angle
at C, to finde the hypothenuſal BC. Here
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60119:109"/>
AB is the middle part, BC and C are the
oppoſite extreams, or the extreams diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.
Now becauſe the extream BC is
ſought, therefore I muſt put the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,
that is, the angle at C, in the firſt
place; and becauſe that angle, as alſo the
ſide ſought are noted by their complements,
therefore I muſt not ſay: As the co-ſine of
the angle at C, is to Radius: ſo is the ſine
of the baſe AB, to the co-ſine of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothenuſal
BC: but thus;</p>
                     <p>As the ſine of the angle at the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ACB, is to Radius; ſo is the ſine of
the baſe AB, to the ſine of the hypothenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
BC. The like is to be underſtood of the
reſt.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning right angled ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical

needs not much be ſaid, becauſe the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

                     <p>As let ABC be a triangle, right angled
at A, and let one of the ſides thereof;
namely, AC be extended, till it become a
quadrant, that is to D; then draw an arch
from D to B; then is DBC a quadrantal
triangle, to which there is a right angled

                        <p>Other eight caſes muſt be reſolved by the
aid of two Analogies at the leaſt, and that
by reducing the triangle propoſed to two
right angled triangles, by a perpendicular
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60119:111"/>
let fall from one of the angles to his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
ſide, which perpendicular falls ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
within, ſometimes without the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle.</p>
                        <p>If the perpendicular be let fall from an
obtuſe angle, it falleth within, but if it fall
from an acute angle, it falls without the
triangle: however it falleth, it muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
oppoſite to a known angle.</p>
                        <p>For your better direction, in letting fall
the perpendicular take this generall rule.</p>
                        <p>From the end of a ſide given, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
to an angle given, let fall the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular.</p>
                        <p>As in the triangle, ABC, if there were
given the ſide AB, and the angle at A: by
this rule the perpendicular muſt fall from
B upon the ſide AC; but if there were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the ſide AC, and the angle at A; then
AB muſt be produced to D; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
muſt fall from C upon the ſide
AD. Thus ſhall we have two right angled
triangles, and the ſide or angle required
may eaſily be reſolved by the Catholick
Propoſition.</p>
                        <p>As ſuppoſe there were given the ſide AB,
the angles at A and C, and required the
ſide AC; then the perpendicular muſt
fall from B upon the ſide AC, as in the firſt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60119:112"/>
triangle, and divide the oblique triangle
ABC into two right angled triangles, to
wit, ABF and BFC. And in the triangle
ABF we have given the ſide AB, and the
angle at A, to finde the baſe AF, for which
the analogie, by the Catholick Propoſition,
is,</p>
                        <p>As the co-tangent of AB, to Radius: ſo
is the co-ſine of the angle at A, to the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
of AF: that is, by the ſeventh caſe
of right angled triangles.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, by the eighth caſe, finde the
perpendicular BF. Laſtly, in the triangle
BFC, having the perpendicular BF, and
the angle at C, by the ſixt caſe of right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
ſpherical triangles, you may finde the
baſe FC, which being added to AF, is the
ſide AC.</p>
                        <p>But thus there are three operations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
whereas it may be done at two:
for the obliquangled triangle being reduced
into two right angled triangles, by letting
fall a perpendicular, as before: the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothenuſal
in one of the right angled tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles
will be correſpondent to the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenuſal
in the other, and the baſe in the
one to the baſe in the other; and ſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts.</p>
                        <p>Then in one of theſe right angled trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60119:112"/>
(which for diſtinction ſake we call the
firſt) there is given the hypothenuſal and
angle at the baſe, whereby may be found
the baſe or angle at the perpendicular, as
occaſion requires; by the ſeventh or ninth
caſes of right angled triangles. And this
is the firſt operation.</p>
                        <p>For the ſecond, there muſt (of the things
thus given and required) two things in one
triangle, be compared to two correſpondent
things in the other triangle, which two in
each with the perpendicular make three
things in each triangle, either adjacent,
that is, lying together, or oppoſite of which
three the perpendicular is alwayes one of
the extreams, and the thing required one
of the other extreams.</p>
                        <p>Thus in the triangle ABF, if there were
given AF and BF, to finde AB: AB is
the middle part, AF and BF are oppoſite
extreams; and therefore by the Catholick
Propoſition.</p>
                        <p>Radius added to the co-ſine of AB, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the co-ſines of AF and BF.</p>
                        <p>Then in the triangle BFC, if there
were given BF and FC, to finde BC: BC
will be the middle part, BF and FC oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
extreames; and therefore by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik
Propoſition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:60119:113"/>
The co-ſines of BF and FC are equall
to the co-ſine of BC and Radius.</p>
                        <p>But if from equal things we take away
equal things, the things remaining muſt
needs be equal; if therefore we take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Radius, and co-ſine BF in both
theſe proportions, it followes, that the co-ſine
of AB added to the co-ſine of FC is
equal to the coſine of BC added to the co-ſine
AF. And therefore, the middle part
AB in the firſt, and the extream FC in the
ſecond, is equall to the middle part BC
in the ſecond, and the extream AF in the
firſt: or thus;</p>
                        <p>As the middle part in the firſt triangle,
is in proporion to the middle part in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
ſo is the extream in the firſt, to the
extream in the ſecond.</p>
                        <p>Thus by the Catholick Propoſition, and
the help of this, the eight caſes following
may be reſolved. In the exemplification
whereof this ſign + ſignifies addition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:60119:113"/>

For the two leſſer angles are alwayes equal
unto two ſides of a Triangle comprehended
by the arkes of great Circles drawn from
their Poles, and the third angle may be
greater then a Quadrant, and therefore
the complement thereof to a Semicircle

former Triangle being equal to the angles

greater angle to a ſemicircle for one. As
AB is equal to the angle at L, or the arke
EG. The ſide BC is equal to the angle at
M, or the arch FH. And the ſide AC is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the complement of the angle LKM,
or the arch DI. Therefore if the angles
of the latter triangle LMK be given, the
ſides of the former triangle AB, BC, and

any other: If the place be Eaſt of <hi>London,</hi>
adde to the time given, but if it be Weſt
make ſubſtraction, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

be the time aequated to the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

of the ſaid Reduction, I have added
a Catalogue of many of the chiefeſt Towns

This done, proportion the Radius of a
circle to what extent you pleaſe, make AB
equal thereto, in the middle whereof, as in
C, erect the perpendicular CD, and draw
the lines AD and BD, equal in length to
your line of equal parts, ſo have you made
an equiangled Triangle, by help whereof
and the Table aforeſaid, the Chord of any
arch proportionable to this Radius may
ſpeedily be obtained.</p>
                        <p>As for example. Let there be required
the Chord of 30 deg. the number in the
Table anſwering to this arke is 518, or in
proportion to this Scale 52 almoſt, I take
therefore 52 from the Scale of equal parts,
and ſet them from D to E and F, and draw
the line EF, which is the Chord deſired.
Thus may you finde the Chord of any other
arch agreeable to this Radius. Or if your
Radius be either of a greater or leſſer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
if you make the baſe of your Triangle
AB equal thereunto, you may in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
finde the Chord of any arch agreeable
to any Radius given. Only remember
that if the Chord of the arch deſired exceed
60 deg. the ſides of the Triangle AD and
DB muſt be continued from A and B as far
as need ſhall require. In this manner is
made the line of Chords adjoyning, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable

Scheme.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>And in this manner may you finde the
Sine, Tangent or Secant of any arch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable

Canon of Naturall Sines, Tangents and
Secants, and the aforeſaid Scale of equall

Let there be required the ſine of 44 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

                        <p>Again, if there were required the tangent

The North plane is but the back ſide of

it, &amp; repreſented in the Scheme by the back
part of the ſame ſtreight line EZW, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

may be applied to the North; becauſe as
the South pole is above the South plane 38
degr. 47 min. ſo is the North pole under the
North plane as much, and each ſtile muſt
reſpect his own pole, onely the meridian
upon this plane repreſenteth the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,

northern declination hath but 39 degr.
90 min. of amplitude in this our Latitude;
and therefore riſeth but 22 min. before 4.
in the morning, and ſetteth ſo much after
8 at night; neither can it ſhine upon this
plane longer then 35 min. paſt 7 in the
morning, and returning to it as much before
5 at night, becauſe then the Sun paſſeth on
the North ſide of the prime vertical, in

the South.</p>

ſubſtract the houre diſtance from that, and

                        <p>Thus in our Example, the angle between

is three houres, or 45 deg. if therefore I
ſubſtract 30 deg. 78 min. from 45 deg. the
remainder will be 14 deg. 22 min. the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of 9 of the clock from the ſubſtile.
Again, the diſtance of 10 of the clock
from the Meridian is 30 deg. and therefore
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60119:174"/>
if I ſubſtract 30 deg. from 30 deg. 78 min.
the diſtance of 10 of the clock from the
ſubſtile will be 78 centeſms or parts of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
the reſt of the houres and parts are
eaſily found by a continual addition of 15
deg. for every houre, 7 deg. 50 min. for half

may perceive, the which conſiſts of three

if N were again the North part of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,

this kinde of plane rightly conceived and

it is not capable of the ſix of clock

                           <p>This Diall is to be made in all reſpects

for if you divide a quadrant or 90 degrees
in eight parts: you have the angles which
the eight windes reckoned from North to
Eaſt or Weſt do make with the meridian;

                        <p>THe Sea-mans Chart is a Parallelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram,
divided into little rectangled
figures, and in the plain Chart are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Squares, repreſenting the Longitudes
and Latitudes of ſuch places, as may be ſet
in the Chart, but the body of the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

reckoned in the Equator from the
Meridian, are in no place equal to thoſe of
the Latitude reckoned in the Meridian from
the Equator, ſave onely in the Equinoctial;
for the degrees of latitude are all equall
throughout the whole Globe, and as large
as thoſe of the Equinoctial; but the degrees
of Longitude at every parallel of Latitude
leſſen themſelves in ſuch proportion as that
parallel is leſſe then the Equinoctial: This
diſ-proportion of longitude and latitude
cauſed for a long time much errour in the
practiſe of Navigation, till at laſt it was in
part reconciled by <hi>Mercator,</hi> that famous
Geographer: and afterwards exactly recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by our worthy Countreyman Maſter
<hi>Edward Wright,</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>The

Correction of Errours in Navigation:</hi> In
which he hath demonſtrated by what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the degrees of Longitude muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
increaſe or decreaſe in any Latitude,
his words are as followeth.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſe, ſaith he, a ſpherical Superficies,
with Meridians, Parallels, Rumbes, and the
whole Hydrographial deſcription drawn
thereupon, to be inſcribed into a concave
Cylinder, their axes agreeing in one.</p>
                        <p>Let this Spherical ſuperficiees ſwell like
a bladder (whiles it is in blowing) equally
alwayes in every part thereof (that is as
much in Longitude as in Latitude, til it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and joyn it ſelf (round about and all
along alſo towards either pole) unto the
concave ſuperficies of the Cylinder: each
parallel upon this ſpherical ſuperficies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
ſucceſſively from the Equinoctial
towards either pole, until it come to be of
equal diameter with the Cylinder, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the Meridians, ſtil inclining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
till they come to be ſo far diſtant
every where each from other, as they are at
the Equinoctial.</p>
                        <p>Thus it may moſt eaſily be underſtood,
how a ſpherical ſuperficies may by extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be made a Cylindrical, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a plain parallelogram ſuperficies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:60119:211"/>
the ſuperficies of a cylinder is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but a plain parallelogram wound
about two equal equidiſtant circles, that
have one common axletree perpendicular
upon the centers of them both, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripheries
of each of them equall to the
length of the parallelogram, as the diſtance
betwixt thoſe circles, or height of the cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is equall to the breadth thereof. So as
the Nautical planiſphere may be defined to
be nothing elſe but a parallelogram made
of the Spherical ſuperficies of an Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical
Globe inſcribed into a concave
cylinder, both their axes concurring in one,
and the ſphericall ſuperficies ſwelling in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part equally in longitude and latitude,
till every one of the parallels thereupon be
inſcribed into the cylinder (each parallel
growing as great as the Equinoctial, or till
the whole ſpherical ſuperficies touch and
apply it ſelf every where to the concavity of
the cylinder.</p>
                        <p>In this Nautical planiſphere thus concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be made, all places muſt needs be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
in the ſame longitudes, latitudes, and
directions or courſes, and upon the ſame
meridians, parallels and rumbes, that they
were in the Globe, becauſe that at every
point between the Equinoctial and the Pole
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:60119:211"/>
we underſtand the ſpherical ſuperficies,
whereof this planiſphere is conceived to be
made, to ſwell equally as much in longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
as in latitude (till it joyn it ſelf unto
the concavity of the cylinder; ſo as hereby
no part thereof is any way diſtorted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
out of his true and natural ſituation
upon his meridian, parallel or rumbe, but
onely dilated and enlarged, the meridians
alſo, parallels, and rumbes, dilating and
enlarging themſelves likewiſe at every
point of latitude in the ſame proportion.</p>
                        <p>Now then let us diligently conſider of the
Geometrical lineaments, that is, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians,
rumbes, and parallels of this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Nautical planiſphere, that we may
in like manner expreſſe the ſame in the
Mariners Chart: for ſo undoubtedly we
ſhall have therein a true Hydrographical
deſcription of all places in their longitudes,
latitudes, and directions, or reſpective ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
each from other, according to the
points of the compaſſe in all things corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
to the Globe, without either ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
or explicable errour.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, therefore in this planiſphere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the parallels are every where equal
each to other (for every one of them is equal
to the Equinoctiall or circumference of the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:60119:212"/>
circumſcribing cylinder) the meridians alſo
muſt needs be parallel &amp; ſtreight lines; and
conſequently the rumbes, (making equall
angles with every meridian) muſt likewiſe
be ſtreight lines.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, becauſe the ſpherical ſuperficies
whereof this planiſphere is conceived to be
made, ſwelleth in every part thereof equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that is as much in Latitude as in Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
till it apply it ſelf round about to the
concavity of the cylinder: therefore at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
point of Latitude in this planiſphere,
a part of the Meridian keepeth the ſame
proportion to the like part of the parallel
that the like parts of the Meridian, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
have each to other in the Globe,
without any explicable errour.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe like parts of wholes keep
the ſame proportion that their wholes have
therefore the like parts of any parallel and
Meridian of the Globe, have the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
that the ſame parallel and meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
have.</p>
                        <p>For example ſake, as the meridian is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the parallel of 60 degrees: ſo a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the meridian is double to a degree
of that parallel, or a minute to a minute,
and what proportion the parallel hath to
the meridian, the ſame proportion have
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:60119:212"/>
their diameters and ſemidiameters each to
other.</p>
                        <p>But the ſine of the complement of the
parallels latitude, or diſtance from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial,
is the ſemidiameter of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>As here you ſee AE, the ſine of AH, the
complement of AF, the latitude or diſtance
of the parallel ABCD from the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial,
is the ſemidiameter of the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.
And as the ſemidiameter of the
meridian or whole ſine, is to the ſemidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the parallel; ſo is the ſecant or
hypothenuſa of the parallels latitude, or
of the parallels diſtance from the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial,
to the ſemidiameter of the meridian
or whole ſine; as FK, (that is AK) to AE
(that is GK) ſo is LK, to KF.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in this nautical planiſphere,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:60119:213"/>
the Semidiameter of each parallel being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the ſemidiameter of the Equinoctial,
that is, to the whole ſine; the parts of the
Meridian at every point of Latitude muſt
needs increaſe with the ſame proportion
wherewith the ſecants of the ark, conteined
between thoſe points of Latitude and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial
do increaſe.</p>
                        <p>Now then we have an eaſie way laid open
for the making of a Table (by help of the
natural Canon of Triangles) whereby the
meridians of the Mariners Chart may moſt
eaſily and truly be divided into parts, in
due proportion, and from the Equinoctial
towards either Pole.</p>
                        <p>For (ſuppoſing each diſtance of each
point of latitude, or of each parallel from
other, to contein ſo many parts as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
of the latitude of each point or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
conteineth) by perpetual addition of
the ſecants anſwerable to the latitudes of
each point or parallel unto the ſumme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of all the former ſecants, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with the ſecant of the firſt parallels
latitude, and thereto adding the ſecant of
the ſecond parallels Latitude, and to the
ſumme of both theſe adjoyning the ſecant
of the third parallels Latitude; and ſo forth
in all the reſt we may make a Table which
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:60119:213"/>
ſhall truly ſhew the ſections and points of
latitude in the Meridians of the Nautical
Planiſphere, by which ſections the parallels
muſt be drawn.</p>
                        <p>As in the Table of meridional parts pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at the end of this Diſcourſe, we made
the diſtance of each parallel from other, to
be one minute or centeſm of a degree: and
we ſuppoſed the ſpace between any two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels,
next to each other in the Planiſpere,
to contain ſo many parts as the ſecant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the diſtance of the furtheſt of
thoſe two parallels from the Equinoctial;
and ſo by perpetual addition of the ſecants
of each minute or centeſm to the ſum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of all the former ſecants, is made
the whole Table.</p>
                        <p>As for example, the ſecant of one centeſm
in Maſter <hi>Briggs</hi> 's <hi>Trigonometrica Britannica</hi>
is 100000.00152, which alſo ſheweth the
ſection of one minute or centeſm of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
from the Equinoctial in the Nautical
Planiſphere; whereunto adde the ſecants
of two minutes or centeſmes, that is 100000.
00609, the ſum is 200000.00761. which
ſheweth the ſection of the ſecond minute of
the meridian from the Equinoctial in the
planiſphere: to this ſum adde the ſecant of
three minutes, which is 100000.01371, the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:60119:214"/>
ſum will be 3000<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>0.02132, which ſheweth
the ſection of the third minute of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
from the Equinoctial, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>orth
in all the reſt; but after the Table was thus
finiſhed, it being too large for ſo ſmall a
Volume, we have contented our ſelves with
every tenth number, and have alſo cut
off eight places towards the right hand,
ſo that in this Table the ſection of 10 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
is 100, of one degree 1000, and this
is ſufficient for the making either of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
or any particular Chart.</p>
                        <p>I call that a general Chart, whoſe line
AE in the following figure repreſents the
Equinoctial, (as here it doth the parallel of
50 degrees) and ſo containeth all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels
ſucceſſively from the Equinoctial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
either Pole, but they can never be
extended very near the Pole, becauſe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the parallels increaſe as much as
ſecants do. But notwithſtanding this, it may
be remed general, becauſe a more general
Chart cannot be contrived <hi>in plano,</hi> except
a true projection of the Sphere it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>And I call that a particular Chart which
is made properly for one particular Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
as if a man were to ſail betwen
the Latitude of 50 and 55 degrees, and his
difference of Longitude were not to exceed
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:60119:214"/>
ſix degrees, then a Chart made, as this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
is for ſuch a Voyage, may be called
particular, and is thus to be projected.</p>
                        <p>Having drawn the line AB, ſerving for
the firſt meridian, croſſe it at right angles
with the two perpendiculars BC and AE;
divide the line AE, or another line paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to it into ſix equal parts, noting them
with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; then ſub-divide each
part or degree into 10, and if you can, each
of thoſe into 10 more; however, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
each degree to be ſubdivided into 1000
parts; through each of theſe degrees draw
lines parallel to the firſt meridian AB. The
meridians being drawn, to draw the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels
of latitude you muſt have recourſe to
your Table of meridionall parts, in which
finding that the diſtance between the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and 50 degrees in the meridian ſhould
be equal to 57 degr. 909 parts in the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and his parallels; I may ſuppoſe the
loweſt parallel to be 57 degrees from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator.
So the diſtance between this loweſt
parallel and the parallel of 50 degrees will
be 909 parts onely: wherefore I take theſe
909 parts out of the line AE, and ſet them
from the loweſt parallel upwards, and draw
the line AE, which ſhall repreſent the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
of 50 degrees. In like manner, I
