            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE PREFACE CONTAINING THE CAVSES AND REASONS OF</hi> this nevv edition, as also a detection of the foule and false dealing of M. Edm. Buny Minister, in his late edition of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer booke.</head>
            <head type="sub">With certaine instructions very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reader.</head>
            <p>WHEN of late I had taken in hand to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and send vnto thee (deare Christian reader) th' other two <note place="margin">The reason of printing againe this first booke of Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> bookes, that were promised of this worke, I meane thos two which should treate of the right entrance and faithful perseuerance in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of almightie God: I was moued by diuers frendes, first of al to put againe in print (in some better order then before) the first booke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petteining to resolution. Wherunto I was the more easie to be induced, for that I perceaued many monethes before, that al the first copies of the said former booke, (though not so wel
<pb facs="tcp:14541:5"/>
done as iustely I might haue wished) were vvholy dispersed and none remaining to be had.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it being now purposed that thes second and third bookes should passe forth in better print, paper, and character, then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer did, (wherin by some errour, as also by difficultie of the time, greate defect was found:) it seemed meere and requisice, that this first booke (of which th' other two doe depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) should be made correlpondent vnto them in thes respectes also, and for that consideration to be reprinted.</p>
            <p>Wherunto when I had yelded; I resolued in like manner, to take the same first booke into my handes againe, &amp; to bestow a short renew vpon that which alredy was done, as wel to polish and fil vp some thinges, whetin before for want of leasure and time, I could not geue to my self any reasonable conteatation, as also to a dioine certaine new chapters, which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in mine owne concept, and partly also vpon <note place="margin">Nevv ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> information of others, I thought not vnmeet for the furnishing of this first argument and subiect of Resolution. And standing determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon this, as also comprehending in mind and cogitation, the whole general corps of that which was to ensue in th' other two boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: <note place="margin">The vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le vvorke deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tvvo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes.</note> I wel saw that I should not be able (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my first designement) to compact the whole, in one reasonable volume; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I resolued to deuide the same into two. Waerof the first should conteine matter of <note place="margin">1. Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue.</note> discourse, know edge, speculation, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to moue vs to resolue; the second should handle things appetteining to exercise, <note place="margin">2. Practive.</note> vse, and practise, for putting in execution our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14541:5"/>
good desires after resolution.</p>
            <p>This being my cogitation, and the matter now wel forward for the print; I was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of two other editions come forth of my <note place="margin">Tvvo edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the booke of Resolution vvithout the authors knowledge.</note> forsaid booke without my knowiedge, the one by a Catholique (as it seemeth) who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceuing ai copies of the former print to be spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; for satisfying of them that desired the booke, procured the same to be set forth againe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit somewhat incorrected, and very disordre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not hauing the consent or aduise of such, as therin should haue geuen him best direction. The second was published by one Edmund Bany minister at Bolton Percy (as he writeth) <note place="margin">M. Ed. Bany.</note> in the liberties of Yorke; who with publicke licence vnder my Lord Archbishop of Yorke his protection, set forth the same to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his brethren; but yet so punished and plumed, (which he termeth purged;) as I could hardly by the face discerne it for mine, when it came vnto my handes, and I tooke no smale compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to see how pitifully the poore thing had bene handled.</p>
            <p>Of this edition then of M. Buny, (letting <note place="margin">Of M. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies edition.</note> passe th' other as a matter onely of a discretion without malice,) I haue to a laertise the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some few things, as wel for mine own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, wherin I am charged by him, as also for the readers admonishment, not to thinke in deed that booke to be mine, which in my name this preacher hath published. And for vttering that which I haue to say in some kinde of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Fovver pointes of this prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</note> and conueniencie of methode; I shal touch breefly in this preface thos principal pointes insuing.</p>
            <p>First, how this booke came foorth from me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the first edition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14541:6"/>
Secondly, how it was set foorth afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by M. Edm. Buny.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, what he meaneth by his treatise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> annexed therunto, tending (as he saith) to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, how the same booke commeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> foorth at this present, and how the discret rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may vse it to his best commoditie.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>of the first edition.</head>
               <p>TO shew how this booke came foorth at the first; it shalbe requisite, perhaps, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate breefly i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place, the things that I saied in my first preface &amp; induction; which preface and induction, M. Buny hath left out in his edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, protesting, <hi>That he durst not in conscience and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the reader.</note> 
                  <hi>in dutie tovvardes God, commend the same in my vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vnto the reader.</hi> And yet trulie was ther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in effect therin (Gentle reader) but that which here in this place shalbe repeated. First, that the primatiue occasion, inducing me to thinke vpon this worke, was the sight of a booke intituled, <hi>The excrcise of a Christian life,</hi> writen in Italian by Doctor Loartes of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie <note place="margin">The first occasion of setting so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orth the booke of Resolution.</note> of IESVS, and translated some years since by a vertuous learned gentilman of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Which booke for that I vnderstood of certaintie to haue profited many, towardes pietie and deuotion: I was moued to cause the same to be printed againe, with certaine am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple additions to the furnishing of some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which that author had omitted: deuiding my whole purpose into three seueral bookes, wherof the first was to persuade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto true resolution; the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to instruct vs how righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beginne; the third, how a man may hould
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14541:6"/>
but and perseuer. Secondly I shewed, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred into the worke, and hauing set downe an other order and method to my self, then that treatise of D. Loartes did obserue; and hauing begunao the first booke touching resolution, whereof no part was handled in that other treatise: I found by experience, that I could not wel conioine th' one with th' other, if I would satisfie either th' order or argument by me conceaued: and therfore that I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to resolue vpon a further labour then at the first I had intended, and this was, to draw out the whole three bookes my self, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing that was in the said exercise, or other like good treatisses to this effect.</p>
               <p>And al this to the end, that our countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might haue some one sufficient directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for matters of spirit and vertuous life, among so many bookes of controuersies as haue bene writen &amp; are in writing daily. Which bookes (said I) albeit in thes our troblesome and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relous <note place="margin">Bookes of deuotion more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to good life the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bookes of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> times, they be necessary for defence of our faith against so manie seditious innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as now daily are attempted: yet help they litle oftentimes to good life, but rather doe fil the heades and hartes of men with a spirit of contradiction and contention, which for the most part doe hinder deuotion, which deuotion is nothing els, but, <hi>A quiet, calme, and peacable state of our soule, induced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a iotful prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.</note> 
                  <hi>and alacritis to the diligent execution of al things that doe or may apperteine to the honour and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of almightbe God.</hi> For which cause, the holie Apostle dehorted greatly his scholer Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <note place="margin">2. Timot. 2.</note> from this contention and contradiction of wordes, affirming clearly, that it was profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to nothing but to subuect the hearers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14541:7"/>
I affirmed further, that our forfathers were most happie in respect of vs, who receauing <note place="margin">Our fathers happie that builded, and contended not about the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> with humilitie one vniforme faith without contention or contradiction, from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holie Catholique Church, did attend onlie to build vpon that foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and vertuous life, as holie scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs to doe; wheras we, spending now al our time in iangling about this first founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">1. Co. 3.</note> of faith, haue no leasure to build either gould or siluer theron, as th' Apostle exhorteth vs, but doe weary out our selues and our owne contentious spirits, without commoditie; dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with much labour and litle profit, with great disquiet and smale reward. For which cause I exhorted the discret reader of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer religion and faith he were, to moderate this heate and passion of contention, and to enter into the careful studie and exercise of good deedes, which are alwayes better among true Christians, then wordes; assuring him that this is the right way to obteine at Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, the light of true beleefe if he were amisse. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging for example therof, the most famous conuersion of Cornelius the Gentile, whos ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life, praiers, and almouse deedes, obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the hands of almightie God, (as S. Luke doth testifie) that S. Peter was sent vnto him for his instruction and establishment in right <note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> faith.</p>
               <p>I adioined moreouer, that ther being two parts of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuinitie, the one Theorike or speculatiue, belonging principally to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <note place="margin">Tvvo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian aiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisie.</note> discours, and beleefe; the second called practique or actiue, appertaining cheefly to action and execution: the first is more easy and common, then the second, bicause it is more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14541:7"/>
easy to know then to doe; to discourse then to <note place="margin">Speculation easier then practise.</note> worke; to beleeue as we ought, then to liue as we should: and the things that a man hath to beleeue, are fewer then the things he hath to doe; learned in shorter time and with lesse dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, thé the other are executed. Euen as we see by experience, that a breefe Cathechisme instructeth a man sufficiently in his faith; but al the bookes and sermons that we can read and heare, can not persuade the least part of men to performe so much in life, as by their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is required. For which cause I said, that both our Saucour and his Apostles did treate much more in their speaches and writings of things to be done, then of things to be known; of vertuous liuing, then of right beleeuing. The like I saied, of Holie fathers and Doctours in the Church after them, as it may be sene in their homilies, sermons, exhortations, treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, commentaries, and expositions.</p>
               <p>For this cause I saied also, that I had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to say some thing of this second part of Christian diuinitie appertaining to manners and direction of life, allotting to my self three principal pointes to be handled therin, and to be treated in three seueral bookes. The first wherof, to conteine the reasons and motiues <note place="margin">The three bookes of this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, vvith their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> which may stir vp a Christian man to make a firme and sound resolution. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the particular meanes, how a man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out errour may put in vre and practise his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution made. The third, to declare certaine helpes and instructions, wherby to be able to perseuer vnto the end. The first of thes bookes, was then set downe and published. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and third vpon necessarie causes were deferred for a time. And this is the summarie of al that
<pb facs="tcp:14541:8"/>
was writen in my former preface and Induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, suppressed now by M. Buny for meere conscience sake as he protesteth Wherin not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I doe not easilie see, what may be accompted either so heinous or intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as his scrupulous conscience should be a fraide to let the same passe vnto the readers eare, except it were for that in a certaine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement, I desired eche Catholique to pray for our persecutours; or for that (perhaps) in the lines before repeated, I doe affirme faith, and beleef to be more common and easy then vertuous life; which notwithstanding I thinke, many Protestants in England wil confesse to be true; and wil easilie proue the same by the liues and actions of their own preachers and ministers. So much then for this: now let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how M. Buny hath set foorth the same booke with his purgation.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>of M. Bunis edition.</head>
               <p>M. Buny hauing taken this booke into his correction, as also into my Lord Archbishop of Yorke his protection; geueth it this title, <note place="margin">A title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by M. Buny.</note> 
                  <hi>A booke of Christian exercise &amp;c. Perused and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied vvith a treatise tending to pacification, by Edm. Buny.</hi> And vnder the title, he writeth this sentence of scripture. <hi>IESVS Christ yester day and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>to day and the same for euer.</hi> The misterie why he set thes wordes ther, him self alone (as I thinke) vnderstandeth and hard it were for other men to coniectare. If he had taken the wordes immediatly following in the same sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of S. Paul; they had bene more cleare, if not more also to the purpose. For they ar thes, <hi>Be not caried avvay vvith variable and strange doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:14541:8"/>
But let vs permit M. Buny to folow his <note place="margin">An old trick of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques to abuse sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people vvith obs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure places of scripture. <hi>See Epiph. cont. heres. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> kinde. The holie fathers that write against auncient heretiques, doe note it for an old tricke of thos companions, to delight them selues, and deceue others with obscure places of scripture. And S. Peter expresly signifieth of the same men, that principally they vsed to take the said obscure sentences out of S. Paul, whence this by M. Buny is also cited. And this for the first page.</p>
               <p>In the next page, he placeth my Lord of Yorkes armes, accompanied with a paire of goodly crosse keyes, and a croune set ouer thé. Vnder which he writeth two latin verses, that <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> say thus much in English, <hi>Thes armes haue bene</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">My L. of yorkes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</note> 
                  <hi>noble in times past by ancient gentry and commendation of learning; but novv they are made more noble by the honour of Peter adioined vnto them.</hi> So that now (as ye see) it is both good doctrine, and very commendable in my Lords grace of Yorke to clame both keyes &amp; croune, from Peters seat, which in the Byshop of Rome is made so hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and so bitterly inueighed against daily.</p>
               <p>After the armes, insueth the dedication of the whole booke, (treating of mortification <note place="margin">The epistle dedicaterie.</note> and contempt of the world) vnto his good Lordship. The reason of which dedication, M. Buny vttereth in thes wordes, <hi>For that hauing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In his Ep. dedicat.</note> 
                  <hi>had</hi> (saieth he) <hi>so longe experience of the vvorld as your Lordship haue, very liklihood teacheth that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des you must grovve more and more from the loue therof. And it is sufficiently knovvn vnto al, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">My L. of yorkes mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others.</note> 
                  <hi>found this mercy your self, you haue in like sort in this long course that God hath geuen you, much called on others to doe the like.</hi> In which wordes, we see, that touching the first pointe of my Lords wearines of this world, M. Buny proueth it
<pb facs="tcp:14541:9"/>
very slenderly, by a bare likelihood only. Albeit in the second, of his Graces calling vpon others to like mortification, he alleageth the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and sufficient knowledge of al, wherunto in reason eche man must yeld. And in truth I haue heard, how ther want not of diuers sortes and <note n="*" place="margin">His L. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise of Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster. Sir Robert Stapleton &amp; others.</note> sexes also, who can witnesse by experience of my Lordes good mortification, and how hotely he hath poursued them of late, for such affaires; and therfore (no doubt) but that this booke was very fitly dedicated to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships protection.</p>
               <p>After the epistle dedicatorie vnto my Lord, ther foloweth a preface to the reader, wherin <note place="margin">The prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to the reader.</note> M. Buny saieth, <hi>That by the litle that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovvedin the studie of schole men, he vvil perceaueth that this booke vvas gathered out of them; vvho liuing in the corrupter time of the Church (as he speaketh) did most of al, by that occasion, treate of reformation of life, vvhen as others vvere rather occupied in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</hi> To which I answer, that by the litle which <note place="margin">M Banies ignorance.</note> M. Buny here vttereth, he sheweth him self scarse worthy to be my Lord Archbishops chaplaine, (albeit to that dignitie much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be not required,) for that whosoeuer shal looke vpon the homilies, sermons, commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and other workes of S. Ambrose, Augustin, Gregorie, Maximus, Bede, Bernard, Anselme, and other that were not scholemen; and shal compare the same (touching exhortation and instruction to good life.) With the questions, distinctions, speculations and subtilties of Peter Lumbard, Hales, Scotus, Durand, Iandun Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preolus and others of that profession; shal ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily see, that in this matter ther is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: and consequently that M. Bunis litle studie in the scholemen is lesse then nothing at al, not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14541:9"/>
knowing so much as the very subiect and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which they handle, or the manner how they handle the same. But al this was spoken <note place="margin">M. Bunies vanitie.</note> by M. Buny, for a vaine florish, and to persuade his reader, that as him self was very learned, so al that was in this booke being taken out of Dunsies (as now in England they tearme scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen,) might appeare more contemptible in euery mans iudgement, and so in reason stand the more subiect to M. Bunis learned censure, to put out, cut of, mangle, change &amp; pare away whatsoeuer it pleased him. Yet protesteth he forsooth, very solemly, <hi>That he allovveth vvel of the matter in general, and that he is glad that some of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ep. Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> 
                  <hi>vs also, haue taken paines in this kinde of labour, and that others of our prosession are sometimes occupied in reading such bookes.</hi> As who would say, that this were a strange and rare matter in our behalfe, either to write or reade bookes of this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or argument.</p>
               <p>But here I would demande of M. Buny in sincerite, where or when, any of his religion did either make or set forthe (of them selues) any one treatise of this kinde or subiect?

For this time present, the most excellent writinges of <hi>Ludouicus de Granada, Diegostella, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancus, Angerius,</hi> and this present booke with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite others, writen in this kinde doe testifie that this argument is not strange among Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, but rather proper and peculier vnto them alone, seing that M. Buny is not able to

name one on his side, from the first heretique that cuer wrote, vnto this daie, which of his owne accorde hath employed him self in this subiect, except it were of enuie and malice to defile and corrupt an other mans labours, to the end they should not worke that good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which otherwise they would, as M. Buny hath now done mine, and as one Rogers an other like companion (whom also he nameth) hath corrupted in englishe the most excellent <note place="margin">

An other also of the same crue, hath vsed the like violence vnto the holie meditations of S. Augustin and Saint Bernard, putting out and in what liked him best, and making thos blessed men to speake like protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, against whom they were most opposite enimies.</p>
               <p>The same hath M. Buny done vnto me, throughout my whole booke, and to most of the ancient Fathers therin named also, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shalbe declared. And this shameles shift of corrupting other mens bookes, is an old oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of heretiques from the beginning, as may appeare by the often complaintes of most ancient fathers, whos workes they were not ashamed to infect and corrupt whiles they were yet liuing. In respect of which impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie the holie Apostle S. Paul, wel prophetied of them to his scholer Timothie, that they should haue, <hi>cauteriatam conscientiam,</hi> a seared and yron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science. And againe; that they should <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> sinne wilfully and damnably in their owne <note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> knowledge and iudgement. So we reade that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14541:10"/>
old heretiques aduentured to corrupt not only priuate mens workes and treatises; but also the holic Canons of general Councels them selues, wherof therwere so many witnesses yet liuing to controle them. This may appeare by the greuous complaint which holie Athanasius <note place="margin">Athanas. apolog. 2. tp ad felic.</note> made in his time against the Arians for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the first Nicen Councel, and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after him, for like heretical attemptes in their times; especially against the sacred text of diuine scripture, in corrupting whereof, al he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques from time to time haue bene most malepert, bold, and impudent, for shadowing their sectes with some shew of holie write.</p>
               <p>And to the ende M. Buny may not here eskape, and tel his reader that this was a spirit <note place="margin">That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes doe follovv the same spirit of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> of heretiques in old time, and not to be found in the protestantes of thes daies: I doe referre him not only to the collections which diuers Catholiques of this age haue gathered against them, touching thes attemptes; but also to the testimonies, confessions, and accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes them selues, one against and other for like impudencie. Especially against the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, or thos that folowed th' opinion of Zuinglius (wherof I thinke M. Buny wil not deny him self to be one,) whom Martin Luther the father of al protestantes doth affirme, to be the most horrible corrupters of other mens bookes, that euer were; concluding his whole inuectiue against them with this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <hi>Their opinion of the Sacrament they began vvith lies, and</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST IN A L</hi> places wher conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14541:11"/>
he maye, he maketh me speake after <note place="margin">B V N. first deuise. To MAKE his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries speake like Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes.</note> the phrase of Protestantes; as for example, page 204. of his booke, wher I talke of Catholique preestes that heare confessions; he maketh me saie, <hi>men that be skilful to giue Counsail, &amp;c.</hi> Againe page 229. wher I saie out of holie scripture, <hi>here hence doe proceede al thos large promises, to virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, chastitie, voluntarie pouertie, &amp;c.</hi> he maketh me saie; <hi>hence doe procede thos promises to mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nevvnes of life;</hi> &amp; he striketh out the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which I alleage for the other. In like maner page 368. when I saie, <hi>penance &amp; satissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> He maketh me saie, <hi>toile of amendment.</hi> And so in infinite other places (which were to long here to recite) M. Buny maketh me to speake like a good minister of England. Neither dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth he only thus with me; but i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like maner also with the ancient fathers, so long as by that meanes he can hold in with them, and when he can not, then he breaketh of and biddeth them a dieu.</p>
               <p>Let one or two examples serue for al; page 374. he ronneth on a whole halfe lease with S. Augustine, turning euery wher the wordes <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and satisfaction</hi> into repentance, vntil at <note place="margin">S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine taught to speake by M. Buny.</note> légth S. Augustine saieth, that this pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce must be inioined to the penitent by the preest: and ther M. Buny leapeth ouer that, but yet after a line or two, ioineth with him familiarly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and so runneth on, vntil he cometh to an other blocke, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be remoued, wher he is inforced againe to leape ouer. So in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner page 209. wher S. August. recounteth the storie of S. Antonie the monke of Egipt; M. Buny leaueth out the name Monke, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth S. Augustine to say; <hi>S Antonie that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed a priuate and solitarie life in Egipt.</hi> And then
<pb facs="tcp:14541:12"/>
wher S. Augustin writeth, <hi>that ther vvas a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the same monkes, norished by S. Ambrose vvithout the vvalles of Millan;</hi> M. Buny maketh him to leaue out the names of Monkes &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie, as also the name and almes of S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, &amp; to say onlie <hi>that others (as he then heard) did the like, euen in Millan it self.</hi> And finally, he frameth euery mans speech (wher he can) to such a stile as though he had bene trained vp in Iohn Caluins schole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> when he hath not commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie to change the very wordes, or els dareth <note place="margin">BVNY se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise. To INSERT parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> not for that they are scripture: then seeketh he to salue the matter with inserting some paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, as though the same were of th' authour him self. So page 39. I say, that our Sauiour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded by a certaine prince, how he might be saued; would geue him no other hope albeit he were a prince, but, <hi>if thou vvilt enter into life, kepe the commandementes.</hi> Wher M. Buny hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth <note place="margin">Math. 18. Marc 10. Luc. 19.</note> the matter out with this parenthesis, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>He vvould geue him no other hope (so long as he sought saluation by his vvorkes) but keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes, &amp;c.</hi> As though this prince had sought his saluation erroniously, &amp; that Christ had answered him in his error, &amp; so deceaued him. In like maner page 229. wher I alleage out of S. Paul and out of the reuelations, that men shalbe crowned in heauen according to their <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. Apoc. 2.</note> fight in this life: M. Buny bodgeth in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis (in some good measure) therby to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite the Holie Ghost in his meaning. Sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, page 229. when I alleage plainly the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of scripture, <hi>No man knovveth vvhether he be vvorthie of loue or hatred in Gods sight.</hi> He addeth <note place="margin">Eccle. 9.</note> this parenthesis (by outward things) as who would say, that by inward things ech man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14541:12"/>
might know the same, which the Holie Ghost in this place did not forsee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIRDLY</hi> when he can not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate <note place="margin">BVN. third shift. MAROI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers fortes.</note> the matter ether by changing the wordes, or by putting in a parenthesis; then maketh he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times certaine amotations in the margent; wherof certaine be idle and foolish, some be ridiculous and absurd, and other be wicked and tending to impietie.</p>
               <p>Of the first kinde, you may see examples page 171. wher, for that I saie, that our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">Annotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fonde.</note> passions moderated, may serue vs to vertue; he maketh a longe and fond annotation, that we doe hold that the soule doth follow the temperature of the body, and thervpon doe grounde that our Lady was borne without ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal sinne; and other such docttines, which is neither so no so; nor the good man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth what he saieth in this point nor what we hold, albeit (if you will beleeue him) he hath studied the schoelmen. Page 228. wher I saie that ther was no reason in our fight, whie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God should so much abuse his owne only sonne in this world, as to suffer so many indignities as he did: this man saith in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical note, <hi>that ther vvas great reason in it.</hi> And so consequently, doth bring the inscrutable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the sonne of God his abasement, (wherat S. Paul so often times wondered, and wherat the very Angels remaine astonished;) within the compasse of humane wit &amp; reason, which euery simple man by nature may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>
               <p>Of the second kinde, which are absurde, you may finde examples page 153. wherby a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal <note place="margin">2. Annotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s absurd.</note> note he discrediteth the beleefe of S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian about the knowledge, that we shal haue
<pb facs="tcp:14541:13"/>
of our fathers, mothers, and other acquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in heauen; as though one Cyprian with Christian men of reason, weighed not more in the affaires of our soule, then ten coople of Bunis, were they neuer so vendible. So againe page 214. vpon the religious rule of life which S. Augustine reporteth to haue bene reuealed to his mother for him to follow, M. Buny wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>That it vvas but a more careful indeuour in the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aug. lib.8. confes. cap. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>vvay of godlines.</hi> And page 212. he addeth to the same, <hi>That it vvas but such, as vve al</hi> (saieth he) <hi>are bound vnto.</hi> But yet he that shal reade either S. Augustine him self, or els Possidonius his scholler declaring the particulers of that rule, <note place="margin">Possid. in vita Aug.</note> which he saw S. Augustine obserue in life, and prescribe vnto others: he wil easily confesse (I thinke) that how soeuer the ministers of England may be bounde therunto by M. Bunis word in this annotation, yet that they doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue but few partes therof in conuersation: especially touching wiuing, I am of opinion, that M. Buny wil not denie S. Augustins rule to containe some-what more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes at this day doe practise. To like fond absurditie appertaineth that which is noted by him, page 300. wher I affirming that Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret iudgement of ech mans particuler pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, is vncertaine to vs, he noteth in the margent, <hi>that calling and iustifying are very plaine and infallible tokens therof, and so far is it not vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the faithful;</hi> as who would saie, that it were an easie mater for him that hath faith, to know who are so called or iustified, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to assure a man of his particuler prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination: whereas notwithstanding, Christ saith of the first, <hi>that many are called vvhich are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> and of the second, S. Paul saith in him self
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14541:13"/>
                  <hi>that he vvas guiltie of nothing, and yet therby he vvas not iustified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the third kinde of annotations, which <note place="margin">3. Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> are both wicked &amp; impious, ther might many examples be alleaged, but thes few insuing shal suffise to discouer M. Bunies spirite. First then, page 212. as concerning the life of that holie and most wonderful man S. Antonie the first monke of AEgipt, whom al antiquitie so much <note place="margin">Athanas. in vita Anton. Aug lib. 8. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes. c. 12.</note> admired, and whom S. Athanafius in writing his life, so highely extolled, and whos doinges S. Augustin so hartely reuerenced, as he made the same a principal motiue &amp; paterne to his owne conuersion; (especially for that he tooke thos wordes of our Sauiour, <hi>Goe and sel al thou</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>hast and geue to the poore,</hi> as spoken to him self in particuler:) vpon this mans conuersion (I say) &amp; most wonderful life, M. Buny maketh this scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neful &amp; irreligious note, <hi>that it may vvel be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Against S. Antonie.</note> 
                  <hi>vvhether he had in that place sufficient ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorke of thos his doings, vnles he had some other special motion besides.</hi> Condemning herin not only S.

               <p>To like purpose or rather more vvickedlie, he maketh an other annotation page 308. vpon <note place="margin">Against S. Augustine.</note> the most famous conuersion of S.

For vnderstanding wherof it is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, that first, generally whersoeuer he findeth the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of certaine thinges that please him not, as of abstinence, fasting, chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the bodie, penance, satisfaction, virginitie, merit, hier, gayning of heauen, laboring for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or the like: he commonly striketh al out together with th' Authours that treat therof, or els so mangleth the same as is pitiful to behold.</p>

Herof you may see exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, Page 29. of his booke, wher he thrusteth out S.

I might say much more, but that this place beareth it not, and therfore thous halt be content (good reader) to accept of one example only among infinite that might be alleaged, and by this one, thou maist make vnto thy self some certaine conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the rest. Page 367. it is handled and proued by me against the impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of delay, how that vvee by deferring our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion, doe alwaies binde our selues to greater penance &amp; satisfaction afterwardes, &amp;c.

And as for the worde Satisfaction, for that he had no other word to put in for it, he thrusteth it cleane out. Then commeth he to S.

downe as good and currant. But the other part of the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce immediatly following, was, <hi>that</hi>

               <p>After S. Cyprian followeth S.

               <p>In the end of the ranke, came graue S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros, affirming, <hi>That vnto a great vvound, a deepe</hi>

               <p>Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (gentle reader) what shal we thinke or say of thes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or of their maner of dealing?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14541:16"/>
Haue they honest meaning trow you? Haue <note place="margin">A conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration vpon the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> they sidelitie? Haue they a conscience? Haue they respect of God or man, that deale in this order? Is it hard to found any new religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to defend it, or to auouch what folie or falsaood soeuer, by this maner of proceeding? If thes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had habilitie to doe what their consciences would permit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world abrod, what an alteration, what a subuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what a metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis would they make in al matters of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie? If they had to them selues the setting forth of the holy fathers &amp; doctours workes, how would they loppe and circumcise the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me? how would they set them foorth in their Ierkins, yea, barehose and doubletes, cutting of al other garmentes and furniture that liked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, or were not sutable to the season of thes mens senses? If thes men (I say) had the keeping of al antiquities, of fathers, Councels, and scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; that to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues alone in their owne custodie, without the knowledge or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any one Catholique, for the space of only fiue hundred yeares together, (as they graunt we held the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al in our handes for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,) what maner of bookes (trow you) should we finde them? How currant and absolute for the protestant religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? No doubt but we should heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speake eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Iohn Caluin speaketh in al matters of controuersie, or rather as that good man for the time would haue them to speake, vnto whos handes the last edition of such workes should be committed.</p>
               <p>And thus much shal suffice for discouerie of M. Bunies editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my booke, now remaineth ther only a word or two to be saide of the treatise which he adioined, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding (as he saith) to Pacification.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">

               <head>Of M. Bunies Pacification.</head>
               <p>AND first of al, a man would thinke that M. Buny did take but a very strange way to pacification, in offering me the greate iniurie which before hath bene shewed, in his editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But for that he pretendeth his peace to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the general, <hi>by labouring the aduersaries,</hi> as his phrase is: I shal be content to passe ouer my particuler, and to examine peaceably what he saieth, and how he laboreth vs to that effect.</p>
               <p>But here againe at the very first enterance, ther riseth a new stoppe against al vnion or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification with vs, for that he is so singulerly persuaded of the rare light and knowledge of truth which they haue alone among them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, as he dareth to pronounce, <hi>That (to their knovvledge) God neuer yet bestovved the like on others.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pride of beretiques.</note> In which asseueratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that he excepteth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fathers or doctours of the primatiue Church, nor yet th' Apostles them selues, whom we hoped to haue had at least wise for iudges and arbiters in making this peace: what proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie can ther be of vnion or composition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, seing that at the very first word, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his cause better, not only then ours, but also then the case and condition of any other whatsoeuer, since Christes departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth or before? But yet this I wil let passe also, as a vaunt proceeding of an humour peculier to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his stampe. For if you goe to al the petie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes of thes our times, or of any other times that haue bene from the beginning: ech one wil sing the self same song, affirming euery other bodies candel to be out, but only theirs. And if they should not say so, they were not sectes or sectaries, for that they acknowledged
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14541:17"/>
not their true mother, which is pride, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie.</p>
               <p>After this his proud entera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he beginneth, his seely discourse: and for methodes sake, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many diuisions and subdiuisions, euery thing running therin by couples, wherin he is so fertile and abundant, as by methode he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth al memorie. But yet as I may, I wil here recite the cheef pointes therof.</p>
               <p>First then he saith, that ther is great reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why we should ioine with them, and none at al why they should yeld to vs. The first he proueth, for that it becommeth the Church of God to be at <note place="margin">VVhy vve should ioine vvith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes.</note> vnitie in it self. Which reason how far it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his purpose, the reader can consider. The second he declareth, for that the gaine that they should receaue by comming to vs, in his opinion should be very smal, both touching <note place="margin">VVhy they vvil not ioine vvith vs.</note> matters of religion as also of state. For in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion he maketh his accompt, that they should haue nothing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now they haue, except only certaine Sacramentes, Images, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies (which he calleth representations,) al which he esteemeth of smale auaile. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of state likewise, he supposeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities would be few and litle: as namely to be deliuered from the Popes curse, which he saieth, they finde now by experience, not to be so hurtful, as hertofore it was esteemed; which reason (as you know) may as wel serue against Godes curse also, for that it doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies shew forth presently his sensible effect.</p>
               <p>Next after this, he declareth how that by <note place="margin">Their hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to vs.</note> yelding to vs, they should not only not recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue gaine, but also great hurtes, &amp; that in double maner. First in religion, wherin among other things they should be bounde to coafession &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:14541:18"/>
penance, which thinges (saith he) <hi>are burdensome and</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">So much the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and of Gods special ordinance, for that othervvise men vvould neuer haue receaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>abhorring from mans nature.</hi> Then in state, for that by this meane, they should come vnder the gouernement of the Byshope of Rome, which he estemeth intolerable: adding further, that this only reason of state holdeth many of their side, from comming to vs, who otherwise in conscience would-haue no scrupule at al; which is such a confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I meruail that euer my Lord Archebishope would let it passe in print. For howsoeuer this poore Minister to terrifie the common people, deuiseth bugges vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ecclesiastical authoritie of the bishope <note place="margin">Note this.</note> of Rome, if it should be restored in England againe, yet euery man of reason can consider with him self, that the Emperour, the kinges of Spaine, France, Polonia and other Princes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the-same authoritie, doe finde no such inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, as neither our Princes of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euer did, for so many ages together, when they were more potent and glorious then they haue bene since the suppression therof. Wherfore if this reason only doe stay so many from vs, as M. Buny affirmeth, it is very like we shal haue the greater part shortly, when God shal open their vnderstanding in a matter that in it self is so plaine and palpable.</p>
               <p>This being done, he commeth to shew the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities that we should receaue by ioining with them, and thos also (after his maner) he <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs in ioining vvith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> maketh of two sortes. First in religion, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our ciuil state. In religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (saith he) we should first receaue, the free vse of holie seriptures, (as though amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs now ther were no vse therof,) and then also we should be deliuered from the burden of confession and penance, as also from <note place="margin">religion.</note> al vowes of chastitie, pouertie, and obedience.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14541:18"/>
And finally we should so cleaue to Christ alone (saith he) <hi>as vve should abandon al other helpes both in heauen and earth, of Angels, Saintes, other men, as also our ovvne.</hi> Which (saith he) were a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. And then he maketh a solemne prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station in thes wordes. <hi>If any people can be found</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation.</note> 
                  <hi>in the vvorld, that doe more aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>done al other meanes in heauen &amp; earth, then vve doe, then vve must pronounce against our selues, that in this respect they are nerer to this aduantage then vve art.</hi> Vnto which protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion notwithstanding, I doubt M. Buny (if he should be wel vrged) would be very much ashamed to stand and cleaue. For albeit I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that he and his felowes doe very litle in deede wherby to helpe them selues by their workes, yet by this reason they should doe far better, i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing nothing at al. For he that should neuer pray, nor desire other men to pray for him, he that should neuer fast or doe other good deede, but should rather defie the same, and lay al vpon Christes passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he should more abandone al other helpes and meanes both in heauen and earth besides Christ, then many of the best protestantes doe.</p>
               <p>Next in our ciuil state, he saith that we should greatly be bettered by ioyning with <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities by yelding, in our ciuil state.</note> them, being made partakers of the blessednes of England, which is greater (as he saith) at this time, <hi>then euer it vvas since the lande vvas first inhabited.</hi> Wherof he seemeth to alleage two reasons or causes. First, for that Protestantes in <note place="margin">Intellerable lying flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie.</note> thes temporal affaires are alwaies prosperous, for (saith he) how soeuer it goe with others that are not frindes to the ghospel, yet shal the fauorers therof alwaies <note n="*" place="margin">Hovv doe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper at this day in Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and Fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</note> prosper: howsoeuer it be with the residue of the children of Israel, yet the tribe of Iuda shal alwaies florish. The
<pb facs="tcp:14541:19"/>
other places the people are going vnder their burdens, but in England al is mirth and saftie. The second cause of this blessednes of England is, for that England (saith he) is gouerned by a Prince of their owne countrie, one that dealeth mildly with them, one that sendeth not ther pleas abrod to other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sistories, one that drieth them not vp with exactions. And when conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient collections are made, the mony that is exacted of subiectes is not sent (saith he) <note n="*" place="margin">Note this blessednes.</note> out of the realme to the maintenance of forraine powers, but is imployed at home, to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and defence. Wherin notwithstanding it seemeth that this good man, talketh rather by meditation or fiction, then by any great intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he hath in such affaires.</p>
               <p>After al this, he goeth about to remoue certaine graue impedimentes, which he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth <note place="margin">The remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments.</note> doe let many Catholiques from coming vnto their side. For which cause he sheweth, first, that we Catholiques should not leese al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together our credites by making vs Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, or at least wise we should not leeso the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <note place="margin">Of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</note> with them that be good and of their side: or if we did somewhat impare the same, yet patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce were to be vsed, for the Ghospels sake. In like maner he sheweth that the holie sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of heauen would not be angrie with vs (as we seeme to doubt) for leaui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their patronage. Also that keruers, kandlemakers, belcasters, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganistes, and other such like, who might feare <note place="margin">Of hurtes.</note> to want by following the Ghospel, albeit in truth they should leese no smale part of their gaine, yet might the matter be eased, and they comforted otherwise.</p>

               <p>And this last point of the Church (therby <note place="margin">Hovv by N.

               <p>THER remaineth now then (gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) for the ending of this preface, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish the only in a worde or two, what thou hast in this later edition more then in the former, and how thou maist reape the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie that is intended and wished to the therin. First, the whole booke hath bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uewed, and both amplified and bettered in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <note place="margin">1. The vvhole booke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uevved.</note> pointes throughout al the chapters that doe remaine as before. Secondly, the title ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is altered as may appeare in the beginning for that the other booke of Christian exercise, <note place="margin">2. The title altered.</note> since the first edition therof, hath bene set fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orth a parte by it self.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, diuers treatises and chapters haue bene wholy altered, especially in the first <note place="margin">3. Diuers treatisses altered.</note> part, wher, vpon a purpose of greate breuitie which in the beginning was conceaued, (but afterwardes could not be held) many things were shifted ouer, and diuers discourses knit vp with more imperfection then in the second part therof.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, sundrie new chapters and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises haue bene added in this edition. And thes <note place="margin">4. Nevv chapters added and vvhy.</note> partly of mine own liking, imagining that the matter might (perhappes) affect other men as much as it did me; among which I may accompt the chapter of examples of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and some other: Partely also vpon aduertisement of good and reuerend Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique preestes that liue in England, who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:14541:21"/>
by their experience in dealing with mens soules, (as my self also did,) that this long time of schisme and sectes, wherein they heare nothing but weangling and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in matters of courtouersies, (their life in the meane space running at al libertie without discipline, and loding their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with infinite burden of sinne;) hath wroght in mens mindes a certaine contempt and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les insensibilitie in thes affaires, esteeming al things to stand vpon probabilitie only of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to and fro, and so by litle and litle, doth <note place="margin">The gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of faith that come by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</note> bring them also to thinke the same of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion it self, imagining that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, Turkes, Saracens and other enimies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (being worldly wise men) may haue as greate reason perhaps to stande against the same, as thes later learned men of oar owae time haue, to staud in so many rankes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions of sectes against the Catholique faith, and as the old Philosophers pretended to haue against the being of one God him self.</p>
               <p>Thes thinges (I saie) being so; (which is alwaies the effect of diuision and heresie,) thos vertuous and discrete men were of opinion <note place="margin">The reason of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler chapters added of nevv.</note> that it should not be amisse in this second edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to adioyne two chapters of the certaintie of one God, and of our Christian faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Besides this, I was admonished by the writinges of our aduersaries since the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of my first edition, how they misliked two principal pointes in that booke. First, that I speake so much of good workes and so litle of faith: secondly, that I talked so largely of Godes iustice and so breefly of his mercie. In both which pointes, albeit an indifferent man might haue bene satisfied before, and easilie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14541:21"/>
perceaue that the aduersarie doth but picke quarels of calumniation: yet to giue more ful contentement in this matter, euen vnto our enemies: I haue besides that which is spoken els wher, (and namely in the 2. and 4. chapters touching faith,) adioyned also a special chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the two seueral partes of Christian profession, which are beleefe and life. And for the second, I haue framed a whole new cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter in the begiuning of the second part, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled; against dispaire of Godes mercie. Thos were the causes of my large and ample addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this booke.</p>
               <p>And yet was ther besides al thes, one cause more, which also I conceaued by information <note place="margin">An other cause of the amplificatio of tins bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oke.</note> of others. An I this was, that diuers persons (as I was tolde) hauing desire in them selues to reade the former booke, but yet being weake and feartul to be touched so nere in conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, as they imagined this booke would doe; durst neuer intermedle therwith, being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that ther was nothing in the same wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to intertaine them selues, but only such vehement matter of persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as would troble and afflict thom. For remedie of which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie (if it were an inconueniencie,) I haue inserted diuers chapters and discourses of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more plausiole, and of them selues more indifferent, whervvith the reader may solace his minde, at such times as he findeth the same not willing to feele the spurre of more earnest motion to perfection.</p>
               <p>And to the end he may the better be able to serue him self at al times and to al purposes, <note place="margin">The reason of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined in the ende.</note> of whatsoeuer is contayned within this booke; I haue thought good to set downe in the end of al, a short draught or methode for
<pb facs="tcp:14541:22"/>
the particuler vse of euery part and parcel therof; how it may sorue either to prayer or meditation, or els to instruction, exhortation, consolation, or other effect according to the time and place, or to the neede, state, condition &amp; other qualetie, of the person that shal come to reade the booke.</p>
               <p>Now then (good reader and my deare Christian brother) hauing nothing els at this time to admonishe the of; I wil end this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face <note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vvith certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</note> and remit the to the reading of the booke it self that followeth; exhorting the most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly for thine owne soules sake in the tender bowels of our sweet Sauiour IESVS, that thou reade the same with attention, as matter that appertaineth nearest of al other vnto the, and with al to yeld most hartie and humble tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to almightie God, that in his Catholique Church fayleth not from time to time to sende diuers strange and stronge meanes, whereby to stirre vp men to consideration of their estate, and to the gayne of their saluation in the life to come. This (I say) by almightie Gods diuine goodnes and prouidence, is ordinarie in his <note place="margin">True trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion only in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church.</note> spouse the Catholique Church, wher his spirit abideth vntil the worldes end: and it is so in her alone, as it is her proper and peculier posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and neuer trulie to be founde in them, who liue out of her, albeit for a time and in some pointes they maye haue a shewe or shadoe therof. This we see fulfilled in al he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques and sectaries both of old and of our daies, who albeit some times they wil seeme to writ bookes, of <hi>institutions to manners and good life;</hi> yet their doctrine therin being as wilde, as their faith is wandering; they neuer bring any thing to passe, but from worse to worse,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14541:22"/>
wherof the whole world at this daye doth giue experience. The reason of this in general, <note place="margin">VVhy no heretique treateth sincerly of deuotion.</note> may be taken from the nature and spirit of heretiques, described vnto vs for our admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in holie scripture, wherof one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal point is, that they shalbe as S. Paul saith, <hi>Sine pace,</hi> without al rest or peace, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>alvvaies learning and neuer attaining to the knowledge of truth.</hi> They shal bestow al their time in iangling and quarreling, and in the meane space, as S. Peter wel noteth, <hi>they shal vvalke according to their ovvne concupiscences,</hi> albeit <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> they talke neuer so much of <hi>mortification</hi> and of their <hi>quickning spirite,</hi> for which cause he calleth them also, <hi>illusores,</hi> mockers and deceauers; that is, as S. Paul seemeth to interprete the same; <hi>fellovves that vvith seigned vvordes shal make their ovvne gaine, and vvhich hauing a shevv of pietie, shal (in life) deny the force or vertue thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this why heretiques in general can neither teach true pietie and deuotion, not <note place="margin">VVhy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes of alother se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries can not teach true pietie.</note> yet giue example therof in their owne liues. But now if we looke into the particuler sectes that are of this our most vnhappie time; we shal finde a more peculier reason why they in special, much lesse may doc the same. For that in truth the very groundes of their opinions doc resist altreating of such affaires; neither can you vrge almost any one point of true pietie, but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> must impugne some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal article of their doctrine. As may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by that which hath bene declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, concerning the places both of fathere and scriptures thrust out by M. Buny in my former booke, wherof also it were not hard to make diuers most cuident demonstrations in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:14541:23"/>
For, if (for example sake) you exhort men to labour for their owne saluation, as S. Paul <note place="margin">Examples bovv prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes can not teach piesie of life vvithout imparing their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> did, Philip. 2. ver. 12. then you teach them to put confidence in their owne workes, which with protestantes is abhominable. If you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men to suffer in respoct of rewarde, as Christ did, Matth. 5. ver. 12. then fal you flatly vpon the doctrine of merite. If you tel them that heauen is put in their owne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to gaine, as our Sauiour did, Math. 11. ver. 12. then allow ye not only of morite, but also of free wil. If you wish men to liue in feare and trembling in respect of Gods secret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of the vncertaintie of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as S. Paul did, Phi. 2. ver. 12. Hob. 3. ver. 14. and S. Peter. 2. ep. 3. ver. 17. then impeach you the certaintie of protestantes predestination. If you counsail men to make amendes by good workes forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: euil life past, as S. Iohn Baptist did, Luke 3. ver. 8. then you reach sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. If you terrifie them with the feare of hel, and with the declaration of the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the world to come, as Christ did, Math. 8. ver. 12. then with them you offer iniurie to Gods infinit mercie. If you exhort men to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, praying, loue of virginitie, desire of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, chastesing their own bodies, restitutió, penance, and the like, as al the course of holie scripture doth: then runne you into plaine and open papistrie.</p>
               <p>And then (deare Christian brother) what treating can ther be of pietic in life, wher <note place="margin">No effect of verme sollovveth vpon the prating of protestants.</note> none of thes important matters may be once named? Truly (good brother) wel may a man vainlie talke in the aire of a <hi>quick ening spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and mstrification,</hi> as they are wonte in pasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to doe; but nothing in sinceritie-wil euer be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14541:23"/>
brought to passe, where thes weightie pointes be not soundly and seriously handled. For take away the mention of thes thinges forth of holie scripture it self, together with the large and frequent exhortations that therin are made vnto them; and very litle wil remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne about other affaires; the cheefe indeuour of Gods holie spirit being bent (as is manifest) to the setting forthe and inculcating of thes matters, aboue al other, vnto Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Which spirit of almightie God, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church his holie and deare spouse, <note place="margin">The spirit of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church.</note> taking vpon her to imitate; after the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true faith once laide, calleth vpon her children both daily and hourly by infinit wayes and mianes, to remember and put in vre thes pointes of vertuous life, while her enimies in the meane space, doe lye wrangling and cauiling about contradictions in beleefe. And therfore in the Catholique Churche onlie (gentle reader) shalt thou finde the true spirite of teaching, and of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of thes pointes touching pietie: within the lappe and bosome wherof if thou alredy be, thou hast humbly and hartely to thanke God for the same, and with al sollicitous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and care to make thy gaine of such helpes as she offereth the for attayning thy saluation. But if thou finde thy self in other estate (as alas many may at this daye in our poore afflicted countrie;) then I beseeche the tender marcie of our Soueraine Lord and Sauiour, that by readings of this present booke, thou maist the sooner be moued to make thy selfe partaker both of the one and of the other benefite; that is to saie;

               <p>The prophet Daniel had many visions and straunge reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of great and high mysteries: but one amongest all other (&amp;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14541:27"/>
this the least,) of the most dreadful iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of god vppon synners in th' ende of the world. The vision was by the great ryuer Tigris; wher, as diuers angels were <note place="margin">Dan. 10.</note> attending about the bankes; so vpon the water it self, stood one in the likenes of a <note place="margin">A most terrible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel vvheri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he savv Christ.</note> man, of exceeding dreadful maiestie; his apparrel being onlie lynninge, through which his bodie shyned like pretious stone; his eyes like burnig lampes, his face like flashinge lightening, his armes and legges like brase inflamed, and his voice as the shoote of a whole multitude of people that should speake together.</p>
               <p>This was Christ by all interpretation: at whose terrible presence when Daniel fel downe dead, he was erected againe by an Angel and made strong to abyde the vision, and so hauing hearde and seene the most wonderful thinges that i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his booke he recompteth; he was bold to aske a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or two, for better vnderstanding therof, and his first question was, <hi>hovv long it should bee, ere thes most vvo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful things tooke</hi>

               <p>Wherby as by all the rest that hytherto hath ben alleaged, is made apparent, that inconsideration, negligence, carelesse ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and lack of vnderstanding in our owne estates, and in gods iudgementes &amp; proceedinges with iniquitie and synne, hath bene a bane, and a common perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of rechelesse men, from tyme to tyme.</p>
               <p>And if we will turne our eyes to this our age much more shall we see the same <note place="margin">The cause of so much sinne at this day.</note> to be true.

               <p>Truelie, nothing in reason can be lesse tollerable in the presence of gods Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, then wheras he hath published a law vnto vs with so greate charge to beare it in mynde, to ponder in harte, to studdie &amp; <note place="margin">Dent. 6. &amp; 11. Iosue 1. Psal. 118. Eccle. 6. &amp; 22.</note> meditate vpon it both day and night, at home and abrode, at our vpry singe and at our downe lyinge; to make it our cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tió, our discourse, our talke, our excercise our rumination, and our delight: that we should notwithstanding so contemne the same, as to make it no part of our thought, but rather to flee the knoledge therof, as we see most men of the world doe, for not troubling their consciences.</p>
               <p>But the holie Ghost hath layed downe the reason hereof long agoe in these wordes: <hi>cum sit timida nequitia, dat testimoniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

self, is alwayes' fearfull, it gyueth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <note place="margin">The first cause vvhy men slie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> against it self of damnation, when so euer it thinketh of the law of god, or of honestie. So Felix the gouernour of Iurie when S. Paul began to talke of <hi>iustice, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, and gods iudgmentes</hi> before hym; he was wonderfullie a feard, and said to <note place="margin">Act. 24.</note> Paul, <hi>that he should departe for that tyme: and that he vvould call for hym againe aftervvard, vvhen occasion should require.</hi> But he neuer dyd, and what was the cause? For that (as Iosephus testifieth) he was a wicked man <note place="margin">Ioseph. li. 20 antiq. cap. 5.</note> &amp; Drusilla his fayre ladie that was with hym at S. Pauls speeche, was not his true wife, but taken by allurement and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from an other, and therfore it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them both to heare preaching of chastitie.</p>
               <p>This then is one principall cause, whie men of this world will not enter into consideration of their owne estate, and of gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes, least they should reade and see their owne faultes, &amp; beare witnesse against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, of their owne condemnation. Wherunto the scripture annexeth an other cause, not far vnlike to this, which is, that worldlie men doe so dro vne them selues in the cares and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations <note place="margin">The second cause vvhy men slye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of this life, as they leaue in their mindes no place to thinke vpon gods af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, which are the busynes of their owne soules. This expresseth Ieremie the prophet most effectuallie, when hauing made his complaint, that not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nding <note place="margin">Iere. 7.</note> his preaching and crying in the temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14541:29"/>
for long tyme together, where all the people passed by hym and heard hym; yet no man (sayeth he) would enter into consideration, or say with hym self, <hi>vvhat haue I donne?</hi> wherof he addeth presentlie the cause and reason;  <q>
                     <hi>omnes enim conuersi sunt</hi>

               <p>Thes are two of the chyefe causes of inconsideration, I meane, wilful malice, and obstinate occupation in the vanities <note place="margin">The third cause of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of this life.

               <p>IT is a thing both common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie <note place="margin">A common: custome in sciences, to, suppose principles.</note> in scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces &amp; artes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are learned or deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by other; to suppose diuers poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and principles, and to passe them oaer without proofe, as ether knowen before to the learner, or els so manifest, casie, and euident of them selues, as they neede no other proofe, but onely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>So when we take in hand to instruct a <note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie.</note> man in chvualrie, or feates of armes; we doe sappose that he knoweth before (were he neuer so rude,) what a man,

what a horse, what armour, what fighting meaneth: as also that warre is lawful and expedient in diuers cases; that princes of the world may wage the same; that sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diars haue to liue in order and discipline vnder their regiment; 2nd that kinges for this cause doe hold their Generales, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantes, Coronels, Captaines, and other like officers in their bandes, garrisons, campes, and armies.</p>
               <p>In manual artes and occupations like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that diuers thinges must <note place="margin">In handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftes.</note> be presupposed to be foreknowen by the learner, as in husbadrie or agriculture; in buylding, in paynting, and other such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercises, when a man is to be taught or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, it were not conuenient for the teacher, to stand vppon euerie pointe or matter that apperteineth to the same, but must leaue and passe ouer many things as apparent of them selues, or easilie to be discerned of euerie learner by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, sense, reason, or common experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>
               <p>But yet in liberal sciencies and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of learning, is this more apparent, <note place="margin">In liberal sciences.</note> where not onely such commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vulgar poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes are to be presumed, without proofe or discourse; but also certaine propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are to be graunted in the beginning, as <note place="margin">Growndes to be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Th' argument of <hi>Motion,</hi> standeth vppó this general ground in philosophie, that <note place="margin">

                     <hi>vvhat soeuer is moued, is moued, if an other.</hi> Wherin also is obserued, that in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of creatures, there is a subordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th' one to th' other. As for example; thes inferiour bodies vppon earthe, are moued &amp; altered by the ayre and other eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; and the elements are moued by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and motion of the Moone, Sunne, and other heauenlie bodies; thes planets agayne are moued from the highest Orbe or Spheare of all, that is called, <hi>the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Primum mobile.</note> a boue which, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe no further among creatures.</p>
                  <p>Now then asketh the philosopher here whoe moueth this <hi>first moueable?</hi> for if you saye that it moueth it self; it is against our former ground, that <hi>nothing is moued in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but of an other.</hi> And if you saye, that some other thing moueth it; then is the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe, who moueth that other? &amp; so from one to one, vntill you come to some thing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14541:42"/>
that moueth, and is not moued of an other, and that must be God which is aboue all nature.</p>
                  <p>This was the common argument of <note place="margin">Plat. l. 10. de legib. Arist. lib. 8. phys. cap. 5.</note> Plato, and of Aristotle, and of all the best philosophers. And they thought it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration vnauoydable, and it seemeth they were admonished of this argument by consideration of the clocke, whose hammer when it stryketh, sheweth the next wheele wherby it is moued: and that wheele, sheweth an other wheele; <note place="margin">An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the clocke.</note> and so from one to one, vntill ye come to hym that was the first cause of motion to all the wheeles, that is, to the clocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker hymselfe.</p>
                  <p>Aristotle, to king Alexander, vseth this pretie similitude. That as in a Quyar of <note place="margin">Arist. lib. de mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do.</note> singers, when the foreman hath gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first tune or note, there insueth present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a sweete harmonie and consent of all other voyces, both great and small, sharpe <note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and meane: So God in the creation of this worlde, hauing gyuen once the first pushe or motion to the highest heauen, called <hi>primum mobile,</hi> ther insue vppon the same, all other motions of heauens, planetes, elements, and other bodies, in most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile order, concorde, and congruetie, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seruation and gouernement of the whole.

bene spoken of Motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For seing by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that euerie thing brought foorth in nature, hath a peculier Ende appointed, whereto it is directed by the selfe same nature, (as we see the byrde is directed to build her nest by nature, the fox to make his denne, and so the lyke in all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:) the philosopher asketh here, what thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is that, which directeth nature her self, seing eche thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g must haue somewhat to directe it to his Ende? And no answer can be made, but that the Director of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, must be some thing aboue Nature, &amp; that is God hymself. This argument of <note place="margin">Philo. l. de opificio mundi.</note> the <hi>final Ende</hi> is most excellentlie handled, by Philo Iudaeus in his learned treatise <hi>of the vvorkemanshipe of the vvorlde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Cause efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the Philosopher disputeth thus. It is euident by all reason, <note place="margin">The third argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e.</note> in respect of the corruptions, alterations, and perpetual motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of all creatures, that this world had a beginning; and <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch de placitis Philosoph.</note> all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t philosophers that euer were, haue agreed theruppon, except Aristotle for a tyme, who held a fantasie, that the world had no beginning, but was from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, albeit at last in his old age, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the contrarie, in his booke to king <note place="margin">Arist. l. 8. phys. &amp; l. de Gen. &amp; corrup. Arist. l. de mundo &amp; vide plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. l. de mundo.</note> Alexander.</p>
                  <p>This then being so, that this world had 3 begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, it must needes follow also, that it had an Efficient cause. Now then is the question, whoe is that Efficient cause that made the world? if you say, that it made it self; it is absurde: for how could it haue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14541:43"/>
power to make it self, before it self was, and before it had any beeing at all? if you say, that some thing within the world made the worlde: that is, that some one parte of the world, made the whole: this is more absurde, for it is, as if a man should say, that the fingar (and this before it was a fingar, or parte of the bodie,) did make the whole bodie.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore we must confesse by force of this argument, that a greater and more excellent thing, then is the whole world putt together, or then any parte therof, made the world, and was the Cause effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of the frame that we see; and this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be nothing els but God that is aboue the world. So that hereby we see, how many wayes the Natural philosopher is fraught with arguments, to proue there is a God, &amp; that by reason onlie, without all light or assistance of faith.</p>

                  <p>And first of all he said, that it could not <note place="margin">The first argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</note> stande with any possibilitie in his scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that <hi>eus finitum,</hi> a thing finite, or closed within bosides &amp; limites, (as this world &amp; euerie creature therin is,) could be, but from some Maker or Creator. For (sayeth he,) the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that in it self is not infinite,

hath his boundes and limmites, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>telie ther must be some thing, that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed thes bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and limites. And seing i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this world there is no creature so great, which hath not boundes and limites: we must of necessitic imagine some infinite supreme Creator or Maker, that limited thes creatures, euen as we see, that the potter at his pleasure, gyueth bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des and limites to the pot that he frameth.</p>
                  <p>This argument the Metaphisique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth by a ruled principle in his scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, <note place="margin">Ut maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysique.</note> 
                     <hi>that euerie thing vvhich is by participation, must be reduced and referred to some other thing, that is not by participation, but of it self.</hi> And he calleth <hi>a thing by participation,</hi> which is <note place="margin">Arist. li. 2.

                  <p>Now then (sayeth the Metaphisique) we see by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that all the creatures and partes of this worlde, are <hi>things by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation onlie,</hi> for that they are finite in nature, and haue limitations in all their

                  <p>By this concludeth the Metaphisique, that as among the creatures, we finde this most excellente order and connexion of thinges, wherby one bringeth furth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and euerie maltitude is referred to his vnitie: so much more in al reason, must the whole frame of creatures conteined in this world (wherein there are so manie millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of multitudes with their vnities,) be referred to one most simple &amp; abstract vnitie, that gaue beginning to them all, and this is God.</p>

                  <p>We see the heauens doe moue aboute continuallie without ceasing, and this not to serue them selues, but inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures lesse excellent then them selues.

And albeit I haue said some what of mans ende before; yet that which in this place I am to adde, is more proper and peculier to Moral philosophie. For as other sciences may and doe consider the final endes of other creatures, which are diuers, &amp; yet all concurre for the seruice of man: so this science of Moral philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie doth properlie consider the final ende of man hym self, calling it, <hi>summum bonum,</hi> his greatest and highest happines, wherunto he was created, and wherunto he tendeth in this life, and wherin he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth and reposeth without further Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or appetit, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath obteined it.</p>
                  <p>For better vnderstanding wherof, it is <note place="margin">Euerie thing in this vvorld hath a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural desire to his ende.</note> to be considered, that euerie thing in this world hath some particuler ende, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an appetite and desire ingraffed by nature to that ende; which desire cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, when the ende is obteined. As for example: a stone hath a natural appetite to goe downwarde to the Centre or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the earth, and so it resteth in no place, (except by violence it be stayed,) vntill it come thyther. On the countrary, fyar, reposeth no where (excepte it be restrained) vntill it mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te aboue the ayer to his peculier &amp; natural place of abode, wher, of it selfe it resteth. And so in other thinges that are without sense, their is a certaine natural appetite &amp; desire to their ende, which ende beig once obteined, that desire and appetite of it selfe reposeth.</p>
                  <p>In beastes likewise we behold, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14541:52"/>
they haue a desire to fill their bellies, and to satisfie their other senses, which being satisfied, they remaine contented, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire nothing els, vntill the same appetite of sense wante his obiect againe. Wherby we perceaue, that sensualitie or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">The feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of beastes.</note> of the senses, is the final ende desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of beastes, and their verie <hi>summum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or supreme felicitie.</p>
                  <p>But in man, albeit for maintenaunce of the bodie, there be this appetite also to satisfie his senses, according to the lower portion of his mynde, that is called <hi>sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue;</hi> yet according to th' other higher parte of his mynde, whose name is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the reasonable parte, (which is the onlie parte in deede, that is peculier to man, and distinguisheth hym from vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable beastes;) he hath an appetite of some more highe and excellent obiect, then is the contentation of thes senses; for that by experience we see and feele, that often times, when the senses be all satisfied, yet is the mynde not quiet, which argueth, that sensualitie, or sensual delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is not our <hi>summum bonum,</hi> wherin our mynde must rest and enioy here feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
                  <p>Here vppon haue Philosophers &amp; wise men fallen to dispute in all ages, what should be the final felicitie, and <hi>summum bonum</hi> of mankynde?

founde out, cleare it is, that all other thinges and actions are to be referred to th obteining of this ende &amp; happines. And therfore aboute this pointe, there hath bene maruelous contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and fight <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, about the felicitie of man.</note> among Philosophers; the Stoikes refuting the Epicures, and the Peripateticues resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againe the Stoikes, and the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niques, (who went nearest the truthe) impugning and refuting both th' one &amp; th' other; and this dissentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went so sarre foorth, th' one parte assigning one thing, and th' other an other, to be this felicitie, or <hi>summum bonum;</hi> that Marcus Varro a most learned Roman. gathered two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fowerskore and eight diferent opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions <note place="margin">Aug. l. 19. de ciuit. cap. 1.</note> (as S.

                  <p>And finallie when all was said and examined, Plato founde, that nothing which might be named or immagined in this life, could be the felicitie or <hi>summum bonum,</hi> of man, for that it could not satisfie the desire of our mynde. And therfore he pronounced this general sentence. <hi>It is</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Plato, in Phadon.</note> 
                     <hi>impossible that men should synde their felicitie, or (summum bonum) in this life, seeke vvhat vvay they vvill, but in the next life vvithout all doubt it must be founde.</hi> The reason of which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and determination was, for that Plato was able to refute any thing, that th' other Philosophers did or could name to be our felicitie &amp; final ende in this life, were it Riches, Honours, Pleasures, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral vertues, or the like, which eche secte
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14541:53"/>
did assigne.</p>
                  <p>As for example; he proued that riches <note place="margin">Hovv no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this lyfe can be our felicitie.</note> could not be our <hi>sammum bonum</hi> or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, for that they are vncertaine, vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, vaine, variable, and thinges that bring with them more danger ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes and trouble of mynde, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth pouertie. Honours he refelled, for that besides their vanitie, they depende of the mouth and myndes of other men, who are changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inconstante. Pleasures of the body and voluptuousnes, for that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to vs with beastes, &amp; alwayes haue annexed their sting, and discontentation, when they are paste. Moral vertues, for that they consist in a certaine perpetual fight and warre with our owne passions, which neuer gyue vs rest or repose in this life. Finally, whether so euer we turne our selues, or what soeuer we laye our handes vpon, in this life, to make it our felicitie, or <hi>summum bonum;</hi> it faileth vs (sayeth Plato,) nether gyueth it any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contentation to our mynde; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this felicitie is to be sought and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre arriueth Moral philosophie <note place="margin">Hovvfarre Moral phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie reacheth in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mans felicitie.</note> by reason, to proue, that mans felicitie or final ende, can not be in any thing of this life or world.

The since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the vvriters.</note> scriptures, is, the consideration of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler men that wrote them; who were such, as in reason can not be suspected of decept or falshod. For as I haue said, the Stories of the Byble, were writen from tyme to tyme by publique authoritie, and by the testimony of all men that saw and knew the thinges that are rehersed. The bookes of propheties, were endited by the prophetes them selues, who were plaine, simple, and sincere me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, authorized from God by continual miracles, and yet so scrupulous and timerous of their owne speeches, as they durst say nothing, but only, <hi>our Lord saith this; the God of Hostes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth

that. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when they had preached and reade their writinges in the hearinge of all the people; they protested, that it was not mans worde, but gods, and that for such they left it in the publique treasurie of their Nation, vntill by tracte of tyme, th' euent and fulfilling of their propheties should proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true (as alwayes it did,) <note place="margin">The lyues &amp; deathes of the prophetes.</note> and their owne both liues and deathes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they meant no falshode; their liues being such, as were not subiect to the corruption, pride, vanitie, or ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this life, (as other prophane and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then writers were,) and their deathes for the most parte, offered vp in holie martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for defence of that truthe whiche they had preached &amp; writen: as appeareth <note n="*" place="margin">See Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum.</note> in Esay, that was sawed in peeces by ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Manasles: in Ieremie, that was stoned to death by the common people: in Ezechiel, that was slayne by the capitaine of the Iewes at Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: in Amos, whose braines were beaten oute by Amasias the wicked &amp; idolitrous priaest in Bethel: in Micheas, whose necke was broken by prince Ioam sonne to kinge Achab: in Zacharie, that was slaine at th' Aulter, and the lyke.</p>
                  <p>And this for the Prophetes of later ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes <note place="margin">A peculier co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of Moises, first vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Bible.</note> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes.

But he dealt plainelie and simplie in this behalfe; he wrote the thinges of <note place="margin">The plaine and sincere proceeding of Moyses.</note> his owne doinges, which euerie man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, did know to be true; and of Gods speeches and communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to hym self, he wrote so much as he was commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wherof both God, and his conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did beare hym witnesse.

                  <p>
                     <hi>THIS HE</hi> confirmeth yet further by a fowerth reason, which is, the consent <note place="margin">THE. 4. proofe of scripturs.

For as among prophane writers of worldlie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, it is a common fashion for hym that followeth, to reprehende the former, and to hunte after praise by his ancetours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: so in thes writers of the Bible, it is a most certaine argument that all were guyded by one spirite from God, that in continuance of so manie ages &amp; thousand yeares, no one yet euer impugned th' other, but alwayes the later supposing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the former for true, doth build therupon, as vpon a sure fondatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>
                     <hi>CONSIDER</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> first (sayeth he,) the subiecte or argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which the scriptures <note place="margin">THE. 5. proof of scripture.

                     <hi>NEXT AFTER</hi> the argument and Ende of the scriptures, the Iew willeth vs to consider the peculier stile and phrase <note place="margin">THE. 6. proof of scripturs.

                  <p>Besides this, there goeth in the same simplicitie, a straunge Maiestie and graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">The gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie and Maiestie of speech i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the scriptures.</note> of speech, declaring sufficientlie from how greate and potent a prince it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth.

                  <p>This am I sure, that Iosephus the Iew, <note place="margin">Faluins. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus de Antiq. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daic. See S.

                  <p>Aristaeus that learned Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tile, of whom <note place="margin">Tvvo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Aristaeus.</note> we haue made mention before, who was in special fauour with Ptolomie the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond greate Monarche of Egipt, (aboute 300 yeares before Christes natiuitie,) and a chief doer in procuring the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hebrue.

The first was, of Theopompus an eloquent Historiographer, who hauing <note place="margin">Theopo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pus.</note> translated certaine thinges out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and endeuouring to adorne the same with vaine colours of eloquence; could not perfourme his desire, but was stroke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a suddain maze and gyddines in the head, and was warned in his sleepe, not to proceede further in that worke after that sorte, for that such manner of style, was to base for so high matters, as the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conteined.</p>
                  <p>The other example was of one Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dectes, a writer of tragaedies, who tolde <note place="margin">Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes.</note> Aristaeus, that once he atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted to bring certaine matters out of the Iewes Bible; into a pagan tragedie, and that theruppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was presentlie strike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; wherwith, he being asto nished, and falling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for that he had donne, and decis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the enterprise, (as also Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pompus

did:) they were both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored againe to their healthes. And thus much did thes three Paganes confesse, of the authoritie, diuinitie, and peculier sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred stile of our scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BVT NOVV</hi> further it insueth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that after the subiect and phrase, we <note place="margin">THE. 7. proofe of scripturs. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes.</note> should consider a litle the contentes of thes scriptures, whiche will perhappes, more clearlie direct vs to the vewe of their authour, then any thing els that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath bene said. And for our present purpose, I will note onlie two special thinges conteined in the Bible. The first <note place="margin">Highe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</note> st albe certaine high &amp; hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrines, which are aboue the reach and capacitie of humane reason, and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie, could neuer fall into mans braine to inuent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for example; that all this wonderful frame of the world, was created of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, where as philosophie saith, <hi>that of Nothing, nothing can be made:</hi> that Angels, being created spirites, were damned eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie for their sinnes: that Adam, by diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in Paradise, drew all his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie into th' obligation of that his synne; and that, the womas seed should deliuer vs from the same: That God is one in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and three in persons: that the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of thes persons, beig God, should become man and die vpon a Crosse for mankinde: that after hym, the way to all felicitie &amp; honour, should be by contempt, suffering, and dishonour. Thes doctrines (I say) and many more, conteined in the Bible, being
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14541:64"/>
thinges aboue mans capacitie to deuise, and nothing agreinge with humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: most euidentlie doe declare, that God was th' authour &amp; enditer of the scripturs, for that by hym onlie, and from no other, thes highe and secret mysteries, could be reueiled.</p>
                  <p>The second thing conteined in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleties in scripture declare their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. <hi>Esa.</hi> 41. 23.</note> that could not proceede but from God alone, are certaine propheties or fortellinges of thinges to come. Wherin God hymself prouoketh th' Idoles of the Gentiles, to make experience of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, in thes wordes: <hi>Declare vnto vs vvhat shall insue hereafter, &amp; thereby vve shall knovv that you are Godes in deed.</hi> Which is to be vnderstoode; if they could fortell parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerlie &amp; plainlie, what was to come, in thinges meerlie contingent or depending of mans will: they should therby declare their power to be diuine.</p>
                  <p>For albeit thes Idoles of Gentiles, as <note place="margin">Hovv the deuils, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may fortell thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs to come.</note> Apollo and other that gaue foorth Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, (which were nothing els in deed, but certaine wicked spirites that tooke vpon them these names,) did some times happen vpon the truth, and fortel thinges to come; as also some Astrologers, South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers, and Magitians doe, ether by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight in the starres &amp; other elementes, or by th' assistance of thes wicked spirites and deuils: yet are the thinges which they pronosticate, ether natural and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent; &amp; so may be forseene &amp; fortolde in their causes; (as raine, heate, colde,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14541:65"/>
wi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, &amp; the like:) or els, if they be meere accidental; thes predictions of theirs are only coniectures, and so, most incertaine and subiecte to errours.</p>
                  <p>This testifieth Porphyrie the greate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of Paganisme, in a special booke of <note place="margin">Th' opinion of a healthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheties of his Godes.</note> th' answers of his Godes, wherin he swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he hath gathered trulie without addition or detraction, the Oracles that were most famous before his tyme, with the false and vncertaine euent therof; In consideration of which euent, he setteth downe his iudgment of their power in predictions, after this manner. <hi>The Godes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Porphy. li. de resp. &amp; oracu.</note> 
                     <hi>doe fortell some naturall thinges to come, for that they doe obserue the order and coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their natural causes: But of thinges that are continge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or doe depend of mans vvill, they haue but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures only, in that by their subtilitie and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritic, they preuent vs. But yet they often tymes doe lye, and deceaue vs in both kyndes: for that, as natural thinges are variable; so mans vvill is much more mutable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre Porphyrie of the propheties of his Godes, whereunto agreeth an other heathen of greate credit, among the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, named Oenomaus, who for that he had bene much delighted with Oracles, &amp; <note place="margin">Oenomaus de falsitate oraculoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; de arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficibus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leficiis.</note> more deceaued: wrote a special booke in th' ende, of their falshod and lies; and yet sheweth, that in manie thinges wherin they deceiued, it was not easie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince them of ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falshod, for that they would inuolue their answers (of purpose,) with such obscurities, generalities, equiuo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14541:65"/>
and doubtefulnes; as alwayes they would leaue them selues a corner wherin to saue their credites, when th' euent should proue false. As for example, when Craesus that famous &amp; riche Monarche of <note place="margin">Deceptful. Oracles.</note> Lidia, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sulted with Apollo, whether he should make warre against the Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; therby obtaine their Empire or no? Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, desirous of bloodshed, (as all wicked spirites are;) gaue his oracle in thes wordes, for deceauing of Craesus. <hi>If Crae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus vvithout feare, shal passe ouer Halys;</hi> (this <note place="margin">Euseb. li. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>This then is th' imbecilitie of both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <note place="margin">The circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In which kinde, not withstanding, seing that the scriptures haue manie and almost infinite propheties, fort old manie yeares, (&amp; some tymes ages) before they came to passe; sett downe in plaine, particuler, and resolut speech; at such tymes as there was nether cause to coniecture them, nonpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie that euer they should be true; deliuered by simple and vnlearned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that could forsee nothing by skill or arte; and yet that all thes by their euentes haue proued most true, and neuer anie one iote in the same haue fayled: this (I say)
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14541:66"/>
alone, doth conuince most apparentlie, (all proofes and reasons, and other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes laid a syde,) that thes scriptures are of God and of his eternal and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirite. And therfore of thes prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will I alleage in this place, some few examples.</p>
                  <p>Abraham the first father and special Patriarche of the Iewes, had manie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheties <note place="margin">1. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetie to Abraham for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie. <hi>Gen. 12. 13. 15. 17. 18.</hi> &amp;c.</note> and predictions made vnto hym, as of his issue, when he had yet none, nor euer lyke to haue; of his inheritinge the land of Canaan, and the lyke. But this which followeth, is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull, of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities discent into Egipt; of their tyme of seruitude and manner of deliuerauce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; (the same being fortolde more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fower hundreth yeares before it was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;) &amp; at that tyme whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no likelihode therof i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world appeared. The wordes are thes. <hi>Knovv thou before hande, that thy issue shal be a straunger in a forraine lande, and they</hi>

                     <hi>shal subiect them to seruitude, and shall asstict them for fovver hundred yeares; but yet I vvill iudge the nation vnto vvhome they haue bene slaues, and ester that, they shal departe thence vvith greate riches.</hi> This is the prophetie; and how exactelie it was afterwarde fulfilled, by the ruine of the Egytians, and deliuerance of the Israelites, euen at that <note place="margin">Exod. 12. Gal. 3.</note> tyme which is here appointed: not onelie the booke of Exodus doth declare, wher the whole storie is layed downe at large: but also the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of <note n="*" place="margin">Porphv. li. 4. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Chri. Appio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. l. 4. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Iudaeos.</note> heathen wryters, as before hath bene touched. And it is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14541:66"/>
speciallie to be noted, that this prophetie was so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and well knowen amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all Iewes, from Abrahams tyme downe vnto Moyses, and so deliuered by tradition fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fathers to their children: as it was the onelie comfort and staye, not onlie of all that people in their seruitude of Egypt: but also of Moyses and others, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the people afterwardes, for fortie yeares together in the deserte, &amp; was the onelie meane in deede, wherby to pacifie them in their distresses and miseries; and therfore Moyses in euerie exhortation almost, maketh mention of this promisse and prophetie, as of a thing well knowen vnto them all, and not deuised or inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by hym selfe or anie other.</p>
                  <p>Longe after this, Iacob, that was Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <note place="margin">2. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetie for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Iuda.</note> nepheue, being in Egipt, &amp; making his testament; said of his sowerth sonne Iuda. <hi>Iuda, thie brothers shal praise thee, and the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thie father, shal bovve vnto the &amp;c. the Scepter shal not be taken from Iuda, vntil he come, that is to be sent, and he shal be the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nations.</hi> Which later parte of the <note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> prophetie, all Hebrewes doe expounde that it was meant of the comming of Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, which was fulfilled almost two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares after, at the coming of Christ, as shalbe shewed in an other special chapter. For at that tyme, kinge Herod, 2 strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, putt owt quite the line of Iuda, <note place="margin">Ioseph. de antiq. li. 14.</note> from the gouernment of Iurie. But for the first parte, touching Iudas scepter; it is wonderfull to consider the circumstances
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14541:67"/>
of this prophetie.</p>
                  <p>For first, when it was spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vttered by Iacob, there was no probabilitie of anie Scepter at all, to be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes, for that the Israelites or so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of Iacob at that daye, were poore and few in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, and neuer like to be a distincte nation of themselues, or to depart foorth of Egypt againe. And secondlie, if anie such thinge should come to passe, as they might be a people, and haue a scepter or gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their owne: yet was it not lyklie, that Iuda and his posteritie should possesse the same, for that he had three elder brothers, to witt, Ruben, Simeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Leuie, who in <note place="margin">Vnlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hodes of this prophetie.</note> all likelihode, were to goe before hym. And thirdlie, when Moyses recorded and putt in wryting this prophetie, (whiche was diuers hundreth yeares after Iacob had spoken it,) it was muche lesse likelie that euer it should be true, for that Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, then present in gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was of the tribe of Leuie, &amp; Iosue designed by Godfor his successour, was of the tribe of Ephrai, <note place="margin">Exod. 2. Iosue. 19.</note> and not of Iuda. Which maketh greatelie for the certaintie of this record. For that it is most apparent, that Moyses would neuer haue putt suche a prophetie in writing, to the disgrace of his owne tribe, and to the preiudice and offence of Rube<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Simeon, Ephraim, and other tribes; nether would they euer haue suffred such a dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but that it was euident to them by tradition, that their Grandsire Iacob had spoken it, albeit then presentelie, there
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14541:67"/>
was no greate likelihode, that euer after, it should come to be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>And this was for the tyme of Moyses: but yet consider further, that from Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to Samuel, (that was last of all the Iudges,) there passed fower hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth years more, &amp; yet was there no appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillinge <note place="margin">1. Reg. 1. &amp; 8.</note> this prophetie in Israel; for that the tribe of Iuda was not established in gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. At lengthe they came to haue kinges to rule, &amp; then was there chosen <note place="margin">1. Reg. 9.</note> one Saul to that place, not of the tribe of Iuda, but of Beniamin, &amp; he indued with diuers children to succede hym. And who would then haue thought that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetie could euer haue bene fulfilled? but yet for that it was gods worde, it must needes take place; and therfore when no man thought therof, there was a <note n="*" place="margin">Dauid.</note> poore shepheard chosen owt of the tribe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, to be kinge, &amp; the regiment &amp; scepter so established in his posteritie; that albeit <note place="margin">1. Reg. 16.</note> manie of his descendentes offended God more greeuouslie, then euer Saul did, who was putt out before: and albeit ten tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes <note place="margin">3. Reg. 12. 2. Para. 11</note> at once brake from Iuda, and neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to obedience againe, but conspired with the Gentiles and other enimies of <note place="margin">The vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards the house of Iuda.</note> euerie syde, to extinguishe the said king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and regiment of Iuda: yet for the fulfilling of this prophetie, the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Iuda held owt still, for more then a thowsand and two hundred yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill Herodes tyme as I haue said. Which is more, then anie one familie in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14541:68"/>
the world besides, can shew for his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie <note place="margin">Euseb. in Chron.</note> or continuance in gouernment.</p>
                  <p>The same Iacob when he came to blesse his litle nepheues Manasses, and Ephraim, <note place="margin">3. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetie for the greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Ephraim aboue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses.</note> that were Iosephs children; though hym self were now dimme of sight, and could not well discerne them, yet dyd he putt his right hande vpon the head of the you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and his left hand vpon the elder, and that of purpose, as it proued afterwarde. For when Ioseph their father misliked the placing of their Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d-fathers ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, &amp; would haue remoued the right hande fró <note place="margin">Gen. 48.</note> Ephraim, and haue placed it vpon the head of Manasses, that was the elder: Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob would not suffer hym, but answered. <hi>I knovv my Jonne, I knovv, that Manasses is the elder; &amp; be shall be multiplied into manie people; but yet his yonger brother shalbe greater then be.</hi> Which afterward was fulfilled, for that Ephraim was alwayes the greater and <note place="margin">Iosue 16. &amp; 17.</note> stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger tribe, and in fine, became the head of the kyngdome of Israel, or of the ten tribes, wherof there was no suspition or <note place="margin">Eccle. 47. Esay. 7. &amp; 28. Icrem. 31. Ezec. 37. Oze. 5.</note> likelihode, when Iacob spake this, or when Moyses recorded it. And how then came Iacob to forsee this, so manie hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares before? as also to forsee and fortell the particuler places of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens habitations, in the lande of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse? as Zabulon at the sea side; Aser in <note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> the fertile pastures; and other the like, <note place="margin">Iosue. 14.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14541:68"/>
lottes so longe after should appointe, but onelie from God, who gouerned their lottes?</p>
                  <p>The like might be asked concerninge <note place="margin">4. <hi>The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of Moyses.</hi> Nu. n. 34. 35. 36.

By the former considerations we haue learned, that as among other creatures,

nothing made it self; so nothig was made for it self, nor to serue it self. The heauens (we see) doe serue th' ayer, th' ayer ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth th' earth, th' earth serueth beastes, the beastes serue man; and then is the questió, whom ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made to serue? For in hym also, holdeth the former reason, that seig he was not made by hym self: it is not likelie that he was made to serue hym selfe</p>
               <p>If we consult with the scripture herein; we finde a general sentence layed downe without exception; <hi>Vniuersa propter se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metipsum</hi>

For thes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations (no doubt) shall stirre hym vp to attende to that, for which he came, &amp; not to imploy his tyme in impertinent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. The lyke would I counsail a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to putt in vre, concerning the case proposed, and to demande of hymself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene God and his conscience, why, and wherfore, and to what endo, he was created &amp; sent hythe: into this worlde? what to doe? wherin to bestowe his dayes? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And then shal he fynde, that for no other cause, matter, or ende, but onlie to serue God in this life, and by that seruice, to gaine heauen and saluation in the lyfe to come. This was the condition of our <note place="margin">Gen. 14: Deut.</note> creation, as Moyses well expresseth; and this was the consideration of our redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, fortolde by Zacharie, before we were yet redeemed; <hi>that vve being deliuered</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Of this consideration doe ensue two <note place="margin">The. 1. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence upon due consideration, of our ende.</note> consequentes to be obserued. Whereof
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14541:81"/>
the first is, that seinge our ende and final cause of being in this worlde, is to serue God, and therby to worke our owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: whatsoeuer thinge we doe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe our tyme in, which ether is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or impertinent, or not profitable to this ende, (though it were to gaine king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,) it is vanitie and lost labour, that will turne vs in tyme to griefe and repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (if we change not our course,) for that it is not the matter for which we came i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to this life, nor wherof we shalbe demanded an accompt, except it be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue iudgement and punishement for the same.</p>
               <p>Secondlie it followeth of the same consideration, that seing our onli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e busines <note place="margin">The 2. conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> and affaire in this worlde, is to serue our Maker, and saue our owne soules; and, that all other earthelie creatures are put here to serue our vses to that onlie ende: we should for our partes be indifferent to all thes creatures, as to riches or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie; to health or sicknes; to honour or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempte; to lytle learning or much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and we should desire onlie so much or litle of either of them as were best for vs to th' attainement of our said ende and Butte pretended; that is, to tho seruice of God &amp; the weale of our soules. For who so euer desireth, seekthe, loueth, or vseth thes creatures, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for this: ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nneth from his ende for which he came hyther.</p>
               <p>By this then, may a careful Christian <note place="margin">Hovv eche <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14541:81"/>
with God, and make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture whether he be in the right waye, or no. For if he attende onlie or principallie to this ende, for which he was set hyther; if his cares, cogitations, studdies, endeuours, labours, talke, conuersation, and other his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, doe runne vpon this matter, and that he careth no more for other creatures, as honours, riches, learnig, and the lyke, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">A right course.</note> they are necessarie vnto hym for this ende that he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth: If his dayes &amp; life be spent in this studdie of the seruice of God, and procuring his owne saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in carefulnes, feare, and trembling, as th' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle aduiseth hym: then is he (doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teles) <note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> a most happie and blessed man, and shall at length attaine to the kingedome which he expecteth.</p>
               <p>But if he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finde hym self in a contrarie <note place="margin">A vvrong and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous course.</note> case and course; that is, not to attende in deede to this matter for which onlie he was sent hyther; nor to haue in his hart &amp; studie this seruice of God and gayning heauen, but rather some other vanitie of the world, as promotion, wealth, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, sumptuous apparrel, gorgeous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges, beautie, fauour of princes, or anie other thing els, that apparteineth not vnto this ende: if he spend his tyme about thes trifles, hauing his cares and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his talke and delight, more in thes thinges, then about th' other greate busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of gayning Gods eternal kingdome, for which he was made and placed in this wold: Then is he (I assure hym) in a peri
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14541:82"/>
lous waye, leading directelie to perditió, except he alter and change his course. For, most certaine it is, that who so euer shal not attende vnto the seruice he came for; shal neuer attaine therewarde assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and promissed to that seruice.</p>
               <p>And for that, the most parte of all this worlde (not onlie of infidels but also <note place="margin">The reason vvhie so fevv are saued.</note> Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,) doe ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne amisse in this pointe, and doe not take care of that affaire and busines, for which alone they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and placed heere: hence it is, that Christe and his holie Sainctes, bothe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after his appearance in fleshe, <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 20 &amp; 22. Lut. 13.</note> haue spoken so hardlie and seuerelie, of the verie simal number that shalbe saued (euen among Christians,) and haue vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certaine speeches, which seeme verie rigourous to fleshe and blood, (&amp; to such as are most touched therin) scarse credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, albeit they must be fulfilled. As among other thinges, that a louer of this <note place="margin">Iacob. 4. Mat. 19. Marc. 10.</note> worlde can not be saued; that riche men doe enter as hardlie into heauen, as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel through a Needles eye, and the like; The reason of which maner of speeches doth stande in this, that a riche man or worldling, attending with all his indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to heape riches (as the fashion is,) can not attende, (nor euer doth,) to that for which he came into this world, and consequentelie, can neuer attaine heauen, except God worke a miracle, and therby doe cause hym to spende oute his riches to the benefyte of his soule, (as some
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14541:82"/>
tymes he doth,) and so doe lessen the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel in suche sorte, as he may passe the Needles eye. Wherof we haue a verie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <note place="margin">Luc. 19.</note> example in the Gospel, of Zachaeus, who beinge a riche man did presentelie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th' entering of Christ into his house, (and muche more as appeareth into his harte,) resolue hym self, to change his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">A perfect example of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion.</note> course touchinge riches, and at one blowe to begynne withall, gaue awaye halfe of all he possessed to the poore; and for the rest, made proclamation, that who soeuer had receaued anie wrong at his handes, (as comonlie manie doe by them that are riche,) he should come and receyue fower tymes so much amendes. By which almes and restitution, he deliuered hym self from the Camels gibbe or bunch on his backe, that letted his passage through the Needles eye. And this extraor dinarie fauour and grace he receyued, by the fortunate presence of his most blessed and bountiful Guest, who had signified before in an other place, that hym self was able, so to drawe the Camel, as he should passe the Needles eye; for that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges impossible to man, were possible to <note place="margin">Mat. 19.

               <p>But to leaue this, and to goe forwarde in our former purpose; no mauaile it is, if in the world abrode, so fewe be saued, seing that of thousandes, skarse one doth accompt of that busines, whiche of all other, is the chiefe and principall.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14541:84"/>
Euen so is it with men of this world, if we belieue S. Paul, who affirmeth, that <note place="margin">8.

Most men doe runne awrie, and doe followe fethers vp and downe in th' ayer; most men doe pursue vanities, and doe wearie them selues oute in the pursute therof, vntill they can nether runne, nor goe, nor moue their limmes anie further; and then for the most parte it is to late to amende their follie. Will you heare the lamentations of suche vnfortunate men? These are their owne wordes recorded by scripture. <q>We are wearied out in the waye of iniquitie and perdition; and the waye <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>This is the lamentable complainte of such men, as ranne awrie and followed a wronge course in their actions of this life. Thes are they, who pursued riches, honour, pompe, and like vanities, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the busines for which they were sent. Thes are they, who were esteemed happie men in this world, and thought to

               <p>Now then would I demaunde of thes two so fortunate men, who laying a side all care of God and religion, did follow the prefermentes of this world so freshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and obtained the same so luckelie: how they liked of this their course and rase in th' ende?

The difference betwene a wise ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and a foole, is, that th' one prouideth for a mischiefe while tyme serueth, &amp; th' other would doe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is to late.

and other necessaries, to repaire that is past. Hytherto thou hast time to refourme thy course, if thou please, which is no small benefite, if all were knowen.

               <p>By this then it is most manifest, that not onlie now to vs that be Christians, but at all other tymes from the begining of the world, &amp; to all other persons and people what so euer, that desired to saue their soules, it was necessarie to beleeue and loue Christ, and to professe in harte his religion.

               <p>For albeit, as th' Apostle S.

For that inwardlie, he testifieth <note place="margin">The diuers testimonies from God of the thinges that vve belieue.</note> the truth of such thinges as we beleeue, by gyuing vs light and vnderstandinge, with internal ioye and consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing them.

conueniences, probabilites, and <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of credibilitis,</hi> (as Diuines doe call them:) that albeit the verie pointe of that which is belieued, remaine still with some obscuritie, (to th' ende there may be place for our will and merite:) yet are there so many circumstances of likelihodes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a man to the beliefe therof; 'as in all reason it may seeme against reason to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or mistrust them.</p>
               <p>This shall easelie appeare by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise following of Christ and Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and of the foundations of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which shalbe confirmed by so manie pregnant reasons, and most manifest cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cústáces of euidét probabilitie: as I doubt not, but the zelous Christiá shall take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedig cófort therin, &amp; esteeme hymself happie, to haue a lottei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that faith &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wher he shall see and feele so much reason, proofe, and conueniencie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre and shew it self, for his satisfaction.</p>
               <p>And to this effect, it shalbe of no meane moment, that I haue proued before, the certaintie, diuinitie, and infallible truth of the Iewes scriptures, or old testament; which writinges we hauing receaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Nation, that doth (as it were) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse enimitie against vs; &amp; the same being writen so many ages before the name of Christianitie was knowen in the world: it can not bee but of singuler authoritie, what so euer shalbe alleaged out of those recordes for our purpose. And therfore as before, in prouing our first principle, <hi>that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14541:94"/>
there is a God,</hi> we vsed onlie the testimonie of such witnesses, as could not be partial: <note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted vvitnesses to be allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geà in this chapter.</note> so muche more in this confirmation of Christian religion, shall we stande onlie, ether vpon the confessions of such as are our enimies; or vpon the recordes of others, who must needes be indifferent in the cause, for that they liued before ether cause or controuersie in Christianitie was knowen or called in question.</p>
               <p>My whole purpose shal be then, to make manifest in this chapter, that Iesus Christ <note place="margin">The drifte of this chapter.</note> was the Saueour and Redeemer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, fore-promissed and expected from the beginning of the world; that he was the sonne of God, and God him self; and consequentelie, that what so euer he hath lefte vs in his doctrine and religion, is true and sincere, &amp; the onlie waie of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vpon earth. For clearer proof and declaration wherof, I will reduce what soeuer I haue to saye herein, vnto three <note place="margin">The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> principal heades or braunshes, according to th' order of three distincte tymes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin they fell out: that is to saye; in the first place shal be considered, the thinges that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> passed before the natiuitie or incarnation of Christ.

But yet the tradition

So is it in the generation of this reprobate people, who first agreed with vs in al, or most pointes, touching Christ to come, &amp; denied onlie the fulfilling or application therof, in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Saueour: But afterward, their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious ofspring, being not able to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in that issue against vs, deuised a new plea, and be tooke them selues to a farre higher degree of impietie, affirming, that we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed manie thinges vnto Iesus, that were not fortolde of the Messias to come; and among other, that he should be God, and the sonne of God, and the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Trinitie, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But herein (no doubt) thes obstinate and graceles men, doe shew them selues both ignorant of their owne scriptures, &amp; disagreing from the writinges of their owne forefathers.

                  <p>And as for the last of thes testimonies, concerning Christes sitting at his fathers right-hand: three of our Euangelistes doe <note place="margin">Math. 2. Marc. 12.

if it were not to long: especiallie, if I would enter among that kinde of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitours, whom they call Cabalistes, (who <note place="margin">Tvvo sortes of Hebrue expositours, Cabalistes and Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudistes.</note> are more auncient and lesse brutishe then are th' other sorte, which are termed Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudistes,) I should finde many cleare and manifest declarations against the Iewes doctrine and errour of later tymes. And among other, (for example onlie of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistical expositions,) I referre the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the discourse of Rabbi Hacadosch (which in Hebrue signifieth the holie Rabbine, &amp; liued not longe after Christ,) <note place="margin">Iere. 23. v. 7.</note> vpon the words of Ieremie before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; in which, for that he findeth the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias to be called <hi>Iehoua,</hi> which word in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue is compounded of the three letters <hi>Iod,</hi> and <hi>Vau,</hi> and <hi>He</hi> twise repeated: this doctor maketh his discourse by arte Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list in this maner.</p>

                  <p>Nay, I will adde further (and this is <note place="margin">The. 4. proofe.</note> greatly to be obserued;) that the self same au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Iewes (as some also of the later) doe holde, &amp; proue by scripture; that christ shalbe (for alwayes they speake of the Messias to come,) the verie sonne of God, <hi>&amp; verbum Dei incarnatum,</hi> and the worde of <note place="margin">Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the sonne of God.</note> God incarnate, or made fleshe.

It was a carnal and seruile law, consisting most in th' external. It was a law of terrour and feare, more then of loue and libertie <note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> of spirit. It was a law (as I said before) of signes and figures for thinges to come, &amp; consequentelie to cease, when those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which it prefigured, should come to be present. It was a law peculier and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfor <note place="margin">Deut. 15.</note> the Iewes alone, without respect of all the rest of the world; and th' excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise therof was allowed onlie in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Now then reasoneth the learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine; <note place="margin">Good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones.</note> if this law of Moyses were for the Iewes and Iurie onlie: how could it serue for the tyme of the Messias, who was to be kinge, as well of the Gentiles, as of the Iewes; &amp; to rule all people in the world <note place="margin">Psal. 2. 21. 26 Esa. 2. 11. 19.</note> that should beleeue in hym, vnder one law? If th' excercise of this law, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable onlie, and lauful in Hierusalemt how coulde it possiblie bee fulfilled by Christians, that are dispersed ouer all the world? As for example; how could they

repai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re to Hierusalem thrise euerie yeare? how could euerie woman that should dwell in England or India, repaire to Hierusalem for her purification after <note place="margin">Leuit. 12. Exod. 13. Num. 8.</note> euerie childebirth, as by the law she was comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded? Most euident it is then, which we said before, that this law was gyuen but to idure for a tyme. And to vse S. Pauls owne wordes, it was but, <hi>introductio me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioris</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>spci,</hi> an introduction to a better hope. It was but an entertainement of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (which by their being amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g th' Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were prone to idolatrie,) vntill Christ should come and ordaine a perfect law. That is, a law of spirit and internal <note place="margin">The nevv lavve of Christ and the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s therof.</note> affection: a law of loue and libertie: a law that should be common to all men, serue for all countries, tymes, places, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: a law that should be writen in the bowels of our hartes: a law that should be tollerable, easie, sweet, plaine, light, brief, and factible, as well to the poore as to the riche: a law (to conclude) that should consist in charitie.</p>
                  <p>This signified Moyses, when he said to his people, after he had deliuered the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer law vnto them: <hi>your Lord shall raise vnto you a Prophet of your ovvne Nation, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>from among your ovvne brethren, as my self: hym shall you heare.</hi> As though he had said; you shall heare me but vntill he come, that must be a law gyuer as my self; but yet of a more perfect law; and therfore more to be heard and obeyed. And then he addeth; <hi>vvho so euer shall refuse to heare the vvords of</hi>

                     <hi>this Prophet, I my self vvill reuenge it, sayeth our Lord God.</hi> Which wordes can not be verified in anie other Prophet after Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vntill Christ; for that of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes the scripture sayeth, <hi>there arose no</hi>

                     <hi>Prophet like vnto Moyses in israel.</hi> Which is to be vnderstoode, that they had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to be Lawmakers as Moyses had, but were all bounde to th' obseruation of that law onlie which Moyses left, vntill Christ came, whom Moyses here calleth <hi>a Prophet as hym self,</hi> that is, a Lawmaker, &amp; exhorteth all men to heare &amp; obey hym.</p>
                  <p>This yet is made more plaine by the prophetie of Esay, who sayeth; <hi>out of Sion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Esa. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>shall come a lavve, and the vvorde of God out of Hierusalem.</hi> Which can not be vnderstood of Moyses law, that had bene published <note place="margin">A nevv lavv pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetied.</note> 800. yeares before this was spoken, and that, from the mount Sinai, and not from Sion: but Christs law began from Sion and Hierusalem, and from thence was spred into all the world. Which the same Esay forsawe when talking of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Messias, he sayeth. <hi>In that daye there</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Esa. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>shalbe an Aulter to God, in the middest of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Egypt. And the title of our Lord at the ende therof, &amp;c. and God shalbe knovven to the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians at that daye, and they shall honour hym vvith sacrifices and oblations.</hi> Which wordes could not be verified i th' old law of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for that by that law th' Egyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s could haue neither aulter nor sacrifice; but at Christes comming it was fulfilled, when th' Egyptians were made Christians, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14541:107"/>
enioyed both th' Aulters &amp; sacrifices that Christians doe vse.</p>
                  <p>The same thing was fortolde by God in Malachie, wher he sayeth to the Iewes and of the Iuishe sacrifices. <hi>I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie we see, that among the Gentiles, there should be a pure maner of sacrifice, more gratefull vnto God, then th' other was, and such, as might be perfourmed in euerie place of the world, and not be tied to one place onlie, as the Mosaical law and sacrifice was.</p>
                  <p>And finallie, I will conclude this whole matter, with th' expresse wordes of God hym self, concerning the ceremonies and preceptes of the olde law. <hi>Dedreis praecepta</hi>

some what to be said of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles. Who <note place="margin">MANIFE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of Christ to the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles.</note> albeit they were to receyue their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal knowledge in this affaire from the Iuishe Nation, to whom the Messias was first and principallie promissed, and from whom the Gentiles had to expecte both their Saue our and his Apostles; as also the scriptures for testimonie and witnesse of them both; and finally all their certaine knowledge and sounde vnderstanding in the mysteries of Christ: Yet had they also among them selues, some kynde of notice and forwarning in this matter, whiche being ioyned with that, whiche I haue set downe before of the Iewes, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at the light of Gods diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheties before alleaged: it will make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie muche for confirmation of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian veritie. And therfore this last consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, shalbe of the fore-knowledge of Gentiles in this behalf.</p>
                  <p>For better vnderstanding wherof; it is to be noted, that besides all knowledge of the Messias, that diuers Gentiles might haue by the Hebrue scriptures, whiche (<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> as I haue shewed before,) were in the Greeke language, diuers ages before Christ was borne: or by th' instruction &amp; conuersation of Iewes, with whom ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Pagans did liue familiarlie: there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained <note place="margin">Three pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiare vvayes vvherby Gentyles mighth care of Cbrist.</note> three wayes peculier to Gentiles, wherby they receyued some vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; forwarning of this great mysterie. The first was, by tradition and writinges of their auncestours. The second, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheties
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14541:109"/>
of their owne. The third, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishement of their Idoles &amp; Oracles, especiallie when the tyme of Christes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance drew neare.</p>
                  <p>And for the first way, it is euident, that <note place="margin">The first vvaye.</note> as the Iewes receyued diuers thinges by succession from their forfathers; &amp; they againe from Moyses; &amp; Moyses from the Patriarches, Iacob, Isaac, and Abraham, (who was the first man, from whom that whole natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proceeded, and in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were distinguished from all other people in the world:) so had the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles &amp; other Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s their succession also of doctrine &amp; <note place="margin">Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of learninge amonge Ievves and Gentiles.</note> monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, euen from the beginning; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the lower they went, the more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt they were, and more obscured in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowledge, by their excercise i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat ie. So wee know that the Romans had their learning from the Grecians; &amp; the Graecians fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th' Egyptians; th' Egyptians, from the Chaldaeans, who were the first people that receyued instruction in diuine matters from Adam, Methusalem, Noe, &amp; others of those first and auncient fathers.</p>
                  <p>Now then it is to be considered, that <note place="margin">Euseb. in Chron.</note> by consent of writers, there were three famous men that liued together in those auncient times; to witt; Abraham, (who <note place="margin">Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Iob. Zoroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres.</note> descending from HEBER, was the father and beginner of the Iewes or Hebrues:) And wth hym, Iob, and one Zoroastres, that were not of that linage of Heber, but as we call them for distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake, either heathens or Gentiles, albeit that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14541:110"/>
was not then in vre. And of Iob, we know by the testimonie of his booke, that he was a most holie and vertuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of Zoroastres, we know onlie, that he was greatelie learned, and left monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes therof vnto his posteritie.</p>
                  <p>This Zoroastres, liuing in Abrahams time, might by accompt of scripture, see or speake with Noe. For that Abraham was borne aboue three skore yeares before Noe disceassed. And Noe was borne aboue fyue hundreth yeares before Methusalem dyed; which Methusalem, had lyued two hundred and fortie yeares with our first father Adam, that had enioyed conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both with God &amp; Angels. And therby (no doubt,) could tell many highe and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete mysteries, especiallie touchinge Christ, in whom all his hope for redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his posteritie, did consist. Which mysteries &amp; hidden knowledge, it is not vnlike, but that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iob, Zoroastres, and others, who lyued at that tyme with them, might recevue at the third hand, by Noe and his children, I meane <note n="*" place="margin">The Ievves haue a tradition, that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham serued Sem. 15. yeares in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Herehence it is, that in the writinges of Zoroastres which are yet exstant, <note n="*" place="margin">See Clem. Alex. lib. 1. strom. &amp; Orig. l. 6. con.

And the most of my proofes, shall be out of a learned <note n="*" place="margin">See this Oration in Eusebius l. 4. ca. 32. de vita Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantini. at the onde.</note> oration, writen in latine by the foresaid Emperour, to a Councel of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in his dayes; wherein he indeuoureth to shew, the vndoubted authoritie of thes Sibyll propheties, which he esteemed so much (after diligent search made for their credite and sinceritie;) as they seeme to haue bene a great cause of his constant zele and feruour in Christianitie.</p>
                  <p>First then he sheweth, that thes predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Sibylles, could not be deuised or seigned by Christians, or made after <note place="margin">The.

                  <p>Secondlie he sheweth, that <hi>Sibylla Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thraea,</hi> who made the former Acrostike verses of Christ, restisicth of her self, that <note place="margin">The. 2. proofe.</note> she liued about 600. years after the fludde of Noe, and her countriman Apollidorus Erythraeus and Varro doe reporte, that she liued before the warre of Troie, &amp; pro phetied to the Graecians that went to that warre, that Troie should be taken.

                  <p>Thus then haue I declared how that <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this first Sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Gods so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne into the world, was for tolde both to Iewe and Gentile, by all meanes that possiblie in reason might be deuised: that is; by propheties, signes, figures, ceremonies, tradition, and by the confession of deuils them selues. Nor onlie, that his comming was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told: but also; why, and for what cause he was to come; that is; to be a Saueour of the world; to die for sinne; to ordeine a new law, and more perfect common wealth. How also he was to come: to witt; in mans fleshe; in likenes of sinne; in pouertie, &amp; humilitie. The tyme likewise of his appearance was foresignified, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the maner of his birth, life, actions, death, resurrection, and ascensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And finallie, nothing can be more desired for the fore knowledge of anie one thing to come; then was deliuered &amp; vttered co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Messias, before Christ or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were talked of in the world.

And this shallbe the subiect &amp; argument, of all the rest of our speeche in this chapter.</p>

                  <p>ALbeit in the pointes before recited, which are to be fulfilled in the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias at his comming; we haue some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie and disagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the Iewe, as hath bene shewed: yet our principal contention in them all, is with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and heathen, that beleeueth no scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <note place="margin">Our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie vvith Gentiles.</note> For that in diuers of the fornamed articles, the Iewe standeth with vs, and for vs; &amp; offereth his life in defence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as farre foorth, as if he were a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In so much, that the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tile ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times, is inforced to maruaile, when he seeth a people, so extremelie bent against an other, as the Iewes are against Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; and yet to stand so peremptorilie, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thos verie principles, which are the proper causes of their disagreement.</p>
                  <p>But hereunto the Iew maketh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; that his disagreement from vs, is in th' application of thos principles. For that in no wise he will allowe, that they were, or may bee verified in Iesus. And herein he standeth against vs, much more obstinatelie then doth the Gentile. For that the Gentile, as soone as he commeth <note place="margin">Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie vvith the Ievves.</note> once to vnderstande and beleeue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheties of scripture; he maketh no doubt or difficultie in th' application thereof; for that he seeth the same most euidentelie fulfilled in our Saueour. Which is the cause, that fewe or no Gentiles since
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14541:116"/>
Christs appearance, haue come to be Iewes, but that presentelie also they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer to be Christians.</p>
                  <p>But the Iewe, by no meanes wilbe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to yeeld, albeit he haue neither scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Th' obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie of the Ievves.</note> nor reason, nor probabilitie for his defence. Which among other thinges, is a verie great argument to proue, that Iesus was the true Messias in deed, seing that among the markes of the true Messias set downe by Gods Prophetes, this was one; that he should be refused by the Iuishe Nation. Herehence are those wordes of <note place="margin">Psal 113. Esa. 28.</note> the Holie Ghost so longe before vttered. <hi>The stone vvhich the</hi>

                  <p>FOR THE first then, concerning the tyme, which is the principal and head of <note place="margin">THE 1. Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. THE tyme appointed</note> all the rest; it is to be noted, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all writers both Pagan, Iuishe, &amp; Christian; Iesus, (whom we beleeue and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14541:117"/>
confesse to be true Christ,) was borne the 25. daye of December, in th' ende of the 41. yeare of th' Emperour Augustus reigne, which was 15. years before his reigne ended. Also in the beginning of the 33. yeare of Herodes reigne in Iurie, which was 4. yeares and more before his death. And from the beginning of the world, as <note n="*" place="margin">See Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb. i chro.</note> some accompt; 5199. And as other; 4089. for that in this pointe betwene the Hebrues and Graecians, there is a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of some litle more then a hundreth years, concerninge their reconinge.</p>
                  <p>The state of the worlde at Iesus Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, <note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral state of the vvorld at Christes comminge.</note> was this. The three Monarchies of the Assyrians, Persians, and Graecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, were past ouer, and ended: &amp; the Romans were entered into the fowerth, that was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then anie of the rest, according to the prophetie of Daniel, 500 yeares before. <note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> Octauius Caesar, surnamed Augustus, after fyue ciuil warres by hym self waged, and after infinit broyles and bloodshed in the <note place="margin">Suetom tranq. &amp; Aurel. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. &amp; alii, in vita Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusti.</note> worlde, reigned peaceablie alone, for many yeares together: &amp; in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal peace ouer all th' earth: he caused the temple gates of IANVS to be shutt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custome of the Romans in such cases; albeit this had happened but twise before, from the buylding of Rome vnto that tyme. And the verie same daye that Christ was borne in Iurie, Augustus commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in Rome (<note n="*" place="margin">Oros. l. 6. hist. ca. 22.</note> as afterward was obserued,) that no man should call hym LORDE, therby to signifie the free libertie,

rest, ioye &amp; securitie, wherin al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were, after so longe miseries, which by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual warres the world had suffered.</p>
                  <p>By this we gather first, that this tyme of Iesus birth, agreed exactelie with the <note place="margin">The. 1. proofe. The Roma Monarchie</note> prophetie so longe before sett downe in Daniel, (who lyued in the first Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie;) that after his tyme, there should be three Monarchies more, and the last, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest <note place="margin">Dan. 2. v. 31. 34. 44.</note> of all; at whose appearinge, the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias should come, and build vp Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome throughout all the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, we see that fulfilled, which Esay aboue a hundreth yeares before Daniel, <note place="margin">The. 2. proofe. The peace of all the vvorld. Esa. 9. v. 6. 7 &amp; cap. 32. v. 18.</note> fortold; that at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Christ; <hi>people should sitt in the beautie in peace.</hi> And againe; <hi>there shalbe no ende of peace.</hi> And yet further: <hi>he shall be Prince of peace.</hi> And kinge Dauid, longe before hym againe; <hi>in his dayes there shal ryse iustice, and abundance of peace.</hi> Which thinge, though especiallie it be to be vnderstoode, of th' internal peace <note place="margin">Psal. 71.</note> and tranquilitie of our myndes and soules: yet, considering that external peace also was necessarie for a tyme, for the quiet plantinge &amp; publishinge of Christes Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and seinge that the same wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s brought to passe most miraculouslie vpon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, when in reason men least might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the same, for th' infinite warres wherin the worlde a litle before had bene; and by reason of the Roman Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie so freshelie established; (whiche in their begininges are wont to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some:) this peace (I saye,) can not be, but, a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14541:118"/>
greate argument, that this was the proper tyme of the Messias his comminge. And this, for the state of the world in general.</p>
                  <p>But now for the particuler state of <note place="margin">The. 3. proofe. The scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iuda.</note> Iurie, at Iesus natiuitie; thus it was, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Iosephus the Iew, (who was borne within fyue yeares after Christ his passion,) describeth the same.

By which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he came at length to marry the daughter of Hyrcanus kinge of Iurie, that was descended liniallie of the house of Dauid, and tribe of Iuda. And by this mariage, obteined of his father-in-law to be Gouernour of the prouince of Galilie, vnder hym. But Hyrcanus after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, fallinge into the handes of the Parthyians, that caried hym into parthia: <note place="margin">The first rysing of Herod As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colonita.</note> Herod ranne away to Rome, and there, by the helpe and special fauour of Antonie, that ruled in company together with Octauius: he obteined to be created kinge of Iurie, without all title or interest i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world. For that not onlie his said father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inlaw Hyrcanus was yet a lyue in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia; but also his yonger brother Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, and three of his sonnes named An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus,

Alexander, and Aristobulus, and diuers other of the blood Royall, in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
                  <p>Herodthen, hauing procured by thes meanes to be kinge of Iurie; procured <note place="margin">Ioseph. l. 15 antiq. c. 9. 11.</note> first to haue into his handes the forsaid kinge Hyrcanus, and so put hym to death; as also he brought to the same ende his yonger brother Aristobulus, together <note place="margin">The most horrible murders, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by Herod.</note> with all his three sonnes. He putt to death also, his owne wife Mariamnes that was kinge Hyreanus daughter, as also.

And a litle after that againe, he put to death his third sonne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">Lib. 17. ca. 10.</note> Antipater. He caused to be slaine at one tyme 40. of the chiefest noble men of the tribe of Iuda. And, as Philo the Iewe <note place="margin">Lib. 15. c. 1.</note> writeth, (that liued at the same tyme with hym,) he putt to death all the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin,</hi> that is, the seuentie and two Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours <note place="margin">Philo li. de tempore.</note> of the tribe of Iuda, that ruled the people. He kylled the chief of the sect of Pharisies. He burned the genealogies of all the kinges and princes, of the house of Iuda; and caused one Nicolaus Damasce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <note place="margin">Ioseph. l. 14 cap. 2.</note> an Historiographer that was his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, to draw out apetidegree for hym and his line, as though he had descended <note place="margin">A paterne of an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> from the auncient kinges of Iuda. He translated the highe priesthode &amp; solde it to straungers. And finallie he so rased, dispersed, and mangled the house of Iuda;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14541:119"/>
as no one iote of gouernment, dignitie, or principallitie remained therin. And when he had donne all this: then was Iesus, of the same house and line, borne in Bethlee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the proper Cittie of Dauid, which Dauid was the founder and first authour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie in Iuda.</p>
                  <p>Now then, consider the prophetie of Iacob concerning the particuler tyme of <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetie of Iacob, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the scepter of Iuda. <hi>Gen. 49.</hi>

                  <p>Now then it is certaine, that Daniel in the prophetie before alleaged, where he assigneth 62. weekes to the tyme of Christs death, could not meane <hi>vveekes of dayes;</hi> for that he appointeth onlie seuen weekes, to the rebuilding of the cittie of Ierusalem; of the Temple; &amp; of the walles aboute; which were not ended but in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and nyne yeares after, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <note place="margin">Lib. 1. &amp; 2.</note> by the bookes of Esdras: which 49. weekes, doe make iust seuen weekes of yeares.

                  <p>Now then if we putt thes yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whiche are here mentioned by Daniel: that is, first the seuen Hebdoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, which make fortie and nyne yeares; and then the three skore and two from the restauratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ierusalem, which make fower hundred thirtie and fower more: we shall fynde the whole number to be <note place="margin">Th' acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of Daniels vveekes.</note> 483. yeares. Which being begonne from the first yeare of Cyrus, as some wil, (for that he first determined the Iewes reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) or from the second yeare of Darius, as other will, (for that he confirmed and putt the same in execution:) or from the twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth yeare of the said Darius, for that then, he made a new edicte in the fauour of Nehemias, and sent hym into Iurie: euerie waye they will ende in the reigne of Herod and of Augustus, vnder whome Christ was borne; or in the reigne of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius Caesar, vnder whome he suffered. And by no interpretation in the world, can it be auoided, but that this tyme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Daniel, is now owt, aboue a thousand &amp; fyue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeares past, whyle

                  <p>Another obseruation they haue vpon the wordes of Esay; <hi>paruulus natus est nobis,</hi>

                  <p>This Starre (as I haue said,) was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told <note place="margin">Propheties of thinges that should fall out in Bethleem. Num. 24. Psal. 71. v. 10.

and for that cause, thos infantes, were called her children, albeit she were dead aboue 2000. yeares before they were slaine, and aboue 1500. before Ieremie wrote the prophetie. Amongest which infantes, Herode also for more assurance, slewe an infant of his owne.

                  <p>And truly, no one thing in al this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Iesus life, doth more establish the certaintie of his being the true Messias; then that Iohn Baptiste, (whos wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning, vertue, and rare sanctitie,

So, Esaie in his 35. <note place="margin">Predictions of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> chapter describeth at large, how the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias at his coming, shal declare his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission by gyuing sight to the blind, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the deafe, speech to the dombe, &amp; agilitie of body to the Lame &amp; Cripple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that which is more maruailous; God reuealed this point very particularly to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:14541:136"/>
the Gentiles by the Sibyles, among who one of them wrote thus of Christ to come, as Lactantius recordeth. <hi>He shal doe al by his</hi>

                     <hi>only vvord: he shal cure al infirmities; he shal raise the dead; he shal make the lame to runne &amp; skippe; the deafe shal heare; the blind shal see, &amp; the dombe speake. In fiue loaues and tvvo fishes, fiue thousand persons shalve satisfied: and the fragmentes shal fil tvvelue baskets, to the hope of many. He shal commande the vvindes, and vvalke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the furious sea, vvith his feete of peace.</hi> And after diuers other greeke verses to this purpose, she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth in thes wordes: <hi>Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal saie, that I am a madde and lying Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse; but vvhen at thes things shal come to passe: then remember mee; for then shal no man say more, that I vvas a liar, but rather the Prophet of the great Gad.</hi>

                  <p>To thes predictions of Prophetes in Iurie, and among the Gentiles, doe agree the Doctours of the Iewes them selues, in many places of their Thalmud: to <note place="margin">Thal. tract.

The same doth Mahomet in his Alcorane; affirming, Iesus the sonne of Marie, to haue bene a great prophet; and to haue wrought his miracles by the only power and spirit of God: and that hym self was sent to confirme Iesus doctrine, sauing only in the point of his godhead; wherin he sayeth, that Iesus went to farre, and had a checke for the same at Gods hand, when he returned to heauen.</p>
                  <p>Thus much doe thes enimies confesse of Iesus miracles. Which, as it is much, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such witnesses: so if they would either deny, or dissemble the same; they might be proued agaist the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by most euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; especiallie in two pointes, wherin ther can be no probablitie of denial.</p>
                  <p>The first is, the calling and retaining of his apostles and other followers, <note place="margin">The cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Apostles.</note> (wherof Iosephus also in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleaged, maketh mention, as of a great miracle;) who were of diuers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, states, conditions, trades, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations <note place="margin">Iosep. li. 18. antiq. c. 4</note> in the world. And yet all, vpon the suddaine, lefte both father, mother, wife, children, and other temporal respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes; and followed hym, who had nothing to gyue or promisse them in this world. A man, that neuer spake them fayre, nor

vttered doctrine, that was not repugnant to the sensualitie of this life, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their owne writinges &amp; testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of hym. A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that was conténed by the better sorte, as then it might seeme; that is, by the wise and learned of that countrie; &amp; especiallie misliked by them, that were in gouernment, as a dangerous and troublesome man to the state. One, that had neither friendes in the world to beare hym out, nor house to put his head in. And yet, not withstanding all this, that worldlie men and women, and some such also, as were great sinners, and loose liuers before, should leaue all their <note place="margin">A greate Miracle.</note> worldlie hope, staye, and condition, to follow such a man, with so great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, losses, daungers, and disfauours as they did; and should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue with hym in all his afflictions, and be content to die and lose their liues; rather then forsake hym, or abandone his seruice; this (I saye) is such a miracle, as neuer in the world fell out the lyke, and must needes be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>The second point is of external thinges &amp; factes donne by Iesus, aboue all power of humane abilitie, in the sight &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all the Iewes; which factes were published by our Euangelistes, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie by S. Mathew, in th' Hebrue ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, while yet the persons were aliue vpon whom they were wroughte, or infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite other that might be witnesses therof. As for example; the raising of Lazarus in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

Bethania, that was a village, but a mile or <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.</note> two distant from Hierusalem; at whose death and burial, (being a Gentleman) manie Scribes and Pharysies must needes be present, (according to the Iuishe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome <note place="margin">Ioseph. l. 17 antiq. c. 11.</note> at that tyme reported by Iosephꝰ;) and they sawe hym bothe disceassed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred, and the funeral feaste obserued for hym; as also raised againe by Iesus after fower dayes of his burial. With whom they did both eate and drinke, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse after his returne to life, and euerie daye might beholde hym walking in the streetes of Hierusalem. This storie (I saye) how could it be feigned?</p>
                  <p>So in like manner the raising of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Archisinagogues daughter, whose name <note place="margin">Math. 9.

the whole countrie about of the people called, <hi>Gerasines,</hi> being striken with feare vpon sight of the fact: besought Iesus most humblie, to departe from their borders.

                  <p>But if we shew, that this was th' eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preordination and appointement of God, for sauing of mankinde; and that the same was fortolde both to Iewe &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile from the beginning; and so vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood also, by the Iuishe Doctors of elder tymes: then euerie reasonnable man (I trow) will remaine satisfied, and preferre Gods diuine wisdome, before ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s follie.</p>

                  <p>Thus much was promissed by Prophets, before Christs appearance.

discouered. Now then, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what maner of performance Iesus made hereof.</p>
                  <p>And first the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s most interessed in the <note place="margin">The appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs vvhich Iesus made after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</note> matter, as they whose total hope, staye, refuge, and felicitie, depended hereof; I meane his appaled, dismaied, and afflicted disciples, doe recount twelue sundrie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which Iesus made vnto them in flesh, after his resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The first, was to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Mary Magdalene aparte, when she with <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> Salome and other women, went and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with ointments about the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.

Luc. 24.</note> in their iourney to Emaus.

Ihon, with fiue other <note place="margin">Ioa. 21.</note> disciples, when they were in fishing; at what time also he vouchsafed to eate with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> them. The eight, was to eleuen disciples <note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> at one time, vpon the mounte Thabor in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Galiley. The ninth, was to more then fiue <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> hundreth brethern at one time, as S. Paule <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> testifieth. The tenth, was to S. Iames, as the <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> same Apostle recordeth. The eleuenth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> was to al his Apostles, disciples, &amp; friends <note place="margin">Act. 1.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Al thes apparitions are recorded in Scripture, as made by Iesus after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, to such as by his eternal wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, were preordained to be witnesses of so glorious a spectacle.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vnto them by their owne souldiars that sawe it: found no other waie to resist the fame therof, but onely by saying, (as also their posteritie doe vnto this dave,) that his disciples came by night, and stole away his bodie, whiles the souldiours
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14541:143"/>
were a sleepe. But what likelihood or possibilitie can there be in this? For first, it is euident to al the world, that his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, (who were the heads of al the rest,) were so dismaied, discomforted, and deiected at that time; as they durst not once goe out of the dore. For which cause, only thos seely women, who for their sexe esteemed them selues more free from violence; presumed alone to visite his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, which no one man durst for feare of the souldiours; vntil by thos women they were informed, that the forsaid band of souldiours were terrefied and put to flight by Christes Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>And how then was it likely, that men <note place="margin">Greate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics.</note> so much amazed &amp; ouercome with feare, should aduenture to steale a bodie from a Guarde of Souldiours that kept it? Or if their hartes had serued them to aduenture so greate a daunger: what hope or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie had ther bene of successe? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie, consideringe the said bodie lay e in a new sepulcher of stone, shutt vp and locked, and fast sealed by the Magistrate? How was it possible (I say) that his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples should come thyther? breake vp the Monument? take out his bodie? and carie the same away, neuer after to be sene or founde, without espial of some one amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest so many that attended ther? Or if this were possible, (as in reason it is not;) yet what profite, what pleasure, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, could they receaue hereby? We see that thes apostles and disciples of his,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14541:144"/>
who were so abandoned of life and hart in his Passion: after two dayes onlie, they were so changed; as life and death can be no more contrarie.</p>
                  <p>For, wheras before they kept home in <note place="margin">The great change in Iesus disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by his resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> all feare, and durst appeare no wher, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept amonge their owne priuate frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: now they came foorth into the streetes and common places, and auouched with all alacritie, and irresistible constancie; euen in the faces and hearinge of their greatest enimies; that Iesus was rysen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life; that they had sene hym; spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with hym; and enioyed his presence. And that for restimonie and confirmation hereof, they were most redie to spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their liues. And could all this (trow you) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede onlie, of a dead bodie, which they had gotten by stealth into their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Would not rather the presence and sight of such a bodie; so torne, mangled, &amp; deformed as Iesus bodie was both vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crosse and before; haue rather dismayed them more, then haue gyuen them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort? Yes trulie. And therfore Pilat the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, considering thes circumstances; and that it was vnlikelie, that either the bodie should be stolne without priuitie of the Souldiars; or if it had bene; that it should <note place="margin">Th' exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the matter by Pilate.</note> yeeld such life, hart, consolation, &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the stealers: beganne to gyue eare more diligentelie to the matter; and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to him the Souldiars that kept the watch, vnderstoode by them the whole truth of th' accident: to witt; that in their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14541:144"/>
sight and presence, Iesus was risen out of his sepulcher to life, and that at his rising, ther was so dreadful an earth-quacke, with trembling &amp; opening of sepulchers rounde about; such skriches, cries, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of all elementes: as they durst not abyde longer, but ranne and tolde the Iuishe magistrates therof, who being greatelie discontented (as it seemed) with th' aduertisement; gaue them money to saye, that while they were sleeping, the bodie was stolne by his disciples fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.</p>
                  <p>All this wrote Pilate presentlie to his Lord Tyberius, then Emperour of Rome. <note place="margin">Pylates let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, and his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon.</note> And he sent withal, the particuler exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and confelsions of diuers other, that had sene and spoken with such as were risen from death at the same tyme, and had appeared to many of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in Hicrusalem, assuring them also, of the resurrection of Iesus.

multitude did, whether they went, and in what place they remained after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture thence. And finallie, he setteth downe so manie particulers; as it had bene th' easiest matter in the world, for his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to haue refuted his narration, if all had not bene true.

whole Citie of Philippi, which could haue testified the contrary.</p>
                  <p>And yet amongst so many aduersaries, <note place="margin">None euer durst im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the Miracles of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but by calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> &amp; eager impugners of Christian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Gods enemie stirred vp in the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, of all sortes and sectes of people: no one euer appeared, that durst attempt to take in hand, the particuler im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing of thes or the like miracles; but rather confessing the factes; sought alwayes to discredite them, by other sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster calumniations: namely and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; that they were wrought by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and sleights of art magike. Thus said the Iewes of the miracles of Iesus; and so <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> said Iulian th' Apostata, of the wonderful <note place="margin">Apud Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryl. li. 1. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

Paul; affirming them to haue bene the most expert in Magike, of any that euer liued; and that Christ wrote a special booke of that profession, and dedicated the same to Peter and Paul; wher as notwithstanding, it is most euident, that Paul was a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour diuers yeares after Christ depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. One Hierocles also wrote a booke, <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Hiero.</note> wherin he feigneth Appolonius Tyanaeus to haue done the like miracles by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, which Christ and his Apostles did by diuine power. And finally, it is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral opinion, that both Nero and Iulian gaue them selues so extremely to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of that vaine science, as no men euer did the like; vpon emulation onely of the miracles done in Rome by Peter and Paul when Nero liued, and by other Saintes &amp;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:14541:152"/>

                  <p>But what was the ende? Plinie that was a Pagane, writeth thus of Nero; that <note place="margin">Plin. lib. 30. Nat. hist. cap. 1.</note> as no man euer laboured more then he in that science: so no man euer left a more certaine testimonie of the maruailous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding vanitie therof. The like in effect <note place="margin">Zosimus in cit. Iulia.</note> writeth Zosimus of Iulian, albeit him self a malitious heathen. And if it were not writen; yet their seueral extraordinarie calamities, and most miserable deathes, which by al their Magike they could not forsee: doth sufficiently testifie the same vnto vs; especially the last words of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian; <hi>Vicisti Galilae, vicisti.</hi> Thou hast woune <note place="margin">Niceph lib. 10. cap. 35. histo.</note> (ô Galilaean,) thou hast gotten the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

Wherin is to be noted, that lesus being God, tooke a different way from the custome of man, in deliuering vnto vs, his lawes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes. For that men, who haue bene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers vnto the worlde, knew no surer way of publishing their lawes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing authoritie to the same; then to write them with their owne handes, and in their life time to establishe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation. So Lycurgus, Solon, &amp; others among the Grecians: Numa to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes: Mahomet to his Sarasins: and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other in like maner. But Iesus to <note place="margin">Iesus lest nothing vvriten by hym seif.</note> shew his Diuine power in directing the penne and stile of his Euangelistes, would not leaue any thing writing him self, but passed from this world in simplicitie and filence, whithout any further shewe or
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:14541:153"/>
ostentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his own doings; meaning notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, by his eternal wisdome, that the prophetie of Ezechiel should be <note place="margin">Ezec. 1.</note> fulfilled, which foresignified the being of his fowre irrefragable witnesses, which daie and night without rest, should preache, extolle, and magnifie their Lord and Maister, to the worldes ende.</p>
                  <p>Foure then were fore-prophetied, and foure (as we see) by Gods prouidence <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the 4. Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelists.</note> were prouided, to fulfil the same prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The first and last, are two Apostles, that wrote as they had sene. The two midle, are two diseiples, who registred thinges, as they had vnderstoode by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Apostles. The first Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was written by an Apostle; to giue light &amp; open the waie to al the rest: And the last, in like maner was written by an Apostle; to giue authoritie and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to al the former. The first was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Hebrue or Iewish tongue, for that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus actions were dóne in that countrie; to th' ende that therby, eyther the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might beleeue them, or the obstinate impugne them. The other three, were written in the publique tongues of al other nations; that is, in the Greeke and Romane languages: if it be true (<note n="*" place="margin">See Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macan. l. 9. de quaest.</note> which diuers holde,) that S. Marcs Ghospel was first written in Latin.</p>
                  <p>They wrote their stories in diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, eche one remaning farre distant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes.</note> an other; and yet agreed they al (as we see) most exactly, in the verie same nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14541:154"/>
They wrote in diuers times, the one after the other; and yet the later, did neither correct nor reprehend anie thing ithe former. They published their stories, when infinite were aliue that knew the factes, and many more that desired to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne them. They set doune in most of their particuler narrations, the time, the day, the houre, the place, the village, the house, the persons, the men, the women, and other the like. Which circumstances, the more they are in number, the more easie to be refuted, if they were not true. Neither did they in Iurie write of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges done in India; but in the same coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie it self; in Townes &amp; Cities that were publiquely knowen; in Bethania, and Bethsaida, villages hard by Ierusalem; in the Suburbes and hiles about the Citie; in such a Streete, at such a Gate, in such a Porch of the Temple, at such a fishpoole, which al people in Ierusalem did euery daie beholde.</p>
                  <p>They published their writinges in their owne life time; and preached in worde, so much as in writing they had recorded. <note place="margin">The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of our Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles.</note> They permitted the same to the iudgment and examination of al Christs church; especially of the Apostles, who were able to discerne euerie least thing therin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. So Marke set forth his Ghospel, by the instruction and approbation of S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: as also did Luke, by the authoritie of <note place="margin">Hieron. in catalog. Script. Eccles.</note> S. Paul. They altered not their writinges afterward, as other authours are wont, in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14541:154"/>
their later editions: nor euer corrected they anie one iote of that which they had first set doune. And that which neuer happened, in any other writinges in the world besides; nor euer Prince or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was able to bring to passe, for cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of his edictes or sanctions: they gaue their liues, for defence and iustefying of that they had written.</p>
                  <p>Their maner of writing is sincere and simple; without al arte, amplification, or <note place="margin">The maner of style in our Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes.</note> Rhetorical exornatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They flatter none; no not Iesus him self, whom they most adore; nor in confessing him to be their God and Creatour, doe they conceale his infirmities of fleshe, in that he was man; as <note place="margin">Mat. 21. Marc. 2. Iohn. 7. Luc. 19.</note> his hunger and thirst; his being wearie; how he wept; his passions of feare; and the like. So lykewise, in the Apostles that were the gouernours, superiours, and heads of al the rest; doe thes Euangelistes dissemble, hide, or passe ouer no such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as were defects and might seeme to worldlie eies, to turne to their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple; how Christ rebuked them for their dulnes in vnderstanding: how after long instruction, they propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed notwithstanding verie rude and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent <note place="margin">Marc. 15. Iohn. 10. 11. &amp; 20.</note> questions vnto him: how Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas would not beleeue the attestation of his fellowes: how S. Ihon and S. Iames the sonnes of Zebedee, ambitiouslie solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to haue the preheminence of sitting nearest to Christ i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his glorie. Which later <note place="margin">Marc. 10.</note> clause, bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g set doune clearly by S. Marke,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:14541:155"/>
while yet S. Ihon the Apostle was liuing: the same was neuer denied nor taken yll by the said Apostle, neither S. Markes Ghospel the lesse approued by him, albeit he liued longest, and wrote last of al the rest.</p>
                  <p>Nay, which is more, and greatly (no <note place="margin">A special point to be obserued in our Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes.</note> doubt) to be obserued; thes Euangelistes were so sincere and religious in their nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: as they noted especiallie the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persections of them selues, and of such other, as they principally respected. So S. Mathew, nameth him self <hi>Mathevv the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican.</hi> And so S. Marke, being Peters disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Mat. 10. Narc. 14.</note> recordeth particulerly, how S. Peter thrise denied his maister. S. Luke, that was scholler and dependent of S. Paul, maketh mention alone, of the litle differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Paul and Barnabas; &amp; in the storie <note place="margin">Act. 15.</note> of S. Stephens death, after al his narration ended; he addeth a clause that in humane iudgement might haue bene left out, to witt; <hi>Saulus erat consentiës neci eius.</hi> Saul was <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>senting &amp; culpable of Stephens death. Wherby we may perceaue most perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouslie, that as thes men were plaine, sincere, and simple, and farre from presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to deuise any thinge of them selues: so were they religious, and had scruple to passe ouer or leaue oute any thinge of the truth, in fauour of them selues, or of any other whosoeuer.</p>
                  <p>Thes mens writinges then, were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished &amp; receyued for vndoubted truth, by all that liued in the verie same age, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:14541:155"/>
were pryuie to the particulers therin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined. They were copied abrode into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit mens handes, and so conserued with all care &amp; reuerence, as holie and diuine scripture. They were read in churches, throughout all countries and Nations; expounded, preached, and taught by all pastours; and commentaries made vpon <note place="margin">No doubt, but that vve haue the true vvritinges of our Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So that no doubt can be made, but that we haue the verie sa ne writinges incorrupt, as th' authours left them: for that it was impossible for anie enimie to corrupt so manie Copies ouer al the world, without discoucrie and resiitance. And the same very text, wordes, and sentences, which from age to age, the learned fathers doe alleage out of thes scriptures, we fynde them now, as they had them at that tyme. As for example; S. Iohn that lyued lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest of all th' Apostles and Euangelistes, had amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge other schollers and auditours, Papias, Ignatius, &amp; Policarpus; al which agree of the foure Ghospels, and other writinges left vnto vs in the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; affirming S. Iohn to haue approued the same. These men were maisters againe to Iustinus Martyr, Irenaeus, and other, whose writinges remaine vnto vs. And if they did not; yet their sayinges and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes touching the Scriptures, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded vnto vs by Eusebius and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the next age after, and so from <note place="margin">Fuseb. li. 5. hist. cap. 15.</note> hand to hand vntil our dayes. So, that of this, ther can be no more doubt, then
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14541:156"/>
whether Rome, Constantinople, Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and other such renoumed Cities knowen to al the world at this day; be the very same, wherof Authours haue treated so much in auncient times.</p>

The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; <note n="*" place="margin">See the narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Philaeas by shope in Affrica touching this pointe, alleaged by Eusebius. l. 8. hist. cap. 11. &amp; 12.</note> What intollerable and vnacusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med tormentes, not hard of in the worlde before, were deuised by Tyrantes for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting this kinde of people. The third; what inuincible courage, and vnspeakable alacritie the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shewed, in bearing oute these afflictions, which the enimies theselues could not attribute, but to some diuine power and supernatural assistance.</p>
                  <p>And for this later point of comfort in their sufferings, I will alleage onlie this <note place="margin">The singu ler alacri tie of Chri stians, in their suffe ringes. <hi>Tertul. in apolog. c. 1.</hi>

Wherto this learned Doctour made answere in these wordes. <q>Truth it is, that many men are prone to yl, and do suffer for the same: but yet dare they not defend their euil to be good as Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doe their cause. For that euery euil thig by nature, doth bring with it either feare or shame: &amp; therfor we see, that malefactours, albeit they loue euill; yet would they not appeare so to the world, but desire rather to lie in couert. They tremble when they are taken; and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14541:157"/>
when they are accused, they deny all, and do scarse oftentimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse their doings vpon torments. And finally, when they are condemned, they lament, mone, and do impute their il fortune to destinie, or to the planets. But the Christian, what doth he like to this? Is their any man ashamed? or doth any man 'repent him when he is taken, except it be for that he was not taken rather? If he be noted by the enemy for a Christian; he glorieth in the same: if he be accused; he defendeth not him self: if he be asked the question; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth it willingly: if he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned; he veldeth thankes. What euil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ther in this Christian cause, which lacketh the natural sequele of euil? I meane, feare, shame, tergiuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, repentance, sorowe, and deploration? what euil (I say) can this be deemed, whose guiltines is ioye? whose accusation, is desire? whose punishment, is happines?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto are the wordes of learned Tertulian, who was an eye-witnes of that <note place="margin">Iesus assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to his Martyrs.</note> he wrote, &amp; had no smal part in the cause of thos that suffred, being him self in that place and state, as daily he might expect to taste of the same affliction. To which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, how redie he was, may appeare by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of this his Apologie, wherin he vttereth, (besides his zeale &amp; feruour,) a most confident securitie, and certaine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of Iesus assistance, by that which he had sene performed to infinite other in their greatest distresses, from the same
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:14541:157"/>
Lord before. So that nothing doth more a-certaine vs of the diuine power and omnipotencie of Iesus; then the fortitude inuincible, which aboue al humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, force, and nature, he imparted to his Martyrs.</p>

Which thing, partely may appeare by the Oracles alleaged in the ende of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer section, (wherin thos spirites fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde, that an Hebrew Childe should be borne, to the vtter subuersion and ruine of their Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nical dominion:) And much more at large the same might be declared, by other answers &amp; Oracles vttered after Christes natiuitie and registred in the monumentes euen of the heathens them selues. Wherof he that desireth to see more ample mention, (especially out of Porphyrie, who then was liuing,) let him read Eusebius sixte booke <hi>de preparatione Euangelica,</hi> where he shal finde store; and namely, that Apollo many times excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Hei mihi, congemiscite: Hei mihi; hei mihi; Oraculorum defecit me claritas.</hi>

  This confessed also the wicked spirites them selues, when at Christs appearing i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iurie, they came vnto him at diuers times, and besought him, not to afflict or torment them, nor command them presently to returne to hel; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to permit them some litle time of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, in the sea or mountaines, or amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g heardes of swine, or the like.

And finally, Plutarche that liued within one hundreth yeares after Christ, made a special booke, to search out the causes, why the Oracles of the Goddes were ceased in his time. And after much turning &amp; winding many waies, resolued vpon two principal pointes, as causes therof. The first, for that in his time, ther was more store of wise men then before, whos answers might sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in stead of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: and the other, that peraduenture the <note place="margin">Tvvo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient causes.</note> spirits which were accustomed to yeeld Oracles, were by length of time growen olde and dead. Both which reasons in the verie common sense of al men, must needs be false; and by Plutarch him self, can not stand with probabilitie. For first; in his bookes which he wrote of the liues of auncient famous men, he confesseth, that in such kinde of wisdom, as he most estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they had not their equals amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their posteritie. Secondlie, in his treatises of Philosophie, he passeth it for a ground, that spirits, not depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of material bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, can not die or waxe olde: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of necessitie we must conclude, that some other cause is to be yeelded of the ceasing of thes Oracles, which can not be but the presence and commaundement of some higher power, according to the saying of S. Iohn: <hi>To this ende appeared the</hi>

                     </gap> onlie, I wil alleage in this place, an offer or chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge made for proof therof, by Tertullian to the heathen magistrates and persecutcurs of his time: his wordes <note place="margin">Tertul. in Apolog. ad gentes.</note> are thes. <q>Let ther be brought here in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence before your tribunal seats, some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who is certainly knowen to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with a wicked spirite: and let that spirite be commaunded by a Christian, to <note place="margin">A most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Againe at the same time; let there be brought forth one of thes (your priests or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets) that wil seeme to be possessed by a diuine spirite; I meane of thos, that speake gasping &amp;c. (in whom you imagine your Gods to talke,) and except that spirit also, (commaunded by vs,) doe confesse him self to be a deuil, (being indeed afraid to lye vnto a Christian:) doe you shedde the blood of the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in that very place, &amp;c. None wil lye to their owne shame, but rather for honour or aduantage: yet thos spirits wil not saye to vs, that Christ was a Magician, as you doe; nor that he was of the common condition of men. They
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:14541:159"/>
wil not saie, he was stolne out of his sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; but they wil confesse, that he was the vertue, wisdome, and worde of God; that he is in heauen, and that he shal come againe to be our iudge &amp;c. Neither wil thes deuils in our presence, denie them selues to be vncleane spirits, and damned for their wickednes; and that they expect his most horrible iudgment, professing also, that they doe feare Christ in God, and God in Christ; and that they are made subiect vnto his seruantes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hytherto are the wordes of Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, conteining (as I haue said) a most confident chalenge, and that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liues and blood of al Christians, to make trial of their power in controlling thos spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, which the Romanes and other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles adored as their Godes.

                  <p>And this Puissant authoritie of Iesus, <note place="margin">The vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Christians ouer spirits</note> imparted to Christians, extended it self so farre forth; that not only their wordes and commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, but euen their very presence did shut the mouthes, and driue into feare thes miserable spirites.

                  <p>This then was the prouidence of God for the punishment of the Iewes at that time.

Wherof he that wil see a ver lamentable narration; let him read but the last booke only of Iosephus historie <hi>de Bello Judaico,</hi> wherin is reported besides other thinges, that after the warre was ended, and al publique slaughter ceased: Titus sent sixtie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thousand Iewes, as a present to his father to Rome, ther to be putt to death in diuers and sundrie maners.

                  <p>After this againe vnder Traiane th' Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ther were so infinite a number of <note place="margin">The final desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iuishe Nation.</note> Iewes slaine and made awaye by Marcus Turbo in Africa, and Lucius Quintus in the East: as al histories agree, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to expresse the multitude.

                  <p>BY AL that hytherto hath bene saide, <note place="margin">The summe of the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer three Sections.</note> we haue declared and made manifest vnto the, (gentle reader,) three thinges of great importance. First, that from the beginning and creation of the worlde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ther hath bene promised in all times and ages, a Messias or Saueour of mankinde, in whom and by whom, al Nations should be blessed; as also, that the particuler time, maner, and circumstance of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming; together with the qualitie of his person, purpose, doctrine, life, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and Ascension, were in like maner by the prophets of God, most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently forshewed. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly; that the very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> same particulers and special points, that were dessigned and set doune by the said Prophets, were also fulfilled most exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their circumstances, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and actions of Iesus our Saueour. Thirdly, that besides the accomplishment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of all the for said propheties; there were giuen by Iesus, many signes, manifestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and most infallible arguments of his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t puissance, after his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention or departure from al humane and corporal conuersation in this world. By al which waies, meanes, arguments, and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:14541:169"/>
proofes; &amp; by ten thousand more, which to the tongue or penne of man are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, the Christian minde remaineth setled, and most firmely grounded in the vndoubted belief of his religion; hauing besides al other thinges, euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and internal comfortes and assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are infinite: thes eight demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratiue <note place="margin">Eight rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> reasons and persuasions which ensue, for his more ample and aboundant satisfaction therin.</p>
                  <p>First; that it was impossible that so many <note place="margin">1. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheties.</note> thinges, should be foretold so precisely, with so many particularities, in so many ages, by so different persons al of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, with so great concorde, consent, and vnitie, and that so long before hand, but by the spirite of God alone, that only hath foreknowlege of future euents. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly; <note place="margin">2. The fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge.</note> that it could not possibly be, that so many thinges, so difficult and strange, with al their particularities and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, should be so exactly and preciselie fulfilled, but in him alone of whom they were truly meant. Thirdly; that it can no waies be imagined, that God would euer <note place="margin">3. Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> haue concurred with Iesus doinges, or assisted hym, aboue all course of nature, with so aboundant miracles, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles doe confesse that he wrought, yf he had bene a Seducer, or taken vpon hym to set foorth a false doctrine. Fourthly; if Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus <note place="margin">4. Iesus doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> had intended to deceaue and seduce the world; he would neuer haue propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a doctrine so difficult and repugnant
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:14541:169"/>
to al sensualitie; but rather would haue taught things pleasant and grateful to mans voluptuous delight, as Mahomet did after him. Nether could the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue euer so affectuously embrased such austeritie, without the assistance of some diuine and supernatural power. Fistly; <note place="margin">5. Iesus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge.</note> for that Iesus being poorely borne and vnlettred, as by his aduersaries confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth appeare, and that in such an age and tyme, when all worldly learning was in most florishing estate: he could neuer pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly but by diuine power, haue attained to such most exquisite knowlege in all kinde of learning, as to be able to decide all the doubtes and controuersies of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers before him, as he did; laving doune more plainly, distinctly, &amp; perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously, the pithe of all humane and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine learning, within the compasse of three yeares teaching, (and that to audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of so great simplicitie;) then did al the Sages of the world, vntil that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, in so much that euen then, the most vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christian of that time, could say more in certaintie of truth, concerning the knowledge of God, the Creation of the world, th' ende of man, the reward of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the punishment of vice, th' immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and rest of our soule after this life, and in other such highe poinctes and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of true philosophie: then could the most famous and learned of al the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, that had for so many ages before, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their braines in contention about the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14541:170"/>
same.</p>
                  <p>Sixtlie, if Iesus had not meant plainly <note place="margin">6. Iesus life and maner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge.</note> and sincerely in al his doinges, according as he professed; he would neuer haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so seuere a course of life to himself, neither would he haue refused al temporal digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and aduanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as he did; he would neuer haue chosen to die so opprobriously in the sight of al men, nor made election of Apostles and Disciples so poore and contemptible in the world; nor if he had; would euer worldly men haue folowed him in so great multitudes, with so great seruour, zeale, constancy, and perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto death Seuenthly, we see that the first <note place="margin">7. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners &amp; first publishers of Christian religion.</note> beginners and founders of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion left by Iesus, were a multitude of simple and vnskilful persons, vnapt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue or deuise any thing of them selues. They beganne against al probabilitie of mans reason: they went forward against the streame and strength of al the world: they continued and encreased aboue humane possibilitie: they perseuered in torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and afflictions insufferable: they wrought miracles aboue the reache and compasse of mans habilitie: they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw Idolatrie, that then possessed the world, and confounded al powers infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, by the only name and vertue of their maister. They saw the propheties of Iesus fulfilled, and al his diuine speeches and predictions come to passe. They sawe the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their enimies and chief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugners to fal vpon them, in their dayes.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:14541:170"/>
They sawe euery daie whole Prouinces, Countries, and kingdomes conuerted to their faith. And finally, the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire and world besides, to subiect it self to the lawe, obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and Ghospel of their maister.</p>
                  <p>Lastly; among all other reasons and argumentes, this may be one most manifest <note place="margin">8. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of Ievves.</note> vnto vs; that wheras by many testimonies and expresse propheties of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is affirmed, that the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael should abandone, persecute, and put to death the true Messias at his comming, as before hath bene shewed; and for that facte, should it self be abandoned of God, and brought to ruine and dispersion ouer al the world; (wherin according to the wordes of Osee; <hi>they shal sitt for a long time,</hi>

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:14541:171"/>
daily they fal into more grosse ignorance and absurdities against common reason, in their later doctrine; then did the most barbarous infidels that euer were; hauing lost al sense and feeling in spiritual affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; al knowledge and vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial thinges for the life to come; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing among them no Prophet; no graue teacher; no man directed by Gods holy spirite: and finally; as men forlorne and filled with al kinde of miserie, doe both by their inward and external calamities, preach, denounce, &amp; testifie to the world, that Iesus whom they Crucified, was the only true Messias and Saucour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and that his blood, (as they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,) lieth heauilie vpon their generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore to conclude this whole <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Chapter vvith an admonishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> discourse and treatise of the proofes and euidences of our Christian religion; seing that by so manifolde and inuincible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it hath bene declared &amp; laied before our eyes, that Iesus is the only true Saucour and redeemer of the world, and consequently, that his seruice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the only waye and meane to please almightie God, and to attaine euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happines; ther remaineth now to consider, that the same Iesus, which by so many Prophets was promised to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucour; was also foretolde by the self same Prophetes, that he should be a Iudge and <note place="margin">Iesus shal be also a Iudge.</note> examiner of al our actions. Which later point, no one Prophet that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:14541:171"/>
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, hath omitted seriously to inculcate vnto vs. No, not the Sibyls them selues, who in euery place where they describe the most gracious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Virgins sonne, doe also annexe therunto his dreadful appearance at the day of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; especially in thos famous Acrosticke verses, wherof there hath <note place="margin">Apud Euse. lib. 4 in vit.

                  <p>To which description of thes Pagane Prophetes, is consona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the whole tenour <note place="margin">1. Reg. 2. Psal. 95.

And to that ende, both Iesus him self, amiddest al his sweet and comfortable speeches with his Disciples, did admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe them often of this last daie; and his Apostles, Euangelistes, &amp; Disciples after him, repeated, iterated, and vrged this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant consideration, in al their wordes

                  <p>Wherfore as by the name and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Saueour, we are greatly stirred vp to ioye, alacritie, confidence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation: so by this admonishment of Gods Saints, and of Iesus himself, that he is to be our Iudge, and seuere examiner of al the minutes and moments of our life: we are to conceyue iust feare and dread of this his second comming. And as by the whole former treatise we haue bene <note place="margin">An illatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the premisses vvith an exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> instructed, that the only waie to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is by the profession of Iesus religion: so by this accompt that shalbe demanded at our handes at the last daie, by the Authour and first institutour of this religion, we are taught, that onles we be true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s indeed, and doe performe such duties as this law and religion prescribeth vnto vs; so farre of shal we be from receyuing any benefite by the name; as our iudgment shal be the more grieuous, and our final calamitie more intollerable. For which cause, I would in sincere charitie, exhorte euery man, that by the former discourse hath receyued any light, and is confirmed in his iudgment concerning the truth of Christian religion; to employ his whole endeuours for the attaineme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the fruite and benefite therof: which is, by being a true and real Christian: for that Christ him self foresignified, that many should take the name without commoditie of their profession. And to the ende ech man may the better knowe or coniecture of

Which being knowen, it shall be easie for euerie one that is not ouer partial, or wilfullie bent to deceaue hym self, to discerne of his owne estate, and of the course and waye that he holdeth.

Of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> second fountaine, are deriued other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, conformable to that humour; as are, the denying of Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and authoritie in our Superiours; the contempt of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; th' exaggeration of the faults and defectes of our Gouernours; th' impugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of al Bishoplike dignitie, or eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical eminentie, and especially of the Sea Aposto lique, wherunto appertainet the correction of such like offendours; &amp; finally, for satisfying this deuilishe and <note place="margin">The doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</note> most pernicious veine of malice, thos wicked reprobates, doe incite and arme the people against their spiritual pastours; they enkindle factions against Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed

substitutes; they deuise a new Church, a new forme of gouernment, a new kingdome, and ecclefiastical hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie vpon earth, wherby to bring men in doubt and staggering, what or whom to beleeue, or wherunto to haue recourse in such difficulties as doe arise.</p>
               <p>Thes two maladies (I save) of Pride <note place="margin">Th' obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of S. Cyprian.</note> and Malice, haue bene the two causes of obstinate errour in al heretiques from the beginning; as ful wel noted that holy and auncient martir S. Cyprian, when he said <note place="margin">Cyprian. epist. 65. ad Rogatian.</note> so longe agoe: <q>Thes are the beginnings and original causes of heretiques and wicked schismatsques: first, to please and like wel of them selues; and then, being puffed vp with the swelling of pride, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne their gouernours &amp; superiours. Thus doe they abandone and forsake the church: thus doe they erect a prophane Altar out of the church, agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st the church: Thus doe they breake the peace and vnitie of Christ, and doe rebell against Gods holie ordination.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, as thes are the causes, either only or principal of erring i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our beleefe; <note place="margin">Many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of euill lyse.</note> most facile and easie (as we see) to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: so of errour in life &amp; maners, ther are many more occasions, causes, ofsprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and fountaines to be found. That is to saye, so many in number, as we haue euil passions, inordinate appetites, wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, or vnlauful inclinations within our mynde; euery one wherof, is the cause of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes of disordered life, and breach of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:14541:180"/>
Gods commandementes. For which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, ther is much more set doune i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for exhortation to good life, then to faith; for that the errour herein is more ordinary and easie, and more prouoked by our owne frailtie, as also by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of infinite temptations. Wherfore we read that our Saueour Iesus in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie beginning of his preaching, straight after he was baptised, &amp; had chosen vnto hym S. Peter and S. Andrew, Iames and <note place="margin">The effect of Christs first sermon. <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 6. 7.</note> Iohn, &amp; some other few Disciples, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp to the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, &amp; ther made his first most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, famous, and copious sermon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by S. Mathew in three whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; wherin he talketh of nothing els, but of vertuous life, pouertie, meekenes, iustice, puritie, sorowe for sinne, patience in suffering, contempt of riches, forgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of iniuries, fasting prayer, penance, entring by the strait gate; and finally, of perfection, holines, and integritie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation; and of the exact fulfilling of euery iote of Gods lawe and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</p>
               <p>He assured his Disciples with greate asseueration, that he came not to breake <note place="margin">Math. 5. v. 20.</note> the law, but to fulfil the same; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentelie, whosoeuer should breake the least of his commaundementes, and should so teache men to doe; that is, should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer <note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> therein, without repentance, and so by his example drawe other men to doe the like: should haue no place in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Againe, he exhorted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:14541:181"/>
most earnestlie to be lightes, and to shyne by good workes, to all the world, and that excepte their iustice did exceede the iustice of Scribes and pharises, (which was but ordinarie and external,) they <note place="margin">Ibid. v. 21.</note> could not be saued. He told them plainlie, they might not serue two masters in this life, but either must forsake God or aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Mammon. He cried vnto them, <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,</hi> stand attent, and consider well your <note place="margin">Cap. 6. Cap. 7.</note> state and condition: and then againe; <hi>seeke to enter by the straite gate.</hi> And lastlie, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that th' onlie trial of a good tree, is the good fruite which it yeeldeth; without which fruite, let the tree be neuer so faire or pleasant to the eye, yet, is it to be cut downe &amp; burned; &amp; that not euerie one who shal say or crie vnto hym, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> at the last daye should be saued, or enter into the kingdome of heauen; but onlie such, as did execute in deedes, the wil and commaundementes of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this life. For want wherof, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth them, that manie at that daye, who had not onlie belieued, but also donne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in his name, should be denied, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, and abandonned by hym.</p>
               <p>Which longe lesson of vertuous life, being the first that euer our Saueour gaue in publique to his Disciples then newlie <note place="margin">Faith is not sufficient vvithout vvorckes.</note> gathered together, as S. Mathew noteth; (hauing treated verie litle of pointes of faith before, but onlie in general by some miracles and preachinge, hauinge shewed hymself to be the true Messias:) doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14541:181"/>
teache vs, that it is not enoughe to beleeue in Iesus, and to make professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his name and doctrine; except we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our lyues and actions accordinge to the prescript of his commaundmentes. For albeit in Christian religion, faith be the first and principal foundation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon all the rest is to be stayed and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: yet as in other material buildinges, after the foundation is layed, ther remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching faith &amp; vvorks.</note> the greatest labour, time, cost, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and diligence, to be bestowed vpon the framinge and furnishinge of other partes that must insue: euen so in this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial edifice or buildinge of our soule, hauing layed once the foundation and grounde of true beliefe, (which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian oftentimes dispacheth in the space of <note n="*" place="margin">In lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme.</note> one weekes learninge;) the rest of al our life, time, labour, and studies, is to be employed in the perfecting of our life and actions, and as it were, in raising vp the walles &amp; other partes of our spiritual buil ding, by the exercise of al vertues, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent obseruation of Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Without the which, our faith is to no more purpose or profite, then is a foundation without a building vpon it, or a stocke or tree that beareth no fruite. Which thinge S.

Paul, that only faith was sufficient to saue them: S. Austine and other auncient fathers were of opinion, that not only thes last wordes of S. Iames, &amp; the whole discourse which he maketh of this matter in that chapter; but also both his and all other Apostles writinges, set forth and published after S.

But S. Iames of al other, is most vehement against al such, as thinke that faith can suffice to saluation without good workes; in so much, as he compareth them to the deuils the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, saying: <hi>Doest thou belieue that there is one God? thou doestvvel:</hi>

               <head>OF THE TWO PRINCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PAL POINTES THAT DOE APPERTAINE TO A Christian life; that is to saye: <hi>To resist all synne, and to excercise all kynde of vertue; vvith the meanes and methode hovv to perfourme them both.</hi> CHAPT. VI.</head>
               <p>SVPPOSINGE that in the partes of this booke which ensue, we are to deale only with suche, as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed and settled in true Christian faith; (wherunto we haue <note place="margin">The reason of this Chapter.</note> proued before, that vertuous life and good deeds are necessarily to be adioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,) it semeth conuenient in this place, to treate of the pointes or pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipal partes belonging therunto. Which partes, are briefly prescribed by God hym self, in the writinges of Dauid, Esaie, and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes <note place="margin">Psal. 36. Esa. 1.</note> of the olde testament, exhorting men, <hi>to decline from vice, and to embrace ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:14541:186"/>
But much more plainly by S. Peter, S. Paul, and other Apostles of the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal law: the first affirming, that the fruite and effect of Christes death and passion was; <hi>that vve being dead to sinne: should liue to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. Tit. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Iustice:</hi> and the other adioining; <hi>that the grace of God our saueour, appeared to al men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing vs to this ende, that vve renouncing al vvickeanes, should liue iustly and godly in this vvorld.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which testimonies of holy write, <note place="margin">The tvvo partes of good life.</note> is made cleare and euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the whole dutie of a good Christian, is reduced to thes two heades or principles; to wit, to the resistance of al euil, and to th' exercise of al pretie and vertue. In respect of the first wherof, our life is called in holie scripture, a warfare vpon earth; and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <note place="margin">Iob. 7. 2. Cor. 10.</note> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are termed souldiours; for that, as good souldiours doe lye in continual wayte to resist their ennemies: so vigilant Christians doe carefully stand vpon their watche, for resisting the suggestions and temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of sinne. In regarde of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 10 20. Tim. 5.</note> pointe, we are named labourers, husbandmen, sowers, marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, bankers, stewards, fermers, and the like; and our whole life is termed a marte and trafique; for that, as thes kinde of people, doe atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to their gaine and encrease of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral riches in this life: so ought we to applie our selues wholy, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual exercise of good workes, for augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation of our merite and treasure in the world to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:14541:186"/>
Thes then are the two partes of a good Christian life; the two principal pointes wherupon we should meditate; the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises wherin we should be occupied; the two legges wherupon we should walke towards our Countrie; the two armes wherwith we should laye faste-hand on Godes eternal kingdome; the two winges wherby we must flie and mount vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that, whosoeuer doth want any one <note place="margin">One of thes partes not auailable vvithout the other.</note> of thes two partes, albeit he had the other; yet can he neuer ascende to Godes blisse; no more then a bird can flie, being maimed of one of her winges. My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is; that neither integritie of life, is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without good workes; nor good workes auailable, without a pure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled life. The later is made cleare by Gods owne speeches, to the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; whos sacrifices, oblations, praiers, and other such workes; that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and commaunded by hymself, he oftentimes reiected, and accompted abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, for that the presentours and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitours <note place="margin">Esa. 1. Iere. 6. Amos. 5.</note> therof, were men of impious and wicked conuersation. The former also is apparantly shewed, by Christes parable of the foolishe virgins; who albeit they were Virgins, and incontaminate from sinne: yet because they lacked the oile of good workes, to giue light in their lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes: they were excluded from the mariage banquet, as also that other most infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note place="margin">Mat. 25. Luc. 13.</note> fellow was, who wanted his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ornament. Both thes pointes then
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:14541:187"/>
are necessarie to a Christian mans salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; that so necessarie; as the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other is not auailable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND FOR THE FIRST,</hi> which is resisting of sinne; we are commaunded by <note place="margin">THE. 1. parte of resisting sinne.</note> Godes holy worde, to doe it manfully, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantly, and constantly. And S. Paul ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth moreouer; that in this resistance, we ought to striue euen vnto death, and to the <note place="margin">Heb. 10. Ephe. 5. Iac. 4. 1. Pet. 5.</note> shedding of our last blood, if occasion doe require. The same are we taught by diuers other Apostles and Saintes in Christes Church, exhorting and instructing vs to this fight and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat with the flesh, world, &amp; deuil, that entice vs to sinne. For proofe wherof, it shal suffice in this place, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage thos last wordes of Iob, which doe conclude his large discourse of the most dreadful power and crueltie of Leuiatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; <hi>Memento belli;</hi> 
                  <q>be not vnmindeful of the <note place="margin">Iob. 40.</note> warre, which thou wagest with this ennimy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which warre and resistance, is to be <note place="margin">Hovv per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce must be.</note> performed with such exquisite diligence, and firme resolution on our behalf: as it behoueth vs, not only to withstand the committing of any one actual sinne; but also the very consent of minde therunto.

                  <note place="margin">Tob. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>any sinne.</hi> Concerning which thing, it is briefly to be noted, that sinne may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted either in deed or in wil alone. And to this later kinde, al diuines agree, and proue it by S. Iames, that ther are three <note place="margin">Iacob. 4.</note>

                  </note> conuinceth vs alwaies of iniquitie. Or to vse the verie wordes of S. Gregorie the great. <hi>In Suggestion, is the seede of sinne; in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation, the norrishment; in Consent, the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> So that, who soeuer doth but only yeeld consent of minde to the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any vnlauful act, so farr foorth, as he would committ the same, if he had time, place, and abilitie therunto: is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by holy write, in the guilt of that sinne, as deeply, as if in deed he had now actuallie committed the same. So Christ <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> him self, in the matter of adulterie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly pronounced, and long before that, <note place="margin">Exod. 12. Deut. 5.</note> by the mouth of Moyses, he determined the like in other offenses of the people of Israel.</p>
               <p>In consideration of which seuere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, it is most wonderful and dreadful to consider, (our selues being so <note place="margin">The dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of auncient auncient in resisting sinne.</note> negligent herein as we are,) what great attention, watche, care, and feare, holy Saintes of God in times past had, in this point of resisting sinne, and the very first motions and temptations therof. In times past (I saie) in thos blessed daies of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, when the spirite of God was yet hoate and boiling in the breastes of his deuout seruants, and when recheles sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualitie
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:14541:188"/>
had not so ouerwhelmed the world as now it hath. We read of the iust and most blessed man Iob, that notwithstanding all his integritie &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <note place="margin">Of Iob.</note> of life; yet did he diligently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse and feare euery the least of his owne <note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note> actions; being wel assured (as he prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,) that God doth not pardon such as are negligent, and doe offend him therin. Holy Dauid also, though he were a king; yet did he euery night, <hi>brushe or svveepe his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of Dauid.</note> 
                  <hi>spiri e,</hi> by dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t examination or the very <note place="margin">Psal. 76.</note> cogitations and inward motions of his hart. In which exercise S. Paul, that most <note place="margin">Of S. Paul.</note> worthie Apostle and exact obseruer of his maisters commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, was so precise and careful; as albeit he were assaulted with many strong and violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the flesh, by Satans suggestion: yet by his owne diligent resistance together with the assistance of Gods holy grace, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> which was giuen vnto him particularly for that combat; he preserued his minde so pure and vnspotted from al blot of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: as after the victorie obtained, he durst affirme of him self, that to his knowledge, he was guiltie of no fault or <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> offence.</p>
               <p>For better obtaining of which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, it is most probable, that he vsed <note place="margin">External helpes for the resisting of sinne. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> thos external helpes &amp; remedies of much fasting, lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g praying, paineful watchig, &amp; rigourous chastising of his owne bodie, which he mentioneth in his writinges. To which ende appertained in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

the same and like exercises recorded by S. Paul and other writers, to haue bene <note place="margin">1.

So Egisippus, Eusebius, and others doe make wonderful <note place="margin">Egis apud Enseb. li. 2. lust. cap. 23. <hi>Of S. Iames</hi>
                  </note> narrations of the strait diet, apparrel, and forme of life vsed by S.

The like or rather more straunge thinges, doth Philo <note place="margin">Philo. lib. 4. de vit. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. <hi>Of S. Mark</hi>

ende, to enhable them selues the better to stand in the fight and bataile against al wickednes and sinne. This was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of austeritie of life, in thos first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and founders of our religion. This was the cause of first leauing the world <note place="margin">The reason of Monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal life in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge.</note> and flying to the desert. This was the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of al Monasteries, Cloisters, Eremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, Celles, &amp; Solitarie habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And finally, this was the reason of al breach and separation from flesh and blood, and from al wordly conuersation; therby to eschue al occasions of external tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by that meanes, to gather the more force and strength, for resistance of the internal. In which internal conflict not with standing, the combat oftentimes was so sharpe and vehement; as it is most wonderful to consider, what is recorded by the forsaid writers, touching assaults endured in this behalfe, by thos auncient Saintes that had left the world, and what extreme paines and afflictions they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined willingly, for continuing their resistance against their spiritual aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Which thinges were sett doune (no doubt) &amp; left writen to vs by Gods holie prouidence, for our confusion that now liue, who are so careles and negligent in resustinge th' assaultes and temptations of synne as we make no accompt or estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ther of at all.</p>

I sat alone, for that I was replenished with sorowe and bitternes. The partes of my bodie were now become deformed, and vglie with continual wearing of my sacke: and my skinne was as blacke, as the skinne of an Ethiopian. I wept daily and passed my time continually in groning: And when at length, sleepe came vpon me against my wil; I laic doune &amp; did beate my bare bones, scarse hanging togither, against the ground. Of my meate &amp; drincke I wil <note place="margin">The auste risie of olde Mounkes.</note> saie nothing; wheras in this place, we that are Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, doe vse only colde water euen when we be sicke, and doe thincke it a great delicacie to taste any one thing that sauoureth of the fire.</q>

did cast my self doune at the feet of Iesus: I did bathe the ground about me with <note place="margin">S.

I am not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to confesse this miserie of my wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched estate.

that the time of this our life, is nothing els but a certaine season alotted vs, wheri to sowe &amp; plant; nothing els, but a fayer or marte wherin to trafique, negotiate, &amp; make our exchaunge for the kingdome of heauen.

So vtterly faileth the whole world at this daie, in performing this point of doing good deedes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore to drawe to a conclusion of this whole chapter: it may appeare by <note place="margin">The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Christian vocation, if it vvere fulfilled.</note> that which hitherto hath bene said; first, what a perfect and most excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a good Christian is; whos life is nothing els but a continual warfare and resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of al sinne, both I thought, word, and deed; and an incessant exercise of al pietie and good workes, which his hand or hart may possibly performe. Which kinde of life, if it were exactly fulfilled, in such sort as it was prescribed by Christ the authour of our profession: most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that the common weale of Christianitie, should be a most heauenly, blessed; and Angelical estate vpon earth, wherin no fraude, no deceipt, no malice, no contention, no wickednes, iniustice, or violence should raigue: and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either few or no te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral lawes should be necessarie for punishment of the same. For that by the only lawe of religion and conscience, al would be simplicitie, al pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, al truth and honestie, concorde, loue, and charitie, one towardes the other; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we read, that it fel out in the first daies
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14541:196"/>
and ages of Christian religion, when this lawe of conscience was yet obserued. But now, for that the world hath abandoned commonlie in euery place, thes two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal partes of Christian dutie, (I meane the resistance of synne, and performance of good workes:) the most part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are become more sensual, and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in maners and life, then euer were the more ciuile part of Gentiles and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideles; which is a most intollerable and supreme dishonour to our Saueour, that gaue his life for reducing vs to a better conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For which cause, in al reason, right, and equitie, the punishment of such vnworthie Christians, must needs be farre greater at the later daie, then of the verse Paganes, who had not that light and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for their direction; according to that speech of Christ to certaine ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Townes &amp; places wherin he had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:<q> woe be to thee Corozain: woe be to the Bethsaida; for that, if the like thinges <note place="margin">Mat. 11.

vsed therin,) is called here by Christ, a iudgment and tribunal, wherin sentence of life or death is to be pronounced.</p>
               <p>Of which iudgmente or accompting daye, the scripture noteth vnto vs two <note place="margin">Tvvo daies of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> kindes. The first wherof is called a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer iudgment, for that it is exercised vpon euerie soule immediately after her departure from the bodie, according to the wordes of holie S. Paul; <hi>It is appointed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Particuler. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 2. General.</note> 
                  <hi>for euery man once to die, and after that to haue his iudgment.</hi> The second is called a general iudgment, for that it shal be executed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the world together at the last daie, when mankinde shalbe translated from this terrestrial habitation. And of this iudgement, are to be vnderstood aswel thos former wordes of Christ, touching his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in glorie, as also infinite other places and passages of Scripture, which doe forewarne and admonish vs of this most dreadful daie. And albeit in the first particuler iudgment, eche soule that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth hence, receyueth an irrevocable sentence, either of life or death eternal, (as may appeare by the examples of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus <note place="margin">Iuc. 16.</note> and of the riche glutton, wherof the one was determined to euerlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and the other to eternal torments immediatly vpon their separation from this world:) yet are ther alleaged by the holie Saintes of God, diuers most cleare, facile, and euident reasons, why his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wisdome, besides that first priuate and particuler daie of trial, hath ordained
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:14541:200"/>
also this second, which shalbe publicke, manifest, and vniuersal.</p>
               <p>The first wherof, is; that the bodie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> man rising from his sepulcher at that daie, <note place="margin">Fovver reasones vvhie ther is a second iudgement.</note> may be partaker of eternal punishment or glorie with the soule, euen as in this life, it was participant of the vertues or vices which the soule did exercise. The second reason is; for that as Christ was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> contemptible in this world, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured publiquily, and put to confusion with his Saints after him in the sight of al men: so was it conuenient that once in this world, he should shewe his power and maiestie, and that in the sight of al his creatures together, but especially of his wicked enimies, who after that daie are neuer to see or beholde him more. The third is; that both wicked sinners &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> blessed Sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of God, might receyue their rewardes and final paimentes openly, in the sight and hearing of eche other; to the more hart breake and confusion of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and triumpha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ioye of the vertuous, who commonly in this world, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, ouerborne, and troden doune by the other. The fourth and last is; for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> men when they die, doe not commonly cary with them al the good or euil which they haue wrought; hauing left behinde them diuers thinges, which may encrease their merite or demerite after their deathes: as are their examples; their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions gyuen to other; their temporal faculties or abilities; bookes, preachings,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14541:201"/>
exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; other like meanes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by good or euil may proceede after their departure. The reward wherof, can not so conueniently be assigned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiles this world endureth, for that their ioyes or punishmentes in the places wher they are, may daily be augmented, by the hurt or good that may be wrought in the world, by thos meanes which they left behind them.</p>
               <p>So diuines doe holde, (for examples <note place="margin">Oh that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider vvel this reason.</note> sake) that the glorie of S. Paul is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed daily in heauen, and shalbe vnto the worlds ende, by reason of them that daily doe profite by his writing and rare exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar life vpon earth: as also on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie part, that the tormentes of Arrius, Sabellius, and other wicked heretiques; <note place="margin">Heretikes.</note> are continually augmented, by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with their seditious and pestilent writiges. The like they holde of dissolute <note place="margin">Loose Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> Poets and other loose writers, which haue left behind them lasciuious, wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and carnal deuises; as also of negligent parents, maisters, or teachers, who by <note place="margin">Euil Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</note> their rechelesnes and euil examples gaue occasion to corrupte the children, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, or seruants committed to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment and instruction. But after this general daie of iudgment once past, their shalbe no more place of meriting either good or euil; for that the world then and ther shal receyue an ende, and a final sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be pronounced of what soeuer
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14541:201"/>
hath passed from the first foundation and establishment therof.</p>

                     <hi>HEL</hi> folowed behinde him; and he had authoritie giuen to him, to slea by sword, by death, and by the beastes of the earth.

And at thes daies men shal seeke death and shal not finde it. And thes locustes were like <note place="margin">VVo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful locustes.</note> barbed horses, with Crounes on their heads. Their faces like men, their heare like women, their teeth like lions, and the noise of their winges, like the noise of many chariotes running together; their tales like scorpio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and their stinges were in their tailes: their king was an Angel of hel, named Abbado<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth an vtter destroier. At the sixt blast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of the trumpet were loosed foure Angels tied before; &amp; then rushed forth an army of horsmen in number twentie hundreth times te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thousand.

thes horses were as lions, &amp; out of their mouthes came fire, smoke, and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, wherby they slewe the third part of men which had not repented; and their strength was in their tales, which were like serpentes. Then was ther an Angel which putting one foote vpon the sea, &amp; an other vpon the land, did sweare by him that liueth for euer and euer, that after the blast of the seuenth trumpet, ther should be no more time. And so when the seuenth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Angel had sounded, ther came great voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">Apoc. 11.</note> from heauen, saying; the kingdome of this world is made to our Lord and his Christ, and he shal raigne foreuer.</q>
               <p>
                  <q>And I heard a great voice saying to the seuen Angels; goe and poure out seuen <note place="margin">Apoc. 16.

The leco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d turned the sea into redde blood. The third turned the riuers and fountaines into like blood. The fourth, afflicted men with fire and made them blaspheme God. The fifte made them eate their owne tongues for sorowe. The sixt dried vp the water. And I sawe three foule spirites like frogges, issue out of the mouth of a dragon. And finally the seuenth cuppe being poured out, ther came a mightie voice from the throne of God, saying; it is dispatched.

And that (which yet is more) he can not abide nor permit the sinner to praise him, or to name his testament with his mouth, as the Holie Ghost testifieth. and therfore no meruaile if he shew such seueritie against him at the last daye, whom he so extremelie hateth &amp; abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this life.</p>
               <p>Of which great hatred there might be manie reasons alleaged; as the vndutiful transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of godes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes; the great ingratitude of a sinner in respect of his diuine benefites, and such other: which might iustifie sufficientlie his indignation and seuere hatred against him. But there is one reason aboue al the rest, which openeth the verie fountaine <note place="margin">The reason vvhy God so hateth a sinner.</note> and origine of the matter; and this is, the intollerable iniurie donne vnto almightie God, in euerie mortall sinne that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: which in deede is so opprobrious &amp; abhominable an iniurie; as no meane worldly potentate could beare the same at his subiectes handes, and much lesse God
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:14541:214"/>
him self (being the omnipotent Lord of al glorie and Maiestie,) may in reason tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate an outrage so often iterated against him, as is sinne daily committed by the wicked.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderstanding of which iniurie, we are to consider, that euerie time we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit a mortal sinne, there doth passe thorough our hart &amp; minde (though we marke it not,) a certaine practik discourse of our vnderstandinge, (as there doth also in euerie other electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) whereby we lay before vs on the one side, the profit of that sinne which we are tempted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; that is to saie, the pleasure which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth vs therunto: and on thother parte, the offence of God, which is, the leesinge of his grace and frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dshippe by that sinne, yf we yeeld vnto it. And thus hauinge as it were the balances there before vs, and setting God in one end therof, and in the <note place="margin">The iniurie done to God by sinne.</note> other the aforesaide pleasure; we stand in the middest deliberatinge &amp; examininge the waight of both partes; and finallie doe make choise of the pleasure, and reiect almightie God: that is; we chuse rather to loose the fauour of God, together with his grace, and whatsoeuer he is worth besides, then to lacke that pleasure and delectation of sinne. Now then, what can be more opprobrious and horrible then this? what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be more reprochful to God, then to prefer a most vile pleasure before his infinite Maiestie? is not this farre more intollerable, then the disgrace offred to
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:14541:214"/>
him by the Iewes, when they made choise of Barrabas the murderer, and reiected <note place="margin">Mat. 17. Marc. 15.</note> Iesus their Saueour? surely, how hamous soeuer that sinne of the Iewes were, yet in two poites this doth seeme to exceede the same. First, in that the Iewes knew not whome they refused in their choise, as we doe. Secondly, in that they refused Iesus but once, wheras we refuse him both dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hourly, whensoeuer in our hartes we giue consent vnto mortal sinne.</p>
               <p>And is it meruaile then, that God dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth so seuerely &amp; sharplye with sinners in the worlde to come, whoe doe vse hym so opprobriouslie and contemptuouslie in this life? Vndoubtedly the malice of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is greate towardes God, and he doth <note place="margin">The malice of a sinner tovvardes God.</note> not onlie dishonour hym by contempt of his commaundementes, and by preferring most vyle creatures before hym: but also beareth a secrete hatred &amp; grudge against his maiestie, and woulde (if it lay in his power) offer his endeuour to pull hym out of his seate, or (at the least wise) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in his hart, there were no God at all to punish sinne after this present lyfe. Let euerie sinner examine the botome of his conscience in this point, whether he could not be content, there were no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of the sowle, no reckoninge after this life, no iudge, no punishment, no hell; and consequentlye no God at al; to the ende he might the more securelie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye his pleasures?</p>
               <p>And because God (who searcheth the

harte and reynes) seethe well this most <note place="margin">Sap. 1. Rom. 8. Psal. 7.</note> vndutiful &amp; trayterous affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towardes hym, lurking within the bowels of sinful men, (how smoth so euer their wordes may be:) here of it commeth, that in the whole course of holie Scripture, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth them for his enimies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth open warre and hostilitie against them. And then suppose yoa, what a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">Rom. 5. Lacob 4. 1. Ioh. 3.</note> case thes vnfortunate men are in, (being but seely wormes and wretches of the earth,) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue so puissant an enimie to fight against them, as doth make the verie heauens to tremble at his looke. And yet that the case is so; heare what himself sayeth, what he threatneth, what he thundreth out against them. After he had by the mouth of Esaye the Prophet re peated many sinnes abhominable in his sight, as the taking of bribes, oppressing <note place="margin">Sinners ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God and God to them.</note> of poore people, and the like: He defieth the doers therof, as his open enymies, saying: <hi>This saieth the Lord God of hostes, the stronge Lord of Israel: Beholde I vvi. be reuenged vpon mine enimies, and vvill comfort my self in their destruction.</hi> And the Prophet Dauid, as he was a man in most high fauour with God, and made preuie to his secretes aboue many other: so he (more than any other,) doth expresse this seuere meaning of God, &amp; his infinite displeasure against sinners; calling them his enimies, vessels of his wrath, and ordayned to eternal ruine and destruction; and complaineth that the world will not beleeue this
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:14541:215"/>
point. <hi>An vnvvise man</hi> (saieth he) <hi>vvill not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 90.</note> 
                  <hi>learne this, neither vvill the foole vnderstand it.</hi> And what is this ô holy Prophet? it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; <hi>That siners and vvorkers of iniquitie (after they haue appeared i the vvorld) doe perishe euerlastingly.</hi> And what is the reason of this? he answereth immediatly: <hi>because toy enimies (o Lord,) thy enimies</hi> (I saie) <hi>o Lord, shal perishe, &amp; til they that vvoreke iniquitie shalbe cosumed.</hi> Wherby we see, that all sinners be eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, and God to them, as also vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what grounde and reason.</p>
               <p>But yet (for the further iustifyinge of godes seueritie,) let vs consider in what measure his hatred is towardes sinne; how great; how far it proceedeth; withi what boundes it is comprehended; or whether it haue any limites or bondes at all, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be infinite and without limitation. And to vtter the matter as in trueth it sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; <note place="margin">Godshatred is infinite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne and vvhie.</note> if all the tongues in the world were made one tongue, and all the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of all creatures (I meane of Angels and men) were made one vnderstandinge: yet, could nether this tongue expresse, nor this vnderstanding conceiue, the great hatred of gods harte towards euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinne which we commit. And the reason hereof standeth in two pointes. First, for that God by how much more he is better than we are: by so much more he loueth goodnes and hateth synne, than we doe. And for that he is infinitelie good: therfore his loue to goodnes is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and his hatred to euil, immesurable;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:14541:216"/>
and consequentlie, his rewardes to them both, are infinite; the one in hell, with euerlasting miserie; thother in heauen, by eternal felicitie.</p>
               <p>Secondlie; we see by experience, that how much more great and worthie the <note place="margin">VVhy eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</note> person is, against whom an offence is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; so much greater is alwayes the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: as for example, the self same blow or iniurie offred to a bond-slaue and to a prince, differeth greatlie in qualitie and in the nature of offence; and consequentlie, deserueth farre different hatred and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. And for that euerie mortal sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne which we commit, is donne directlie against the person of God hym self, as hath bene declared before, whose digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is infinite: therfore the offence or guilt of euery such sinne is infinite, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, deserueth infinite hatred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite punishment at gods handes. Hereof foloweth the reason of diuers thinges both sayed and donne by God in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and taught by diuines towching the punishments of sinne, which seeme verie straunge vnto the wisedome of the <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.

As first of al; the most dreadful pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of eternal and irreuocable dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of so manie thowsandes, or rather millions of Angels, that were created to <note place="margin">The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Angels.</note> glorie with almost infinite perfection, &amp; that for one onlie sinne, but once commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that onlye in thought, as diuines are of opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:14541:216"/>
Secondlie, the rigourous punishment <note place="margin">Of Adam and Eu</note> of our first parents Adam and Eue, and al their posteritie, for the eatinge of a seely aple; for which fault, besides the chastisinge of the offenders themselues, and al the creatures of the earth for the same, and al their children and ofspring after them, both before our redemption and after; (for albeit we are deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the guilte of that sinne, yet te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes doe remaine vpon vs for the same, as hunger, thirst, cold, sicknes, death, and a thousand other miseries:) besides also the infinite soules, damned for the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comming of Christ, by the space offower thousand yeres; as also since, as wel, infidels, which are not baptized, as others: besides al this I say, (which in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reason maye seeme seuere enough:) gods wrath and iustice could not be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly satisfied, except his owne onlie sonne had come downe into the worlde, &amp; take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our flesh vpon him, and by his paines &amp; death made satisfaction for the same.

Which, how great a losse it is, we may esteeme in part, by the state of a worldly princes seruant and fauorite, who being in highe grace and credit with his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine, should by some one great offence lose al his fauour at one instant, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre his mortal hatred and displeasure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he leeseth all his inheritance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> clayme, and title to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> which is due onlie by grace, as S.

Fourthlie, he looseth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the quiet, ioye, and tranquillitie of a good conscience, and all the fauours, cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, consolations, and other comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, wherwith the holie Ghost is wont to visite the mides of the Iust. Fifthly, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the merit and rewarde of his good workes done al his life before, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he doth, or shal doe, while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in that miserable and sinful state. Sixtlie, he maketh hym self guiltie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> eternall punishment, and enrolleth his name in the booke of perdition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentlie,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:14541:220"/>
byndeth hym self to althose miseries and inconueniences, wherunto the reprobate are subiect; that is to saie, to be an inheritour of hel and damnation; to be in the power of the deuill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; to be thral to synne and euerie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation <note place="margin">Esa. 13.</note> therof; and his sowle (which was before the temple of the holy ghost, the habitation of the blessed Trinitie, the spouse of God, &amp; place of repose for holy Angels to visit:) now to be a de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, <note place="margin">The leesing of Christ by sinne.</note> a nest of scorpions, a dongeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles, a sincke &amp; swine-stie of al filth and abhomination, and hym self a companion of the miserable damned spirites.</p>
               <p>Lastlye, he abandoneth Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth al the interest and portion he had with hym, treading hym vnder his feete, defiling his most pretious blood, &amp; Crucifying hym againe (as S. Paul auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,) in that he sinneth agaist him, who died for sinne, and maketh hym self a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutour of his redeemer. For which cause <note place="margin">Heb. 10. Heb. 6. Rom. 6.</note> the same Apostle pronounceth a most hard and heauie sentence against such men, in thes wordes: <hi>If vve synne vvillfullye novv</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. Rom. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>after vve haue receyued knovvledge of the trueth: there remaineth no more sacrifice for synnes, but rather a certaine terrible expectation of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, and rage of fyre, vvhich shall consume the aduersaries.</hi> To which S. Peter agreeth, <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> when he saieth: <hi>It had bene better not to haue knovve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vvay of iustice, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after such knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to slyde backe agayne from the holye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement vvhich vvas gyuen.</hi>

This being so; let sinful worldlinges goe now and solace them selues in their <note place="margin">Fonde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses of sume.</note> vanities and wato<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, as much as they lift.

But this is a mere madnes, and a voluntarie deluding of our selues; for that God hym self by his sacred word, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth vs to reason after an other sashion. Which I wil here breefly touch, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euery prudent Christian seriously to examine the same.</p>
               <p>At what time the great Apostle of the Gentiles S.

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:14541:221"/>
by God,) and thos which Christians doe commit after their Redemption; he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this collection concerning Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice due vnto them both, saing: <hi>If God spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the naturall boughes; take heede least he spare not thee.</hi> And there-vpon he inferreth <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> this admonition, <hi>noli altum sapere, sed time,</hi> Be not high minded, but feare. Againe, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth thus vpon the olde and the new lawe. <q>He that brake the lawe of Moyses, being conuicted by two or three witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> died for the same without commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or mercye: &amp; how much more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous punishment then doth he deserue, who breaking the law of Christ by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sinne, treadeth the Sonne of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feete, polluteth the bloode of the new testament, and reprocheth the holie Ghost?</q> In like maner reasoneth S. Peter and S. Iude towching the sinne of Angels and ours. <q>If God spared not the Angels <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. Ep. Iud.</note> when they sinned, but did thrust them downe to hell, there to be tormented, and to be reserued vnto iudgement with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall chaines vnder darckenes: how much lesse will he spare vs? And agayne; if the Angels which passe vs in power and <note place="margin">2.

               </p>
               <p>By al which examples, we are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.</note> how to reason maturely &amp; sincerely
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:14541:221"/>
in our owne cause. As for example, eche <note place="margin">A good maner of reasoninge.</note> man may truly saie thus vnto hym self: if God haue punished so seuerelie one sinne in the Angels, in Adam, and in others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> recited: what shall I looke for, which haue committed so manie sinnes against hym? If God haue damned so manie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> soules for lesser sinnes then mine, are: what will he do to me for mine that are farre greater? If God haue borne longer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with me, then he hath done with many other whom he hath cut of, without ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them of repentance: what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is there, that he should beare longer with me? If Dauill and others after their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> synnes forgyuen, tooke such paines in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting them selues, for satisfaction of the temporal punishement in this life: what punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t remaineth for me, either here or in the wold to come, for satisfaction of so manie sinnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted? If it be true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that our Sauvour saith, that the waye is <note place="margin">Math. 7. Luc. 13.</note> harde, and the gate narrow wherby men goe into heauen, and that they shal aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for euerie ydle worde before they <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> enter therein: what shal become of me that doe liue so easie a life, and doe keepe no accounte at al of my deedes, and much lesse of my wordes? If good men in olde time did take such paines for their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet (as S.

               <p>

Thes argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, consequentes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, are more true (good Christian,) and would proue more profitable vnto vs, if we would excercise our selues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and therby enter into some cogitation of our owne daungers, and into iust feare of Gods seuere iudgementes, without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringe or deceyuinge our selues. For wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherof either onlie or principallie, the most parte of enormous sinnes from time to time are committed, according as holy Dauid most euidentlie declareth, when <note place="margin">Tvvo prin cipal causes of deceaui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g our selues.</note> hauing shewed and detested the multitude of sinnes which the world committeth; he reduceth (al as it were,) vnto two prin cipal causes. Wherof the first is, that men deceyue them selues and others, by vaine flatterie, in deminishing their sinnes; of whom he saith: <hi>they are taken in their ovvne deuises, for that they praise the vvicked man in the lustes &amp; desires of his ovvne minde.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note place="margin">Psal. 9.</note> is, for that this deceipt and flatterie is referred commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie by the vitious man, to the driuing of Gods iudgementes out of his memorie, to the end he may sinne with lesse feare and scruple. For so saith the prophet expresselie; <hi>The sinner hath exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperated God against him, (in that he hath said,) god in the multitude of his vvrath, vvil not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an accounte of my doinges.</hi> But what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ensueth of this? heare the wordes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie folowing: <hi>he hath not God before his eyes; his vvayes are filthie from time to time.</hi> And what is the cause of al this? <hi>for that thy iudgementes (o Lord) are remoued from his sight:</hi>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:14541:222"/>
that is; for that he wil not see, he wil not behold, he wil not heare, he wil not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider or beare in mind thy iudgementes, ô Lord, but wil needes flatter, delude, and deceyue hym self. Herof it commeth, that he neuer maketh an end of his filthie life &amp; wicked wayes, but exasperateth thie iustice o Lord, against him, vntil it be ouer late to repent or amende. Thus said this holie Sainte, of wicked sinners: but what of him self? heare his wordes (deare brother) and imprint them in thie memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <hi>I haue kept the vvayes of my Lord,</hi> (saith he,) <hi>&amp; haue not donne vvickedlie in the sight of</hi>

For that Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were continuallie before his eyes; therfore was his life pure, and voide of wickednes; or as in other wordes at an other time he expresseth; <hi>I vvil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse vnto</hi>

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:14541:224"/>
to adde a reason or two in this chapter, wherby it maye appeare, how great our offence is, in sinni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g against God as we doe; and how righteous his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; iustice are agaist vs, for the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND FIRST OF AL IS</hi> to be considered, the maiestie of hym, against <note place="margin">THE. 1. part. MAIESTIE of God.</note> whom we sinne. For most certaine it is, (as I haue noted before,) that euerie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is so much the greater and more grieuous, by how much greater and more noble the person is, against whom it is done, and the partie offending, more base and vile. And in this respect, almightie God (to terrifie vs from offending hym,) nameth hym self oftentimes with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine great and dreadful titles of maiestie; as to Abraham: <hi>I am an omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Lord.</hi> And <note place="margin">Gen. 17.

               </p>
               <p>First then I saye, consider (gentle Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) of what an infinite maiestie he is, whom thow a poore worme of the earth, hast so often and so contemptuously offended i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this lyfe.

maister; yet when Christ appeared vnto him after his Resurrection, with certaine sparcles only of his dreadful gloric, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">Certaine de clar. ilio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Gods Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.</note> words of most sweet consolation vnto hym; he was for al that, so astonied &amp; oppressed with feare, that he fel doune starke dead, as him self confesseth, vntil the same his Lord and Maister, vouchsafed to raise him vp againe. The like trial of this inexplicable maiestie, had Moyses the familiar friend and trustie seruant of God; who after many conferences, desiring once in his life to see him, whos wordes he had so often heard; made humble peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the same. But God answered, that no man might see hym and lyue. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, to satisfie his request, and to shew him in parte what a terrible and maiesticall God he was: he promised Moyses, that he should see some part of <note place="margin">Exod. 33.</note> his glorie; how beit he added, that it was needfull he shoulde hyde him self in the hole of a rocke, &amp; be couered with Gods owne handes for his defence, whiles he, (or rather his Angel as diuines doe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete,) did passe by in glorie. Who being once past; God remoued his hande, and suffered Moyses to behold the hynder par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes only of the Angel, which was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding most terrible and dreadful.</p>
               <p>The same maiestie was reuealed also in some part to Daniel, who sawe God (as he writeth) placed vpon a most glorious <note place="margin">Dan. 7.</note> throne; <hi>his apparell vvas as vvhit as snovv; bis beare lyke vnto fyne vvoolle; bis throne vvas of</hi>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:14541:226"/>
                  <hi>a flame of fyre, and his chariottes vvere a burning furnace; a svvift flud of fyre ranne from his face; thousand thousandes did serue him, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand hundred thousands did assist him:</hi> Al this and much more is recorded in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to admonishe vs therby, what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful prince of maiestie he is, whom a synner doth offend. Which thing that iust and holie man Iob considering; and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring but one word vttered by his friend which in his conceit did sauour of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption <note place="margin">Iob. 26.</note> against this God; burst forth into thes wordes. <q>Whom wilt thou teach (my friend?) wilt thou teach him which hath inspired breath into man? which hath stretched out the heauens ouer the vacuitie of this world, and hath hanged vp the earth in the aire without staie? before whom hel is wide-open and ther is no couering from perdition? The pillers of heauen doe tremble and quake at his only fight. And if we should heare but the lest whispering of his speech; who should be able to abide the thunder of his maiesties greatnes?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Imagine then novv (my louing bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">A contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.</note>) after althes testimonies, that thou seest before thy face, this great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie king sitting in his chaire of maiestie, with chariottes of fire, vnspeakable light, and infinite millions of Angels aboute him. Imagine further, (which also is most trew,) that thou seest al the creatures in the world stand in his presence, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at his maiestie, and most carefullie
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:14541:226"/>
attending to doe that, for which he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them: as the heauens to moue aboute: the Sunne, moone, and Starres to geeue lighte and influence: the earthe to bringe foorth her sustenance: and euerie other creature diligently to labour for perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the dutie assigned vnto him. Imagine besides, that thou seest al these creatures (how bigge or litle soeuer they be,) to hange and depende onlie of the power and vertue of this God; and therby only to stande, moue, and consist; and that there passeth from God to eche creature in the world, yea to euerie parte that hath motion or being in the same, some beame of his vertue: euen as from the sunne, we see infinite beames passe into the ayer. Consider (I say) that no one parte of anie creature in the world, (as the fishe in the sea, the grasse on the ground, the leaues of <note place="margin">Hovv al creatures depende vpon the Creator.</note> trees, or the partes of man vpon the face of the earth,) can grow, moue, or consist, without some litle streame of vertue and power deriued to it continuallie from God. So that, thou must imagine God to stand as a most glorious and resplendent Sunne, in the midle or center of al thinges created, and from him, to passe foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable beames and streames of vertue, to all the creatures that are either in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, earth, the ayer, or waters, &amp; to euerie parte and particle of the same; and that vpon thes beames of his deuine vertue, all creatures doe depend; in so much, as if he should stop or diuert but any one of them
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:14541:227"/>
al; it would destroye and annihilate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie some creature or other.</p>
               <p>This I saye, if thou shalt consider tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the maiestie of God, and the infinite dread that all creatures haue of him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onlie a sinner, (for the deuils also doe feare him as S. Iames affirmeth:) thou <note place="margin">Iac. 2.</note> wilt not meruaile at the seuere iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t appointed for his offence. For sure I am, that very shame of the world maketh vs to haue more regarde in offending the poorest friende we haue in this life, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wicked man hath in offending almightie God: which is an intollerable contempt of so great a maiestie; &amp; such a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt in deed as God him self doth account to pro ceede of plaine infidelitie. For wheras at a certaine time, he had declared his owne <note place="margin">Lacke of feare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of Infidelitie.</note> great power, by the mouth of Ieremie, &amp; threatened manie punishmentes to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes for their wickednes: thei werenothig moued therwith.

For if they had belieued him to be in deed so powerful, terrible, &amp; ful of maiestie, as the holie scripture set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

               <p>
                  <hi>BVT NOVV IF VVE</hi> adioine to <note place="margin">THE. 2. part. GODs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites.</note> this contemplation of maiestie, an other consideration of his benefites bestowed vpon vs: our default wil grow to be far greater. For that to iniury him, who hath done vs good; is a thinge moste detestable euen in nature itself. And there was neuer yet so fearce a harte, no not among brute beastes, but that it might be wonne with curtesie and benefites. But much more among reasonable creatures doth benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence preuaile, especiallie if it come from great personages, whose loue and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe (declared vnto vs but in small gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) doth greatlie by nde the hartes of the receyuers to loue them againe.</p>
               <p>Consider then (deare Christian) the infinite good turnes and benefites which thou hast receyued at the handes of this great God, therby to winne the to his loue, and that thou shouldest leaue of to offende and iniurie him. And albeit no tongue created either of man or Angel, can expresse the one halfe of thes giftes which thow hast receyued from him, or the value therof, or the great loue and hartie good will, wherwith he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed the same vpon the: yet for some better helping of thy memorie, &amp; stirring vp thine affection to be grateful; I will repeate certaine generall and principall pointes therof, wherunto the rest may be easilie referred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:14541:228"/>
First then, cal to minde, that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed <note place="margin">THE. 1. benefite. Or creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee the benefite of thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherby he made the of nothing to the likenes of hymself, and appointed the to so noble an ende, as is to serue him in this life, and to raigne with him in the life to come; hauing furnished thee besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, for the better attainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therof, with the vse, seruice, and subiection of al his other creatures. The greatnes of which benefite may partly be conceyued, if thou doe imagine thy self to lacke but any one parte of thy bodie, as a leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, an arme, an eye, or the like: and that one should freelie euen of pure good wil and loue, supplie thy want, and gyue the same vnto thee. Or if thou wantest but any one of thy senses, as that thou were deafe, blynde, or dumme; and some man should restore thy sight, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or fpeech vnto thee: howe wouldest thou esteeme of this benefite? how much wouldest thow professe thy self behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dig vnto him for the same? And if the gyft of one of these partes onlie, would seeme vnto thee so singuler a benefite: how greatly oughtest thou to esteeme the free gyfte of so manie partes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>Adde now hereunto, (as I haue sayde) that he hath created the, to thee lyknes of no other thing, but of him self; to no other ende, but to be his honorable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uante in this world, and his compartener in kynglie glorie, for all eternitie to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:14541:228"/>
come: and this he hath done to the, being only a peece of earth or claye before. Now ymagine then, of what sea of loue al this proceeded. But yet adde further, how he hath created all this magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t world for the, and all the creatures therof to serue thee in this busines: the heauens to gouerne the and to geeue the light: the earth, ayer, and water, to minister most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite varietie of creatures for thy behoof and sustenance: and of al thes hath made the Lord &amp; maister, to vse them for thine auaile and benefite in his seruice. Which giftes being so manifold and magnificent as they are; I appeale to thine owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience (good Christian brother) how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable an ingratitude it is, so greatly to dishonour &amp; iniurie the giuer, as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie thes giftes to his offence, which he bestowed vpon the for his seruice.</p>
               <p>Next after this ensueth the benefite of thy redemption, much more excellent and <note place="margin">The 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite. OF redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> bountiful the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former; the effect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, that wheras thou hadst lost al those former giftes and benefites, and hadst made thy self guiltie by sinne of eternal punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and damnation, (wherunto the Angels were now deliuered for their sinne committed before:) God chose to redeeme the, and not the Angels; and for satisfying of thine enormous fault, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to deliuer his owne only soone to the most opprobrious death of the Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se. O Lord God, what hart can possibly conceyue the greatnes of this benefite?
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:14541:229"/>
Suppose with thy self (gentle Christian) for better vnderstanding of this benefite; that thou being a poore and abiect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, vnder the dominion of some great &amp; mightie Emperour, hadst with some of his principal Peres, committed grieuous cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes <note place="margin">A supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this benefite.</note> against his Emperial Maiestie; thou oftentimes, and they but once; and being both by law conuicted, and redie to suster Iustice for the same; so singulerly should the Emperours fauour extend it self in thy behalf, as deliuerig ouer thos other great princes to execution for their demerites; he conceyued a desire to saue and pardon thee. And finding no other conuenient meanes in respect of his Iustice, how to doe the same, should vpon his only sonne and heire of al his Empire, laie the paines, shame, and torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of death due vnto thy trespasses. Tel me now, if being so abiect and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible a creature, thou shouldst receyue so great a grace of a mightie Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who had for fewer offences, euen in thy sight, put to death greate and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious princes; (as God did thos princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Angels:) how wonderfully wouldest thou thincke thy self bound and beholden vnto him for the same? But if further, this sonne and heire of this noble Monarch, refusing to speake one word for thos great princes, should not only accept willingly this dishonour and punishment laid vpon him by his father, for thy sake, but also should offer himself therunto, and craue most instantly, that he might by his death
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:14541:229"/>
make satisfaction for thine offences, and not only this, but also to deriue vnto thee the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, making thee of a bondslaue, heire apparant to so Puissant an Emperour, &amp; coheire to him self: could thy hart possibly conceyue so great a benefite? were it possible, that thy powers of bodie &amp; soule should not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue in the cogitation of so inspeakable a grace? would not thy bowels burst in sunder with the vehemencie of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards such a benefactour? Or can any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reason, euer imagine, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest willingly for a thousand worlds, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any more so gratious a Lord? And yet is this benefite of thy redemption (deare brother,) by infinite degrees surpassing both this and al other temporal graces, that mans wit can imagine, in al and euery circumstance that before hath bene mentioned.</p>
               <p>In the third place doe come to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, <note place="margin">THE. 3. and 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites. OF voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</note> two other benefites named voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Iustification. The first wherof is, that, wherby God of his infinite depth of mercies, hath called vs from infidelitie, to the state of Christians; and therby made vs partakers of this our redemption last mentioned, which infidels are not. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he payed the ransome for al in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; yet hath he not imparted the benefite therof to al, but to such onlie as best it pleased his diuine goodnes to bestow it vpon. After which grace of vocation, and <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1. Cor. 1.</note> our acceptance therof, insued immediatlie
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:14541:230"/>
our iustification wherby we were not onlie set sree from al our sinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, and from al paine and punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dew to the same: but also our soules were beutified and enriched by the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his holie grace inherent, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. Cor. 13. Esa. 11.</note> with the vertues theological, as faith, hope, and charitie; &amp; with the most pretious giftes of the Holie Ghost: and by this grace, wee were made iust and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the sight of God, and entitled to the most blessed inheritance of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, the worthines of which gift, no tongue of man or Angels can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.</p>
               <p>After these doe ensue a greate number of benefites together, apperteining pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <note place="margin">The 5. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite. OF the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes.</note> to such as are made the children and true frendes of God; euery one wherof in it self is of most infinite price and valew. Among which are in the first place to be nombred, the holie Sacraments of Christs Church, left vnto vs for our comfort and preseruation after we be entred into the bosome therof. They being nothing els in deed, but certaine sacred co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duits to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaie vnto vs the holie grace of God: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thos two which appertaine to al men in general, I meane, the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of penance and of the blessed bodie and blood of our Sauyour: wherof the first, is to purge our sowles from sin so <note place="margin">The vse of Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes</note> often as she falleth; the seconde, to feede and comforte the same after she is purged. The first, is as a bathe made of Christs
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:14541:230"/>
owne pretious bloode, to washe and cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se our woundes therein: the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de as a most comfortable and riche garment, to couer our soule after she is washed. In the first, Christ hath left with his spouse the Church, al his authoritie, which he hath in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or earth to remit sinnes: in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he hath left him self, &amp; his owne flesh and bloode, to be a pretious foode, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to seede and cherish our soule after her sinnes be remitted.</p>
               <p>Besides al thes; ther yet remaineth an other benefite which we cal the benefite <note place="margin">The 6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite. Of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and inspiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of Preseruation; wherby God hath kept and preserued vs from infinite dangers, wheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to many others before vs haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and into which our selues had fallen in like maner, if gods-holie hande had not stayed vs: as from heresie and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and manie other greeuous sinnes: but especially, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death &amp; damnation, which longe a goe by our wickednes, we deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to haue bene executed vpon vs. Wherunto maie be annexed also the most singuler benefites of godlie inspirations and admonitions, wherby God hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both knocked inwardlie at the dore <note place="margin">Apoc 3.</note> of our conscience, and warned vs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by so many wayes and meanes, as are good bookes, good sermons, good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, good companie, good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of others, &amp; a thousand other most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means besides, which at diuers times he hath vsed and doth vse, therby to gaine vs and our sowles vnto his eternal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:14541:231"/>
by stirring vs vp to abandon vitious life, and to betake ourselues to his holy and swete seruice.</p>
               <p>Al which most rare and excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, being measured either according <note place="margin">Circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And this gratitude shoulde be, to resolue ourselues at length, to serue him vnsaynedlie, &amp; to preferre his fauour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore al wordlie or mortal respectes whatsoeuer. Or if we can not obtaine so much of ourselues; yet at leastwise not to offende him anie more by our sinnes and wickednes.</p>
               <p>There is not so fearse or cruell a nature in the world, (as I noted before,) but is mollisied, allured, and wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne by benefites: And stories do make reporte of straunge <note place="margin">A Flian. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But if they should further malitiouslie seeke to offende him, and to ioyne in amitie with his professed enimie: how intollerable a matter would this seeme in his conceit? And yet him self, dealing much more ingratfullie and iniuriouslie with almightie God, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math it a matter of smal consideration, &amp; easely pardonable. He dealeth (I saie) far more ingratfullie with God; for that he hath receyued a thousand folde for one, in respect of all the benefites that one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man can gyue vnto an other.

This paine may partlie be conceyued; if we would driue out life, but from the least parte of our bodie, as for example, out of our litle fingar, like as sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geans are wont to doe, when they wil mortifie any one place, to make it breake. What intolerable paine doth a man suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, before this member be dead? what ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging greefe doth he abyde? If then the mortifying of one litle parte onlie, doe so much afflict vs: Imagine, what the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mortifying of al the partes together wil doe. For we see that first the soule is driuen by death to leaue the extreamest partes, as the toes, feete, and fingers: then the legges and armes, and so consequently one parte dieth after an other, vntill life be restrained onlie to the harte, which holdeth out longest as the principal part; but yet finallie must be also constrained to render it self, though with neuer so much paine and resistance. Which paine how great and stronge it is, may appeare
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14541:236"/>
by the breaking in peeces of the verie stringes and holdes wherwith it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed, through the excessiue vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this deadlie torment.</p>
               <p>Neuertheles, before it come to this pointe of yelding; no man can expresse the cruel conflict that is betwixt death and her, and what distresses she abideth in the time of her agonie. Imagine that a <note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe the paines of death.</note> prince possessed a goodlie citie in al peace, wealth, and pleasure, and greatlie frinded of al his neighbours round about him, who promised to assiste him in al his needes and affairs; &amp; that vpon the sudden, his mortal enimie should come and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege this citie, and taking one holde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an other; one wall after another; one castell after an other; should driue this prince onlie to a litle tower and besiege him therin, al his other holdes being beaten doune, and his men slaine in his sight: what feare, anguishe, and miserie woold this afflicted pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nce be in? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten would he looke out at the windowes &amp; loope holes of his tower, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his friendes and neighboures would come to help him or no? And if he saw them all to abandone him, and his cruel enemie euen readie to breake in vpon him; would he not (trow you) be in a most pitiful plight? Euen so then fareth it with a poore soule, at the hower of death. The bodie wherin she raigned like a iolie princesse in al pleasure, whiles it flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; is now battered and ouerthrowen
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:14541:237"/>
by her enimie, which is death: the armes, legges, and other partes wherewith she was fortified as with walles and wardes during time of health, are now surprised and beaten to the grounde, and she is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen onlie to the harte, as to the last and extremest refuge, wherein also she is most fearcelie assayled in such sorte, as she can not possiblie hold out longe. Her dearest friendes who soothed her in time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, and promised assistance, as youth, agilitie, strength, courage, diet, phisicke, and other humane helpes; doe now vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie abandone her: the enimie wil not be pacified or make any league at al, but night and daye assaulteth this Turret wherein she is retired, and which now beginneth to shake and shiuer in pecees, in such sort, as she expecteth hourelie when her enimie in most raging &amp; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful maner, wil burst in vpon her.</p>
               <p>What thinke you is now the state of this afflicted soule? It is no maruaile if a wise man become a foole, or a stoute worldling most abiect in this instant of extremitie, as we often see they doe, in such sorte, that they can dispose of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well either towardes God or the world at this houre.

Surely S. Augustine describeth the same verie effectuously in one of his sermons, and (according to his manner) doth gyue a notable exhortation vpon the same.

Contrariwise the iust mans soule goeth out of his bodie with greate ioye and comforte, the good Angels accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paininge her, with exultation.

                  <hi>of my change or departure from this vvorld.</hi> Out of which atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion &amp; premeditation, doe proceede sundrie most excellent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes and frutes, for preuention of al euil that may insue at that day. The first wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is, to stand in continual awe and feare of death, as holie Dauid did, who confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of him self, <hi>that the feare of death vvas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>fallen vpon him.</hi> Out of which feare doth proceed a second effect of great weight in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> mans life, named heedfulnes or sollicitude, which the blessed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iob had by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named meditation of death; for so he saith of him self, that, <hi>by consideration, he vvas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>made sollicitous vvith scare,</hi> and therupon he addeth further, <hi>that he doubted al his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>vvorkes.</hi> In which case S. Paul also signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth him self to be, when he exhorted al men to be careful <hi>to doe good vvorkee vvhiles</hi>

                  <hi>they haue time;</hi> and, <hi>for that this time is but short; so to vse this present vvorld, as though they vsed it not.</hi> The third effect that followeth by the meditation of death, is the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of our owne basenes and vilitie, wherunto S. Paul exhorted the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians when he said vnto them. <hi>Except you be reprobates you knovv your selues.</hi> For he <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> that thinketh often vpon the state of a dead man, shal easilie confesse with saint <note place="margin">Iacob. 4. Esa. 4.</note> Iames, <hi>that our life is a vapor;</hi> and with Esay;
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:14541:245"/>
                  <hi>that al the glorie of man, is but as a flovver of the field.</hi> And wil finallie say to him self with the wise man. <hi>Quid superbit terra &amp;</hi>

                  <hi>cinis?</hi> Whie doth earth and dust ware proude, and take so much vpon it?</p>
               <p>Thes are three most excellent effectes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that doe insue, by frequent meditation and consideration of death. But besides thes, ther followeth also a fowerth, which is the casting from vs of al superfluous worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlie cares, which are commonlie in them that consider not ther ende, according as the wise man warneth vs when he saith; <hi>God hath giuen</hi> (or permitted) <hi>to the sinner,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccle. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>affliction and superfluous care to scrape and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, to leaue it to such as to God it shal best please.</hi> And out of this effect, is inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> by litle and litle and by degrees, an other more high and excellent thing, called the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of creatures for the loue of their Greator, wherunto S. Paul was arriued when he wrote thos finie wordes; <hi>I doe</hi>

                  <hi>Christ.</hi> And from this proceedeth an other (which is the sixt and last,) called the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or rather the loue and desire of death. Which S. Paul also had attained vnto, when he said of him self. <hi>I doe desire to be dissalued, and to be vvith Christ.</hi> And the holie prophet Dauid, who said in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (as you haue heard,) <hi>that the feare of death vvas fallen vpon him:</hi> came at length to <note place="margin">Psal. 41.</note> crie out; <hi>my soule doth thirst after God, that is the liuelie vvel-spring; vvhen shal I come, and appeare before the face of God?</hi> So that from

the feare of death, (which is the first ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that springeth of the remembrance <note place="margin">The highest felicitie of Saintes in this life.</note> &amp; meditation therof,) he was come now to the loue and most earnest desire of the same, which is the highest degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the most supreme felicitie that saintes doe arriue vnto in this life.</p>
               <p>Endeuour then (my deare Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) by frequent and diligent premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al.</note> of this passage, to attaine to this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, or at least wise, to some parte or degree therof.

And this meane hath oftentimes <note place="margin">The force of feare.</note> preuailed more then anie other that could be vsed, by reason of the natural loue which we beare towardes our selues; and consequentlie the natural feare which we haue of our owne danger. So we reade <note place="margin">Ion. 5.</note> that nothing could moue the Niniuites so much as the fortelling them of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <note place="margin">Math. 3.</note> destruction.

               <p>For which cause, hauing now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered in the former chapters of death, and of godes seuere iudgment ensuing thervpon, (wherin euerie man hath to receyue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his workes in this life:) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:14541:247"/>
this resolution of seruinge God. For as I haue noted before, if euerie man haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie a loue of him self and desire to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his owne ease: then should he also haue feare of peril, wherby he is to fal into miserie &amp; calamitie. This expresseth S. Bernard verie excellently according to <note place="margin">In serm. de primordii.</note> his wonte. <q>O man (saieth he) if thou haue left al shame, (which appertaineth to so noble a creature as thou art:) if thou feele no sorow (as carnal men doe not:) yet loose not feare also which is founde eué in brute and sauage beastes. We vse to loade an asse and to werie him out with laboure, and he careth not, because he is an asse: but if thou wouldest thrust him into fire, or flinge him into a ditch, he would auoide it as much as he coulde, for that he loueth life and feared death.

This feare is called the beginning of wisdome, and not shame or sorow; for that the spirite of feare is more potent to resist sinne, then the spirite of shame or sorow. Wherfore it is saide, <hi>remember the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccle. 7.</note>

               <p>First therfore to speake in general of <note place="margin">Three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures of shegreatnes of Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> the punishmentes reserued for the life to come: if the scriptures did not declare in particular their greatnes vnto vs; yet are there manie reasons to persuade vs that
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:14541:247"/>
they are most seuere, grieuous, and intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <note place="margin">Psal. 71. Deut. 10.</note> For first, as God is a God in al his workes, that is to saye, greate, wounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and terrible: so especiallie he sheweth the same in his punishmentes: being called <note place="margin">Psal. 4. Psal. 93.</note> for that cause in holy scripture, <hi>Deus iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> God of iustice: as also, <hi>Deus vltionum,</hi> God of reuenge. Wherfore seing al his other workes, are maiestical and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">1. His Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.</note> our capacities: we may likewise ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that his hande in punishment, must be also most wonderful. God himself tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to reason in this maner, when he <note place="margin">Iere. 5.</note> sayeth: <hi>And vvil ye not then feare me? and vvil ye not tremble before my face? vvho haue set the sande, for limites to the sea; and haue giuen the vvaters a commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neuer to passe the same; no not then, vvhen they are most troubled, and the vvaues therof most outragious?</hi> As who would say; if I be wonderful and doe passe your imagination, in these woorkes of the sea and other of this world, which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould dailie: then haue yee iust cause to feare me, considering that my punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes are like to be correspondent to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my other actions. <note place="margin">2. Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>An other coniecture of the great and seuere iustice of God in punishing, may be the consideration of his infinite and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable mercie; which, as it is the verie nature it self of God, and consequently, without ende or measure, as his godhead <note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> is: so is also his iustice. And these two, are the two armes (as it were) of his diuine Maiestie, embracing &amp; kyssing one th' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:14541:248"/>
as the scripture saieth. And therfore as in a man of this world, if we had the measure of one arme, we might easely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture the length of the other: so behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding daily the wounderful examples of godes infinite mercie towardes them that doe repent: we may therby conceyue the seueritie of his Iustice towards such as he reserueth to punishment in the life to come, and whom for that cause, he calleth in holy writ, <hi>Vasa furoris;</hi> that is, vessels, <note place="margin">Esa. 13. Psal. 7.</note> of furie, wheron to exercise the rage of his dreadful and most terrible indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A third consideration to induce vs to the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the greatnes of Gods punishmentes in general; may be his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous patience, and long suffering of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this life. As that (for example) he permitteth diuers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from sinne to sinne, from day to day, from yeare to yeare, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age, to liue continually in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Maiestie, and transgression of his commaundementes; refusing al per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions, allurementes, good inspirations, or other meanes of grace and fauor, that his merciful goodnes can deuise to offer for their amendment. And what man in the world could suffer this? or what mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hart were able by inestimable suffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; for bearing in this life, to shew such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience? but now if al this should not be requited with seueritie of punishment, in the worlde to come: it might seeme to be against the law of iustice and equitie, and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:14541:248"/>
so one arme in God to be longer then the other. S. Paule toucheth this reason in his epistle to the Romans, where he saith: <hi>duest thou not knovv that the benignitie of God is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>vsed to bring thee to repentance? and thou by thy bard and impenitent hart, doest heape vp vengeace vnto thy self, in the day of vvrath and appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Gods iust iudgementes, vvhich shal restore to euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to his vvorkes.</hi> In which sentence S. Paul vseth the phrase of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping wrath or ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to signifie therby, that like as the couetous man, doth laie vp money daily to make his heape en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; so the irrepentant sinner doth heape sinne vpon sinne: and God on the contrary side, heapeth vengeance to vengeance, vntil his measure be ful, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store in the ende, <hi>measure against measure,</hi> as <note place="margin">Esa. 27.</note> the prophet saith, and to paye vs home <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multitude of our ovvne abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 16. Gen. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This was the meaning of almightie God when he said to Abraham <hi>that the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the Amorrheans vvere not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet:</hi> As also in the reuelations vnto S. Ionn Euangelist, when he vsed this conclusion of that booke: <hi>He that doth euil, let him doe yet more euil: and he that lieth in filth, let him yet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>become more filthie: for beholde I come quicklie, and my revvard is vvith me, to render to euerie man according to his deedes.</hi> By which wordes God signifieth, that his forbearance and tolleration with sinners in this life, is an argument of his greater seueritie in the life to come: which the prophet Dauid
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:14541:249"/>
doth insinuate in like maner, when tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Psal. 36.</note> of a careles sinner, he saieth:  <q>God shal deride him for that he seeth before hand, that his daie vvil come.</q> Which daie (no doubt) is to be vnderstoode the daye of account and punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t after this life; for so doth God more at large declare him self in another place, in these wordes. <q>And thou sonne of <note place="margin">Ezech. 7.</note> man, this saieth thy Lord God: the end is come; now (I save) the end is come vpon the. And I wil shew on the my furie, and wil iudge the according to thy waies. I wil laye against the al thine abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; myn eye shal not spare the, nether wil I take anie mercie vpon the, but I wil laie thine owae waies vpon the, &amp; thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Behold affic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commeth on, the end is come, the end (I saie) is come: it hath watched against the, and beholde it is come: destruction is now come vpon the: the time is come; the daie of slaughter is at hand. Shortlie wil I power out my wrath vpon the, and I wil fil my furic in the, and I wil iadge the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy waies, and I wil lay al thy wickednes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the: myn eye shal not pitie the, nor wil I take any compassion vpon the, but I wil lay thy waies vpon the, and thy abhominations in the middest of the, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord that striketh.</q> Hitherto is the speech of almightie God deliuered by the mouth of his holie Prophete.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SEING THEN</hi> we now vnderstand <note place="margin">OF hel.</note> in general; that the punishmentes of God

in the life to come are most certaine to be <note place="margin">OF paines in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer. AND of tvvo sortes, therof.

                  <hi>the portion of vvicked men, shalbe in the lake bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vvith fire and brimstone, vvhich is called the second death.</hi> The other, which haue the guilt of their sinne pardoned by their repentance in this life, but yet haue not made that temporal satisfaction to gods iustice, nor are so thoroughlie purged in this world, as they may passe to heauen without punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and of these it is wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <note place="margin">1.

               <p>And the same holie father in an other place hath these wordes. <q>If a sinner by his <note place="margin">August. de vera &amp; falsa poenitentia. cap. 18.</note> conuersion escape death, and obtaine life, yet for al that, I can not promise him, that he shal escape al paine or punishment.

To like effect doth S. Gregorie write <note place="margin">Gregor. in Psal. tertis. paenitent. Psal. 27.</note> of the seueritie of this punishment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding those wordes of Dauid. <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy surie, nor correct me in thy vvrath.</hi> 
                  <q>This is as if he said (saith S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) I know that after this life, some must be clensed by purging fire. And other must receyue sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of eternal damnation. But because I esteeme that purgi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fire (though it be transitorie) to be more intolerable, then al the tribulation which in this life may be suffered: therfore I doe not onlie desire, not to be rebuked in the furie of eternal damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but also I greatlie feare to be purged in the wrath of transitorie correction.</q> Thus far S.

of that fire. Thes thinges therfore which we suffer heere, are much more easie then that fire: and yet you see, that men wil doe any thing rather then suffer the same: how much more then ought we to doe that litle which.

               <p>The Hebrue word which the scripture vseth for hel, is SEOL, which signifieth <note place="margin">SEOL. Esa. 14. Mat. 14.</note> properly a great ditche or dungeon.

               <p>The Chaldie worde (which is also vsed in Hebrew, and translated into greke) is GEHENNA.

And this place was afterward vsed for the receipt of al fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, dung, dead carions, and the like. And most probable it is, that our Sauiour vsed this word GEHENNA aboue al other,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:14541:253"/>
for hel; therby to signifie the miserable burning of soules in that place, the pitiful <note place="margin">The loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes of hel.</note> clamours and cries of the tormented, the confuse and barbarous noise of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, together with the most lothsom filthinesse of the place; which otherwise is described in the scriptures, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of adders, snakes, cocatrices, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and other venemouse creatures, as hath bene and shalbe afterwards decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And with this word GEHENNA, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth also in signification an other vsed by the Prophet Esaie, to denote the same place; that is to saie, TOPHET. Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <note place="margin">TOPHET.</note> signifieth the forsaid valley of the children of Hinnom; but is applied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to declare and represent the most horrible dungeon of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned soules.

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:14541:254"/>
may serue to inferre the calamitie of the other. As for example; when S. Paule <note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So againe, when the scripture saith, that the felicitie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in heauen is a perfect felicitie, containing <hi>al goodnesse,</hi> so that no one kinde of pleasure ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be imagined which they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse <note place="margin">Exo. 33.</note> not: we must thinke on the contrary part, that the miserie of the damned, must be also an absolute miserie, containing al afflictions that may be, without want of any. So that, as the happines of the good is insiaite and vniuersal; so also is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie of the wicked infinite and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. Now in this life, al the miseries and paines which fal vpon man, are but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and not vniuersal. As for example, we see one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pained in his eyes, an other in his teeth, an other in his stomak, an other in his back: which particular pains not witstanding, are some times so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, as life is not able to resist them, &amp; a man wolde not suffer them long for the gaining of a million of worldes.</p>
               <p>But suppose that some one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted <note place="margin">The paines of hel infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite &amp; vni uersal.</note> in al the parts of his bodie at once, as in his head, his eyes, his to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, his teeth, his stomak, &amp; in al other ioints &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of his bodie besides: suppose (I say) he were most cruellie tormented with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme paines in al these parts together,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:14541:254"/>
without ease or intermissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What thing could be more miserable then this? what fight more lamentable? what calamitre more vnspeakable? If thou shouldest see but a brute beast lye in the strete thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; I know thou couldest not but take compassion of him. Wel then, consider what difference there is betwene abiding thes paines for a week, or for al eternitie: in suffering them vpon a sost bedde, or vpon a burning gridiron and boiling for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace: among a mans friendes comforting him, or among the suries of hel whipping and tormenting him. Consider this (I say gentle reader,) and if thou wouldest take agreate deale of labour, rather then in this life temporallie to abide the one; be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to sustaine a litle paire, rather then to incurre the other in the life to come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternallie.</p>
               <p>But yet to penetrate these things a litle further; not onelie al these partes of the <note place="margin">Hovv eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie parte bathe his particuler torment in hel.</note> body which haue bene instruments to sinne, shalbe tormented together in this place of punishment; but also euerie sense both external and internal for the same cause, shalbe afflicted with his particular torment, contrarie to the object wherein it delited most, and toke pleasure in this world.

the holie spirit of God reueileth vnto vs an other condition or qualitie no lesse terrible then the former which is, the most seuere straitnes therof, without al possibilitie of anie one iote of help, aide, ease, intermission, relaxation, respiration, or comfort. This is signified by thos seuere wordes of our Saueour so often times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>that the daned shalbe cast into hel boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hand and foote,</hi> that is, without al habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie <note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> of resistance or strugling against their tormentes: Also, by that most dreadful shutting vp of the gate, wherof our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueour spake in such dolful maner when he said; <hi>clausa est ianua,</hi> the gate is shut vp, and made fast for euer; that is to say; in hel the gate of al mercie, of al pardon, of al ease; of al intermission, of al comfort, is shut vp <note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> foreuer; and that both from heauen, from earth, from the creator, and from al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; in so much, that no consolation is euermore to be hoped for, (as in the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life there is alwaies some,) but extreme desolation for al eternitie.</p>
               <p>This straitnes is likewise most liuelie expressed in that dreadful parable of the riche glutton in hel; who was driuen to <note place="margin">

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:14541:258"/>
straitnesse of the place, it was denied vnto him. O ye that liue in sinful welth of the world, consider but this one example of Gods seueritie, and be a fearde. This man was in that russe &amp; iolitie a litle before, as he wolde not gyue the verie crommes of his table, to buy heauen; and now wolde he gyue a thousand worldes (if he had them) for one drop of water to coole his tongue. Good God, what demaund could be lesse then this? what request more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? He durst not aske to be deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or to haue his torments diminished, or to haue a great vessel of water wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to refresh his whole bodie; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so much as would sticke on the top of Lazarus fingar, to coole his tongue. To what extreme need was this poore man now driuen? what a strong imagination had he of the force of one drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? to what pitiful chaunge was his ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue now come, that was accustomed to be so daintelie bathed, and diligentlie tended with al kindes of pleasant liquors? O that one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not take example by an other: ô that Ooliba wil not learne to be wise by seing the punishmentes of her elder <note place="margin">The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of one moueth not an other.</note> sister Oolla. God reueiled the calamitie of the former, inflicted for her wickednes, therby to terrifie the latter, from the like sinne; <q>but for that she profited nothing by <note place="margin">Ezec. 23.</note> that exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, he saieth; for so much as thou Ooliba hast walked in the waies, of thie sister Oolla: this saith God vnto the; I wil lay the cup of thie sister vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the; thou

               </p>
               <p>Thus said the prophet of God then to Hierusalem, that would not be warned by the punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Samaria; and thus saith the sonne of God now to al men, that wil not be terrified by thes torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the damned Glutton; and if al this be true (as it must be except the wordes of our Saueour could be false:) then what wonderful people are we, that seing our selues in danger of this intollerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie; doe not seeke with more diligence to preuent the same?</p>
               <p>In respect of these extremities &amp; strait dealings of God in denying al comfort &amp; consolation at this day: holie scripture <note place="margin">Apo. 16. Eccle. 23.</note> sayeth, that men shal fal into rage, furie, and vtter impatience, blasphening God, &amp; cursing the day of their natiuitie, with <note place="margin">Apo. 23. Luc. 23.</note> eating their own tongues for griefe, and desiring the rockes and mountaines to come and fal on them, therby to ende and finish their paines.</p>
               <p>But now, if we adde to al this, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and euerlasting continuance of these <note place="margin">7. The eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the paines.</note> torments; we shal see, that it encreaseth the matter beyond al hu nane cogitation. For in this world, there is no torment so great, or affliction so viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; but that time either taketh away or diminisheth the same. For either the tormentor, or the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented dieth, or some other occasion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, wherby the extremitie of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:14541:259"/>
is mitigated. But here no such hope or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort may be expected; for that, <note place="margin">Apo. 21.</note> as holie writ affirmeth, <hi>Cruciabuntur in sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula saeculoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in stagne ardente igne &amp; sulphure:</hi> 
                  <q>They shalbe tormented for euer and euer, in a poole that burneth with fire &amp; brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</q> As long as God is God, so long must they burne therin. Neither shal the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentour or the tormented die, but both must liue eternallie, for the eternal mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of him that suffereth.</p>
               <p>O (sayeth one holie father in a godlie meditation) if a sinner damned in hel, did <note place="margin">A vvo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful saying, and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note> know that he had to suffer those torments no more thousand yeres, then there be sandes in the sea, and grasse leaues on the grounde; or no more thousand millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ages, then there be creatures in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hel, and in earth: he wold greatlie reioice; for that he wolde comfort him self at the least wise, with this cogitation; that once yet the matter wold haue an ende. But now (saieth this good man) this word <hi>Neuer,</hi> breaketh his hart, considering that after a hundred thousand millions of worldes; (if ther might be so many,) he hath as farre to his iournies end, as he had at the first day of his entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into thos torments. Consider (good Christian) what a length one houre wold seme vnto the, if thou haddest but to hold thy hand in fire and brimstone onelie during the space thereof, or to be stretched on a racke, or other torture. We finde by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that if a man be grieuouslie sick, though he be
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:14541:259"/>
laid vpon a verie soft bed; yet one night seemeth a long time vnto him. He turneth and tosseth him self from side to side tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the clock, and counting euerie houre as it passeth, which seemeth to him a whole day. And if a man should saye vnto him, that he were to abide that pain but seuen yeres together: he wold goe nigh to dispare for griefe. Now if one night seeme so long and tediouse to him that lieth on a good soft bedd, afflicted onelie with a litle ague: what wil the lying in fire and brimstone doe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shal know euidentlie, that he shal neuer haue ende thereof? O deare brother, the satietie of continuance is lothsome, euen in things that are not euil of them selues. If thou shouldest be bound alwaies to eate one onelie meate, albeit otherwise of it self it were not ingrate: yet would it be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant vnto the in the ende. If thou shouldest be bound to sit stil al thy life in one place, without mouing: it would seeme grieuous and intollerable, albeit no man did tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thee in that place. What then wil it be, to lie eternally, that is to say, world without ende, in most extreme torments and inexplicable desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? is it any way to be comprehended, how they may be suffered? ô blind iudgement of man, that maketh no more accounte of preuenting thes calamities.</p>
               <p>And yet might I here adioine an other circumstance of thes punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, which holie scripture it self omitteth not, when
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:14541:260"/>
it saith, that al these torments shalbe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <note place="margin">8. Darckenes in hel.</note> in darkenes; a thing dreadful of it self vnto mans nature, as you know. For that there is not the stoutest hart made of flesh, but if he found him self alone, desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 22</note> and naked in some desolate place of darkenes, and should heare the voices and cries of infernal spirites drawing towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des him; he would be striken with feare in respect of the place it self, albeit as yet he felt no hurt vpon his body. For that nothing is more terrible to mans imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then to conceaue perils at hand; which the eye can not discouer, nor any thing more ful of extreme desolation, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing our sight, to want for euer the vse and obiect therof. This then is the most pitiful and desolate state of such as are <note place="margin">9. The derisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that shall e vsed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards the damned.</note> damned, that their insupportable &amp; euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting paines are sustained in darknes. whereunto also may be added an other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance recorded by the prophet to knit vp al the rest, which is, that God shal laugh at them in thes their miseries; an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction <note place="margin">Psal. 36.</note> perhappes to be numbred amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the greatest of al others. For as in this life, to be moned by a mans friendes in time of aduersitie, is exceeding great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: so to be derided and laughed at, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie by them, who onelie may help and redresse our miseries; is a great and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable encrease of calamitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>AND NOVV AL THIS</hi> that I haue <note place="margin">OF the paines. OF damage</note> hitherto treated, is but one onlie part of a damned mans punishment, called by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:14541:260"/>
                  <hi>paena sensus,</hi> the paine of sense or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; that is, the paine or punishment sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie inflicted vpon the soule and bodie. But yet beside this, ther is an other part of his punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t called, <hi>poena damni,</hi> the paine of losse or dammage; which by al learned mens opinion, is either greater, or no lesse then the former. And this is, the infinite losse which a damned man indureth, in being excluded for euer &amp; euer, from the sight of his Creator, and from his glorie. Which sight onelie, being sufficient to make happie and blessed al thos that are admitted therunto; must nedes be an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite miserie to the damned man, to lacke the same eternallie. And therfore, this is put as one of the first and chiefest plagues to be layed vpon him; <hi>Tollatur impius ne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deat</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 26.</note>

                  <q>Let the wicked man be taken away to hel, to the ende he may not see the glorie of God.</q> And this losse con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taineth al other losses and dommages in it: as are the losses of eternal blisse and ioye; of eternal glorie; of eternal societie with the Angels; and the like: which los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses when a damned man considereth, (as he can not but consider them perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;) he taketh more grief thereof (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines doe proue) then of al other sensible torments that he abideth besides.</p>
               <p>And hereof proceedeth that great and general torment, which is so often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.</note> in holie write, by the name of the <hi>vvorme of our conscience,</hi> so called; for that, as a worme lieth eating and gnawing the

How many times we were foretolde of this daunger, and yet how litle care and feare we tooke of the same. How vaine thos wordlie trifles were, wherein we spent our time, and for which we lost heauen, and fel into thes most intolerable miseries.

               <p>This is the onlie time wherin we may auoide al; now is the season whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may <note place="margin">The pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the preset time.</note> put our selues out of daunger of al thes terrible matters: now (I say) if we reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue our selues out of hand. For we know not what shal become of vs to morrow. It may be that to morrow our harts wil be as hard and careles of thes affaires, as they haue bene heretofore, and as Pharao his hart was, after Moyses departure from him. O that he had resolued him self throughlie whiles Moyses was with him; how fortunate a creature had he bene? if the riche Glutton had taken the time while Lazarus lay at his dore; how bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a man had he made him self? he
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:14541:262"/>
was for told his miserie (as we are now) by Moyses and other prophets, according <note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> as our sauy our doth signifie; but he wold not heare. After ward he fel into such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his owne foly, that he wold needes haue Lazarus sent from Abrahams bolome vnto his brethren in the world, to warne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his errour. But Abraham told him, it was booteles; for that they wold not haue beleeued Lazarus in this case, but rather (perhappes) haue persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him as a liar and difamer of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable brother disceased, if he should haue reuealed vnto them his torments. And so in verie deede would the wicked men of this world doe now, if one should come and tel them that their parents or frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are damned in hel, for such and such offences as them selues are inta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. What then can God deuise to doe for the sauing of thes men? what way, what means, what order may he take, when neither warning, nor example of others, nor threats, nor exhortations wil doe any good? we know, or may know, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the life we doe, we can not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. We know and ought to know, that many before vs haue bene damned for lesse matters. We know and can not chuse but know, that we must shortlie die, and <note place="margin">Greate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence &amp; ouer sight.</note> receyue our selues, as they receyued; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as they did, or worse. We see by this laid down before, that the paines are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable and yet eternal, which doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende and expect the wicked. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:14541:263"/>
them most vnfortunate and miserable that for anie pleasure or commoditie of this world, are now fallen into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What then should let vs, to dispatche our selues quicklie of al impediments? to breake vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie from al bandes and chaines of this wicked world, that let vs from this true and zealouse resolution? why should we sleepe one night in sinne; seing that night may chaunce to be oar last, and so the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting cutting of, al hope to come?</p>
               <p>Resolue thy self therefore (my deare brother) if thou be wise; and cleare thy <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> soule from thes daungers while God is willing to receyue thy amendment, and moueth the therunto by these meanes, as he did the riche man by Moyses and his other prophets while he was yet in his prosperitie. Let his example, be ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times before thine eyes, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and it shal doe the good. God is a wounderful God; and to shew his patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and infinit goodnesse, he woeth vs in this lise; seeketh vnto vs, and layeth him self (as it were) at our feet, to moue vs therby to our owne good; to winne vs, to drawe vs, and to saue vs from perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But after this life, he altereth his course of dealing: he turneth ouer the leafe, and chaungeth his stile. Of a lambe he heco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a lyon to the wicked: and of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour, a iust and seuere punisher.

But for that al hartes are not of one constitution in this respect, nor al drawen and mooued with the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: I purpose to adioine here a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of commoditie, wherunto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie eche man is prone by nature; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, may be perhaps of greater force to worke that effect which we desire, then any thing else that hitherto hath bene spoken.

               <p>
                  <hi>OF THIS PAIMENT</hi> then reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for gods seruants in the life to come, <note place="margin">THE. 1. part. OF the revvard in general. Mat. 25. 2.

And first of al, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the holie scripture, calling it a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a heauenlie kingdome, an eternal kingdome, a most blessed kingdome: we must nedes confesse it to be a maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great reward: seing that in this world, hardlie can there be found so bountiful a Monarch, as wil bestowe a kingdome vpon his seruant in recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se of his seruice; and if he would and were
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:14541:265"/>
able to performe the same; yet would it be nether heauenly nor eternal nor blessed kingdome, such as this is which God hath promised vnto his seruants. Secondlie, if we credit that which S. Paul saieth of this reward, <hi>that nether eye hath seene, nor eare</hi>

For that we haue sene many wounderful things in our dayes; we haue heard more wounderful; we may conceyue most wounderful, and almost infinit. How then shal we come to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the greatnesse and value of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? surelie no tongue created either of man or Angel can expresse the same, no imagination conceyue, no vnderstanding comprehend it. Christ him self hath said, <hi>nemo scit nisi qui accipit:</hi> No man knoweth it <note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> but he that enioyeth it. <q>And therfore he calleth it <hi>hidden manna</hi> in the same place.</q> Notwithstanding, as it is reported of a <note place="margin">Hovv the greatnes of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie ioy is found out.</note> learned Geometrician, who finding the length of Hercules foote vpon the hil Olimpus, drew out his whole bodie by the proportion of that one part: so we by some things set doune in holy scripture, and by some other circumstances agreing therunto, may frame a coniecture of the matter, though it be farre vnequal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the thing it self.</p>

               <p>Lastlie, for some further declaration of <note place="margin">6. By the 3. places vvherto a man is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</note> this matter, and for expressing th' incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable excellencie of heauenlie blisse; some diuines doe vse a consideration of the three different places, wherunto man by his creation is ordained, albeit in al pointes it be not necessarie to hold the same iust proportion. The first of which places is, our mothers wombe; the second, this present world; the third is, <hi>coelum Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pireum,</hi> which is the place of blisse in the life to come. Now in these three places, (say the learned,) we must hold some like proportion, (by al reason) betwene the third and second place, as we see sensiblie to be obserued betwene the second and first. So that, in what proportion the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:14541:270"/>
doeth differ from the first: in like measure must the third be different from the second, on rather much more, for that eternal and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly thinges doe exceede al comparison of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sitorie thinges amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themselues. By this proportion then, we must say, (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple sake,) that as farre as <note place="margin">Mark the collection.</note> the whole world doth passe the wombe of one priuate woman: so much in al beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, delites, and Maiestie, doth the place of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie blisse, passe al this whole world with the ornamentes therof. And as much as a man liuing in the world doth exceede <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a child in his mothers bellie, for strength of bodie, beautie, wit, vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowledge: so much and farre more, doth a Saint in heauen passe al men of this world, in al these excellencies and infinite more besides. And looke how great horrour a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of perfect age would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> conceaue, to returne into his mothers wombe againe: so much and farre greater would a glorified soule haue, to come back from that eternal blisse into this vale of miserie. The nine moneths also of life in the mothers wombe, are not so litle in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> respect of any mans age in the world, as is the longest life vpon earth, in respect of euerlasting life in heauen. Nor the blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ignorance, and other miseries of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> child in his mothers wombe, are any way to be compared to the cecitie, darknes, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, &amp; other calamities of this life; in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the cleare light, most excellent knowledge, deuine vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, &amp; other
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:14541:271"/>
singuler prerogatiues of the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. So that by al thes reasons laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ther may a general coniecture be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the most infinit and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible excellencie of this reward wherof we treate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BVT NOVV TO CONSIDER</hi> the same thing somewhat more in particular; <note place="margin">THE. 2. part. OF THE tvvo partes of felicitie in heauen.</note> it is to be noted, that this reward or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of heauen, shal comprehend in it self two partes or members; the one called es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential, belonging to the soule: the other termed accidental, belonging to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. <note place="margin">First of the soule.</note> The essential part consisteth in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or sight of God, as afterward shalbe shewed. The accidental consisteth in the <note place="margin">Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the bodie.</note> change and glorification of our flesh after the general resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherby this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible bodie of ours, shal put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, (as S. Paul sayeth) and of mortal <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. Sap. 9. Ephe. 4.</note> become immortal. Al this flesh (I say) of ours, that now is so combersom and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeueth the minde; that now is infested with so many inconueniences; subiect to so many mutations; vexed with so many diseases; defiled with so many corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; replenished with so infinit miseries and calamities: shal then be made glorious &amp; most perfect, to endure for euer without change or mutation, and to raigne with our soule euerlastinglie. And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (as <note n="*" place="margin">See S. Tho. 3. par. q. 82. in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> diuines doe proue) the same shalbe endued with certaine excelles qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and giftes from God, which S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm (whom in this matter I wil folow) <note place="margin">In l. de simi. c. 48. 49.</note>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:14541:271"/>
doth reckon to be seuen; to wit, beautie, agilitie, fortitude, penetrabilitie, health, <note place="margin">Seuen priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the glorified bodies.</note> pleasure, &amp; perpetuitie. Al which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, either doe want in the damned bodies; or else their contraries are found therin.</p>
               <p>And first of al, concerning the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and high excellencie of beautie, <note place="margin">1. Beautie.</note> how singuler it shalbe in the bodies glorified, our Saueour him self in some part declareth, when he sayeth. <hi>At that daie shal the Iust shine as the sunne in the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>kingdome of their father.</hi> A maruailouse speech, and in humane sense almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that our putrefied bodies should shine and become as cleare as the sunne. Whereas in the contrarie part, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the damned shal be as black and vglie, as filth it self. The second preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue assigned to the bodies of the iust, is <note place="margin">2. Agilitie.</note> agilitie or velocitie, whereby their flesh is deliuered from al lumpish heuinesse, wherwith it was pestered in this life, and made as light as the Angels them selues which are spirits, and doe passe from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to place with infinit swiftnesse, as also doe ascend and descend of them selues, against the nature of corruptible bodies: whereas in the meane space, the damned bodies shal be bound both hand &amp; foote, <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> not able once to moue, as the scripture expressie noteth.</p>
               <p>The third gift and qualitie is superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural strength, wherewith the glorified <note place="margin">3. Strength. <hi>Cap.</hi> 52.</note> bodie shal so abound (as Anselmꝰ saieth,)
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:14541:272"/>
that he shal be able to moue the whole earth if he wold: and contrariwise, the damned body shal be so weake and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as he shal not be able to remoue the verie wormes frome: his owne face and eyes. The fourth qualitie is penetrabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or free power of passage, whereby the glorified bodie shalbe inabled, to pearse <note place="margin">4. Penetrabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> and penetrate any other bodies what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; as walles, doores, the earth or firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any resistance, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the nature of a corruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. So we see that. Christs bodie glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> after his resurrection, entered the house wher his disciples were, the dores being shut, and pearsed also the heauens at his Ascensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The fift rare qualitie, is most absolute health; whereby the glorified <note place="margin">5. Health.</note> body shal be deliuered from al diseases &amp; paines of this life, and from al troubles &amp; encombrances belonging to the same; as are, eating, drinking, sleeping, and other like; and shalbe set in a most perfect and florishing state of health and freedome, neuer decayable again: whereas the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bodie in contrarie maner, shal be filled and stuffed with innumerable diseases, paines, and torments, which no tongue of man is able to expresse.</p>
               <p>The sixt perfection is delite and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, <note place="margin">6. Pleasure.</note> wherewith the glorified bodie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al measure shalbe replenished; al his senses together finding now their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and proper obiects in much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, then euer they could in this
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:14541:272"/>
world. Now (I say) euerie part, sense, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ioint, shal be filled with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding delectation and pleasure; according as in the damned, ech part and sense shal contrariwise be afflicted and tormented. I wil alleage S. Anselmus his wordes, for that they expresse vnto vs this matter most liuelie. <q>Al the whole glorified body <note place="margin">Ansel. c. 5v. vbi sup.</note> (layeth he) shal be filled with abundance of al kind of comfort; the eyes, the eares, the nose, the mouth; the hands the throte, the lungs, the hart; the stomacke, the backe, the bones, the marowe; and the very-entrales them selues, and euery part thereof, shalbe replenished with such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable swetenesse and pleasure; that truelie, it may be sayed, that the whole man <hi>is made t, drinke of the riuer of Gods diuine</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>delites, and made-dronke vvith the abundance of Gods house.</hi>
                  </q> In contrarie wise the damned bodie, shalbe tormented in al his partes and members; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if you saw a man that had a burning yron thrust into his eyes, an other into his mouth, an other into his brest, an other into his ribbes, and so through al the ioints, partes, and members of his bodie. Would you not thinke him miserable, and the other man happie?</p>
               <p>The seuenth and last excellencie of a glorified body, is called perpetuitie or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie <note place="margin">7. Perpetuitie</note> of life, wherby it is made assured neuer to die or alter more from his feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie; according to the saying of holie scripture, <hi>the iust shal liue for euer.</hi> And this <note place="margin">Sap. 5.</note> is one of the chiefest prerogatiues &amp; most
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:14541:273"/>
excellent dignities of a glorified bodie, wherby al care, doubt, and feare is taken away, al danger of hurt and noyance. For if al the world should fal together vpon such a bodie; it could not hurt or harme it any thing at al: where as the damned bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die lieth alway in dying, and is subiect to the griefe of euery blow and torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t laied vpon it, &amp; so must remain for al eternitie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Thes <note n="*" place="margin">Al thes thinges Bun. either reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tath, or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth: perhap pes, as not appertaini<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the bodies of Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> seuen most excellent qualities, prerogatiues, dignities, and preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, shal adorne and beautifie, or rather deifie (in a certaine sorte) the bodies of the iust in the life to come. And albeit this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal happinesse be but accidental (as I haue sayed,) and nothing in deed to the essential felicitie of the Queene &amp; mist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res her self, that is our soule: yet is it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no smal importance as you see, but such, as if any bodie in this life had but any one iote of the least part therof, we should esteeme it most happie. And to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine so much in this world, many men wold aduenture farre; whereas to get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al together in the life to come, no man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most wil moue his fingar.</p>
               <p>But now to leaue this, &amp; to come to the <note place="margin">The 2. part of felicitie, called essen tial, pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the faule.</note> most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; essential point of this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, that is, to the part which pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the soule: it is to be vnderstood, that albeit there be many things that doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre in this felicitie, for the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; perfection of ful happinesse; Yet the fontaine of al is but one onelie thing, called by diuines, <hi>Visio dei beatifica,</hi> the sight

               <p>Wherfore to conclude at length this whole chapter; thou hast to consider my <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vvith th' applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of al that hath bene said.</note> deare and louing brother, that this greate Game and Goale of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie blisse, which hitherto I haue endeuoured to describe vnto thee, is set vp onlie for them that wil runne vnto it, as S. Paul wel noteth: and no man is crouned in this glorie, but such onelie as wil fight for it, according as the same. Apostle doth teach and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. Phil. 3. 2. Tim. 2. 1. Ti. 6. Heb. 12. Mat. 7. 19 25.</note> vs. It is not euerie one that saieth to Christ, Lord Lord, shal enter into the kingdome of heauen: but they onelie which shal doe the wil of Christs eternal father that is in heauen. Albeit this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ be set out to al men, yet euerie man shal not arriue to raigne with Christ, but such onelie as shal be content <note place="margin">Rom. 8. Mat. 11.</note> to suffer with Christ. Though the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen be subject to violence: <note place="margin">Apo. 14. &amp; 20.</note> (as hath bene said,) yet no man can enter
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:14541:283"/>
there by force, but he onelie whose good deedes shal follow him to make open the gates: that is; <hi>except he enter</hi> (as the prophet <note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> saith) <hi>vvithout spot, and haue vvroght iustice.</hi> My meaning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that as I haue shewed, the exceeding greatnes and worthines of this treasure (gentle reader:) so thou being a Christian shouldest also conceaue the right way of gaining the same; which is no other by the testimonie of Christ him self, but onelie by holie and vertuous life, in keping his commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Thou art therfore to sit doune &amp; consider, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Math. 7. &amp; 19. Ioh. 14. Luc. 14.</note> to thy Saueours counsaile,) what thou wilt doe and determine herin; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haue so much spiritual money, as is sufficient to build this tower, and to make this heauenlie warre, or no: that is; whether thou haue so much good wil and holie manhood in thee, as to bestow the paines of a vertuous life, (if it be rather to be called paines then pleasure,) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the gaining of this eternal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. This is the question, this is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <note place="margin">The final end of al that hath bene said.</note> pointe, this is the verie whole issue of al the matter; and hitherto hath apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained whatsoeuer hath bene spoken in this booke before, either of thy Creatour and creation, of thie particular end; or of the Maiestie, bountie, and iustice of thie God and Saueour: as also of the account he wil demand of thee; and of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or rewardes laid vp for the life to come. Al this (I say) hath bene meant by me to this onelie end and purpose, that
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:14541:283"/>
thou (measuring the one part and the other,) shouldest finallie resolue thie self what thou wouldest doe, and not to passe ouer thy time in careles negligence, as manie are accustomed to doe, neuer espiing their own errours vntil it be to late to amend them.</p>
               <p>For the loue of God then (deare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <note place="margin">An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> brother) and for the loue thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to thy own soule &amp; eternal welfare, shake of this most dangerous securitie, wherin flesh and blood is wont to lulle the careles people of this world; make some earnest resolution, for looking to thy state in the life to come. Recalle to mind oftentimes that worthie sentence; <hi>Hoc momentum, vnde pendet aeternitas:</hi> This life <note place="margin">A saying to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</note> is the mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherof dependeth al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of weal or woe hereafter. If it be but a moment (deare brother) and yet a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so great consequence and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: how is it passed ouer by earthelie men with so litle care, and cogitation? what reason may be alleaged of this so dangerous a negligence? what cause may be assigned, of so extreme a follie? Al the creatures of earth, heauen, and hel, euen from the very first to the last, if thou exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them al, may be argumentes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues vnto thee, to leaue this perilous course wherin thou art: al are or may be bookes lessons and sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnto thee, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and protesting, (some by their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, some by their glorie, some by their beautie, and al by their creation,)
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:14541:284"/>
that thou oughtest without delay, to make resolution of an other kinde of life; and that al is vanitie, al is folie, al is iniquitie, al is miserie, besides the onelie seruice of thie Lord and maker. And so with this, wil I make here an ende of this first part, reseruing some other things to be spoken in the second; for remouing of such impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as our spiritual aduersarie is wont to cast against this good worke of Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as against the first step and degree of our saluation.</p>

               <p>This is that great and maine impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that stoppeth the conduits of Gods <note place="margin">The mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> holie grace, from flowing into the soule of a sinful man.

To which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable estate, when a sinful man is once arriued; the next steppe he maketh, is, (for auoiding al remorse and trouble of cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce;) to engulfe him self into the depth of al detestable enormities, and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done his soule to the verie sincke of al filth and abhominations; according as S.

               <p>Which wicked resolution of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, is the thing (as I haue noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that most of al other offences vpon earth, doth exasperate the ire of Almighty God, depriuing his deuine Maiestie of <note place="margin">The thing vvherin God most deliteth, is mercie.</note> that most excellent propertie, wherin he cheifly deliteth and glorieth, which is, his infinite and vnspeacable mercie. This might be declared by diuers and sondrie examples of holy writt; how be it, two only shal suffice for this present. The first is of the people of Israel not long before their banishment to Babilon; who being threatned from God by the Prophet Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that manifold punishments were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent ouer their heads, for their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinnes committed against his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie: bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne (in stead of repentance) to fal to desperation, and consequently, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to take that impious course of al dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute life, alleaged before out of S. Paul; for thus they answered God exhorting them by his threats to reforme their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked liues. <hi>VVe are novv grovven desperate; &amp; therfore vve vvil hereafter folovve our ovvne</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A desperat resolution.</note>

                     <hi>Interrogate Gentes; quit audiuit talia horribilia?</hi>  Aske and enquire of the verie Gentiles, whether euer among them were heard any such horrible blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</q>
                  <pb n="527" facs="tcp:14541:287"/>
And after this, for more declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this intollerable iniurie herin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his Maiestie: he commaunded the Prophet Ieremie to goe forth of his owne house; and to get him to a potters shope, which in the village was framing his vessels vpon the wheele. Which Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie hauing done; he sawe befor his face a pot crushed and broken by the potter al in peeces vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wheele; and thincking therby that the vessel had bene vtterly vnprofitable and to be cast away: he saw the same clay ptesently framed agayne by <note place="margin">A marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Gods cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inencie.</note> the potter, into a new vessel more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then before. Wherat he maruailing; God said vnto him: <q>Doest not thou thinck (Ieremie) that I can doe with the house of Israel, as this potter hath done with his vessel? Or is not the house of Israel in my handes, as the clay is in the handes of this craftesman? I wil denounce vpon the sodaine against a Nation and kingdome, that I wil roote it vp and destroye it; and if that nation or kingdome doe repent from their wickednes, I also wil repent me of the punishment which I intended to laie vpon them. </q>And then he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth foreward, declaring vnto Ieremie the exceeding greif and indignation which he conceaueth, that any sinner what soeuer, should despaire of mercie &amp; pardon at his hands.</p>
               <p>The second example is of the same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israel during the time of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in Babilon, at what time being

                  <hi>life then may vve haue?</hi> At which cogitation and speech God being greatly moued; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared presently to Ezechiel &amp; said vnto him; <hi>Tel this people; I doe liue saieth the Lord God of hostes, I vvishe not the death of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, but rather that he should turne from his vvicked vvaies and liue. VVhy vvil the house of Israel die in their sinnes, rather then turne vnto me?</hi> And then he maketh a large and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment protestation, that how greuously soeuer any person shal offend him, &amp; how great punishments soeuer he shal denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce against him; yea, if he had giuen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse sentence of death and damnation vpon him: yet, <hi>Si egerit paenitentiam a peccato suo, secerit<expan>

               <p>And this now might be sufficient, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit nothing els were spoken) for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this first obstacle and impediment of

true resolution, which is the dispaire of Gods infinite goodnes and mercie.

               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST OF AL,</hi> by the infinite and <note place="margin">THE. 1. part. TOVCHING. the loue that God: beareth tovvardes man.</note> incomprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sible loue that almightie God beareth vnto man; which loue is alwaies the mother of fauour, grace, and mercie. If you demaund of me in what sort I doe proue that the loue of God is so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great towardes man: I answere as the Cosmographer is wont to doe, who by the greatnes and multitude of the strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and riuers, doth frame a coniecture of the fountaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they flowe. The proper riuers which are deriued and doe ronne forth of loue, are good turnes and benefites; which seing they are infinite endles and inestimable, bestowed by God vpon man, (as in place before hath bene declared, and the whole vniuersal frame of this world doth aboundantly beare witnesse;) it foloweth most euidently, that the origine, fountaine, &amp; welspring
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:14541:289"/>
of al thes fauours, graces, and good tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; must needs be infinite, immeasurable, and farre surpassing al compasse of mans vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>If you require of me the cause and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why almightie God should so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully be affected towards man; I can directly yeld you none at al, but rather meruaile therat with holy Iob, why so soueraine a Maiestie should set his hart <note place="margin">Iob. 7.</note> vpon so base a subiect. Notwithstanding, the holy Scripture seemeth to alleage one principal reason of this loue, when it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth; <hi>Nihil odistieorum quae secisti, &amp; parcis om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>quia tua sunt, Domine, quidiligis animas.</hi> 
                  <q>That is; Thou (O Lord) which louest sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, canst not hate thos thinges which thou hast made, but doest vse mercy towards al, for that they are thine.</q>  And the like maner of reasoning vseth God <note place="margin">1. The first cause vvhie God loueth vs, for that he is our Creator &amp; vve are his ovvne vvorkes. <hi>Ezec.</hi> 18.</note> him self when he saieth by his Prophet Ezechiel; <hi>behould, al soules are mine:</hi> and hereupon he inferreth a litle after; <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid voluntatis meae est mors impij:</hi> Can I haue the wil to damne a wicked man, seing that his soule is mine, created and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by me? as who would saie, this were a case against al order and equitie. And the reason of this maner of speech and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, for that euery man naturally is enclined to loue the things that be of his owne making. So we see that if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue an orchard wherin be great varietie of trees and plantes, yet if ther be but one of his owne peculier grafting that flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:14541:289"/>
and prospereth wel; he taketh more delite therin, then in any of the rest, for that it is his owne workemanship. So in <note place="margin">Euerie man giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue his ovvne.</note> like maner if a man haue a vineyard of his owne planting and trimming. For which respect, the holy prophet Dauid, finding him self and the whole kingdome of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in great affliction &amp; calamitie: thought no other means so forcible to draw God to compassion and commiseratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their case, as to crie out to him in this maner; <hi>Thou vvhich gouernest Israel, looke tovvards vs</hi>

                  <hi>and be atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: Thou hast brought forth a vineyard out of Egipt, thou hast purged the same from Gentiles, and hast planted it.

               </p>
               <p>But aboue al other, the blessed man Iob standeth, as it were, in argument and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation <note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> with God about this matter, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; haue not thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds made me? haue they <note place="margin">The confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Iob in that God had made him.</note> not framed me of clay and earth? hast not thou compacted me as cheese is made of milke? hast not thou knit my bones and sinowes together, and couered my flesh with skinne? hast not thou giuen me life, and conserued my spirite with thy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual protection? how soeuer thou seme to dissemble thes matters and hide them in thy hart; yet I know that thou reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brest
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:14541:290"/>
them al, and are not vnmindful of them. By which words this holy man signified, that albeit God suffered him greatly to be tempted and afflicted in this life, so farre forth, as he might seme to haue forgotten him: yet was he wel assured that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maiestie could not of his goodnes forsake or despise him, for that he was his creature and the proper workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of his owne hands. In which verie name of <hi>vvorkemanship,</hi> holy Dauid tooke such great comfort, considering that the workeman can not chuse but be louing and fauourable towards his owne work, (especially so excellent and bountiful a workeman as is almightie God, towards a worke made as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, to his owne shape and likenes:) that in al his necessities, yea euen in his greatest infirmities of flesh, and most grieuous offenses committed against his Maiestie, he conceaueth most assured <note place="margin">Th' assured hope Dauid had in that he vvas Gods vvork manship.</note> hope of mercie and pardon, vpon this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he was his workemanship; and consequentlie, wel knowen to his deuine wisdome, of how bricle &amp; infirme a metal he was made. For thus at one time among other, he reasoneth of this matter. <q>Looke how farre distant the east is from <note place="margin">Psal. 102.</note> the west; so farre of hath God remoued our iniquities from vs. Euen as a father doth take compassion of his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; so doth our Lord take mercie vpon vs: for that he wel knoweth the mould wherof we are made, and doth remember that we are nothing els but dust.</q>

In which discourse the holie Prophet maketh mention of two thinges, that did assure him of Godes mercie; th' one, that God was his Creator and maker, and therby priuie to the frailtie of his consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution &amp; nature: th' other that he was his father, whos propertie is to haue compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on his children; and this is a second reason, more strong and forcible perhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes then the former, whie euerie man <note place="margin">The second reason of assurance of Gods loue, for that he is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> maie be most assured of pardon that hartely turneth vnto almightie God; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that it hath pleased his deuine Maiestie, not only to be vnto man a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour (as he is to al other thinges;) but also a father, which is the title of the greatest loue and coniunction, that nature hath left to thinges in this world. Wherof a certaine philosopher said wel; that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could conceaue the loue of a parents hart, but he onlie that had a child of his owne. For which respect, our Sauiour IESVS to put vs in mind of this most feruent loue; and therby as it were, by one fire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendle an other within our hartes; did vse often times and ordinarily, to repeat this <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 6. 8. &amp;c.</note> sweet name of Father in his speeches to his folowers, and therupon founded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers most excellent and comfortable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sourses; as at one time, when he dehorted them from ouer much care and worldlie solicitude: he addeth this reason; <hi>Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

shal not need to trouble yourselues with too great anxietie in thes matters, for that a fathers hart can not but be prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and careful for his children. The like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction maketh he in the same place, to the same effect, by comparison of the bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the aire and other- irreasonable creatures; for which, if God doe make (saith he) so aboundant prouision, as al the whole world may witnesse that he doth: much more careful wil he be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for men that are his owne children, which are more deare vnto him then any other terrestrial thing created.</p>
               <p>Al which speeches and reasons of our Sauiour, are deriued from the nature and propertie of a parent, which can not but affect and loue his children; especially such a father whom Christ calleth cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial, who in this perfection of true father ly <note place="margin">VVhat a father God is.</note> loue, so farre exceedeth al earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents put together; as in power, clemencie and goodnes, almightie God surpasseth the infirmitie of his feeble creatures. Such a father, as hath not only geuen life and being vnto his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but also (as S.

And vpon assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this hope haue aswel sinners as Saints from the beginning, fled vnto him confidently vnder this title of paternitie, and neuer were deceaued. So the prophet
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:14541:291"/>
Esaie aswel in his owne name, as in the name of the sinful people of Israel, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to crie. <hi>Thou art our father; Abraham</hi>

For which cause he is called <note place="margin">Psal. 35.</note> in Scripture the God of iustice and reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, and not the Father. And finally this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">VVhat the name of Fa ther doth import.</note> name of father in God, doth import vnto vs by Godes owne testimonie, al sweetenes, al loue, al frendship, al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; al satherly prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, care, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; al certaintie of fauour, al assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of grace, al securitie of mercie, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and remission of our sinnes, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer vnfainedly we turne vnto him. And in this point his diuine Maiestie is so foreward and vehement, to geue vs assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; that being not content to set forth his loue vnto vs by the loue of a fathers hart; he goeth further, and protesteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that his hart is more te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der towardes vs in this behalf, then the hart of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be to the only child and infant of her own wombe.

if we returne willingly vnto him; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onr receauing shal cost him nothing els, but only a merciful looke vpon vs; which is not so much from the infinite bowels of his botomeles mercie, as is one droppe of water from the most huge gulfe of the maine Ocean sea.

               <p>And for the first, which are his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; most apparent it is, as wel by the

And finallie, God talking to a soule that hath oftentimes fallen &amp; most infinitelie offended him; he saith thus:  <q>it is <note place="margin">Iere. 3.</note>a common receaued speech that if a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> depart from her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and doe ioine her self to an other man; she may not returne to her first husband againe, for that she is defiled, and made contaminate.

               </p>
               <p>By which wordes is expressed the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werth vniuersalitie, containing al states, qualities, and conditions of men; how many waies, or how oftentimes, or how contemptuouslie soeuer, they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted sinnes against his diuine Maiestie. And what may be added now more vnto this? was ther euer prince that made so large an offer vnto his subiectes? or was ther euer father that gaue so ample and vniuersal promise of pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?

O most miserable and infortunate man that excludeth him self, whom God excludeth not. What is ther in this general and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal promises, wherof anie man in the world should haue pretence, to make any least doubt or question? Of the meaning (perhapes) and intent of him that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth? O deare brother, it is onlie loue and tharitie; and consequentlie, can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue vs. Of the truth and suertie of his promisses? It is infallible; and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine then heauen and earth put together. Of the power that he hath to perfourme <note place="margin">Three poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of great comfort.</note> his promisse? It is infinite, and not restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any boundes or limitation: wherof the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may we doubt? or in which of thes
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:14541:300"/>
three pointes may we not conceaue most singuler consolation? heare the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meditation, that blessed S.

                  <note place="margin">Bern. ser. in verb. Psalm. misericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni in aeter. cantab.</note> 
                  <hi>vocationis, veritatem promissionis, pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem redditionis. &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>That is, I doe consider three thinges (saith this holie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) wherin al my hope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth, &amp; wherby it is made inuincible. First, the exceeding loue and charitie of him, that calleth me to him by repentance; secondlie, the infallible truth and certaintie of his promise which he maketh to me of pardon and mercie; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the endles power and abilitie he hath to perfourme whatsoeuer he promiseth. This is that triple or threefold rope and chaine, which holie scripture saith is <note place="margin">Eccle. 4.</note> hardlie broken: for that by this rope, let donne vnto vs from heauen which is our contrie, into this world, that is our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; we may ascende and mount vp (if we wil) euen vnto the sight and possession of Gods eternal kingdom and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. </q>Thus farre that blessed father.</p>
               <p>But now to the second pointe; if we consider how faithfullie almightie God <note place="margin">Hovv God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sourmed his promises, to sinners that haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> hath put in execution thos promises of his from time to time, &amp; how no one man vpon earth, (so many ages as the world hath continued) was euer yet frustrate of his hope, in making his conuersion vnto his Maiestie, if he made it from his hart: we shal finde further cause for vs to confide.
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:14541:300"/>
For so much as it is not probable, or i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be imagined; that he which neuer failed in times past, wil breake his promise for the time to come; especially seing now in Christianitie, when we haue this aduantage aboue other former times (as S. Iohn doth also note,) that he who was <note place="margin">1. Ioa. 2.</note> and is our iudge, is become also our aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocat to pleade our cause.</p>
               <p>Cast backe thine eyes then my louing deare brother, and take a vew of al ages times and seasons past and gone. Beginne from the first creation of the world, and come donneward euen vnto this daye; &amp; examine indifferentlie whether in al this wide compasse of times, persons, places &amp; <note place="margin">Neuer sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that vvas not pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> most greeuous offences committed against his diuine Maiestie, ther were euer yet any one sinner vpon earth, that returned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say nedlie and was not receaued. The sinne of our first parentes, was presentelie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> vnto them, vpon their first significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of greefe and sorowe for the same. And not onlie this, but our Saueour also <note place="margin">Adam &amp; Eue.</note> Iesus Christ was promissed to be sent, for restoring them and their posteritie to the glorie and felicitie, which by their fal they had lost. After this, vntil the time of Abraham and of the people of Israel, as some workes of Gods iustice are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in holie writ, that were excercised vpon irrepentant offendours: so are ther many more celebrated of his mercie; and onlie two persons in particuler are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, who notwithstanding some
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:14541:301"/>
sorow which they seemed to haue of their offences, were yet reiected; the first <note place="margin">The reice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cain and Esau.</note> wherof was the murderer Cain, who at the beginning denied his wickednes vnto God; and then being conuicted, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired of remission. The second was Esau, whom S. Paul calleth a profane fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; who founde no place of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> with teares he sought the same. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of S. Chrisostome geueth the reason in <note place="margin">Chris. hom. 80. de pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. ad pop. Antio.</note> thes wordes: <hi>For this cause Esau obtained not pardon, for that he did not repente as he should haue done; his teares proceeding rather of anger and temptation, then of true sorovv.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the people of Israel came to be a distinct nation, and to be gouerned at Gods appointement: how greeuouslie (trow you) did they offend day lie, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most howerlie his diuine Maiestie? And how gratiouslie did his vnspeakable cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie remitt and pardon their manifold and innumerable sinnes &amp; trespasses done agaist him? The whole scripture (in truth) <note place="margin">The infinit sinnes of the Iuishe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; their infinit par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.</note> seemeth nothing els, but a perpetual nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods incredible patience and infinite mercies towardes them. And if I would speake of particuler persons amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, which he receaued to his fauour after greate and manifold offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; ther would be no end of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital. Let Manasses that most impious and wicked king, be an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple for al; of whos <note place="margin">Th' exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Manasses</note> enormous life and most detestable actes, whole pages are replenished, both in the <note place="margin">4. Reg. 21 2. Par. 33.</note> bookes of kinges and Chronicles; and yet
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:14541:301"/>
afterwardes notwithstanding, the same man falling into miserie and calamitie among the Babylonians, (a fortunate schoole oftentimes for Princes, who in their prosperitie are wont to contemne God,) he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be sorowful for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life and actions; and to doe great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (as the scripture saith) in the sight of God, for the same. Wherat his diuine and incomprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sible mercie was so much moued presentlie, as he receaued him to fauour, and brought him backe from his prison and fetters, to his kingdome and imperial throne of Maiestie.</p>
               <p>The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple also of the Niniuites is very notable &amp; singuler in this behalf: against <note place="margin">The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites.</note> whom almightie God hauing decreed a sentence of death, to be executed within a certaine time; he commanded Ionas the <note place="margin">Ion. 1. 2. 3. 4.</note> prophet to goe and denounce that sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto them. But Ionas wel knowing the nature and disposition of God towardes mercie; forsaw (as afterwardes he signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth) that if he should goe and beare that embassage vnto them, and they therupon make change of ther liues; his Maiestie would presentlie pardon them, and so he should be taken for a false and lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. For auoiding which inconuenience, he chose rather to flee away by sea to the citie of Tharsis, and ther to hide himself. But almightie God raised a tempest in that iourney, and disposed in such sort, as Ionas was cast into the sea, and ther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued and deuoured by a whale; from
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:14541:302"/>
whos belly he was commanded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to repaire to Niniue, and to doe his former message; which he perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And the tenour of his message was, that within fortie dayes that huge citie of Niniuie should be destroyed. Which he hauing denounced vnto them: the sequel fel out, as Ionas before had suspected. For the Niniuites beleeuing the message, and betaking them selues to repentance, God forgaue them presentlie; wherat Ionas was exceedinglie greeued &amp; offended, &amp; complained sweetlie to God of his stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge dealing herin, demanding whie he had inforced him to come and preach destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto them, knowing wel before ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that he would pardon them. But his merciful Lord answered him fullie to this pointe, by a certaine accident that fel out, wherto Ionas was not able to replie one word.</p>
               <p>For so it chanced, that Ionas sitting without the walles of Niniuie, vnder an Iuie bush, that in one night by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment was spro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vp to couer him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sunne: the same Iuie by Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce perished vpon the suddaine, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by a worme, leauing the poore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet destitute of that consolation of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe which he receaued by it. Wherwith he being not a litle disquieted and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider this speech of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. Ion 23. 4.</note> God said vnto him; <q>thou (Ionas) art sorowful, and much grieued for losse of thine Iuie tree, which not withstanding thou diddest not plant nor make to grow,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:14541:302"/>
nor tookest any labour at al about it. But the same grew vp in one night, and in one night it perished againe. And shal not I then, be careful to pardon my greate citie of Niniuie, wherin ther be aboue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twentie thousand innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which can not distinguish betwene their right hand and their left? </q>This was the answer of almightie God to Ionas, for defence of his singuler inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in respect that the Niniuites were his owne creatures, his owne workmanship, and the labours of his own handes, as al other people also are. Of which kinde of reason, and consideration, ther haue bene diuers thinges said and declared <note n="*" place="margin">In the first part of this chapter.</note> before, for manifestation of Gods infinit mercie. And al this that hitherto hath bene spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is of thinges onlie donne in time of the old testament, before the appearance of Christ our Saueour in flesh.</p>
               <p>But now if we looke into the time of grace, when God incarnate came him self <note place="margin">Examples of mercie in the nevv testament.</note> in person, to shew the riches of his endles mercie vnto mortal men vpon earth: we shal see more examples without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of this exceeding clemencie. For that now, our Creator and shepheard ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (as it were) with extreme compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion came down into the vale of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, with resolution not onlie to offer pardon and forgeuenes to al his sheepe that were a stray and would returne; but <note place="margin">Luc. 15.</note> also to follow &amp; seeke them out; &amp; being found, to lay them on his own shoulders,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:14541:303"/>
and so to beare them backe vnto the fold againe, and ther to geue his life and blood for their defence against the wolfe. O sweet Lord, what greater loue ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined <note place="margin">Ioan. 10. &amp; 11.</note> then this? what more pregnant sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of inflamed charitie, can mans cogitation conceaue or apprehend? is it maruaile now if he which desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnto vs with this hart, and with thes bowels of burning affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did set open the gates of al his treasures, fauours, &amp; graces vnto vs? Is it maruaile if the holie apostle S.

               </p>
               <p>Herehence it proceeded that al his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite and pleasure vpon earth, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse <note place="margin">The vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</note> with sinners, and to geeue them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </p>
               <p>And in the very same sermon he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth yet further of the same matter, in manner folowing. <q>Not euery man that hath sinned, but he that perseuereth in sinne, is hateful and abominable in the sight of God. For that no man must distrust of Gods mercie towards him that wil amend and leaue his sinnes. For that God him self as a most sweete comforter hath

said by his Prophet, <hi>that the impietie of a</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus then we see, if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s foote, leg, or arme be broken; with how great paine <note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud of the bodie, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the miscrie of the soule, by multiplying sinne.</note> the same is restored to his accustomed strength. But if any member of our body should be broken twise, or three times, or more often in one and the self same place: your charitie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagin, how hard a thing it were for that part to recouer her perfit health againe. So fareth it (deare brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) in the woundes and ruptures of our soule. If a man doe commit sinne once or twise, and doe vnsainedly without dissimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make his refuge to the medicine of pera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; he doth out of hand obtaine health againe, and that sometimes without any skar or blemish of the disease past. But if he begin to adde sinnes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinnes in such sort, that the woundes of his soule doe rather putrifie within him by couering and defending them, then heale by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and confession: it is to be feared, least that heauy speach of th' Apostle be fulfilled in him, to whom he saith; <hi>dost thou</hi>

For to this end did he

               <p>First then albeit wee should suppose, that the way of vertue were so hard in <note place="margin">1. If vertuous life vvere hard, yet vvorthie the labour.</note> deed, as the enemie would make it seeme; yet might I wel say with S. Iohn Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, that seeing the reward is so great &amp; infinit as before we haue declared: no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour should seeme great for gaining of the same. Againe, I might say with holy S. Augustine; <note place="margin">Lib. de co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punct. cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis. Hom. 16. ex 50.</note> That seeing we take daily so great paine in this world, for auoiding of lesser inconueniences, as of sicknes, imprisonementes, losse of goodes &amp; life, and other the like: what paines should we refuse for auoiding the eternitie of hel fire, the torment wherof is insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table? The first of thes considerations S. Paul vsed when he said;  <q>
                     <hi>the sufferinges of this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2. Pet. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>life are not vvoorthie of the glorie vvhich shal be reuealed in the next.</hi> The second, S. Peter vsed, when he wrote; that seeing the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens must be dissolued, and Christ come in Iudgement to restore to euery man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his woorkes: what maner of men ought we to be in al holy conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</q>  As who wold say; No labour, no paines, no trauaile, no penance, ought to seeme hard or great vnto vs, to the ende we might auoide the terrour of that dreadful day. S. Augustin demandeth this question; what we thinke the riche glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <note place="margin">Lue. 16.</note> in hel wold doe now for auoiding his torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, if he were in this life again; wold he take paines or no? wold he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirre
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:14541:310"/>
him self, rather then turne into that place of calamitie againe? I might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioine to this, the infinit paines that Christ tooke for vs; the infinit benefites he hath bestowed vpon vs; the infinit sinnes we haue committed against him; the infinit examples of Saincts, that haue troden this path before vs, being notwithstanding of more delicate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution of bodie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are: in respect of al which, we ought to make no bones at a litle paines and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if it were true that Gods seruice were so troublesome as many doe esteeme it.</p>
               <p>But now in verie truthe the matter is nothing so; and this is but a subtile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceate <note place="margin">2. The vvays of vertue is not hard in deed. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</note> of the enemie for our discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The testimome of Christ him self is cleare in this point, saing: <hi>Iugu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suaue est, &amp; enus meum leue:</hi> My yoke is sweet, and my burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> light. And his dearlie beloued dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple S. Iohn, who had best cause to know his maisters secret herein, sayeth plainlie; <hi>Mandata eius grauia non sunt;</hi> his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.</note> are not greeuous. What is the cause then why so many men doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue such an insuperable difficultie in this affaire? Surelie, one cause is, (besides the fallacie of the deuil which is the <note place="margin">The cause of prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> difficulties.</note> cheefest,) for that men feele the disease of concupiscence in their bodies, but doe not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the strength of the medicine geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs against the same; they crie with S.

the rebellion of concupiscence left in our flesh by original sinne;) but they confesse not, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider not with the same apostle; <hi>that the grace of God, by Iesus Christ, shall deliuer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>them from the same.</hi> They remember not the comfortable saying of our Saueour vnto S.

               <p>So fareth it with the weake and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful people, who feeling and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring onlie the miseries and infirmities of their own nature, wherby day lie strong <note place="margin">The singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, for ouer cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</note> tentations do rise against them; doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the batail painful, and the victorie vnpossible; hauing not tasted in deed, nor euer proued (through their own default and negligence) the manifold helpes of heauenlie and spiritual succours, which almightie God neuer faileth to send vnto such, as are content for his sake to take this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict in hand.

Of which diuine oyle, and heauenlie comfort, when this blessed seruant of God had receaued his part; he confessed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie, that he did not onlie walke the wayes of Gods commandementes with ease; but also did runne them ouer with exceeding pleasure.

aptlie expresseth our state and condition; who without Gods assistance are able to doe nothing; but with the ayde thereof, are able to conquere and ouercome al things.</p>

For thus much signifieth S. Iohn; in that, (hauing saied that the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Christ are not greeuous;) he inferreth presently, as the cause there of; <hi>Quoniam omne quod na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
                     <pb n="584" facs="tcp:14541:316"/>
                     <hi>est ex Deo, vincit mundum.</hi> For that al which is borne of God, ouercommeth &amp; conquereth the world: that is; the grace and heauenlie assistance which is deriued and sent vs from God aboue, doth both conquer the world, with al the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and temptations therof; as also make the commaundements of almightie God, most easie vnto vs, and al vertuous life veric sweet and pleasant.</p>
                  <p>But here perhappes you wil saye vnto <note place="margin">Hovv Christes for nice is a yoke and burden and yet not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie nor tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome.</note> me: Christ him self confesseth it to be a yoke and burden; and how then can it be so pleasant &amp; easie as you make it? wherto I answer; that Christ addeth also, that it is a sweete yoke &amp; a light burden; wherby your obiection is taken away. Againe it is further signified, that there is a burden which greeueth not the bearer, but rather helpeth and refresheth the same; like as the burden of fethers vpon a birdes back, beareth vp the bird, and is nothing at al greeuoꝰ vnto her. So in like maner though it be a yoke, yet is it a sweete yoke, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable yoke, a yoke more pleasant than hony or hony combe, as sayeth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note> And whie so? because we drawe therin, with a sweete yokefelow; we drawe with Christ him self; that is to say, Christes holie grace draweth at the one end of the yoke, and our endeuour at the other. And because when a great oxe and a litle doe drawe together in one yoke, the weight lieth al vpon the greater oxe his neeke, for that he beareth vp the yoke
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:14541:316"/>
from the other: therof it cometh, that we drawing in this yoke together with Christ, which is infinitly stronger and greater then we are; he lighteneth vnto vs the whole burden, and onelie requireth, that we should goe on comfortablie with him, and not refuse to ioyne and perseuer vnder this sweet yoke in his companie; for that the paines shalbe his, and the pleasure and profit ours. And this him self. <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> signifieth verie expreslie in the Ghospel, when he inuiteth al men that are heuelie <note place="margin">The yoke of Christ deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs from many yokes.</note> loden, to come vnto his yoke and he wil refreshe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherby he declareth plainly that his calling vs to the bearing of his sweet yoke, is onlie therby to disburden and ease vs, and not any waye to loden or agreeue vs: to disburden vs (I say) of the heauie loadinges packes and yokes of this world; as from the burden (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) of a guiltie conscience, the burden of melancholie, the burden of enuie, hatred, and malice; the burden of pride, the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ambition, the burden of couetousnes, the burden of wrath, the burden of feare, the burden of al wickednesse, and of hel fire it self. From al these burdens, lodinges, and miserable yokes, our most louing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucour desireth to deliuer vs, by couering our neckes onelie with his yoke and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, so lightned and sweetned by his holy grace; as the bearing therof is not trauail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, but most easie, pleasant, iocunde, and comfortable. And thus much of the first and principal helpe that maketh the path
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:14541:317"/>
of vertuous life easie; I meane of Gods holie grace, inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in mans soule, which is the ofspring and fountaine of al other helpes that doe insue.</p>

What maketh (for examples sake,) the mother to take such incessant paine in the bringing vp of her child, &amp; to indure with comfort so many trauailes as she doth, but onelie loue? what causeth the wife to fit so attentiue at the beds side of her husbande when he is sicke, but onelie loue? what moueth the beastes and birdes of the ayer, to spare from their owne foode, and to endaunger their own liues, for the feeding and defending of their litle ones, but onelie the great force and puissance of loue? <note n="*" place="margin">See S. Aug. of this matter, ser. 9. de verb. dom.</note> S. Austen doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute this pointe at large by many other examples, as of Marchantes that refuse no aduenture of sea, for loue of gaine; of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, that refuse no season of euill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for loue of game; of soldiers, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse no danger of spoyle. And he addeth in the end: that if the loue of man can be
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:14541:317"/>
so great towardes creatures here, as to make great labours easie, and in deede to seeme no labours but rather pleasures: how much more shal the loue of good men towardes God make al their paines and trauailes comfortable, which they take in his seruice.</p>
                  <p>This extreme loue was the cause and reason, whie al the intollerable paines &amp; <note place="margin">The great force of loue betvvene Christ and his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> afflictions which our Saue our Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our sake, did seeme nothing vnto him. And this loue also was the reciprocal cause why so infinit trauailes and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as zelous Christians from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning haue suffered for their Lord and Maister, seemed nothing vnto them. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonmentes, tormentes, losse of honour, goodes, and life; haue seemed verie trifles to innumerable seruantes of God, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this feruent and burning loue. This loue droue infinite virgines, and tender children to offer them selues in time of persecution, for zelous affection toward him, which in the cause was persecuted. This loue caused holie Apollonia of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria, being broght to the fire, to slip <note place="margin">Euseb. li. 6. c. 34.</note> out of the handes of such as ledde her, and ioyfullie to runne into the same, of her self. This loue inforced blessed Ignatius, <note place="margin">Ierom. in catalogo.</note> the auncient Martir to saye (being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to beastes, and fearing least they would refuse his bodie, as they had done the bodies of diuers Martirs before him;) that he would not permit that; but would rather prouoke them to pulle and
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:14541:318"/>
teare his bodie in peeces.</p>
                  <p>Thes are the effectes (deare brother) of feruent loue; which doe make euen the <note place="margin">The loue of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</note> thinges that in this world are most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dreadful of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, to appeare verie facile sweete and pleasant; and much more the lawes and commaundementes of almightie God; which in them selues are most iust, reasonable, holie and easie. <hi>Da amantem</hi> (sayeth S.

                     <q>Geue me a man that is in loue with God: and he feeleth this to be true, which I say: but if I talke to a cold Christian; he vnderstandeth not what I say.</q> And this is the reason whie our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saueour talking of the keeping of his commandementes; repeateth manie times this word, LOVE; as the onelie sure ground wheron their whole regard, reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; obseruation depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth; for want of which loue among men in this life; the most part of the world neither respecteth nor kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth them.

                     <hi>of al the lavv,</hi> for that it comprehendeth al in al.

The <note place="margin">Esa. 66.</note> soule that is drouned in sinful pleasures and delites of this world, can not be partaker of this rare benefite, neither the harte that is replenished with carnal cares and cogitations.

                  <p>But if thou wouldest resolue thie self effectually, &amp; once offer thie self througly to his diuine seruice: then (no doubt) but thou shouldest finde most sweet and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful intertainement aboue al expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

Which is most euidentlie signified, by the parable of the prodigal sonne, whom the good father cherished with much more tendernes and sollicitude, then he did the elder brother, which had serued him continuallie. And the causes hereof are two; the one, for the ioye of the new gotten seruant, as is expressed by S. Luc in the Ghospel; the other, least he finding no consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the beginning, should turne back to Egipt againe; as God by a figure in the children of Israel declareth most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestlie in these wordes: <hi>VVhen Pharao</hi>

                     <q>that it is a most strong solace and comfort vnto vs, when we make our refuge to the hope that is proposed by God that can not lie, which hope we hold as the sure &amp; infallible anker of our soule.</q> This is that <note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 1.

And yet further, <hi>spes impiorum abhominatio animae:</hi> The hope of wicked men is abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <note place="margin">Iob 11.</note> and not a comfort vnto their soule. And the reason hereof is double. First, for that in verie deed (though they <note place="margin">The vaine hope of vvicked men,</note> say the contrarie in wordes) wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe not put their hope and confidence in God, but in the world, in their riches, in their strength, friendes, and authoritie; &amp; finallie in the <hi>deceauing arme of man:</hi> euen as the prophet expresseth in their persone, <note place="margin">Iere. 17.</note> when he sayeth: <hi>VVe haue put a lye for our hope:</hi> That is, we haue put our hope in <note place="margin">Esa. 28.</note> thinges transitorie, which haue deceaued vs. And this is yet more expressed by the scripture, saying: <hi>the hope of vvicked men is as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sap. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>chasse, vvhich the vvinde blovveth avvay: and as a buble of vvater vvhich a storme disperseth: and as the smoke vvhich the vvinde blovveth abrode: and as the remembrance of a guest that stayeth but one day in his inne.</hi> By al which metaphores, the Holie Ghost expresseth vnto vs, both the vanitie of the thinges wherein in deed the wicked doe put their trust; and how the same faileth them, after a litle time, vpon euery smal occasion of aduersitie that falleth out.</p>
                  <p>This is that also which God meaneth, when he so stormeth &amp; thundreth against those which goe into Egypt for helpe, &amp; <note place="margin">Esa. 30. &amp; 36.</note> doe put their confidence in the strength of Pharao, accurfing them for the same, &amp; promising, that it shal turne to their owne confusion: which is properlie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode <note place="margin">Iere. 17. 48.</note> of all those, which put their
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:14541:325"/>
cheef confidence in worldlie helpes; as al wicked men doe, whatsoeuer they say or dissemble to the contrarie. For which cause also of dissimulation, they are called hypocrites by Iob: for where as the wiseman saieth, <hi>the hope of vvicked men shal perish:</hi> Iob saieth, <hi>the hope of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi>

Which thing, not only Scripture, but also experience teacheth. <note place="margin">The vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mans hope is not in God.</note> For with whom doeth the wicked man consult in his affaires and doubtes? with God principallie, or with the world? to whom doeth he seeke in his afflictions? whom doeth he cal vpon in his sickenes? from whom hopeth he to receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his aduersities? to whom yeeldeth he thankes in his prosperities? When a worldly man taketh in hande any worke of importance, doeth he first consult with God, about the euent thereof? doeth he fal downe on his knees, and aske his aide? doeth he referre it wholie or principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnto his honour? if he doe not; how can he hope for aide therein at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des? how can he repaire to hym for assistance in the daungers and lettes that fal out about the same? how can he haue any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in hym, which hath no part at al in that woorke? It is hypocrisie then (as Iob truely saieth) for this man to affirme that his confidence is in God: whereas in deede it is in the world, it is in Pharao, it
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:14541:325"/>
is in Egypt, it is in the arme of man, it is in a lie. He buildeth not his house with the wise man, vpon a rocke: but with the foole, vpon the sandes: and therfore (as Christ wel assureth him) <hi>vvhen the rayne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>shal come and studdes descend, &amp; vvindes blovv, &amp; al together shal rush vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that house</hi> (which shalbe at the hower of his death:) <hi>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal this house sal, &amp; the sal of it shalbe great.</hi> Great, <note place="margin">The sal of a vvicked mans house.</note> for the great chaunge which he shal see: great, for the great horrour which he shal conceaue: great, for the great miserie which he shal suffer: great, for the vnspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable ioyes of heauen lost: great, for the eternal paines of hel incurred: great eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way assure thy self (deare brother) or els the mouth of God would neuer haue vsed this word, Great.

Take a man whom she ouerruleth in any <note place="margin">The miserie of a man ruled by sensualitie.</note> passion: as for example, in the lust of the flesh: what paines taketh he for her? how doeth he labour, how doeth he drudge in this seruitude? how potent and strong doeth he feele her tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie?

If you should see a Christian man in slauerie vnder the great Turke, tyed in a galley by the legg with chaines, there to serue by rowing for euer: you could not but take compassion of his case. And what then shal we doe of the miserie of this man, whoe standeth in captiuitie to a more base creature, than is a Turke, or

Was there euer seruitude so greate as this? doeth not Christ saye <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. Rom. 6. 2.

whole order of the thing; she exulteth &amp; <note place="margin">holy vvom. i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvth.</note> triumpheth, and blesseth thee (ô Lorde,) which art more strong and liberal than <note place="margin">Li 9. c. 9. 10 11. 12. 13.</note> we can aske or vnderstand; for that she sawe now, much more graunted to her from thee, touching me, than she was wont to aske with her pittiful &amp; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sighes.

                     </q> Hitherto are S. Augustines own wordes.</p>
                  <p>Now then (deare Christian brother) in the miraculous example of this famous <note place="margin">Annotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpon this conuersion.</note> mans conuersion, there be diuers things to be noted, bothe for our comfort, and also for our instruction. First is to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> marked; the great conflict he had with his ghostely enemie, before he could get
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:14541:337"/>
out of his possession and dominion; which was so much the more (no dowt) for that he was to be so greate a pillar afterward in Gods Church. And we see that his fellow Alipius found not so great resistance, for that the enemie sawe there was much lesse in him, to hurt his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than in S. Augustine: which ought greatlie to animate and comfort them, that feele great resistance, and strong tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations against their vocation; assuring <note place="margin">The best men, haue greatest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion.</note> them selues, that this is a signe of more grace and fauour, if they manfullie goe through. So was S. Paul called (as we read) most violentlie, being striken down to the grounde, &amp; made blinde by Christ, before his conuersion, for that he was a <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> chosen vessel, to beare Christes name vnto the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly is to be noted in the same example, that although this man had most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> strong passions before his conuersion, &amp; that in the greatest and most incurable diseases, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie afflict worldlie men; as in ambition, couetousnes, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the flesh, (according as him self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth,) which maladies possessed <note place="margin">Li. 6. c. 6. &amp; 15.</note> him so stronglie in deede, as he thought it vnpossible (before his conuersion,) euer to subdue and conquer the same: yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, he proued the contrarie, by the help of Gods omnipotent grace. Thirdlie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> also is to be considered, that he had not onelie the victorie ouer these his passions afterward, but also found great sweetness
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:14541:338"/>
in the way of vertuous life. For a litle after his conuersion, he writeth thus: <q>I <note place="margin">LL 9. c. 6.</note> could not be satisfied (ô Lord) in those dayes, with the maruailous sweetnes which thougauest me. O, how much did I weepe in thy himnes &amp; canticles, being vehementlie stirred vp with the voyces of thy Church, singing most sweetlie! Those voyces did runne into my eares, &amp; thy trueth did melt into my hart, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did boyle out an affection of pietie, and made teares to runne from me, and I was in most happie state with them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthlie is to be remembred for our <note place="margin">4. The dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of S. Aug. in arying and follovving Gods voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> instruction and imitation, the behauiour of this holy man about his vocation. First in searching &amp; trying out the same, by his repaire to S. Ambrose, to Simplicianus, &amp; others; by reading of good bookes, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of good companie, and the like; which thou oughtest also (good reader) to doe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou feelest thy self inwardlie moued; and not to lye dead, as manie are wont, resisting openlie the holie Ghost with al his good motions, &amp; not so much as once to geue eare to the knocking of Christ at the dore of their consciences. <note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> Moreouer, S. Austen (as we see) refused not the meanes to know his vocation, but prayed, wept, and often retired him self alone from companie to talke with God, in that matter. Which many of vs wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe, but rather doe detest and flie al meanes that maye bring vs into those co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of our conuersion. Finallie, S.
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:14541:338"/>
Austen, after he had once seene clearlie the wil and pleasure of God, made no more staye of the matter, but bracke of stronglie from al the world and vanities therof; gaue ouer his rhetorike lecture at Millan; left al hope of promotion in the <note place="margin">Li. 9. c. 2.</note> court, and betooke him self to serue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God through lie; and therfore, no maruaile if he receaued so great consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aduauncement from God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as to be so worthie a member in his holy Church. Which example is to be folowed of al them that desire perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so farforth as ech mans condition &amp; state of life permitteth.</p>
                  <p>And here by this occasion I may not let passe to aduertise thee (good reader) <note place="margin">Violence to be vsed at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our conuersion.</note> &amp; also by S. Austens exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to forewarne thee, that who soeuer meaneth to make this resolution throughlie, must vse some violence to him self at the beginning. For as a fire, if you rushe in vpon it with force, is easilie put-out, but if you deale softlie, putting in one hand after an other, you may rather hurt your self then extinguish the same: so is it with our passions, who require manhode and courage for a time, at the beginning. Which who soeuer shal vse (together with the other meanes set doune in the second booke of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise:) he shal most certainlie finde that thing to be easie, which now he thinketh heauie; and that most sweete, which now he esteemeth so vnsauorie. For proofe wherof, as also for conclusion of this
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:14541:339"/>
chapter, I wil alleage a shorte discourse out of S. Barnard; who after his fashion, proueth the same most fitlie by an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie alleaged out of the holy scriptures. His wordes are thes.</p>
                  <p>Christ sayeth vnto vs; <hi>take my yoke vpon you, and you shal find rest.</hi> This is a maruelous <note place="margin">Bernard. in verba Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelij: Ecce nos relicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus omnia.</note> noueltie, but that it cometh from him <hi>vvhich maketh al things nevv.</hi> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">He that taketh vp a yoke, findeth rest; he that leaueth al, findeth a hundred times so much.

So in old time he saied to Abraham, <note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>take thy sonne Isaac, vvhom thou louest, and offer him to me in sacrifice.</hi> This was a feigned la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in a commandement.

Thou therfore, if thou heare the <note place="margin">Christsyoke a feigned labour.</note> voice of God within thy hart, willing thee to offer vp Isaac (which signifieth ioy or laughter;) feare not to obey it faith fuilie and constantlie. What soeuer thy corrupt affection iudgeth of the matter, be thousecure. Not Isaac, but the Ramme shal die for it; thy ioy shal not perish, but thy stubburnes onelie, whose hornes are entangled with thornes, and can not be in thee, without the prickinges of anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thy Lord doth but tempt the, as he did
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:14541:339"/>
Abraham, to see what thou wilt doe. Isaac (that is, thy ioy in this life) shal not die, as thou imaginest, but shal liue; onelie he must be lifted vp vpon the wood, to the end, thy ioy may be on high, and that thou maiest glorie, not in thine owne flesh, but onelie in the crosse of thy Lord, by whom thy self also art crucified: crucified, (I say) but crucified to the world: for vnto <note place="margin">Gall. 3.</note> God thou liuest stil, and that much more, then thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest before.</hi>

               <head>THE THIRD IMPEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT THAT STAYETH DIVERS MEN FROM RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution in Gods seruice. <hi>VVhich is, the feare they conceaue of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, affliction, losse, danger or tribulation.</hi> CHAPT. III.</head>
               <p>THER want not many persons in the world, who, (either moued by the reasons and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations before recited, or conuicted by their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, for that they behold daily no smal numbers of godly persons to liue as

contentedly as them selues) doe yeld thus much vnto vertuous life, that in very deed they esteeme the same to be easie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant inough, to such as are once entered in therunto. And that in good sooth, for their owne partes, they could be content to embrace and folow the same, if they might doe it with quiet and peace of al handes. But yet to request them vnto it in such time or place, or with such order and circumstances, as tribulation, affliction, or <note place="margin">Nevv sni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> persecution may fal vpon them for the same: they think it a matter vnreasonable to be demaunded, and them selues verie excusable, both before God and man, for refusing it. But this excuse (deare bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) is no better then the other going before of the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded difficultie; for that it standeth vpon a false ground, as also vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an vniust illation or consequent inforced vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ground. The ground is this; that a man may liue vertuouslie, and serue God truelie, with al worldlie ease; &amp; without any affliction, tribulation, or persecution; which is false. For that, albeit external contradictions and persecutions, be more in one time then in an other; more in this place, then in that: yet can there not be any time or place without some, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal. Which although (as I haue shewed before) in respect of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold helpes and consolations sent from God in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terpoise of the same, they seeme not heauie nor vnpleasant vnto the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: yet are they in them selues both great
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:14541:340"/>
and weightie, as would appeare if they fel vpon the wicked and impatient. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, the illation and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce made vpon this ground, is vniust; for that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth tribulation, as a sufficient reason to abandone Gods seruice, which God him self hath ordained for a meane to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect; that is, to draw men therby <note place="margin">Fovver pointes to be handled in this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter.</note> vnto his seruice and from the seruice of the world. For better declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof (the matter being of verie great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) I wil handle in this chapter, thes fower pointes insuing.</p>
               <p>First, whether it be ordinarie for al <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that must be saued, to suffer some kinde of persecution tribulation or affliction; that is, whether this be appointed an ordinary or vsual meane of mans saluation in this life.</p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlie, what are the causes whie God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (louing vs as he doth) wold chuse &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point thes sharpe meanes of our saluation.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, what principal reasons of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort a man may haue in his tribulations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and afflictions.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, what is required at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des in hat state. which fower pointes being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> declared, I doubt not but great light shal appeare in this whole matter, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to flesh and blood to be so ful of darknes and improbabilities.</p>

                     <hi>AND TOVCHING</hi> the first, there needeth litle proofe, for that Christ
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:14541:341"/>
him self hath affirmed to his Disciples, &amp; <note place="margin">1. VVHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther al good men must suffer tribulation or no.</note> by them to al other his seruantes; <hi>In mundo pressuram sustinebitis;</hi> In the world you shal sustaine affliction.

And to signifie yet further the necessitie of this matter, bothe S. Paul and Barnabas also did teach (as S.

                     <note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>tribulations:</hi> vsing the worde <hi>oportet,</hi> which signifieth a certaine necessitie. And Christ him self yet more plainly reuealeth this secret, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayeth to S. Iohn th' Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, <note place="margin">Apo. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>that he chastiseth al those vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loueth.</hi> Which wordes S. Paul as it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding to the hebrewes sayeth, <hi>flagellat</hi>

                     <hi>omnem filium que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> recipit;</hi> he whippeth euery child whom he receaueth. And S. Paul vrgeth this matter so farre in that place, as he affirmeth plainlie al those to be bastardes, and no children of God, who <note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> are not afflicted by him in this life. The same position he holdeth to Timothie: <hi>Si sustinemus &amp; conregnabimus;</hi> if we suffer <note place="margin">2. Ti. 2.</note> with Christ, we shal raigne with Christ, &amp; not otherwise. Wherin also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curreth holie Dauid, when he sayeth, <hi>Multe tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationes</hi>

                     <pb n="635" facs="tcp:14541:341"/>
The same might be proued by many <note place="margin">1. Testimonie of scripture.</note> other meanes, as by that our Sauiour sayeth. <hi>He came not to bring peace, but the svvord into the vvorld.</hi> Also by that S.

                     <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>fight laufullie.</hi> But how can we fight, if we haue no enemie to oppugne vs? The same signifieth Christ in the Apocalips, when <note place="margin">C. 2. &amp; 3.</note> he repeateth so often that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is onelie for him that conquereth. The verie same is signified by the shippe, wherinto Christ <note place="margin">Matt. 8.</note> entered with his disciples, which was tossed and tumbled, as if it wold haue bene drouned; this (I saie) by al the auncient Fathers exposition, was a figure of the troubles and afflictions, that al they should suffer, which doe saile in the same shippe with Christ our sauiour. The same also is proued, in that the life of man is <note place="margin">Iob. 7.</note> called a warfare vpon earthe; and by that, he is appointed to labour and trauaile, <note place="margin">Iob. 5.</note> while he is here; also in that, his life is replenished with many miseries, euen by <note place="margin">Iob. 13.</note> the appointement of almightie God after mans fal. The same also is shewed, in that that God hath appointed euery man to passe through the paines of death, before he come to ioye. In like maner, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite contradictions and tribulations, bothe within and without, left vnto man in this life. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, within, are the rebellions of his concupiscence &amp; other miseries of his minde, wherwith he hath continualie to make warre, if he wil saue his soule. Without, are the world, and the
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:14541:342"/>
deuil, which doe neuer cease to assault him, now by faire meanes, and now by foule; now by flatterie, &amp; now by threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes; now alluring by pleasure and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now terrefying by affliction and persecution; Against al which the good Christian hathe to resist manfullie, or els he leeseth the crowne of his eternal saluation.</p>
                  <p>The verie same thing also may be shewed by the examples of al the most renowned <note place="margin">2. The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of saintes in the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</note> saintes, from the begining; who were not onelie assaulted internallie with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of their owne flesh; but also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted &amp; afflicted outwardlie, by diuerse aduersities, therby to confirme more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestlie this purpose of almightie God vnto vs. This we see in Abel, persecuted and slaine by his owne brother, as sone as <note place="margin">Gene. 4.</note> euer he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to serue God sincerly. The same we see in Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, afflicted diuerslie after he was once chosen by almightie God. Of the same cuppe dranke al his <note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> children and posteritie that succeded him, in Gods fauour; as Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, <note place="margin">Iudit. 8.</note> Moyses, and al the prophetes; of whom Christ him self geueth testimonie, how their blood was shed most cruellie by the <note place="margin">Ma. 5. 23.</note> world. The affliction also of Iob is <note place="margin">Luc. 13.</note> wonderful, seing the scripture affirmeth it to haue come vpon him by Gods special <note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> appointement, he being a most iust man. But yet more wonderful was the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holie Tobias, who among other cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, was stricken blinde by the falling <note place="margin">Iob. 2.</note>
                     <pb n="637" facs="tcp:14541:342"/>
doune of swallowes dung into his eyes; of which the Angel Raphael tolde him afterwarde: <hi>Because thou vvere a man grateful</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Tob. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>to God, therefore it vvas of necessitie that this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation should proue thee.</hi> Beholde the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of afflictions to good men. I might adde to this, the example of Dauid and others; but that S. Paul geueth a general testimonie of al the saintes of the olde testament, saying: <q>That some were racked; <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> some reproched, some whiped, some chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, some imprisoned: other were stoned, cut in peeces, tempted, and slaine with the sword: some went about in heare clothe, in skinnes of goates, in great neede, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and afflicted, wandering and hyding them selues in wildernesses, in hilles, in caues, and holes vnder grounde, the worlde not being woorthie of them. </q>Of al which he prononceth this comfortable sentence, to be noted of al men: <hi>Non susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientes redemptionem, vt meliorem inuenirent resurrectionem:</hi> 
                     <q>That is, God wolde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them from these afflictions in this life, to the end their resurrection and rewarde in the life to come might be more glorious. </q> And this of the saintes of the olde testament.</p>
                  <p>But now in the new testament, founded <note place="margin">3. Sainctes of the nevv testament. <hi>Luc.</hi> 24.</note> expresselie vpon the crosse, the matter standeth much more plaine, and that with great reason. For, if Christ could not goe into his glorie but by suffering, as holy scripture affirmeth: then by the most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable rule of Christ, affirming, <hi>that the</hi>
                     <pb n="638" facs="tcp:14541:343"/>

And in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, <note place="margin">A parable.</note> the wind vsed al violence that he could to blow of the said clok.

sent forth her pleasant beames, &amp; by litle and litle so entered into this man, as he caused him to yeeld &amp; to put of, not onely his cloke, but also his cote.

                  <p>The like is shewed by the example of <note place="margin">2.

Nor euer wanteth there occasion of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the crosse, and suffering affliction, to him that wil accept of the same. And this may susfice for this first point, to proue that euery man must enter into heauen by tribulation as S. Paul saieth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE FIRST</hi> cause then, and the most <note place="margin">1. ENCREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of glory.</note> principal, is, to encrease therby our merit and glorie in the life to come.

                  <p>And that this is Gods fashion towards al good men, king Dauid sheweth in the persone of al, when he sayeth, <hi>Thou hast proued vs (ò Lord) thou hast examined vs by fire; thou hast layed tribulation vpon our backes, and</hi>

                     <hi>hast brought men vpon our heades.</hi> And yet how wel he liked of this matter, he signifieth, when he calleth for more therof in an other place: saying, <hi>Trie me (ò Lord) and tempt me; burne my reines and hart vvithin me.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psa. 25.</note> That is, trie me by the way of tribulation and persecution; search out the secretes of my hart and reines; let the world see whether I wil sticke to the in aduersitie or no.

                     <hi>trieth the potters vessels, so tribulation trieth men.</hi> For as the sounde vessels onelic, do <note place="margin">Eccl. 27.</note> hold when they come to the fornace, and thos which are crased doe breake in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: so in time of tribulation and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the vertuous onely stand to it, and the counterfeit bewraye them selues: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the saying of Christ: <hi>In tempore tentationis recedunt:</hi> They depart from me <note place="margin">Luc. 8.</note> in time of temptation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE SEVENTH</hi> reason, whie God layeth tribulation vpon the vertuous, is, <note place="margin">7. TO MAKE men runne to God.</note> therby to make them runne vnto him for aide &amp; helpe: euen as the mother, to make her child to loue her more, and to runne vnto her, procureth the same to be made afearde and terrified by others.

This chaine had drawen Dauid vnto him when he saied, <hi>O</hi>

But in the <note place="margin">Tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. helpeth not the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> reprobate, this rope draweth not, this yoke holdeth not, nor doth this chaine of loue winne them vnto God; wherof God him self complaineth, saying: <hi>In vaine haue</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>OF THIS NOVV</hi> ensueth an eight reason, why God bringeth his seruantes <note place="margin">8. To MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Gods povver and loue in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering.</note> into affliction: to wit, therby to shew his power and loue in deliuering them. For as in this world a princelie mind desireth nothing more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to shew his habilitie &amp; good wil vnto his deare frend: so God almightie which hath al occasions in his owne handes, and passeth al his creatures together in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of loue and nobilitie of mind; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth purposely diuers occasions and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, wherby to shew and exercise she same. So he brought the three childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="651" facs="tcp:14541:349"/>
into the burning fornace, therby to shew his power and loue in deliuering them. So he brought Daniel, into the lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne; <note place="margin">Dan. 3. 6. 13.</note> Susanna, vnto the point of death; Iob, into extreme miserie; Ioseph, into prison; To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 2. Gen. 31. Tob. 2. 12.</note> vnto blindnes: therby to shew his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and loue in their deliuerance. For this cause also did Christ suffer the shippe to be almost drouned, before he would <note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> awake; &amp; S. Peter to be almost vnder wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <note place="margin">Mar. 14.</note> before he would take him by the hande.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AND OF THIS</hi> one reason, many other reasons and most comfortable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <note place="margin">9. THE IOY of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> doe appeare of Gods dealing herin. As first, that we being deliuered from our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, might take more ioy and delite thereof, then if we had neuer suffered the same. For as water is more grateful to the waiefaring man, after a long drouth; &amp; a <note place="margin">A sunili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> calme more pleasant vnto passingers after a troublesome tempest: so is our deliuerie more sweet after persecution or tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according as the scripture saieth; <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciosa misericordia Dei in tempore tribulationis;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 35.</note> the mercie of God is beautiful and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in time of tribulation. This signified also our Sauiour, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saied, <hi>your sorovv shalbe turned into ioy;</hi> that is, you shal reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.</note> that euer you were sorowful. This had Dauid proued when he saied, <hi>thy redie (o</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord) and thy staffe haue comforted me</hi> that is, I take great comfort that euer I was cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised with them. And againe, <hi>according to the multitude of my sorovves, thy consolations</hi>

                     <pb n="652" facs="tcp:14541:350"/>
                     <hi>haue made ioiful my mind:</hi> That is, for euery sorow that I receaued in time of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I receaue now a consolation after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance. And again in an other place, <hi>I vvil exult and reioice in thy mercie ô Lord.</hi> And wherfore (good king) wilt thou so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice? <note place="margin">Psal. 30.</note> it foloweth immediatly: <hi>For that thou hast respected my abasement, and hast deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the necessitie vvherin shee vvas, and hast not left me in the handes of mine enemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This then, is one most gracious meaning of our louing and merciful father in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting vs for a time; to the end our ioy may be the greater after our deliuerance; as no doubt but it was, in al thos whom I haue named before, deliuered by Gods mercie: I meane, Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ioseph, Daniel, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, Susanna, Iob, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias, Peter and the rest; who tooke much more ioy after their deliuerance, then if they had neuer bene in affliction at al. When Iudith had deliuered Bethulia, and returned thither with Holofernes head; <note place="margin">Iudith. 6. 14. 15.</note> there was more hartie ioy in that citie, then euer there would haue bene, if it had not bene in distresse. When S. Peter was <note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> deliuered out of prison by the Angel; there was more ioy for his deliuerance in the Church, then could haue bene, if he had neuer bene in prison at al.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>OVT</hi> of this great ioy resulteth an other <note place="margin">10. THANKES giuing for our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> effect of our tribulation, much pleasant to God, and comfortable to our selues; and that is, a most hartie and earnest thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuing to our Lord for our deliuerance;
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:14541:350"/>
such as the prophet vsed when he saied, after his deliuerance: <hi>I for my part vvil sing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 58.</note> 
                     <hi>of thy strength, and vvil exalt thy mercie betimes in the morning, for that thou hast bene my aider and refuge, in the daey of my tribulation.</hi> Such hartie thankes and praise did the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Israel yeeld to God for their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when they were passed ouer the read sea, in that notable song of theirs, which beginneth, <hi>Cantemus domino;</hi> and is <note place="margin">Exo. 15. 1. Re. 2. Iudie. 5. Iudi. 12.</note> registred by Moyses in Exodus. From like hartie affect came also thos songes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Debora, and Iudith, moued therunto by the remembrance of their afilictions past. And finally, this is one of the cheefest things that God esteemeth and desireth at our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des; as he testefieth by the prophet, saying, <hi>cal vpon me in the day of tribulation; &amp;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal 49.</note> 
                     <hi>I vvil deliuer thee, and thou shall honour me.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>BESIDES AL</hi> thes effects, God hath yet further reasons of laying persecution <note place="margin">11. EMROLD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Christians,</hi> which is the most honorable title that can be geuen vnto a creature in heauen or earthe.

This is the heauenly meaning of our Soueraine Lord and God, in sending vs persecution, tribulation, and affliction; in respect whereof holy Iob douteth not to say: <hi>Blessed is the man that is afflicted by God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>AND FIRST</hi> of al for proofe and declaration of this third part, the reasons <note place="margin">VVHY tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations should be perceaued ioifullie.</note> and causes before alleaged of almightie Gods merciful and fatherly meaning in sending vs affliction, might be sufficient to comfort and content any Christian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or woman, who taketh delite in Godes holy prouidence towardes them. For if God doe send affliction vnto vs, for the encrease of our glorie in the life to come, for drawing vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, for opening our eyes, and curing our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases; and for preseruing our soules from sinne hereafter, as hath bene shewed in the former part: who can be iustly displeased therwith, but such as are enemies vnto their owne eternal welfare? We see, that for the obtaining of bodilie health, we are content, not onely to admit many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and vnpleasant medicines, but also (if neede require) to yeeld willingly some parte of our blood to be taken from vs. And how much more should we do this, for the eternal health and saluation of our soules? But now further; if this medicine haue so many more commodities besides, as haue bene declared: if it serue here for the punishment of our sinnes, due other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in an other place, in farre greater quantitie and rigour of iustice: if it make <note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</note> a trial of our estate, and doe draw vs to
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:14541:352"/>
God: if it procure Godes loue towardes vs; yeeld matter of ioy by our deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; prouoke vs to thankfulnes; embolden and strengthen vs in his seruice; and finally, if it furnish vs with al vertues, and doe make vs like to Christ him self crucified: then is there singular great cause, why we should take comfort and consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therein: for that to come neare and to be like vnto our maister and Sauiour, is the greatest digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that can be imagined. Lastly, if Gods eternal wisdom haue so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and appointed, that this shalbe the meares of his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the badge and liuerie of his sonne; the high way to heauen vnder the standard of his Crosse: then ought we not to abhorre thes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, not to refuse this liuerie, not to flie this way, but rather with good S. Peter <note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> and Iohn, to esteeme it a great dignitie to be made worthie of the most blessed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation therof. We see that to weare <note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</note> the colours of the prince, is thoght apre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue among courtiers in this world; but to weare the robe or crowne it self, were to great a dignitie for any inferiour subiect to receaue. Yet Christ our Lord and king is content to imparte both the one &amp; th' other of his, vnto vs. And how then ought we (I pray you) to accept therof?</p>
                  <p>And now (as I haue said) these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons might be sufficient to comfort and <note place="margin">Special con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in affliction.</note> make ioyful al those that are so happie as to be called to suffer affliction and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:14541:353"/>
for Christes cause. But yet there want not some more particular conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations besides. Wherof the first and most principal is, that this matter of persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and affliction commeth not by chance or <note place="margin">1. Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and his loue.</note> casualtie, or by any certaine general dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of starres and planetes vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but by the special prouidence and peculiar dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, as our Sauiour Christ sheweth at large in S. Matthews <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> gospel; that is to say, this heauenlie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine or potio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is made for vs by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hand of almighty God. Which Christ signifieth expresly when he saied to his disciples, at it were in anger, <hi>shal I not drinke the cuppe vvhich my Father hath geuen to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>me?</hi> That is, for as much as mine ownfather hath tempered a potion for me, shal I not drinke it? as who would saye, it were too much ingratitude. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlie is to be noted, that the verie same hand of God, which tempered the cuppe for Christ, who was his owne natural sonne, hath done the same also for vs, according to Christs saying; <hi>You shal drink of my cuppe;</hi> to wit, of the same cuppe which my Father hath <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> tempered for me. Herof it foloweth, that, with what hart and loue, almightie God tempered this cuppe vnto his owne most dearlie beloued sonne; with the same he hath tempered it also to vs: that is, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our good &amp; for his glorie. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is to be considered, that this cuppe is te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered with such special care (as Christ sayeth) that, what trouble or danger
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:14541:353"/>
soeuer it may seeme to woorke: (as al pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations for a time doe) yet shal not one heare of our head perish by the same. Nay <note place="margin">Luc. 21. Mat. 10. Psal. 79.</note> further, is to be noted, that which the prophet sayeth, <hi>O Lord thou shalt geue vs to drinke in teares, in measure.</hi> That is, the cuppe of teares and tribulation shal be so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in measure by our heauenlie phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as no man shal haue aboue his strength. The dose of Aloes and other bitter ingredients shalbe qualified with manna and sufficient sweetnes of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie consolation. <hi>God is faithful</hi> (saieth S. Paul) <note place="margin">1. Co. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and vvil not suffer you to be tempted aboue your abilitie.</hi> This is a singular point of comfort, and ought alwaies to be in our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, we must consider, that the appointing and tempering of this cuppe, <note place="margin">2. Al tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured vnto vs by Christ <hi>Mat. 28. Heb. 5.</hi>
                     </note> being now in the handes of Christ our Sauiour, by the ful commission graunted him from his Father, &amp; he hauing learned by his owne sufferinges (as S. Paul no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth) what it is to suffer in flesh and blood; we may be sure that he wil not laie vpon vs more, then we can beare. For, as <note place="margin">A comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</note> if a man had a Father or brother that were a most skilful phisition, and should receaue a purgation from them, tempered with their owne handes; he might be sure it wold neuer hurt him, what ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling soeuer it made in his bellie for the time: so and much more may we be assured of this potion of tribulation ministred vnto vs by the hand of Christ, howsoeuer

(as S. Paul saieth) it seeme vnto vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> in the operation.</p>

Heb. 12.</note> cogitations, this is the greatest and most ful of consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to consider, that he diuideth this cuppe onelie of loue, as him self protesteth, and as S. Paul proueth; that is, he geneth out portions of his crosse (the richest Iewel that he maketh acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of) as worldlie princes doe their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine: vnto none, but vnto his chosen and picked freendes; and among them also, not equally to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, but to euerie one a measure, according to the measure of good wil and special affection wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loueth them. This is euident by the examples before set downe of his dearest frendes most of al afflicted in this life; that is to say, they receaued greatest portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this treasure, for that his good wil was greatest towardes them. This also may be seene manisestly in the exaple of S. Paul, of whom after that Christ had saied to Ananias, <hi>vas electionis est mihi,</hi> he is a chosen vessel vnto me: he geueth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> the reason therof: <hi>For I vvil shevv vnto him, vvhat great thinges he must suffer for my name.</hi> Loe here, for that he was a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen vessel, therfore he must suffer great matters for Christ. Doth not the measure of suffering goe then according to the measure of Gods loue vnto vs? Surely S.

                  <p>Of this now foloweth an other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent <note place="margin">4. TRIBV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of singular consolation in time of affliction; and that is, that tribulation (especiallie when grace is also geuen to beare it patientlie) is a great coniecture of our predestination to eternal life. For, so much doe al those argumentes before touched, insinuate. As also on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part, to liue in continual prosperitie, is a dreadful signe of euerlasting reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This point is maruailouslie proued by S. Paul vnto the hebrewes, and greatlie <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> vrged. And Christ geueth a plaine signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in S. Luke, when he saieth; <hi>Happie</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>are you that vveepe novv, for you shal laugh.</hi> And on th' other side; <hi>VVoe be vnto you that laugh novv, for you shal vveepe: vvoe be vnto you rich men, vvhich haue your consolation here in this life.</hi> And yet more vehementlie then al this, doth the saying of Abraham to the riche man in hel, (or rather Christs wordes parabolicallie attributed vnto Abraham) confirme this matter. For he saieth to the riche man complayning of his torment: <hi>Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber child, that thou recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedst</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>good things in thy life time.</hi> He doth not say (as S. Barnard wel noteth) <hi>rapuisti,</hi> thou tokest them by violence, but <hi>recepisti,</hi> thou receauedst them. And yet, this now is obiected against him for a sufficient cause of his damnation as wee see. Holy Dauid handleth this matter in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but purposelie in two of his psalmes, <note place="margin">Psal. 27. &amp; 143.</note> and that at large. And after long search,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:14541:355"/>
and much admiration, his conclusion of wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prospering aboue other in the world, is this: <hi>Veruntamen propter dolos po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suisti</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 37. Ver. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>eis, deiecisti eos dum alleuarentur.</hi> 
                     <q>Thou hast geuen them prosperitie (ô Lord) to deceaue them withal; and thou hast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed throwen them downe, by exalting them:</q>  That is; thou hast throwen them downe to the sentence of damnation in thy secret and inscrutable determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Here then the comparison of S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie <note place="margin">Com. in Iob.</note> taketh place; that as the oxen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the slaughter, are let runne to feed at their pleasure, and the other <note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of S.

In like maner, the tree that beareth no fruite, is neuer beaten (as we see) but onelie the fruitful; &amp; yet th' other (as Christ saieth) is reserued for the fire. The sick man that <note place="margin">Ma. 3. 7. Ep.

To conclude, the stones that must serue for <note place="margin">3. Re. 6.</note> the glorious temple of Salomon, were hewed, beaten, and polished without the Church, at the quarrie side, for that no stroke of hammer might be heard within the temple. S. Peter saieth, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> are chosen stones, to be placed in the spiritual building of God in heauen, where there is no beating, no sorow, no tribulation. Here then in this life must we <note place="margin">Apo. 21.</note>
                     <pb n="664" facs="tcp:14541:356"/>
be polished, hewed, and made fit for that glorious te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple; here (I say) in the quarrie of this world; here must we be fined, here must we feele the blowe of the hammer, and be most gladde when we heare or feele the same; for that it is a signe of our election, to that most glorious house of Godes eternal mansion.</p>

Wherby is promised the companie of God him self in affliction and persecution. This is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular motiue (saith S. Barnard) to stirre men vp to embrace tribulation, seing that euen in this world for good companie, men aduenture to doe many hard and difficult things. Ioseph was caried captiue into Egypt, and God went downe with <note place="margin">Gen. 37 Sap. 10</note> him (as the scripture saieth:) yea more then that, he went into the dongeon, and was in chaines with him. Sidrach Misach and Abdenago were cast into a burning fornace, and presentlie there was a fourth sene, that did beare them companie; of whom Nabuchodonasor saieth thus:  <q>did <note place="margin">Dan. 3</note> we not put three men onelie bound into the fire? And his seruantes answered, yea verilie Sir. But behold (sayeth he) I see fower men vnbounde walking in the middest of the fire; and the shape of the fourth is like the sonne of God.</q> Christ
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:14541:356"/>
restored, as he passed by, a certaine beggar vnto his sight, which had bene blind from his natiuitie. For which thing, the man being soone after called in question, and speaking somewhat in the praise of <note place="margin">Ioh. 9</note> Christ, for the benefit receaued; he was cast out of the sinagoge by the pharasies. <note place="margin">Note this example.</note> Wherof Christ hearing, sought him out presentlie, and conforting his hart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon him the light of minde, much more of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then that of the bodie geuen vnto him before. By this and like examples it appeareth, that a man is no sooner in affliction and tribulation for iustice sake, but streight waie Christ is at hand to beare him companie: and if his eyes might be opened, as the eyes of Elizeus his disciple was, to see his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, the troupes of Angels (I meane) <note place="margin">4.

haue to suffer: and by <hi>eternal poise of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> he expresseth the incomprenensible greatnes of the reward prepared in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for recompence of that suffering.

This wakening of Christ doth please him wonderfullie, as before hath bene shewed; but especialie if it be done, with that assured confidence of true affectioned children, wherwith S.

                  <p>Finallie, this was the resolution of al the holie Martyrs and Confessors, and <note place="margin">Of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</note> other seruantes of God: wherby they haue withstood the temptations of the deuil, the allurementes of flesh and bloode, and al the persecutions of tirants, exacting things vnlauful at their handes. I wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage one example more out of holy scripture, and that before the comming of Christ, but yet nigh vnto the same; and therfore no manuaile (as the holy fathers doe note) though it tooke some heate of Christian feruour and constancie towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des martyrdome. The example is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, for that in mans sight it was but for a smal matter required at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, by the tirantes commandement; that is, onelie to eate a peece of swines flesh: for thus it is recorded in the scripture.</p>
                  <p>It hapened seuen brethren to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended together in those dayes, and to be broght (with their mother) to the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <note place="margin">2. <hi>Mac.</hi> 7 A maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

out of vs, ô king? we are readie here rather to die, then to breake the auncient lawes of our God. Wherat the king being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie offended, commanded the frying pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes and pottes of brasse to be made burning hote; which being redie, he caused this first mannes tongue to be cut of, together with the toppes of his fingers and toes, as also with the skinne of his head, the mother and other brethern loking on; &amp; after this he caused him to be fried vntil he was dead. Which being done, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond brother was brought to torment, &amp; after his heare pluckt of from his head together with the skinne, they asked him whether he wold yet eate swinnes flesh or no, before he was put to the rest of his tormentes? wherto he answered, noe: &amp; thervpon was (after many tormentes) slaine with the other. Who being dead the third was taken in hand, and being willed to put forth his tongue, he held it forth quicklie together with bothe his handes, to be cut of, saying confidentlie: <note place="margin">A vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
                        <hi>I receaued both tongue and handes from heauen, and novv I despise them bothe for the lavve of God, for that I hope to receaue them al of him againe.</hi>

the former) endeuoured by al meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to draw from his purpose, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and swearing, that he should be a rich and happie man, and one of his checi fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, if he wold yeld. But when the youth was nothing moued ther with, Antiochus called to him the mother, and exhorted her to saue her sonnes life, by persuading him to yeld; which she feigning to doe, therby to haue libertie to speake to her sonne; she made a most vehement exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him in the hebrew tongue, to sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <note place="margin">A noble example of a mother.</note> to it, and to die for his conscience; which speech being ended, the youth cried owt with a loud voice, and vttered this noble sentence worthie to be remembred. <hi>Qucon suslinetis? non obtempero praecepto regis, sed prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto legis:</hi> Whom doe you staye for?

Whereto I wil adde the thirde, which with a noble hart, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes preuaile as much as either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both: and that is, to consider what others haue suffered before vs, especiallie Christ him self, and that onelie of mere Ioue and affection towardes vs. We see that in this world, louing subiectos doe glorie of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then of their daungers or hurtes taken in bataille for their prince, though he neuer tooke blowe for them againe. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would they doe, if their prince had bene afflicted voluntarilie for them, as Christ hath bene for vs? But if this great example of Christ seeme vnto the to high to imitate: looke vpon some of thy brethren before thee, made of flesh and blood as thou art; see what they haue suffered before they could enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; and thinke not thy self hardlie dealt withal, if thou be called to suffer a litle also.</p>

And a litle after, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <note place="margin">2.

                     <q>I am the minister of God in many labours, in imprisonments more then the rest in beatinges aboue measure, and oftentimes in death it self. Fiue times haue I bene beaten of the Iewes, and at euery time had fortie lashes lacking one: three times haue I bene whipt with rod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: once I was stoned: three times haue I suffered ship wrake: A day and a night was I in the bottome of the sea: oftentimes in iourneys, in dangers of fluddes: in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers of theeues: in dangers of Iewes: in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers of Gentiles: in dangers of the citie: in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>By this we may see now, whether Christs holy Apostles taught vs more by <note place="margin">Hovv Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred the Apostles to vvant.</note> wordes, then they shewed by their owne examples, about the necessitie of suffering in this life. Christ might haue prouided for them if he would, at leastwise thinges necessarie to their bodies, and not haue suffered them to come into thes great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of lacking clothes to their bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, meate to their mouthes, and houses to pat their heades in. He that gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to doe so manie other miracles, might haue suffered them also to haue procured sufficient maintenance for their bodies, which should be the first miracle that worldly men would worke, if they had such authoritie. Christ might haue saied to Peter when he sent him to take his tribut from out of the fishes mouth; take so much more, as wil suffice for your <note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> necessary expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, when you trauaile ouer foraine countries. But he woulde not, nor yet diminish the great afflictions which I haue shewed before, though he loued them as dearely, as euer he loued his owne soule. Al which was done, (as S.

<pb n="684" facs="tcp:14541:366"/>
amiddest the greatest of al our tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
                  <p>Saint Paul vseth this, as a principal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> when he writeth thus to the Hebrewes, vpon the recital of the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes <note place="margin">A notable exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S.

Thinke vpon him (I say) which sustained such a contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against him self, at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of sinners: &amp; be not wearie, nether faint yee in courage. For you haue not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted against sinne vnto blood; and you haue for gotten (perhaps) that comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble saying, which speaketh vnto you as vnto children: <hi>My sonne; doe not contemne the discipline of our Lord, and be not vvearie vvhee thou art chastised of him.</hi> For whom God <note place="margin">Prou. 3. Iob. 5. Apoc. 3.</note> loueth he chastiseth, and he whippeth euery sonne whom he receaueth. Perseuer therfore in the correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laied vpon you.

For what child is there whom the father correcteth not? if you be out of correction, wherof al his children are made partakers; then are you bastardes, &amp;
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:14541:366"/>
not children. Al correction, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time when it is suffered, seemeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant and sorowful; but yet after, it bringeth foorth most quiet fruite of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, vnto them that are exercised by it. Wherfore, strengthen vp your wearie handes, and loosed knees; make way to your feete. &amp;c. That is, take courage vnto you, and goe forward valiantly vnder the Crosse laied vpon you.</q> This was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of this holy captaine vnto his countrie man (souldiers of IESVS Christ) the Iewes.</p>

                  <p>I might here alleage many things more
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:14541:367"/>
out of the scripture to this purpose, for <note place="margin">The conclusion.</note> that the scripture is moste copious herein: and in verie deed, if it should al be melted and poured out, it would yeld vs nothing els almost, but touching the crosse, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient bearing of tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life. But I must end, for that this chapter groweth to long, as the other did before. And therfore I wil onelie, for my conclusion, set down the confession and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exhortation of olde Mathathias, in the time of the cruel persecution of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus against the Iewes. The storie is thus reported in the scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>At that time the officers of Antiochus said vnto Mathathias; thou art a prince, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Mac.</hi> 2 The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession &amp; exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Matha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias.</note> &amp; of greatest estate in this citie, adorned with children and brethern; come thou therfore first, and doe the kinges comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, as other men haue done in Iuda and Ierusalem, and thou and thy children shalbe the kings freends, and enriched with gold and siluer, and many giftes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Wherto Mathathias answered with a loude voice: if al nations should obey Antiochus, to depart from the obedience of the lawes of their auncestours; yet I, &amp; my children and brethern wil folow the lawes of our fathers; Let God be merciful vnto vs at his pleasure, &amp;c. And the daies came of Mathathias his death, and then he saied vnto his children. Now is the time that pride is in her strength. Now is the time of chastiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t towardes vs, the time <note place="margin">Note.</note> of euersion &amp; indignation is come. Now
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:14541:367"/>
therfore (ô Children) be you zelous in the lawe of God: yeld vp your liues for the testament of your fathers; remember the workes of your auncestours, what they haue done in their generations, and so shal you receaue great glorie, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal name. Was not Abraham found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">Gen. 12. Gen. 41. Num. 25</note> in time of temptation, and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him for iustice? Ioseph in time of his distresse kept Gods commandemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and was made Lord ouer al Egypt. Phinees our Father, for his zeale towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the lawe of God, receaued the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Iosue. 1. Iud. 14. 2. Re. 2. 4.

Elias for that he was zealous in zeale of the lawe, was taken vp to heauen.

Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel for his simplicitie, was deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouth of lions. And so doe you runne ouer, by cogitation, al generations, and you shal see that al those that hope in God shal not be vanquished. <hi>And doe you not sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the vvordes of a sinful man; for his glorie is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>

               <p>This may be confirmed by that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <note place="margin">Mat. 13. Marc. 4.

For the first sorte of men ther mentioned, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> compared to a high waie, wherin al seed of life that is sowen, ether withereth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie, or els is eaten vp by the birdes of

The second sorte of damnable people are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to rockie groundes, in which, for lacke of depe roote, the seed that falleth continueth not; and by this are signified, light and vnconstant persons, that now choppe in, and now runne owt; now are seruent, and by and by keie-colde againe; &amp; so in time of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation, they are gone; saith Christ. The third sorte are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a feild, wherin the seed of life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> groweth vp, but yet there are so many thornes about the same (which one father expoundeth to be the cares, troubles, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and deceinable vanities of this life) as the good corne is choked vp, <hi>and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth soorth no fruite.</hi> By which last wordes lie signifieth, that whersoeuer the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Christ groweth vp, &amp; yet bringeth not forth due fruite: that is to saie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer his faith is planted receaued and professed, (as among Christians it is,) and yet bringeth not forth vertuous life, holie conuersation, good workes, and due ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God corespo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dent to this seed; ther the principal cause is, for that it is choked with the loue and care of this present world.</p>
               <p>This is a parable of maruailous greate <note place="margin">The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this varable.</note> importance, as may appeare; both for that Christ after the recital therof, cried out

               </p>
               <p>First; how and in what sense al this whole world and commodities therof are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> meere vanities in them selues and of no value, as Christ here signifieth; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie, ought not to be an impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to let vs from so great a matter, as the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen and seruing of God is.</p>

               <p>Thirdlie; how they are <hi>spinae,</hi> that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> pricking thornes, as our Saueour affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; albeit they seeme to worldly men to be most sweet and pleasant thinges.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie; how they are <hi>arumnae,</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is to saie miseries and afflictions.</p>
               <p>Fiftlie; <hi>quomodo suffocant,</hi> how they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> strangle or choke their possessours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the sonne of God in this parable auoucheth.</p>
               <p>Sixthlie; how we may vse them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> without these daungers &amp; euils, and to our great comfort, gaine, and preferment.</p>

that al the pleasures and goodlie shewes of this world are mere vanities, as Christ here signifieth, then to alleage the testimonie &amp; proofe of some, which hath tasted and proued them al; that is to say, of such an one, as speaketh not only by speculation, but also of his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and practise.

                     </note> this thing in word, but doth proue it also by examples of himself. <q>I haue bene king of Israel in Ierusalem (saith he,) and I purposed with my self, to seeke out by wisdom al things. And I haue seene, that al vnder the sunne, are meere vanities and affliction of spirit. I said in my hart, I wil goe and abound in al delites, and in euery pleasure that may be had: and I saw that <note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> this was also vanitie. I toke great workes in hand, builded houses to my self, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vineyardes, made orchardes and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,

&amp; beset them with al kind of trees: I made my fish-pondes to water my trees: I possessed seruantes and hand-maides, &amp; had a great familie, great heardes of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, aboue any that euer were before me in Ierusalem: I gathered together gold &amp; siluer, the riches of kings and prouinces: I appointed to my self musitians and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, both men and women, which are the delites of the children of men: fine cuppes also to drinke wine, and what soeuer my eyes did desire, I denied it not vnto them: nether did I let my harte from vsing any pleasure, to delite it self in these thinges which I had prepared.

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the testimonie of Salomon, <note place="margin">The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of S.

But yet, if any man be not moued with this: let vs bring yet an other witnesse owt of the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; such a one, as was priuie to the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Sauiour Christ herin; and this is, the holie Euangelist &amp; apostle <note place="margin">1.

tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sitorie &amp; al that is to be desired therin; that is to saie, it is vaine, fleeting, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and not permanent; and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to shew the substance of this transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie-vanitie, he reduceth them al to three general heades or branches, saying; <hi>vvhat so euer is in this vvorld, is either concupiscence of</hi>

                  <p>Thes then are the three general and <note place="margin">Three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> most principal vanities of this life, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wordlie men doe wearie owt their braines; to wit, ambition, couetousnes, and carnal pleasures; wherunto al other lesser vanities are addressed, as to their superiours. And thersore it shal not be amisse to consider of thes three in this place together with their dependents; for that eueric one of thes three haue diuers branches depending of them; especially the first, which here I wil handle, called by S.

                  <p>
                     <hi>FIRST</hi> vainglorie, which is a certaine disordinate desire to be wel thought of, <note place="margin">1. VAIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie.</note> wel spoken of, praised and glorified of men: and this is as great a vanitie, (though it be common to many) as if a man should runne vp and doune the streetes, after a
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:14541:372"/>
fether flying in the ayer, tossed hither and thither with the blastes of infinit mennes mouthés. For, as this man might wearie out him self before he gate the thing which he folowed, and yet when he had it, he had gotten but a fether: so a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious man may labour a good while, before he attaine to the praise which he desireth: and when he hath it, it is not worthie three chippes; being but the breath of a few mennes mouthes, that doth alter vpon euery light occ sion, and now maketh him great, now litle, now nothing at al. Christ him self may be an example of this; who was tossed to and from in the speech of men: some said he was a Samaritan and had a deuil; other said he was a prophet; other said he could <note place="margin">Mat. 27. Ioh. 8.</note> not be a prophet, or of God, for that he kept not the Sabboth day: others asked, if he were not of God, how he could doe so many miracles? So that there was a scisme or diuision among them about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Ioh. 9.</note> as S. Iohn affirmeth. Finally, vpon Palme sunday, they receaued him into Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, with triumph of <hi>Hosanna,</hi> casting <note place="margin">Mat. 21. Mar. 11. Mat. 27.</note> their apparel vnder his feet. But the thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seday and friday next ensuing, they cried, <hi>Crucifige</hi> against him; and preferred the life of Barrabas, a wicked murderer before <note place="margin">Luc. 23.</note> his.</p>
                  <p>Now my freend, if they delt thus with <note place="margin">The miseroy of depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on other mens mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes.</note> the Saueour of the world which was a better man, then euer thou wilt be; and did more glorious miracles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer thou
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:14541:373"/>
wilt doe, to purchase name and honour with the people: why doest thou so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and beate thy self about this vanitie of vainglorie? why doest thou cast thy trauailes into the wind of mens mouthes? why doest thou put thy riches in the lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of mutable men, where euery flatterer may robbe the of them? hast thou no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a chest to locke them vp in? S. Paul was of an other mind, when he said: <hi>I esteeme</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>litle to be iudged of you, er of the day of man.</hi> And he had reason surely. For what careth he that runneth at the tilt, if the ignorant people that stand by doe geue sentence against him, so the Iudges geue it with him? If the blind man, in the way to Ieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, had depended of the liking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation <note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> of the goers bie, he had neuer receaued the benefit of his sight: for that, they disuaded him from running and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so vehemently after Christ. It is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable thing for a man to be a windemil, which grindeth not nor maketh meale, but according as the blast endureth. If the gale be strong, he sourgeth about lustely; but if the winde slake, he relenteth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. So, doe you praise the vainglorious man, and ye make him runne; if he feele not the gale blow, he is out of hart. He is like the Babilonians, who with a litle sweete musike, were made to adore any <note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> thing what soeuer.</p>
                  <p>The scripture saith most truely, <hi>as siluer is tried in the fire by blovving to it: so is a man</hi>

or the sorow in leesing it. Where are now al thos emperours, thos kings, thos princes &amp; prelats, which reioised so much once, at their owne aduancement? where are they now, I say? who talketh, or thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of them? are they not forgotten, and cast into their graues long agoe? And doe not men boldely walke ouer their heads now, whos faces might not be looked on, without feare, in their life? what then haue their dignities done them good?</p>
                  <p>It is a wonderful thing to consider the vanitie of this worldly honour. It is like <note place="margin">The vanity of vvorldly honour.</note> a mans owne shadow, which the more a man runneth after, the more it flieth: and when he flieth from it, it foloweth him againe: and the onely way to catche it, is to fal downe to the ground vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. So we see, that thos men which desired honour in this world, are now forgotten; &amp; thos which most fled from it, and cast them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues lowest of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by humilitie; are now most of al honoured: honoured (I say) most, euen by the world itself whos ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they were, while they liued.

                     <hi>THE FOVRTH</hi> vanitie that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to ambition or pride of life, is <note place="margin">4. THE vani tie of vvorldly vvisdome. 1.

It is a strange thing to see, how contrarie the Iudgmentes of God are to the iudgmentes of men. The people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael wold needes haue a king (as before I haue said) and they thought, God would haue geuen them presentlie some great mightie prince to rule ouer them, but he
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:14541:376"/>
chose out a poore man, that folowed <note place="margin">1. Re. 9.</note> asses vp &amp; down the countrie. After that, when God wold displace this man againe for his sinnes; he sent Samuel to anoint one of Isay his sonnes; and being come to <note place="margin">2. Re. 16.</note> the house, I say brought forth his eldest sonne, Eliab, a lustie taule felow, thinking him in deed most fitte to gouerne; but God answered, <hi>Respect not his countenance, nor his taulnes of personage, for I haue reiected him: nor doe I iudge according to the countenance of man.</hi> After that, I say brought in his second son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, Abinadab, and after him, Samma, and so the rest, vntil he had shewed him seuen of his sonnes; Al which being refused by Samuel; they maruailed much and said, there was no more left but onelie a litle read headed boye, that kept the sheep, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Dauid; which Samuel caused to be sent for. And as sone as he came in sight, God said to Samuel, this is the man that I haue chosen.</p>
                  <p>When the Messias was promised vnto the Iewes to be a king, they imagined pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie according to their worldlie wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that he should be some great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: and therfore they refused Christ, that came in pouertie. Iames and Iohn being yet but carnal, seing the Samaritanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouslie <note place="margin">Ioan. 12.</note> to refuse Christes disciples sent to them, and knowing what Christ was; thought streight way, that he must in reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, haue called downe fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to consume them: But Christ rebuked them, saying; <hi>you knovv not of vvhat spirit you</hi>

Cor. 1.</note> fooles for their labours. Festus, the Emperours lieutenant, hearing Paul to speake so much of abandoning the world, <note place="margin">Act. 26.</note> and folowing Christ, said he was madde. Finallie, this is the fashion of al worldlie wise men: to condemne the wisdome of Christ, and of his Saints. For so the holie scripture reporteth, of their own confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, being now in place of torment; <hi>nos insensati vitam illorum aestimabanins insaniam;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sap. 5.</note> we fond men, esteemed the liues of Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as madnes. Wherfore, this is also great vanitie (as I haue said) to make such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt of worldlie wisdome; which is not onelie called folie, but also madnes, by holie scripture itself.</p>
                  <p>Who would not thinke, but that the wise men of this world, were the fittest to be chosen to doe Christ seruice in his Church? Yet S. Paul saieth, <hi>non multi sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>

                     <hi>secundum carnem,</hi> God hath not chosen many wise men according to the flesh. Who wold not think, but that a worldly wise man might easilie also make a wise Christian? yet S. Paul saith no; except first he become a foole, <hi>stultus fiat, vt sit sapiens:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> If any man seeme wise amongest you, let him become a foole, to the end he may be made wise. Vaine then &amp; of no account, is the wisdome of this world, except it be subiect to the wisdome of God.</p>

to pride of life, is corporal beautie; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">5. THE vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Pro. 31. Psa. 118.</note> the wise man saith, <hi>vaine is beautie, and deceauable is the grace of a faire countenance.</hi> Wherof also, king Dauid vnderstode pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, when he said, <hi>Turne avvaye my eies (o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lord,) that they beholde not vanitie.</hi> This is a singular great vanitie, dangerous and deceatful; but yet greatlie esteemed of the <note place="margin">Psal. 4.</note> children of men, whose propertie is, <hi>to loue vanitie,</hi> as the prophet affirmeth and experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teacheth. Beautie is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared by holiemen, to a painted snake, which is faire without, and ful of deadlie poison within. If a man did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what infinite ruines and destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue come by ouer light geuing credit therunto, he wolde beware of it. And if he remembred what foule drosse lieth vnder a faire skinne; he wolde litle be in loue therwith, saith one holy father. God hath imparted certaine sparcles of beautie vnto his creatures, therby to drawe vs to the consideration and loue of his owne beautie, wherof the other is but a shadow; euen as a man fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a litle issue of water, maye seeke out the fountane therby; or happening vpon a smal vaine of gold, may therby come to the whole mine it self. But we like babes, delite our selues onelie with the faire <note place="margin">A lesson to be read in the beautie of al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> couer of the book, and neuer doe consider what is writen therin. In al faire crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that man doth beholde, he ought to reade this lesson, saith one father; that if God could make a peece of earth so faire and louelie, with imparting vnto it some
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:14541:377"/>
litle sparke of his beautie: how infinite faire is he himself, and how worthie of al loue and admiration? And how happie shal we be, when we shal come to enioye his beautiful presence, wherof now al creatures doe take their beautie?</p>
                  <p>If we wolde exercise our selues in these maner of cogitations, we might easilie keepe our hartes pure and vnspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before God, in beholding the beautie of his creatures. But for that we vse not this passage from the creature to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but doe rest onely in the external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a deceatful face, letting goe the bridle to our foule cogitations, and setting wilfully on fire our own concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscences: hence it is, that infinite men doe perish day lie by occasion of this fond va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. I cal it fond, for that euerie childe may discrie the deceate and vanitie therof. For take the fairest face in the world, wherwith infinite folish men fal in loue vpon the sight therof, and rase it ouer but with a litle scrach, and al the matter of <note place="margin">Hovv quickly beautie is destroied.</note> loue is gone; let there come but an Ague for foure daies and al this goodly beautie is distroyed; let the soule depart but one halfe hower from the bodie, and this lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing face is vglie to looke on; let it lie but two daies in the graue, and those who were so hote in loue with it before, wil skarse abyde to beholde it, or come neare it. And if none of those things happen vnto it: yet quicklie cometh on olde age, which riueleth the skinne, draweth in
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:14541:378"/>
the eies, setteth-owt the teeth, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figureth the whole visage, as it becometh more contemptible and horrible now, then euer it was beautiful and alluring before. And what then can be more vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then this? What more madnesse, then ether to take a pride therof, if we haue it our selues, or to indanger our soules for the same, if we behould it in others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE SIXT</hi> vanitie belonging <note place="margin">6. THE vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. Eccl. 11.</note> to pride of life, is the glorie of fine appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; against which the scripture saith, <hi>In vestitu ne gloriaris vnquam;</hi> See thou neuer take glorie in apparel. Of al vanities this is the greatest, which yet we see so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among men of this world. If Adam had neuer sallen we had neuer vsed appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. For that, apparel was deuised to couer our shame of nakednes, and other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites contracted by that fal. Wherfore, we that take pride and glorie in apparel, doe as much as if beggar should glorie &amp; take pride of the olde cloutes that do couer his sores. S. Paul said vnto a bishop, <hi>If vve haue vvhervvithal to couer our selues, let</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Ti. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>vs be content.</hi> And Christ touched deeplie the daunger of nice apparel, when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended so much S. Iohn Baptist for his austere attire, adding for the contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <hi>Qui moliibus vestiuntur in domibus regum sunt;</hi> They which are clothed in soft and <note place="margin">Ma. 3. 11. Luc. 7.</note> delicate apparel, are in kinges courtes; that is, in kinges courtes of this world, but not in the kinges court of heauen. For which cause in the descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the riche
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:14541:378"/>
man damned, this is not omitted by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: <hi>That he vvas apparelled in purple and</hi>

                     <hi>silke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a wounderful thing to consider the different proceeding of God and the <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> world herin. God him self was the first tailer that euermade apparel i this world, and he made it for the most noble of al our auncestous, in paradise: &amp; yet he made it but of beasts skinnes. And S. Paul testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> of the noblest saintes of the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, that they were couered onelie with goates skinnes, and with the heares of Cameles. What vanitie is it then for vs, to be so curious in apparel, and to take such pride therin, as we doe? we robbe &amp; spoile al creatures in the world, to couer our backes, and adorne our bodies. From one, we take his wolle; from an other his <note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and pouertie of man.</note> skinne; from an other his furre: and from some other their verie excrementes; as the silk, which is nothing els, but the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of wormes. Nor yet content with this, we come to fishes, and doe begge of them certaine pearles to hang about vs. We goe doune into the grounde for gold and siluer; and turne vp the sandes of the sea, for pretious stones; and hauing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed al this of other creatnres, we iette vp &amp; doune, prouoking men to looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, as if al this now were our own. When the stone shineth vpon our fingar, we wil seeme (forsooth) therby to shine. When the siluer and silkes doe glister on our backes; we looke bigge, as if al that
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:14541:379"/>
beautic came from vs. And so (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith,) we passe ouer our daies in <note place="margin">Psal. 77.</note> vanitie, and doe not perceaue our owne extreme folie.</p>

                     <hi>of the flesh;</hi> which conteineth al pleasures and carnal recreations of this life, as are banquetting, laughing, playing, and such other delites, wherwith our flesh is much comforted in this world. And albeit in this kind, there is a certaine measure to be allowed vnto the godly, for the conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient maintenance of their health, (as also in riches it is not to be reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded;) yet, that al thes worldly solaces, are not onely vaine, but also daungerous, in that excesse and abundance, as worldly weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie men seeke and vse them, appeareth plainlie by thes wordes of Christ. <hi>VVoe be</hi>

                  <p>The very same doth Iob confirme both <note place="margin">Iob. 21.</note> of the one &amp; th' other sort: for of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges he saith; <q>that they solace them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with al kind of musicke, and doe passe ouer their dayes in pleasure, and in a verie moment doe goe doune into hel. </q>But of the godly he saith in his owne persone; <note place="margin">Iob. 3.</note> that they sigh before they eate their bread. <q>And in an other place,
that they <note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note>
                        <pb n="716" facs="tcp:14541:382"/>feare al their workes, knowing that God spareth not him which offendeth.</q> The reason whereof the wise man yet further <note place="margin">Eccl. 9.</note> expresseth, saying: <hi>That the vvorkes of good men are in the handes of God, and no ma knovveth vvhether he be vvorthie of loue or hatred, at Gods handes: but al is kept vncertaine for the time to come.</hi> And old Tobias insinuateth yet an <note place="margin">Tob. 5.</note> other cause, when he saith: <hi>VVhat ioy can I haue or receaue, seing I sit here in darknes,</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king litterallie of his corporal blindnes, but yet leauing it also to be vnderstood of spiritual and internal darknes.</p>
                  <p>Thes are then the causes (beside exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affliction which God often sendeth) <note place="margin">

                  <p>Hereof Christ gaue vs a most notable aduertiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in that he wept often times; as for example, at his natiuitie, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitation of Lazarus, vpon Ierusalem, &amp; <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.

                  <p>A wise trauailer passing by his Inne, albeit he see pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t meates set before him <note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> to banquet at his pleasure; yet he for bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and restraineth his appetite vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But a foole layeth handes on euerie deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate bayt that is presented to his sight: and playeth the prince for a night or two. But the next morning when it cometh to the reckning, he wisheth that he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued onelie with bread &amp; drinke, rather then to be so troubled as he is, for the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The custome of Gods Church is, to fast the euen of euerie feast, and then to make merie the next daye following, which is the festiual it self. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth the abstinent life of goodmen in this world, therby to be merie in the world to come. But the fashion of the world is contrarie, that is, to eate and drincke merilie first at the tauerne, and after to let the host bring in his reckning.

This doth Salomon (in the places before alleged) signifie, when he doth not onely cal the riches and pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of this world, <hi>vanitie of vanities,</hi> that is, the greatest vanitie of al other vanities; <note place="margin">Eccle. 1. 2. 3. 4.</note> but also <hi>affliction of spirit;</hi> geuing vs therby to vnderstand, that where thes vanities are, and the loue of them once entered; there is no more the peace of God which passeth al vnderstanding; there is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger rest or quiet of mind; but warre of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, <note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> vexation of thoughtes, tribulation of feares, pricking of cares, vnquietnes of soule, which is in deed a most miserable &amp; pitiful affliction of spirit.</p>

                  <p>But yet the prophet Esay, hath a much more terrible description of these mens <note place="margin">Esa. 59.</note> estate: <hi>They put their trust in thinges of nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>and doe talke vanities; They conceaue labour and bring foorth iniquitie; They breake the egges of serpentes, and vveaue the vvebbes of spiders.

And first he saith, <hi>they put their hope in thinges of nothing, and doe talke vanities:</hi> to signifie, that he meaneth of the vanities and vaine men of this world, who commonlie doe talke of the things which they loue best, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they place their greatest affiance. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie he saith, <hi>they conceaue labour, and bring forth iniquitie;</hi> alluding herin to the childbirth of women; who first, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in their wombes, and then after a great deale of trauaile, doe bring forth their infant: euen so worldlie men, after a great time of trauaile and labour in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, doe bring foorth no other fruite, then sinne and iniquitie. For that is the effect of these vanities, as he speaketh in the same chapter, crying out to such kind of men: <hi>VVoe be vnto you, vvhich doe dravv iniquitie in the ropes of vanitie.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="729" facs="tcp:14541:388"/>
But yet to expresse this matter more forciblie, he vseth two other similitudes; <note place="margin">Tvvo sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes.</note> saying, <hi>they breake the egges of serpentes, &amp; doe vveake the vvebbes of spiders:</hi> Signifying by the one, they vanitie of thes worldly cares, and by th other, the daunger therof. The spider we see, taketh great paines and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour many daies together, to weaue vnto her self a webbe; and in the end, when al is done, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a puffe of winde or some other litle chaunce, and breaketh al in peeces: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he in the gospel which had taken great trauaile and care, in heaping <note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> riches together, in plucking down his olde barnes, and building vp of new; and when he was come to saie to his soule, <hi>Novv be merie;</hi> that night his soule was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him, and al his labour lost. Therfore Esaie saith in this place, that <hi>the vvebbes of these vvcauers shal not make them clothe to couer them selues vvith al, for that their vvorkes are vnprofitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Th' other comparison containeth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great daunger and feare. For, as the bird that fitteth vpon the egges of serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, by breaking and hatching them, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth aperilous brood to her owne destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so thos that sit (as it were) on brood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thes vanities of the world, doe hatch at last their own destruction. The reason wherof is, (as Esay saith,) <hi>for that the vvorke of iniquitie is in their handes:</hi> stil harping vpon this string, that a man can not loue and folow thes vanities, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle him self with their ropes (as his
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:14541:389"/>
former phrase is) but that he must in deede draw on much iniquitie therwith; that is, he must mingle much sinne and offence of God with the same. Which effect of sinne, because it killeth the soule that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>senteth vnto it, therfore Esay compareth it vnto the brood of serpentes, that killeth the bird which bringeth them forth into the world. And finallie, Moyses vseth the like similitudes, when he saith of vaine and wicked men. <hi>Their vineyard is the vineyard of</hi>

There are not so many daies, nor hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in our liues, as there are miseries and contrarieties in the same. And further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, the euil hath this prerogatiue aboue the good, in our life; that one defect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ouerwhelmeth and drowneth a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of pleasures together. As if a man had al the felicities heaped together, which this world could yeld, and yet had but one toothe out of tune: al th' other pleasures would not make him merie. Herof you haue a cleare example in Ama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cheefe counsailer of king Assuerus: who, <note place="margin">Hest. 5.</note> for that Mardochaeus the Iew did not rise to him when he went by, nor did honour him, as other men did: he said to his wife &amp; free<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, that al his other felicities were nothing, in respect of this one affliction.</p>
                  <p>Adde now to this, the miserie of darknes and blindnes, wherin wordlie men liue, <note place="margin">4. The misery of blindnes.</note> (as in parte I haue touched before;) most fitlie prefigured by the palpable darknes of Egypte, wherin no man could see his <note place="margin">Exo. 10.</note> neighbour, no man could see his worke, no man could see his way: such is the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:14541:391"/>
wherin woridlie men walke. They haue eyes, but they see not, saith Christ: <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> that is, though they haue eyes to see the matters of this world, yet they are blinde, for that they see not the thigs they should see in deed. The children of this world are wiser in their generation, then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">Luc. 16.</note> of light. But that is onelie, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this world, in matters of darknes, not in matters of light, wherof they are no children, for that the carnal man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth not the things which are of God. Walke ouer the world, and you shal <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> finde men as sharp eyed as Egles in things of earth, but the same men as blind as beetles in matters of heauen. Her of ensue thos lamentable effects that we see daily, of mans lawes so carefully respected, and Gods commaundemétes so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptuously reiected: of earthly goods sought for, and heauenly goods not thought vpon: of so much trauaile taken for the body, and so litle care vsed for the soule. Finally, if you wil see in what great blindnes the world doth liue; remember, that S. Paul comming from a worldling to be a good Christian, <note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> had skales take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his eyes by Ananias, which couered his sight before, when he was in his pride and ruffe of the world.</p>
                  <p>Besides al thes miseries, there is yet an <note place="margin">5. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and dangers.</note> other miserie, greater in some respect, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former: and that is, the infinit number of temptations, of snares, of intisementes in the world, wherby men are drawen to perdition daily. Athanasius writeth of S.

Anthonie the heremite, that God reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Athan. in vita An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonii.</note> vnto him one day the state of the world; and he sawe it al hanged ful of nettes in euery corner, and deuilles fitting by to watch the same. The prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, to signifie the verie same thing, that is, the infinit multitude of snares in this world, saieth, <hi>God shal raine snares vpon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

                     <hi>men;</hi> that is, God shal permit wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fal into snares, which are as plentiful in the world, as are the droppes of raine which fal doune from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Euery thing almost, is a deadly snare vnto a carnal and loose harted ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>Of this then, and of the blindnes decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, doth folow the last and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <note place="margin">6.

And yet, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily men of the world doe commit sinne, and how litle scruple they make of the matter, Iob signifieth, when talking of such a man, he saieth, <hi>bibit quasi aquam iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p> Here now may euery man iudge of the spirit of the world, and of the spirit of Christ; and (applying it to him self) may coniecture, whether he holdeth of the one or of th' other. S. Paul geeueth two pretie short rules in the very same place <note place="margin">Tvvo ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of S. Paul to knovvour spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> to trye the same. The first is, <hi>They vvhich are of Christ, haue crucifie ltheir flesh, vvith the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; concupisconces therof.</hi> That is, they haue so mortified their owne bodies, as they commit none of the vices and sinnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated before, nor yeld not willinglie vnto the concupiscences or temptations therof. The second rule is, <hi>if vve liue in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, then let vs vvalke in spirit:</hi> That is, our walking &amp; behauiour is a signe whether we be aliue or dead. For if our walking be spiritual, (such as I haue declared before by the twelue fruites therof:) then doe we liue and haue life in spirite: but if our workes be carnal, (such as S. Paul now hath described:) then are we carnal and dead in spirite, nor haue we any thing to doe with Christ, or portion in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And for that al the world
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:14541:393"/>
is ful of those carnal workes, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth no fruites in deede of Christs spirit, nor permitteth them to grow or <note place="margin">Christ and the vvorld enemies.</note> prosper within her: thence is it, that the scripture alwaies putteth Christ and the world for opposite and open enemies.</p>

                     </note> to our purpose. There was (saieth he) a certaine citie, or common wealth, which vsed to chuse to them selues a king from among the poorest sorte of people, and to aduaunce him to great honour, wealth, and pleasures for a time. But after a while, when they were wearie of him, there fashion was to rise against him, and to dispoile him of al his felicitie, yea of the verie clothes of his backe, and so to banish him naked into an Iland of a farre countrie; where, bringing nothing with him, he should liue in great miserie, and be put to exceeding slauerie for euer. Which practise one king at a certaine time consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, by good aduise (for al th' other, though they knew that fashion, yet
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:14541:397"/>
through negligence &amp; pleasures of their present felicitie, cared not for it;) tooke resolute order with him self, how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this miserie: which was by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. He saued euery day great sommes of money from his superfluities and idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; and so, secretly made ouer before hand a great treasure vnto that iland, wherunto he was in daunger daily to be sent. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time came, that in deed they deposed him from his kingdom, and turned him away naked, as they had done th' other before: he went to the ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with ioy and confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, where his treasure lay; and was receiued there, with exceeding great triumph; and placed presently in greater glorie, then euer he was before.</p>
                  <p>This parable teacheth as much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may be said in this point. For this citie <note place="margin">Th' appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> or common wealth, is this present world, which aduaunceth to authoritie, poore men: that is, such as come naked into this life; and vpon the soudaine when they looke least for it, doth pul them doune againe, and turneth them of naked into their graues, and so into an other world; where bringing no treasure of good workes with them, they are like to finde litle fauour, but rather eternal miserie. The wise king that preuented this cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, is he, which in time of wealth in this life (according to the counsail of our Saueour Christ) doth seeke to lay vp trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <note place="margin">Luc. 12.</note> in heauen by almes deedes and other good works, against the day of his death,
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:14541:397"/>
when he must be banished hence naked, as al the prices of that citie were.

               <p>Many things haue bene said before, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It hath bene showed, how Christ our Sauiour when he sent forth his Apostles and disciples, as the first spiritual fathers and masters of the world; instructed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> especially in thes two doctrines, as most behooful and necessarie to the end which he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth.
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:14541:398"/>
And for that his diuine wisdome did easily foresee, that deedes haue much more force to persuade then wordes: he did set forth this doctrine most exactly in the example of his own life, making the same a paterne of al worldly contempt and suffering for iustice; as also did his said Apostles and disciples after him, to the true and perfit imitation of their maister.</p>
               <p>Thus much then hath bene treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and many particulers haue bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <note place="margin">The firme resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of th' apostles.</note> as wel of the holie Apostles extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me suffering in al kindes and maners of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as also of their vtter dispising whatsoeuer was pretious or pleasant in this world, for the perfect seruing of their Lord and maister. No allurements of this world could intise them, no dignities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light them, no flatterie deceiue them, no pleasure peruert them, no labours weary them, no difficultie stay them, no terrour or tyrannie of mortal man could feare them from their course begonne, as long as their soules remained within their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.

O blessed bee those tongues of yours, that haue bene such instruments of the holie Ghost, and blessed be your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers inbrued with blood, for the loue of Christes Church. You haue trulie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed your maister in al things, &amp;c. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce therfore thou Peter, to whom it was giuen to die vpon the crosse, therby to imitate thy Sauiour: and triumphe thou Paul, whose head was cut of with the sword for the same cause. O this sword shal be to me in steade of a crowne, and the nailes wherwith S.

to him that wil reade the <note n="*" place="margin">Vide hist. Secrat. li. 6.</note> Ecclesiastical historie, which declareth how he both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and died in continual tribulation.</p>
               <p>O deare christian brother, if we had so tender harts in contemplation of thes affaires, as had this holie man of God, we would be of other iudgment in many things then we are. We see that S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome was thus moued, with the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration onelie of thes two Apostles tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uails. But how much might be said of al the rest in like maner? Of S. Iames that <note place="margin">Of S. Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</note> was called the brother of IESVS, and was left by him as the first bishope of Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, it is writen by Egesippus that liued <note place="margin">Egesip. lib. 5. hist. apud Euseb. li. 2. cap. 22.</note> immediatly after his time, that he being in singuler auctoritie &amp; credit for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and wisdome, not only among al Christians, but also among the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iewes (for which he was called by the name of Iames the Iust as Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus the Iew reporteth;) yet chose he a most austere and sharpe life, neuer testing either wine or flesh, or anointig his body with oile, according to the fashion of the countrie. He was so diligent and painful in continual praying vpon his knees, that the skinne therof was as hard as the brayne of a camels knee. And being broght forth one daie and placed vpon a pinnacle of the temple of Hierusalem, in the presence of in inic people, (for it was on the highe feast of Easter) and ther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by al the nobles and Magistrates of Iurie to speake some word in deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:14541:400"/>
of Christian religion, with promisse of infinite honour for the same, if he would yeld the runto: he made choise not only to lacke that honour, but also to be reuiled by the people, to be throwen downe from the pinnacle wher he stood, and to haue his head cleft in sunder with a staffe or instrument that diars of cloth doe vse, rather then to relent one iote in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that thing which he knew to be true.</p>
               <p>This was the smal accompte that thos men made of worldly dignities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, when they broght with them any let or hinderance to Gods perfect seruice. And this was the redy desire they haue to suffer, in euery least occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for their. Masters honour. O gentle reader, how worthely said our Samour Iesvs of thes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; <hi>you are they vvho baue stood vvith me in my temptations, and therfore I prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>

<pb n="753" facs="tcp:14541:400"/>
afflictions &amp; persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnto his Church vpon earth, (except only certaine short times or breathing,) wherin he ment to make euident proofe of his seruantes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and of his owne power against his enimies. And wheras a litle before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he forwarned his disciples of thes things to come, assuring them that they <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> should haue pressures, and that he sent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth as lambes among wolues; he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed the same in such sorte not long after, as it may seeme that he brake open al the gates and barres of hel at once, (as els wher I haue noted) and turned forth al the legions of suries therin conteined, as most rauenous beares and lions vpon thes his lambes. For in ten general &amp; most deadful persecutions, which in this time, by publique authoritie &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were excercised; it is impossible for man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte, either the tyrannie and iniquitie of the lawes, or the barbarous crueltie of the executors, or the infinite multitude of the sufferers, or the strange inuentions of the tormentours. And albeit in thes times of trial (as alwaies it falleth out,) ther wanted not diuers Christians (as Eusebius <note place="margin">Euseb. li. 8. hist. cap. 2.</note> wel noteth that writeth the storie) who for loue of their own ease made shipwrak of their saluation: yet without number were thos also that by contempt of the world, did beare out the storme, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered faithful.

               <p>Besides this the good man got time also and opportunitie in his iourney, to write diuers epistles to sandry churches, which Eusebius in his storie setteth downe. And among other things either he being informed, or fearing of him self, that the Christians in Rome hearing of his comming, would make means to the Emperour to get pardon for his life, and so depriue him of martyrdome: he write a

But if they should refuse to set vpon me, I wil intise them on my self. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me (my children) for I know what is good for me. Now I begine to be Christs true disciple, desiring nothing that is sene in this world with mans eyes, but only IESVS Christ my Sauiour.

Iohn Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist; whose domestical disciple he was many yeares, and by him made bishope of the Church of Smyrna: and for that his fight and martyrdome for Christian religion, ensued not longe after the death of Ignatius; it shal not be amisse to speake of him also in this place. The storie is set downe at large by Eusebius, <note place="margin">Euseb. l. 4. c. 13. &amp; 14.</note> and others out of an Epistle writen by the Christians of the Church of Smyrna, which were al present at the whole tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie of his death; the summe wherof is this: that wheras at a certaine day by the commandement of the Emperour Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, incredible and innumerable torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were vsed against Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in the citie of Smyrna: diuers did beare the same out with inuincible courage, to the singuler comfort of their brethren, and to the great admiration of their enemies; albeit

one Quintus that was newly come out of <note place="margin">Dangerous for any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to offer him self to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutours.</note> Phrygia, and had rashlie offered him self to the tortours before he was sought for; fel shamefully the same day, &amp; denied his profession.</p>
               <p>Polycarpus then while thes thinges were in doing remained secretly in a hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se therby, with other christians; whether euery thing was brought to him by the brethren as soone as they were done: and at length newes came, that Polycarpus himself was sought for. Wherat he nothing moued, answered with a quiet mind and countenance, that he was ready; meaning in deede to expect the officers ther vntil they came for him. But the christians that were present with him, inforced him whether he would or no, to retire him self vnto a litle village not far of, where he made his abode for certaine daies, whiles he was sought for in the citie. During which time, he did nothing els (saith the storie) but pray day and night, and that especially for the peace and vnitie of the Church, for that heresies now pubblicly <note place="margin">Policarpus greatest care for the Churches vnitie.</note> begon to swarme. He had a vision also, (which he tould vnto thos that were ther present with him) signifying that he must goe to Christ by fier. At length the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuants that had sought him al about the citie, came by Gods permission, vnto the village where he was, and therupon he sted by night vnto another, whether they followed him also. And ther finding two children in the street, enforced the one
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:14541:404"/>
of them by beating, to discouer the house wherin he laie.</p>
               <p>Comming therfore into the house, and vnderstanding that he was in a chamber <note place="margin">Policarpe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> aboue, sent for him to come downe; and albeit the messenger fauouring Polycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, shewed him a way how to escape by an other house, yet he refused the same, saing; we haue fled inough, let Gods wil be done. And so comming downe with a mery countenance, bid them hartely wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and commanded the meate left in the house to be set before them, beseeching them only to giue him one houres space wherin to pray vnto his Lord, before he departed: Which they willingly granted, being much moued with his gray haires and fatherly countenance, as allo cast into admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the feruour of his praiers that he made ther by him self, whiles they were eating. Which being ended, they tooke him forthe, placing him vpon an Asse, and so led him towardes the citie of Smyrna, very early in the morning vpon the great saboth day, hauing aduertised the Magistrates before of their comming, who for that cause were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with al the people in the market place.</p>
               <p>And to make the matter more solemne, they sent forth one Herode, that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uost <note place="margin">Policarpus his cariage to Smirna.</note> of the peace, to mete him and fetch him in. He therfore comming forth with great pompe in his coche, met with Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus, &amp; first saluted him with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:14541:405"/>
and reuerence, causing him to come downe from the asse, and to sit with him in his coche, &amp; there began to flatter him, saing; You are a graue and wise man, haue <note place="margin">The maner of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> respect vnto your self. what great matter (man) is it to say, <hi>Lord Caesar;</hi> or to make a sacrifice. But Polycarpus held his peace; and when the other went forward to vse many wordes to that purpose, Polycarpus answered: Syr, in fine I am not to folow your counsel. At which wordes he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great disdaine; thrust him headlong out of his coche, and that with such viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as he wounded pitifullie his leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in going forth.

Which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased; the Proconsul asked him, whether he were Polycarpus; to which he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea. Then said the Proconsul, haue regarde vnto thy oldage, (Father) repent &amp; desire that wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be destroied.

destroy or take awaie the wicked. Then said the Proconsul; sweare also by Caesars fortune, and defie Christ.

               <p>After this there passed diuers other speaches betwene them, the one threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tormentes, beastes, fier and sword; and th' other shewing al desire and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to susteine the same. The people cried out continually that he might be <note place="margin">Vnruly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haueour of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> torne with wild beastes. But that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, for that the beastes were wearied out vpon other martyrs before.

He praied vehemently in the fier, and gaue immortal thankes vuto almightie God that had made him worthy of that daies combate; during which time, the fier diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it self in two partes, and would not touch him; in so much, that the magistrate was constreined to send one to ronne his body through with a sword, wherwith he died.

liued long, and ended his life by a most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous martyrdome. He taught alwaies thos things, which he had learned of the apostles, &amp; which the Church deliuereth, and which are only true. Which may be proued, by the consent of al the churches of Asia, and by the bishopes which haue succeded after him.

               <p>This be spoken by the way, concerning thes notable mens zeale in detestation of schisme and heresie, and of new expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of holy scripture against the tradition of antiquitie: which no man can thinke to be from our purpose, if he consider the times wherin we liue, and how litle this tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is now regarded by many, in respect of their own new deuises and fresh inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But now it foloweth in the forsaid storie of Eusebius, that S. Irenaeus in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of smal time, came also to make his combat for the confession of his maister, in the citie of Lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in France; wher, after infinit torments and afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he ended his life the xxviij. day of <note place="margin">The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome of Irenaeus.</note> Iune vnder th' Emperour Seuerus. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, he was sent into Asia to the Christians there, from the Christians in France that liued in persecution, and in the way he had letters also to the bishop of Rome Eleutherius, in his own comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Which letters doe wel declare, what a reuerend opinion the martyrs of God had of him. And th' other letters that
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:14541:409"/>
he carried into Asia, doe set foorth the maruailous trial that our Sauiour vsed at that time vpon his seruantes. wherof for our instruction, as also for our comfort in aduersities that fal vnto vs, I haue thought good to recite some part also in this place.</p>
               <p>The letters beginne thus. <q>The seruantes of IESVS Christ, that dwel at Lions and <note place="margin">The letters of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s suffering persecution in France. <hi>Apud Evse. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> Vienna in France, send peace in our Lord IESVS, vnto their brethern in Asia and Phrigia, who haue the same faith and hope of redemption &amp;c. The greatnes of our afflictions which grow vpon vs, in this place, and the multitude of torments that we suffer, neither can we, nor any man els by writing expresse. </q>And then they shew first, how they were forbid by publique edict to enter into any common house, boothe, or market place, or to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brod out of their own dores. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne houses they were fetcht out by officers, led to the market place, and in the way reuiled and spit on by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, beaten with stones and other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which ech ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had in his hand; their apparel pulled from their backes, and this before iudgement was geuen against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, while yet they expected the comming of the President to determine their cause. Who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came, demaunding no other question of them, but only whether they were christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or no; commaunded al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of torments to be exercised vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And for that a noble yong gentilman na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:14541:410"/>
Vetius, began to speake a word or two in their behalf; he was also condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the rest, as aduocate of the christians. Thirdly they shew, that al their frindes, acquaintance, and kindred among the Gentils at that time, forsooke them. Their owne seruants for feare of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, came in and accused them most falsly of eating of <note n="*" place="margin">This vvas a commi ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in thos dayes, in respect of the B.

               <p>And yet al this notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that Christ their Sauiour forsooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not in thos extremities, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue al measure, by the noble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bates of diuers others, wherof they recite very strang examples; namely of one Sanctus a deacon, who for al the <note place="margin">VVonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers martyrs.</note> torments the enemies could vse vpon him from morning vnto night, could not be inforced to answere the President to no one question that he demanded, but onely by those two latin wordes (<hi>Christianus sum</hi>) I am a Christian. Thes two wordes (saith the storie) serued for answere to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he was asked, either touching him self or others. The like they write of one Blandina a noble woman, which wearied out al her tormentours, and therfore in a rage towardes the end of the day, they tied her to a great beame, and hanged her vp in the aire. Which beame for that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the forme of a Crosse as shee hanged vpon it: did comfort both her and
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:14541:410"/>
al other Christians infinitly. They decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re besides, that their holy old bishope na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Pothenus (in whose place Irenaeus <note place="margin">Pothenus.</note> succeded after) being four score and ten yeares old, and not able so much as to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on his feete, was caried to the place by the hands of souldiours, and there ended his life with incredible fortitude. And of the foresaid Blandina, they write, that <note place="margin">Blandina.</note> being put downe from the beame againe, she was beaten with whippes, rent with yron hookes, set vpon a burning frying pan, and after that, wrapt in a net and cast amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g wilde bulles. In al which torments she kept a mery countenance, thanking God most hartelie for this benefit, and for that shee had sene her owne children die constantly in the same place for the same cause before her.</p>
               <p>They report also of one Attalus a man of great name &amp; authoritie in that cittie, <note place="margin">The corage of Attalus the martyr.</note> who being drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth of his house, was first lead about the place of spectacle with a table borne before him, wherin was writen in great latine letters, <hi>This is Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus the Christian:</hi> and afterward he was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the people in al kinde of most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme villanous maner; but yet because of his calling, the president durst procede no further against him, vntil he had write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Rome to the Emperour, and receaued answer, which soone after was had, (he in the meane space being kept in prison wher he did singuler much good,) &amp; then vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the solemne day of the publike faires
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:14541:411"/>
that were in Lions, he was brought forth againe, and first put to fight with diuers wild beastes, by which he was greatly torne and tormented, but not slaine. And then after al this, he was placed naked in a chaire of burning yron, and ther exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie.</note> of his faith. And when the smoke and lothsome stinch of his flesh that broiled, offended them that stoode about him; he said vnto the people; ò brethren, this is in deed to denoure mans flesh, wherof fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly you accuse vs. And finallie, the storie addeth, that after thes tormentours had ended their furie i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the slaughter of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as it was a very horrour vnto them selues to behold their bodies and bones; yet were they not so satisfied. But first caused the said bodies to be watched in that place for the space of six daies together (vntil they were putrified) to the end that Christians should not steale them away: and then also doubting least some of their reliques might be reserued, if <note place="margin">Spite of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note> they should so abandone them; they burnt al to ashes, &amp; caste the same into the great riuer of Rhodanus that ronneth through the citie.</p>
               <p>Thes were the combates (ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle reader) wherby almightie God in thos daies would proue and trie his trustie seruantes. Heare now an other breefe description set doune by Dionisius bishope of Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

After that, they came in furie vnto al our houses, &amp; drew vs forth, that is, euery man his neighbour according as either hatred moued him or couetousnes to haue his goodes. For what so euer was pretious in our houses, they tooke with them, and the rest they flung out into the streets. This indured for diuers monethes, and many noble Martyrs died in this time; as Appollonia, Serapion, and others; albeit some that were not worthie of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, made shipwrake of their saluation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At length was published the most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible edict of Decius against vs, and then might you see that dreadful sentence of our Sauiour fulfilled, <hi>that the very elect if it vvere possible, should be driuen to fal.</hi>

               <p>Thus wrot this blessed man of God; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioining many things of his own exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and sufferings, which for breuitie sake I omit; onely I may not let passe, that <note place="margin">The Zele of Dionys. against Schisme &amp; Heresie.</note> rare zeale which he shewed amiddest al thes his afflictions, against Schismatiques and Heretiques; as may appeare by thos wordes of his, which he writeth in an epistle to Nouatus, when he by new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions began to trouble the Church of <note place="margin">Euseb. li. 6. cap. 37.</note> Rome.

               <p>After this not many daies, he liuing in certain orchardes or gardins in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; was aduertised by his frendes, that two Pursiuantes were sent to take him, &amp; bring him to the citie of Vtica; whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fled.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce was reade, that he must be behedded. Wherunto S.

               <p>And the reuerend opinion of this mans sanctitie was so great among Christians euen presently vpon his death, that they builded Churches in his honour and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, as may appeare by the storie of S.

               <p>I might here recompt many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, and the singuler combats of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit particuler men, which could neuer (I dare say) weary the Christian reader. But yet would they be to long for this place. <note place="margin">The last general persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnder Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian and others.</note> Eusebius affirmeth, that to set doune one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fight susteined in his time, vnder Diocletian, Maximianus, Maximinus, and other tyrants, (which was the last gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affliction, before the general peace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored by Constantine:) were a matter of infinit volume. For (saith he) the persaecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">See Euseb. toto lib. 8. &amp; 9.</note> began in the moneth of Marche, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christians were ready to celebrate the feast of Christs holy passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. At what time Diocletians first edict was, that al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiane Churches through out the world, should presently be ouerthrowne, al Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors therof taken, and by al maner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that mans wit could deuise, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to sacrifice together with their people. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (saith Eusebius) was it a time, when ech man might easily see who loued the world, or loued God; who was a good <note place="margin">A time of trial.</note> Christian, and who was a counterfete; who was true corne, &amp; who was chaffe. Many lost their soules (saith he) in this combat, &amp; many got them eternal crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The edict was executed with al ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and fury throughout al Prouinces at once: and diuers were the issues of such as came into trial. But the infinit glorie of such as conquered, surpassed far the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:14541:416"/>
of such as fel.</p>
               <p>And the ennemy in the end, being vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly confounded, would gladly haue see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue brought that to passe, which <note place="margin">The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Gods eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for to seeme to haue vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> he neither did, nor could. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce he had drawen Christians vnto the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Idols, he would haue had it seeme, that they came voluntarily; &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men would not sacrifice, he was desirous at least-wise, that they should permit him to say &amp; publish, that they had sacrificed; others being beaten doune with clubbes vpon their knees, were reported to haue kneeled of their owne wils for adoring the Godes; wherof some cried ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that they neither had nor euer would doe so, for any torment that could be laid vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the more reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute sorte, they were dealt with in al most cruel and barbarous maner without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, reason, or order. Wherof you may reade both many and strange examples in the eight and ninth bookes of Eusebius, who wrote the things as he saw them passe; and when our Sauiour permitted al <note place="margin">A comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</note> thes extremities to fal vpon his Church, then was the time neerest that he had determined to beautifie her in earth, with greatest peace, rest, riches and glorie: euen as he did immediatly after, by conuerting Constantine to be so zelous a Christian.</p>

He made a mate and companion for him; he blessed them both; and finallie, shewed al possible tokens of loue, that might be. But what ensewed? Adam committed but one sinne; and that, at the entisement of an other; and that also a sinne of smal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (as it may seeme to mans reason,) being but the eating of an aple forbidden: and yet the matter was no sooner done, but al frendship was broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwene God and him; he was thrust out of paradise, condemned to perpetual miserie, and al his prosperitie to eternal damnation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him self, if he had not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

<pb n="804" facs="tcp:14541:426"/>
onelie sinne committed by certaine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men in the citie of Gabaa, vpon the wife of a Leuit; God punished the whole tribe, in this order, as holy scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth. He caused al the other eleuen <note place="margin">Iudi. 19. 20.</note> tribes to rise against them; &amp; first, to come to the house of God in Silo, to aske his aduise, and to folow his direction in this warre against their brethren. And thence hauing by Godes appointement ioined battaile twise with the tribe of Beniamin, the third daie God gaue them so great a victorie, as they slew al the liuing creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, within the compasse of that tribe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept onelie six hundred men that escaped awaie into the desert: the rest were slaine both man, woman, children, and infantes, together with al the beastes, and cattel; &amp; al the cities, villages, and howses burnt with fire. And al this, for one sinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted onelie at one time, with one woman.</p>
               <p>And who then (deare Christian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) wil not confesse with Moyses, <hi>that</hi>

not forgiue Esau, though he demaunded it with teares, as S. Paul saieth: if he would <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> not remit the punishment of one fault to Moyses &amp; Aaron, albeit they asked it with great instance: if he would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue one proude cogitation, vnto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: nor the eating of one apple vnto Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without infinite punishment; nor would passe ouer the cuppe of affliction from his own deare sonne, though he required the same thrise, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his verie knees, with the sweate of blood and water in his presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: what reason hast thou (my brother) <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> to thike, that he wil let passe so many sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thine vnpunished? what cause hast thou to induce thy imagination, that he wil deale extraordinarilie with thee, &amp; breake the course of his iustice for thy sake? Art thou better then thos whom I haue named? or hast thou any priuilege from his Maiestie aboue them?</p>
               <p>If thou wouldest consider the great and strange effectes of his iustice, which we <note place="margin">Great and straunge effectes of gods iustice.</note> see dailie executed in the world: thou shouldest haue litle cause to persuade thy self so fauorablie, or rather to flatter thy self so daungerously, as thou doest. We see that, notwithstanding Godes mercie, yea after the death and passion of Christ our Sauiour, for sauing of the whole world: yet so many infinite millions be damned daily, by the iustice of almightie God; so many insideles, heathens, Iewes and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that remaine in the darknes of their owne ignorance; and among Christi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ans,
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:14541:427"/>
so many heretiques and misbeleuers; and among Catholiques, so many euel liuers, as Christ truely said, that few were they <note place="margin">Ma. 7. 20.</note> which should be saued; albeit his death was paid for al, if by their own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes they made them selues not vnworthie therof. And before the comming of our Sauiour much more we see, that al the world went awrie to damnatió, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand yeres together, excepting a few Iewes, which were the people of God. And yet among them also, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part perhappes were not saued, as may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectured by the speeches of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes from time to time: and specially by the sayings of Christ to the harisees and other rulers therof. Now then, if God for the satisfying of his justice, could let so many millions perish, through their own sinnes, as he doth also now daily permit, without any preiudice or impechement to his infinit mercie; why may not he also damne thee forthy sinnes, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his mercie, seing thou doest not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commit them without feare, but also doest confidently persist in the same?</p>

We haue to see therfore, how, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al this, the mercie of God doth exceede his other workes.</p>
                  <p>And first, his mercie may be said to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, for that, al our saluation is of his mercie, and our damnation from our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues <note place="margin">The first vvay hovv Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is aboue his iustice. <hi>Ose.</hi> 13.</note> only, as from the first and principal causes therof, according to the saying of God, by the prophet, <hi>Perditio tua Israel, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tummodò in me auxilium tuum.</hi> 
                     <q>Thy perdition is onely from thy self (ô Israel) and thy assistance to doe good, is onely from me.</q> So that, as we must acknowledge Gods grace and mercie for th' author of euerie good thought and acte that we doe, and consequently, ascribe al our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him: so none of our euil actes (for which we are damned) doe proceede from him, but onely from our selues, and so he is no cause at al of our damnation; and in this doth his mercie exceede his iustice.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, his mercie doth exceede, in <note place="margin">The 2. vvay.</note> that he desireth al men to be saued, as S.

terrible; yet was his mercie greater to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as appeareth by Christs wordes, if they had not reiected the same.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, his mercie exceedeth his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, <note place="margin">The 3. vvay.</note> euen towardes the damned them selues; in that he vsed many meanes to saue them in this life, by geuing them freewil and assisting the same with his grace to doe good: by mouing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inwardlie with infinite good inspirations: by alluring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outwardlie with exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, promisses, examples of others; as also by sicknes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities, and other gentle corrections. By geuing them space to repent, with occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, opportunities, and excitations vnto the same. By threatning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eternal death, if they repented not. Al which thinges being effectes of mercie, and goodnes towardes them; they must needes confesse amiddest their greatest furie and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that his iudgementes are true, &amp; iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them selues, and no waies to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>By this then we see that to be true, which the prophet saieth, <hi>Misericordiam &amp;</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles vvas seruile.</note> gentiles,) was onely in seruile feare: for that they honoured and adored their Idoles, not for any loue they bore vnto them, being so infinit as they were, and such not able leudnes reported of them (I meane of Iupiter, Mars, Venus, and the like;) but onely for feare of hurt from them, if they did not serue adore and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them.</p>
                  <p>S. Peter also in one sentence expoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> al this matter. For hauing said, <hi>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem corum ne timueritis,</hi> feare not their feare (meaning of the seruile feare of wicked men:) he addeth presentlie, <hi>Dominum autem Christum sanctificate in cordibus vestris, &amp;c. cum modestia, &amp; timore, conscientiam habentes bona;</hi> 
                     <q>That is, doe you sanctifie our Lord IESVS Christ in your hartes; hauing a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, with modestie and feare.</q> So that the spirit of seruile feare, which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely vpon respect of punishment, is forbidden vs: but the louing feare of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is commaunded. And yet also about
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:14541:431"/>
this, are there two things to be noted.</p>
                  <p>The first, that albeit the spirite of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile. <note place="margin">1. Seruile fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> feare be forbiden vs, (especiallie whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are now entered into the seruice of God;) yet is it most profitable for sinners, and for such as yet doe but beginne to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue God; for that it moueth them to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp; to looke about them: for which cause it is called by the wiseman, <hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of vvisdome.</hi> And therfore, both Ionas <note place="margin">Pro. 1. IOH. 13. Mat. 3.</note> to the Niniuites, and S. Iohn Baptist to the Iewes, and al the prophets to sinners haue vsed to stirre vp this feare, by threatning the daungers and punishmentes which were imminent to them, if they repented not. But yet afterward, when men are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to God, and doe goe forward in his seruice; they change euery day this seruile feare into loue, vntil they arriue at last, vnto that state wher of S. Iohn saith, <hi>that perfecti loue or charitie expelleth feare.</hi> Wherupon S. Austen saieth, that feare is <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. Tract. 9. in cp. 1. Ioh.</note> the seruant, sent before to prepare place in our hartes; for his mistres, which is charitie. Who being once entered in, and perfectly placed: feare goeth out againe, &amp; geueth place vnto the same. But where this feare neuer entereth at al, there is it impossible for charitie euer to come and dwel, saieth this holy father. <note place="margin">2. Seruile fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re may vvel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing to be noted, is, that albeit this feare of punishment, be not in verie perfect men; or at leastwise, is lesse in them, then in others, as S. Iohn in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce before alleaged teacheth: yet being
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:14541:432"/>
ioined with loue &amp; reuerence, (as it ought to be,) it is most profitable and necessary for al common Christians, whose life is not so perfect, nor charitie so great, as that they haue that perfection, wherof S. Iohn speaketh. This appeareth by that, that our Sauiour Christ persuaded also this feare, euen vnto his Apostles, saying; <hi>Feare you him, vvhich after he hath slaine the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, hath povver also to send both bodie and soule</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 12. Mat. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>vnto hel fire: this I saye vnto you, feare him.</hi> The same doth S. Paul to the Corinthians, whoe were good Christians, laying downe first the iustice of God, &amp; therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> persuading the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tò feare. <hi>Al vve</hi> (saith he) <hi>must be prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted before the tribunal seat of Christ,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>to receiue, ech man his proper desertes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath done, good or euil in this life. And for that vve knovve this; vve doe persuade: he feare of our Lord vnto men.</hi> Nay (that which is more) S. Paul testifieth, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing al his fauours receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God; he retained yet him self this feare of Gods iustice, as appeareth by those wordes of his; <hi>I doe chastise my bodie, and doe bring it into</hi>

                  <p>Now then (my frend) if S. Paul stoode <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> in awe of the iustice of God, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="819" facs="tcp:14541:433"/>
that they meane, by his grace, to amend al in time. And this time is driuen of from day to day, vntil almightie God (in whos handes onely the momentes of time are) doe shut them out of al time, and doe send them to paines eternal without time, for that they abused the singular benefite of time in this world.</p>
               <p>This is one of the greatest &amp; most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deceites, and yet the most ordinary and vniuersal, that the enemie of mankind doth vse towardes the children of Adam.

He wel knoweth the <note place="margin">The causes vvhy the deuil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadeth vs to delay.</note> force of this snare aboue al others, and therfore vrgeth it so much vnto euerie man. He considereth, better then we doe, the importance of delay, in a matter so weightie, as is our conuersion and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is not ignorant how one sinne draweth on an other; how he that is not fit to day, wil be lesse fit to morow; how custome groweth into nature; how old diseases are hardly cured; how God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his grace; how his iustice is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to punish euery sinne; and how by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay we exasperate the same, and heape vengeance on our owne heades, as S.

He is priuie to the vncertaintie and perils of our life; to the dangerous chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we passe through; to the impedimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that wil come daily more and more, to let our conuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Al this he knoweth
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:14541:434"/>
and wel considereth, and for that cause persuadeth so many to delay as he doeth. For being not able any longer to blind the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of many Christians, but that they must needes see clearlie, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie and vtilitie of this resolution; and that al impedimentes in the world, are but trifles, &amp; mere deceites, which diuert them from the same: he runneth to this onely refuge, that is, to persuade men, that they deferre a litle, and that in time to come they shal haue better occasion and opportunitie to doe it, then presentely they haue.</p>
               <p>This, S. Augustine proued in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, as him self writeth. For that after <note place="margin">Li. 8. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. ca. 7. 12.</note> he was persuaded, that no saluation could be vnto him, but by change and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life: yet the enemie held him, for a time in delaie, saying vnto him; <hi>staye yet a litle; yet deserre for a time.</hi> Therby (as he saith) to binde him more fast in the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of sinne; vntil by the omnipotent power of Gods grace and his owne most earnest endeuour, he brake violentlie from him, crying to God; <hi>vvhie shal I longer saye to morovv, to morovv? vvhy shal I not doe it euen at this instant?</hi> And so he did, euen in his verie youth, liuing afterward, a most holie and seuere Christian life.</p>
               <p>But if we wil discouer yet further, the <note place="margin">The causes vvhiche make our conuersion harder by delay.</note> greatnes and peril of this deceit: let vs consider the causes that may let our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and conuersion at this present; and we shal see them al increased, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:14541:434"/>
by delaie; and consequentlie, the matter made more hard and difficult, for the time to come, then now it is. For first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> (as I haue said) the continuance of sinne bringeth custome; which once hauing gotten prescription vpon vs, is so hard to remoue, as by experience we proue daily in al habites that haue taken roote within vs. Who can remoue, (for examples sake) without great difficultie, a longe custome of dronkennes, of swearing, or of any other euil habite, once setled vpon vs? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, the longer we persist in our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> life, the more God plucketh his grace and assistance from vs; which is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie meanes that maketh the waie of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue easie vnto men, and their conuersion possible. Thirdlie, the power and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the deuil is more established, &amp; confirmed in vs by continuance; and so, the more hardely to be remoued. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the libertie of our free wil is more &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> more weakened, and daunted by frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of sinne, though not extinguished. Fiftlie, the faculties of our mind, are more corrupted; as, the vnderstanding is more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> darkened, the wil more peruerted, the appetite more disordered. Sixtlie and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, our inferiour partes and passions are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> more stirred vp and strengthened against the rule of reason, and harder to be repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by continuance of time, then they were before.</p>
               <p>Wel then, (deare Christian brother) put al this together, and consider indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie <note place="margin">Note.</note>

And he concludeth the mysterie to haue bene, for that Lazarus was now dead fower daies, and also buried: which signifieth, the fower degrees of a sinner; the first, in voluntarie delectation of sinne; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in consent; the third, in fulfilling it by worke; the fowerth, in continuance or custome therof; wherin whosoeuer is once buried (saieth this holy father) he is hardlie raised to life againe, without a great miracle of God, and many teares of his owne part.</p>

So, the vices wherein we delited during our youth, are so dispersed by custome in our bodies and bones; that when old age doth come on, we canne not ridde them at our pleasure, without great difficultie and paine. What folie then is it, to deferre our amendment vnto our old age, when we shal haue more impedimentes and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties by a great deale, then we haue now?</p>

                  <hi>him self, vvhich in his life time did forget God?</hi> O, how many examples are there sene herof dailie? how many worldlie men, that haue liued in sensualitie; how many great sinners, that haue passed their life in wickednes; doe end and die, as if they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into some place insensible, where no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, no reckening should be demanded? They take such care in their testamentes for flesh and blood, &amp; the commodities of this world, as if they should liue stil, or should haue their part of thes vanities when they are gone. In trueth, to speake as the matter is, they die as is there were no immortalitie of the soule; and that, in verie deede, is their inward persuasion.</p>
               <p>But suppose now, that al this were not so, and that a man might as easilie, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouslie, <note place="margin">The losse of merite.</note> yea and as surely also, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert him self in old age as in youth, and that the matter were also acceptable enough to God: yet tel me, what great time is their lost in this delaie? what great treasure of merit is there omitted, which might haue bene gotten, by labour in Gods seruice?

therof: for otherwise, woe be vnto thee, for that thou hoardest (as S. Paul saieth) wrath, and vengeance on thine owne <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> head.

                  <p>Notwith standing (as I haue said) this general law barreth not the mercie of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie <note place="margin">That the conuersion made at the last day is insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</note> God, from vsing a priuilege to some particular man euen at the verie last cast. But yet miserable is that soule, which placeth the ancker of his eternal wealth or woe, vpon so tyclesome a point as this is.

And albeit they doe not absolutely condemne it, in al; but doe leaue it as vncertaine vnto Gods secret iudgement: yet doe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the negatiue part; and doe alleage fower reasons, for which that conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is to be doubted, as insufficient for a mans saluation.</p>
                  <p>The first reason is, for that the extreme <note place="margin">The first reason.</note> feare &amp; paines of death, being (as the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
<pb n="836" facs="tcp:14541:443"/>
saith) the most terrible, of al terrible thinges, doe not permit a man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie so to gather his spirites &amp; senses at that time, as is required, for the treating of so weightie a matter with almightie God, as is our conuersion and saluation. And if we see often times, that a vetie good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not fixe his minde earnestlie vpon heauenlie cogitations, at such time as he is troubled with the passions of cholicue, or other sharpe diseases: how much lesse in the anguishes of death can a worldlie man doe the same, being vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that exercise, and lodened with the guilt of many and great sinnes, and cloyed with the loue, both of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and things belonging therunto?</p>
                  <p>The second reason is; for that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, which a man maketh at the last <note place="margin">The second reason.</note> day, is not (for the most part) voluntarie, but vpon necessitie, and for feare: such as was the repentance of Semei; who hauing greeuously offended king Dauid, in time of his affliction; afterward, when he saw <note place="margin">2. Re. 16.</note> him in prosperitie againe, and him self in daunger of punishment; he came, and fel doune before him, and asked him forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenes with teares. But yet, Dauid wel <note place="margin">2.

Reg. 2.</note> according to his deserts.</p>
                  <p>The third reason is; for that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:14541:443"/>
of sinne, which hath continued al <note place="margin">The third reason.</note> the life long, can not easely be remoued vpon the instant, being growen now (as it were) into nature it self. For which cause, God saieth to euil men, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ieremie; <hi>If an Ethiopian can change his</hi>

                  <p>The fowerth cause is; for that the actes of vertue them selues, can not be of so <note place="margin">The fourth reason.</note> great value with God, in that instant, as if they had bene done in time of health be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For, what great matter is it (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sake) to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy enemies at that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, when thou canst hurt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more? to geue thy goodes awaie, when thou canst vse them no more? to abandon thy concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine when thou canst keepe her no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger? to leaue of sinne, when sinne must leaue thee? Al thes thinges are good and holie, and to be done by him, which is in that last state: but yet, they are of no such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as other wise they wold be, by reason of this circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time, which I haue shewed.</p>
                  <p>Thes are the reasons whie the holie Fathers and doctors of Christ his Churh, <note place="margin">S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of the doubtful euent of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> doe speake so dowtfullie of this last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion: not, for any want on Gods part, but on theirs who are to doe that great acte. I might here alleage great store of authorities for this purpose: But one place of S. Austen shal serue for al. Thus then he writeth of this matter in a certaine homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="838" facs="tcp:14541:444"/>
of his. <q>If a man haue done penance <note place="margin">Hom. 47. est lio. 50.</note> truelie, and do die, (being absolued from the bondes wherwith he was tied &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodie of Christ,) he goeth to reste. But if a man in the extreme neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of his sickenesse, doe desire to receiue <note place="margin">Al tins discourse of S Augustin Bun. stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out.</note> penance, and doe receiue it, and doe passe hence reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled: I confesse vnto you, that we doo not denie him that, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth: but yet we presume not, that he goeth hence in good case. I doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume (I tel you plainely,) I doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume. A faithful man that hath liued wel, goeth awaie securelie. He that dieth the same houre he was baptised, goeth hence securelie. He that is reconciled in his health, and doeth penance, and afterward lineth wel: goeth hence securelie. But he that is reconciled, and doeth penance at the last end: I am not secure, that he goeth hence securely. Where I am secure, I doe tel you, &amp; doe geue securitie. And where I am not secure, I may geue penance, but I can geue no securitie. But here perhappes some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil say to me; good priest, if you know not in what state a man goeth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, nor can geue securitie that he is saved to whom penance was assigned at his death: teach vs (I beseech you) how we must liue after our conuersion and pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? I say vnto you; abstaine from dronkennes, from coucupiscence of the flesh, from theft, from much babling, from immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate laughter, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> idle wordes, for which men are to geue account in the day of
<pb n="839" facs="tcp:14541:444"/>
iudgement. Loe how smal thinges I haue named in your sight. But yet, al thes are <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> great matters, and pestilent to thos which commit them. Nay yet, I tel you further: a man must not onely abstaine from thes vices, and the like, after penance: but also before, when he is in health. For if he driue it of to the last ende of his life: he can not tel, whether he shalbe able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue penance, and to confesse his sinnes to God, and to the priest, or no. Behold the cause why I said vnto you, that a man should liue wel before penance, and after penance better.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Marke wel what I saie: and perhappes it shal be needful to expounde my meani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <note place="margin">Note this.</note> more plainlie, least any man mistake me. What say I then? that this man which repenteth at the end shal be damned? I doe <note place="margin">Here Bun. putteth in a peece of S. Aug. agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth his name.</note> not say so. What then? Doe I saie he shalbe saued? no. What then doe I saie? I say, I know not: I say, I presume not; I promise not; I know not. Wilt thou deliuer thy self forth of this doubt? wilt thou escape this dangerous and vncertaine point? doe penance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiles thou art whole. For if thou doe pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce while thou art in health, and the last day chaunce to come vpon thee: runne presentlie to be reconciled; and so doing, thou art safe. And whie art thou safe: for that thou diddest penance in that time, wherin thou mightest haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But if thou wilt doe penance then, <note place="margin">A notable saying.</note> when thou canst sinne no longer; thou leauest not sinne, but sinne leaueth thee.
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:14541:445"/>
But you wil saie to me; how knowest thou whether God wil forgeue a mans sinnes at the last houre, or no? You say wel; I know it not. For, if I knewe that penance wold not profit a man at the last houre, I would not geue it him. Againe, if I knewe that it wold deliuer him: I wold not warne you, I would not terrifie you, as I doe. Two thinges there are in this matter: ether God pardoneth a man, doing pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, at the houre of death; or he doeth not pardon him. Which of thes two shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be, I know not. Wherfore, if thou be wise, take that which is certaine, &amp; let goe the vncertaine.</q> Hitherto are S. Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wordes of the dowtful case of thos, which doe penance at the last daie.</p>
                  <p>And here now wold I haue the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Christian to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider with me, but this one comparison that I wil make. If they <note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</note> that repent, and doe such penance as they may at the last daie, doe passe hence not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, in such dangerous doutful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as S. Augustine sheweth: what shal we thinke of al such who lacke either time or abilitie, or wil, or place, or meanes, or grace to doe any penance at al, at that houre? what shal we say of al thos, who are cut of before? which die suddenlie? which are stricken dumme, or deafe, or senseles, or frantike, as we see many are? what shal we say of thos, which are aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by God, and left vnto vice, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the last breath in their bodie? I haue shewed before out of S. Paul, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, <note place="margin">2. Co. 11.</note>
                     <pb n="841" facs="tcp:14541:445"/>
sinners die, according as they liue. So that, it is a priuilege for a wicked man, to doe penance at his death. And then, if his penance (when it is done) be so dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as S. Austen hath declared: what a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful case are al other in? I meane the more part, which repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not at al, but die as they liued, and are forsaken of almightie God in that extremitie, according as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, when he saieth; <q>For that I haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Pro. 1. Iere. 35.</note> you, and you haue refused to come; for that I haue held out my hande, and none of you would vouchsafe to looke towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des me: I wil laugh also at your destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when anguish and calamitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth on you. You shal cal vpon me, and I wil not heare; you shal rise betimes in the morning to see me, but you shal not finde me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is both dreadful and lamentable which the prophet saith, of such as defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <note place="margin">A dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful saying. <hi>Psal. 58.</hi>
                     </note> their conuersion, from time to time: <hi>Conuertentur ad vesperam; &amp; famem patientur vt canes, &amp; circuibuat ciuitatem;</hi> 
                     <q>They wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert them selues to God at the euening, &amp; then shal they suffer hungar, as dogges; and shal runne about the citie.</q>The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that goe immediatly before, and doe immediatly ensue after, doe expresse more plainly the greatnes of this threate. For before, the verse is: <hi>Attend (o Lord) to visit al nations; take no mercie vpon al thos that vvorke iniquitie.</hi> That is, which worke iniquitie vnto the end without change, for otherwise the wish were hard. And
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:14541:446"/>
immediatly after enseweth; <hi>Thes men shal speake vvith their mouth, and a svvord shal be in their lippes; for vvho hath heard them? and thou (ô Lord) shalt skoffe at them.</hi> That is to say, thes men in their last extremety shal cry for help; and their crie shal be as sharp to pearse me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eares, as a sword is; &amp; yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And thou (ô Lord) which onely canst help them, shalt be so farre of from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or pitying their case, as thou shalt also laugh at their miserie and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. By al which is signified, the great calamitie of such as deferre their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vnto the last day, expressed by three circumstances, in the former sentence alleaged.</p>
                  <p>For first he saith, <hi>they vvil turne at the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> that is, at the houre of death. For as <note place="margin">Turning to God at the euening.</note> the euening is the end of the day, and the beginning of night: euen so is this time, the end of light, and the beginning of al darkenes vnto the wicked. In which sense Christ said; <hi>I must vvorke the vvorkes of him</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>that sent me, vvhiles the day lasteth; for night vvil come on, vvhen no man can vvorke more.</hi> At this time then; that is, at this euening, in this twy light, betwene day and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, when the pleasant brightnes, and heate of al sunne beames is past: the brightnes (I meane) of honour, of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie, and of worldlie pompe is consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: when the heat of concupiscence, of carnal loue, of delicate pleasures is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; when the beautiful sommer day of
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:14541:446"/>
this life is ended, and the boisterous win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter night of death draweth on: (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saieth the prophet) wil the wicked man begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of force to turne vnto God; then wil he (forsooth) repent; then wil he resolue him self, and make his conuersion.</p>
                  <p>But what? shal this be accepted? You haue heard the prophets request to God, <note place="margin">Final tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to God not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
                     <hi>Non miserearis;</hi> doe not take mercie on them. Not, for that the prophet wisheth God to be vnmerciful; but for that he wel knew Gods immutable iustice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes such kinde of men. Whos miserie, in this extremitie, he expresseth further, by saying, <hi>they shal suffer hungar as dogges;</hi> which is, as if he should haue saied: euen as dogges, when they are hungrie, are raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, &amp; doe seeke by al meanes for meate, be it neuer so homelie: and wil refuse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is offered, but wil deuoure al thos things most gredilie, which they contemned whiles their bellies were ful: so thes men that would not heare of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, while they were in health, wil now admit any thing, and make strange of nothing. Now (I say) when they can liue no longer, wil they promise any pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: what praiers you wil; what fasting you please; what almes deedes you can desire; what austeritie soeuer you can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. They wil promise it, (I say) vpon conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might now haue life agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; vpon condition that the day might be prolonged vnto them; albeit, if almightie God should graunt them their request, in
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:14541:447"/>
this also, (as many times he doeth,) they would performe no one point therof; but would be as careles, as euer they were before: yet for the present, you shal see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as hungrie as dogges, saieth the prophet, most redie to deuour any thing, that may be deuised, for their saluation.</p>
                  <p>And not contented with this, the same prophet addeth yet a further clause of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie. <note place="margin">A marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of miserie for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that deserre their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the euil.</note> And that is, <hi>that they shal circuite or runne about the cilic;</hi> euen as dogges doe, when they are hungrie, putting in their heades at eucry dore for releef, though it be with great danger to be beaten out againe. This expresseth an vnspeakable distresse and calamitie of wicked men, at the last day; when they shal circuite, and runne about the whole citie of God, both in heauen, and earth, to seeke help, and shal finde none. When they shal crie, with sighes and grones, as pearsing as a sword, and yet shal not be heard. For, whether wil they turne them selues in this distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se? vnto their worldly wealth, power, or riches? alas, they are gone; and the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saieth, <hi>riches shal not profit in the day of reuenge.</hi> Wil they turne vnto their carnal <note place="margin">Pro. 11.</note> frends? But what comfort can they geue, besides onely weeping, and comfortles mourning? Wil they aske helpe of the Saints in heauen to pray for them in this instant? It is good, surely, so to doe: but yet, they can not chuse but remember what is writen, <hi>The sainies shal reioise in glorie; exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psa. 145.</note> 
                     <hi>shalbe in their throtes; and tvvo edged</hi>
                     <pb n="845" facs="tcp:14541:447"/>
                     <hi>svvordes in their handes, to take reuenge vpon nations, and increpations vpon people; to binde kings in fetters, and noble men in manacles of iron; to execute vpon them the prescript iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; and this is the glorie of al bis saintes.</hi> Their onely refuge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must be vnto God, who in deed is the onely sure refuge of al; but yet in this case, the prophet saieth here, that he shal not heare them: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contemne, and laugh at their misery. Not, that he is contrarie to his promise of <note place="margin">Pro. 1. Psa. 58.</note> reccauing a finner, at what time soeuer he repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth, and turneth from his sinne: but, for that this turning at the last day, is not commonly true repentance and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for the causes before rehearsed.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then this matter of delay; what wise man is ther in the world, who <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, vvhat danger is in delay.</note> reading this, wil not feare the deferring of his conuersion, though it were but for one day? Who doeth know whether this shalbe the last day, or no, that euer God wil cal him? God saith; <hi>I called, and you refused to come; I held out my hand, and you</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>vvold not looke tovvardes me; and therfore vvil I forsake you, in your extremitie.</hi> He doth not say, how many times, or how long he did cal and hold out his hand. God saith, <hi>I stand at the dore, and knocke;</hi> but he saith not, how often he doth that, or how many knockes he geueth. Againe, he said of wicked Iezabel, the faigned prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse <note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> in the Apocalips; <hi>I haue geuen her time to due penance, and she vvold not, and therfore shal she perish:</hi> but he saieth not, how
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:14541:448"/>
long this time of repentance endured. We read of wonderful examples herin. HEROD the father, had a cal geuen him, and <note place="margin">1. <hi>HEROD</hi> the first.</note> that a lowd one, when Iohn baptist was sent vnto him, and when his hart was so farre touched, as he willingly heard him, and folowed his counsaile in many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <note place="margin">Marc. 6.</note> as one Euangelist noteth. But yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he deferred the matter, and tooke <note place="margin">2. HEROD <hi>the second.</hi> Luc. 11. Luc. 23. Mat. 14.</note> not time, when it was offered: he was cast of againe, and his last doings made worse then his former. HEROD tetrarche the sonne, had a cal also, when he felt that desire to see Christ, &amp; some miracle done by him: but, for that he answered not vnto the cal, it did him no good, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much hurt. What a great knocke, had PILATE geuen him at his hart, if he had <note place="margin">3. PILATE.</note> bene so fortunate, as to haue opened the dore presently, when he was made to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the innocencie of Christ; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <note place="margin">Plat. 27.</note> by washing his handes in testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie therof, and his wife also sent vnto him an admonition about the same? No <note place="margin">4. AGRIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PA. Act. 26.</note> lesse knocke had king AGRIPPA at his dore, when he cried out, vpon the hearing of S. Paul: <hi>O Paul, thou persuadest me a litle, to be a Christian.</hi> But, because he deferred the matter, this motion passed away againe.</p>
                  <p>Twise happie had PHARAO bene, if he <note place="margin">5. PHARAO.</note> had resolued him self presently, vpon that motion that he felt, when he cried to <note place="margin">Exod. 9. Act. 24 6. FELIX.</note> Moyses, <hi>I haue sinned, and God is iust.</hi> But by delay, he became worse then euer he was before. S. Luke reporteth how FELIX, the
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:14541:448"/>
gouernour of Ieurie for the Romanes, conferred secretly oftentimes with Saint Paul, that was his prisonner; and heard of him the faith in Christ, wherwith he was greatly moued; especially at one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, when Paul disputed of Gods iustice, and of the day of iudgement, whereat FELIX trembled. But yet, he deferred this resolution, willing Paul to depart, and to come againe an other time: and so the matter by dilation came to no effect. How many men doe perish daily, some cut of by death, some left by God, and geuen ouer to a reprobate sense; which might haue saued them selues, if they had not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their conuersion from day to day; but had made their resolution presently, when they felte God to cal within their hartes.</p>
                  <p>Almightie God is ready and bountiful to knocke and cal; but yet, he bindeth him <note place="margin">The da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of passing the day of our voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> self to no time or space, but commeth and goeth at his pleasure. And they who take not their times when they are offered, are excuseles before his iustice, and doe not know whether euer it shalbe offered to them againe, or no; for that, this thing is ouelie in the wil and knowledge of <note place="margin">Exo. 33.</note> God alone; who taketh mercie where it pleaseth him best, and is bound to none. <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> And when the prefixed time of calling is once past, woe be vnto that partie. For a thowsand worldes wil not purchase it againe. Christ sheweth wonderfully the importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this matter; when, entering
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:14541:449"/>
into Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon Palme-sonday, amidest al the mirth &amp; glorie of his receiuing, he could not chuse but weepe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that citie, considering (as most men thinke) that this was the last day of mercie and vocation, that euer should be vsed to the same. And therfore he said with teares; <hi>O Ierusalem, if thou knevvest also, thos thinges vvhich apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>to thy peace, euen in this thy day! but novv thes thinges are hidden from thee.</hi> As if he had said; if thow knewest (Ierusalem) as wel as I doe, what mercie is offered vnto thee, euen this day, which is the last day, that euer such offer shalbe made; thou wouldest presentlie accept therof. But now this secret iudgement of my father is hidden from thee; and therfore thou makest litle account therof, vntil thy destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction shal come suddenlie vpon thee; as soone after it did.</p>
                  <p>By this now may be considered, the great reason of the wise mans exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Forslovv not to turne to God; nor doe thou deserre it from day to day; for his vvrath vvil</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>come vpon the, on the suddain, and in time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge it vvil destroy thee.</hi> It may be sene also vpon what great cause, S. Paul exhorted the Hebrewes so vehemently, <hi>Dum cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatur</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note>

<pb n="849" facs="tcp:14541:449"/>
sinne it is, to resist the Holy Ghost.

This (no doubt) is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; but yet thou must remember also, that the virgins which filled their lampes, only at the verie instant of their enterance to the mariage, were shut out, and vtterly reiected by Christ.

                  <head>Of Sloth.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FIRST THEN,</hi> the impediment of slouth, is a great and ordinary let of reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution <note place="margin">OF Sloth. the first part.</note> to many men; but especially in idle and delicate people, whos life hath bene in al case and rest; and therfore doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade themselues, that they can take no paines, nor abide anie hardnes, though neuer so faine they would. Of which kind of persons, S. Paul saieth, that nise <note place="margin">1. Co. 6.</note> people shal not inherite the kingdome of heauen: Thes folkes doe proceede in this order. They wil confesse to be true, so much and a great deale more then is said before: and that they would also gladlie for their partes put the same in execution, but that they can not. Their bodies may not beare it; they can not fast; they can not watch; they can not praie. They can not leaue their disportes, recreations, and <note place="margin">Excuses of nise people.</note> merie companions: they should die pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently (as they saie) with melanchely, if they did it; yet in their hartes they desire (forsooth,) that they could doe the same; which seing they can not, no doubt (say they) but God wil accept our good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, &amp; pardon vs in the rest. But let them hearken a litle, what the scripture saith hereof; <hi>Desires do kil the slothful man</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Pro. 21.</note> Salomon:) <hi>his handes vvil not fal to any</hi>
                     <pb n="854" facs="tcp:14541:452"/>
                     <hi>vvorke: al the daie long he coucteth and desireth: but he that is iust, vvil doe, and vvil not cease. Take the slothful and vnprofitable seruant</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>and fling him into vtter darkenes, vvhere shalbe vveeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
                     <q>And when he passed by the way and founde a figge tree with leaues, without fruit (which signified desires without <note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> workes:) he gaue it presentlie an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting curse. </q>Finallie, the prophet Dauid detesteth thos men, and saith also, they are detested of God, <hi>qui in labore hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non sunt,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psa. 72.</note> which are not in the labours of men.</p>
                  <p>Of this fountaine of sloth, do proceed many effectes, that hinder the slothful fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <note place="margin">Fovver ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes of slouth.</note> al good resolution. And the first is, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine heauines, and sleepie drowsines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> towardes al goodnes, according as the <note place="margin">DROV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SINES. Pro. 19. Ephe. 5. Marc. 13. Mat. 24. &amp; 25.</note> scripture saith; <hi>pigredo immittit soporem,</hi> sloth doth bring drousines. For which cause S. Paule saith, <hi>surge qui dormis,</hi> arise thou which art a sleepe: and Christ crieth out so often, <hi>videte, vigilate,</hi> looke about you, and watch. You shal see many men in the world, with whom if you talke of a cowe or a calfe, of a fat oxe, of a peece of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or the like, they can both heare and talke willinglie and freshly. But if you reason with them of their saluation, and of their inheritance in the kingdome of heauen: they answere not at al, but wil heare, as <note place="margin">Prou. 6. &amp; 24.</note> if they were in a dreame. Of thes persons then saith the wise man;<q> how long wilt thou sleepe, ô slouthful felow? when wilt thou arise out of thy dreame? A litle yet
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:14541:452"/>
wilt thou sleepe; a litle longer wilt thou slumber; a litle wilt thou close thy handes together, and take rest: and so, pouertie shal hasten vpon thee as a run ning poste, and beggarie as an armed man shal take &amp; possesse thee.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second effect of slouth, is a certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fond feare of paines and labour, and <note place="margin">FEARE.</note> of casting dowtes where none be, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the scripture saith, <hi>pigrum deiicit ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> feare discourageth the slothful man. <note place="margin">Pro. 19.</note> And the prophet saith of the like, <hi>they shake for feare vvhere there is no feare.</hi> Thes <note place="margin">Psa. 52.</note> men doe frame vnto them selues strange imaginations of the seruice of almightie God, and of verie dangerous euentes, if they should imbrace and folow the same. One saith; if I should <note n="*" place="margin">Bun. here striketh out the first tvvo me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of fusting &amp; praying.</note> fast much, it would without dowte corrupt my blood. An other saith, if I should pray, and stand bareheaded long; I should die most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly with rheume. A third saieth, if I should kepe account of al my sinnes, to confesse them; it would quicklie kil me with sadnes. And yet al this is nothing els but slouth, as the scripture testifieth in thes wordes; <hi>Dicit piger, leo est foris; in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>medio platearum occidendus sum.</hi> 
                     <q>The slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man saith (sitting stil in his house) ther is a Lion without; if I should goe out of dores to labour, I should certainly be slaine in the middest of the streetes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third effect of sloth is, pusillanimitie and faintnes of hart; wherby the slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> man is ouerthrowen, and discouraged
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:14541:453"/>
by euery litle contrarietie or difficultie <note place="margin">Pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</note> which he findeth in vertue, or which he imagineth to finde therin. Which the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture signifieth, when it saith, <hi>inlapide luteo lapidatus est piger,</hi> the slouthful man, is sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Eccl. 22.</note> to death with a stone of durt; that is, he is ouerthrowne with a difficultie of no importance. Againe: <hi>De stercore boum lapidatus est piger,</hi> the slouthful man is sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dead with the dung of oxen: which commonly is such a substance, as hardly can doe any hurt.</p>
                  <p>A fowerth effect of slouth is, idle la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines: which we see in many men that <note place="margin">4. Lasines.</note> wil take and consult of this &amp; that, about their amendement, but wil execute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Which is most fitlie expressed by the Holie Ghost in thes wordes; <hi>Sieut ostium vertitur in cardine suo, it a piger in lectulo suo.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 26.</note> 
                     <q> As a dore is tossed in and out vpon his hingels, so is a slothful man, lying lazelie vpon his bedde. </q>And againe; <hi>vult &amp; non</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>vult piger;</hi> A slothful man wil and wil not; that is, he turneth him self to and from in his bedde, &amp; betwene willing and nilling he doth nothing. And yet further, in an other place the scripture describeth this lazinesse, saying, <hi>the slothful man putteth his handes vnder his girdle, and vvil not vouchsase to lift them vp to his mouth, for that it is painful.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Al thes and many more are the effectes of slothe; but thes fower especiallie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue I thought good to touch in this place; for that, they let and hinder greatlie this
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:14541:453"/>
resolution which we talke of. For he that liueth in a slumber, &amp; wil not heare, or attend to any thing that is said of the life to come; and besides this, imagineth feareful matters in the same; and thirdlie, is throwen downe by euerie litle blocke, that he findeth in the way; and lastlie, is so lazie, as he can beare no labour at al: this man (I say) is past hope, to be gained to any such purpose as we speake of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TO REMOVE</hi> therfore this impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this forte of men ought to lay befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <note place="margin">MEANES to remoue Sloth.</note> their eies, the labours of our Sauiour Christ, and of his Saintes; the exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they vsed to other men, to take like pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; the threates made in scripture against them which labour not; the condition of our present warfare, that requireth tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile; the crowne prepared for it; and the misery ensewing vpon idle and lazie peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

For albeit thes men <note place="margin">Tit. 1.</note> of whom I speake, doe in wordes confesse God, and professe them selues to be as good Christians as the rest: yet secretlie in deed they doe not beleeue God, as their life and doings doe declare. Which thing holy scripture discouereth plainlie, when it saith, <hi>vae dissolutis corde, qui non credunt Deo;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 2.</note> 
                     <q>woe be vnto the dissolute and careles in hart, who doe not beleeue God.</q> That is, albeit they professe that they beleeue and trust in him; yet by their dissolute and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reles doings, they testifie, that in their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:14541:455"/>
they beleeue him not; for that, they haue nether care nor cogitation of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pertaining to him.</p>
                  <p>This kinde of men, are thos which the <note place="margin">Of careles Atheistes. <hi>Deu. 22.</hi>

Thes are they of whom Christ saith in the reuelations, <hi>I vvould thou vvere ether colde or hoate. But for that thou art luke vvarme, and</hi>

                     <hi>netber cold nor hoate, therfore vvil I beginne to vomite thee out of my mouth.</hi> Thes are they who can accorde al religions together, and take vp al controuersies, by onely saying; that, ether they are differences of smal importance, or els that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine onelie to learned men to thinke vpon, and not vnto them. Thes are they who can applie them selues to anie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, to any time, to any princes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for matters of life to come. Thes men forbid al talke of spirite, religion, or deuotion in their presence; onelie they wil haue men eate, drinke, and be merie with them; tel newes of the courte and affaires abrode; sing, daunce, laugh, and plaie at cardes; and so passe ouer this life in lesse consideration of God, then doe the very heathens. And hath not holie writ great reason then (deare brother) in saying, that thes men in their hartes and workes are in deede verie Atheistes? yes surelie. And it may be proued by many
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:14541:456"/>
rules of our Sauiour him self. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; this is one rule set downe by him self; <hi>By their fruites yee shal knovv them.</hi> For <note place="margin">Luc. 6.</note> such as the tree is within, such is the fruit which that tree sendeth forth.

                     <note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> and consequentlie, seing thes mens talke is nothing but of worldlie vanities: it is an euident signe, there is nothing in their hart, but that. And then it foloweth also by a third rule, <hi>vvhere the treasure is, there is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>the hart;</hi> and so consequently, seing their hartes are onelie set vpon the world, the world is their onelie treasure, and not God; and ther vpon are very Atheistes.</p>
                  <p>This impediment (deare Christian <note place="margin">Tvvo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme at this daie.</note> brother) reacheth both farre and wide at this daie; and infinite are the people who are intangled therwith; and the causes therof are two especiallie. The <note n="*" place="margin">This Bun. lesueth out.</note> first is, deuision schisme and heresie, in matters of our faith; which by raising many doubtes and questions, and by contentious quarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which it maintaineth, wearieth out a mans wit, and in the end bringeth him to care for no part, but rather to contemne al. The second is, inordinate loue of the world; which bringeth men to hate God, and to conceiue enemitie against him, as the Apostle saith; and therfore, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.</note> though indeed they nether beleeue, nor delite in him. And of al other men thes are the hardest to be reclaymed, and brought to any resolution of amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for that they are insensible; and besides
<pb n="863" facs="tcp:14541:456"/>
that, doe also flie al meanes, wherby they may be cured. For, as there were final <note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</note> hope to be conceiued of that patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which being greuouslie sicke, should nether feele his disease, nor beleeue that he were diste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, nor abide to heare of phisick, or phisition, nor accept of anie counsail that should be offered, nor admit any talke or consultation about his curing: so thes men are in more dangerous estate then anie other, for that, they know not their owne danger; but persuading them selues to be more wise then their neighbours, doe remoue from their cogitations al things, wherby their health might be procured.</p>
                  <p>THE ONELIE waie to doe thes men <note place="margin">THE vvaie to cure ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reles men.</note> good, (if there be any waie at al) is, to make them know that they are sicke, and in great daunger; which in our case may be done best (as it seemeth to me) by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them to vnderstand, how farre they are of, from any one peece of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie; and consequentlie, from al hope of saluation that may be had therby. God requireth at our handes, that we should <note place="margin">Deut. 6. Mat. 22. Luc. 10.</note> loue him and serue him, <hi>vvith al our hart, vvith al our soule, and vvith al our strength.</hi> Thes are the prescript wordes of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, set downe both in the old and new law. And how farre (I praye the) are thes careles men short of this, who emploie not the halfe of their hart, nor the halfe of their soule, nor the halfe of their strength in Gods seruice; nay, not
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:14541:457"/>
the least part therof? God requireth at our handes, that we should make his lawes <note place="margin">Deut. 6. &amp; 11. Iohn.

But how farre are thes men from this, which bestowe not the third parte of their thoughtes vpon this matter, no not the hundreth part, nor scarse once in a yeare do talke therof? Can thes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saie, they are Christians, or that they beleeue in IESVS, our Saueour?</p>
                  <p>Christ making the estimate of things in this life, pronounced this sentence; <hi>Vnum est necessarium,</hi> one onelie thing is <note place="margin">Luc. 10. <hi>Antitheses betvve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true Christians and careles vvorldlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> 1.

Thes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finde many things necessarie besides this one thing, and this nothing necessarie at al. How farre doe they differ then in iudgement from their Sauiour Christ? Christes Apostle saith; that a Christian, <hi>must nether loue the vvorld, nor any thing in the vvorld.</hi> Thes men loue nothing els, but that which is of the world. He saith, <hi>That vvho soeuer is a frend to the vvorld, is an enemie to Christ.</hi> Thes men are enemies to who soeuer is not a frend to the world. How then can thes men holde of Christ? Christ saith, <hi>vve should praye stil.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 18. Ephe. 5.</note> Thes men praye neuer. Christs Apostle
<pb n="865" facs="tcp:14541:457"/>

Mat. 10.</note> among Christians: thes men haue no other but such talke. Finally, the whole course and canon of scripture runneth, that Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s should be, <hi>attenti, vigilantes, soliciti, instantes, feruentes, perseuerantes, sine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissione:</hi> That is, attent, vigilant, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, instant, feruent, and perseuerant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermission, in the seruice of their God. But thes men haue no one of thes pointes, nor any one degree therof, but in euery one the cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. For they are nether attent to thos things which appertaine vnto God, nor vigilant, nor solicitous, nor careful; and much lesse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and feruent; and least of al, perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant without intermission; for that they neuer beginne. But on the contrarie side, they are careles, negligent, lumpish, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misle, key cold, peruerse, contemning and despising, yea lothing and abhorring al matters that appertaine to the mortifiing of them selues, and to the true seruice of God. What parte haue thes men then in the lot and portion of Christians, besides onely the bare name, which profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</p>
                  <p>And this is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to shew, how great and dangerous an impediment this care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, <note place="margin">The dager of a careles man.</note> senseles, and supine negligence is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof we entreate. For if Christ require to the perfection of this resolution, that whosoeuer once es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieth <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> out the treasure hidden in the field,
<pb n="866" facs="tcp:14541:458"/>
(which is the kingdome of heauen, and the right way to gaine it) he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently goe and sel al that he hath, and buie that field: that is to say, that he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the pursute of this kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, before al the commodities of this life whatsoeuer; and rather venture them al, then to omit this treasure. If Christ (I say) require this, as he doeth; when wil thes men euer be brought to this point, who wil not geue the least parte of their goodes to purchase that field; nor goe forth of the dores to treate the bying therof, nor wil so much as thinke or talke of the same, nor allow of him which shal offer the meanes &amp; waies to compasse it?</p>
                  <p>Wherfore, whosoeuer findeth him self in this perilous disease, I would counsaile <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> him to reade some chapters of the first part of this booke; especially the third &amp; fift, entreating of the causes for which we were sent into this world; as also of the account, which we must yeld to God, of our time here spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; &amp; he shal there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand (I dout not) the errour &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger he standeth in, by this damnable negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence wherein he sleepeth, atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thos things which are meere vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for which he came not into this world; and passing ouer other matters, without care or cogitation, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding are only of importance, and most necessary for al men to employ their whole care and study in.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THE THIRD</hi> and last impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that I purpose to handle in this booke, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">HARDNES of hart, the 3. part.</note> affection, or euil disposition in some men, called by the scriptures, Hardnes of harte, or in other wordes, obstination &amp; obstinacie of minde. Wherby a man is set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in resolution, neuer to yeld from the state of sinne wherein he liueth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shal or may be said against the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. And I haue reserued this impediment, for the last place in this booke; for that, it is the last, and worst of al other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes discouered before, containing al the euil in it self that any of th' other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearsed haue; and adding to the same besides, a most wilful and malitious resolution of sinne, quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to that resolution, which we so much endeuour to induce men vnto.</p>
                  <p>This hardnes of hart hath diuerse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in diuers men, and in some much <note place="margin">Tvvo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of hardnes of hart.</note> more greeuous &amp; perilous then in other. For some are arriued to that highe and and cheefe obduration, which I named before; in such sort, as albeit they wel know that they are amisse, yet for some worldlie respect or other, they wil not yeeld, nor chaunge their course, doe, saie, or proue what you wil or can. Such was the obduration of Pilate; who albeit he <note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> wel knew that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned our Sauiour Christ wrongfullie: yet, not to leese the
<pb n="868" facs="tcp:14541:459"/>
fauour of the Iewes, or incurre displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with his prince; he proceeded, and gaue that most wicked sentence against him. This also was the obduration of Pharao; who, though he saw the miracles <note place="margin">Exod. 6. 7. 8.</note> of Moyses and Aaron, and felt the strong hand of God vpon his kingdome: yet, not to seeme to be ouercome by such simple people as they were; nor that men should thinke he would be enforced by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to relent: he perseuered stil in his wilful wickednes, vntil his last and vtter destruction came vpon him. This hardnes of hart was also in king Agrippa, and in <note place="margin">Act. 26. 27.</note> Foelix, gouernour of Ieurie; who, though in their owne consciences they thought that S. Paul spake trueth vnto them; yet, not to hazard their credit in the world, they continued stil, and perished in their owne vanities. And commonly this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration is in al persecutors of vertue, and <note place="margin">Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> of vertuous men: whom, albeit they see euidentlie to be innocent, and to haue equitie on their side; yet, to maintaine their estate, credite, and fauour in the world; they persist, without ether mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or release, vntil God cut them of, in the middest of their malice and furious cogitations.</p>
                  <p>Others ther are, who haue not this <note place="margin">A second degree of abduratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> obduration in so high a degree, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in wickednes directly against their owne knowledge; but yet they haue it in an other sort: for that, they are setled in firme purpose to folow the trade, which
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:14541:459"/>
alredie they haue begonne; and wil not vnderstand the dangers therof; but doe seeke rather meanes to persuade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues and quiet their consciences therin: and nothing is so offensiue vnto them, as to heare any thing against the same. Of the; men holie Iob faith: <hi>Dixerunt Dco, recede a nobis, &amp; scientiam viarum tuarum nolumus:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 21.</note> They say to almightie God, depart from vs, we wil not haue the knowledge of thy <note place="margin">Psal. 57.</note> waies. And the prophet Dauid yet more expressely; <hi>Their furie is like the furie of serpentes, like vnto cocatrices that stope their cares, and vvil not heare the voice of the inchaunter.</hi> By this inchaunter, he meaneth the Holie Ghost, which secketh by al meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to charme them from the bewitching wherin they stand, called by the wise man, <hi>fascinatio megacitatis;</hi> the bewitching of vanitie.

<pb n="870" facs="tcp:14541:460"/>
for that, through the light of knowledge which they had by hearing of Gods law, they could not in truth, or with shew of reason, condemne the things which were said, or auoide the iust reprehensions vsed towardes them; and yet resolued with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues not to obey, or change the custome of their proceedings: therfore fel they in fine to persecute sharplie their reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; wherof the onely cause was, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of hart. <hi>Indurauerunt facies suas supra pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram, &amp; noluerunt reuerti,</hi> saieth God by the <note place="margin">Iere. 5.</note> mouth of Ieremie;<q> they haue hardened their faces aboue the hardnes of a rocke; and they wil not turne to me.</q> And in an other place of the same prophet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth greeuouslie of this peruersenes: <hi>Quare ergo auersus est populus isle in Ierusalem,</hi>

A hard hart is that, which is ingratful to Gods benefites, disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his counsails, made cruel by his iudgementes, dissolute by his allureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, vnshamefast to filthines, feareles to perils, vncourteous in humane affaires, recheles in matters pertaining to God, forgetful of things past, negligent in things present, improuident for things to come.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this description of S. Barnard it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that a hard hart is almost a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <note place="margin">The expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of S. Barnards vvordes.</note> and remediles disease, where it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. For what wil you doe (saith this good father) to amend it? If you laie the greeuousnes of his sinnes before him: he is not touched with compunction. If you alleage him al the reasons in the world, why we ought to serue God, and why we
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:14541:461"/>
ought not to offend and dishonour him: he is not mollified by this consideration of pietie. If you would request him and beseeche him with teares, euen on your knees: he is not moued. If you threaten Gods wrath against him: he yeeldeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therunto. If God scourge him in deede: he waxeth furious, and beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth much more hard then before. If God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe benefites on him: he is vngrateful. If he counsaile him for his saluation: he obeieth not. If you tel him of Gods secret and seuere iudgementes: it driueth him to desperation, and to more crueltie. If you allure him with Gods mercie: it maketh him dissolute. If you tel him of his owne filthines: he blusheth not. If you admonish him of his perils: he feareth not. If he deale in matters towardes men: he is proude, and vncurteous. If he deale in matters towardes God: he is rashe, light, and contemptuous. Finallie, he forgetteth what soeuer hath passed before hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des other men, either in rewarde of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, or in punishment of sinners. For, the time present, he neglecteth it, and maketh no account of vsing it to his benefite. And of things to come, ether of blisse or miserie, he is vtterlie vnprouident; nor wil esteeme therof, laie them neuer so often, or vehementlie before his face. And what waie is there then, to doe this man good?</p>
                  <p>Not without great cause surelie, did the wise man pray so hartelie to God; <hi>Animae</hi>

Oh that al hard harted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would note this reason of the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <note place="margin">Note.</note> But S.

                     <q>There was neuer yet hard harted man saued, except perchance God by his mercie did take awaie his stonie hart, and geue him a hart of flesh, according to the prophet.</q> By which wordes S. Barnard signifieth, and proueth out of the prophet, <note place="margin">Tvvo kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in men, vvith their properties.</note> that there are two kindes of hartes in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the one a fleshie hart, which bleedeth if you but prick it; that is, it falleth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, repentance, and teares vpon neuer so smal a checke for sinne. The other is a stony hart, which if you beate and buffet neuer so much with hammers, you may as soone breake it in peeces, as ether bend it, or make it bleed. And of thes two har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in this life, dependeth al our miserie, or felicitie for the life to come. For as God, when he would take vengeance of Pharao, had no more greuous waie to doe it, then to saie, <hi>Indurabo cor Pharaonis;</hi> I wil harden the hart of Pharao; that is, (as S.
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:14541:462"/>
Austen expoundeth) I will take awaie my <note place="margin">Exo. 4. 7. 14. Au. q. 18. su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exod. &amp; ser. 88. de temp. Ezec. 36.</note> grace, and so permit him to harden his owne hart: so when he would shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to Israel, he had no more forcible meane to expresse the same, then to saie, <hi>I vvil take avvaie the stony hart out of your flesh, and geue you a fles hie hart in steade therof.</hi> Which is to saie, I will take away your hard hart and geue you a soft hart, that wilbe moued when it is spoken vnto. And of al other blessings and benefites which God doth bestowe vpon mortal men in this life, this soft and tender hart is one of the greatest; I meane such a hart as is soone moued to repentance, soone chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and controlled, soone pearsed, soone made to bleed, soone stirred to amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And on the contrarie parte, there can be no greater curse or malediction laied vpon a Christian, then to haue a hard and obstinate hart, which heapeth euery day vengeance vnto it self and his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster also, as S. Paul saieth: and is compared <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> by the same Apostle vnto the ground which no store of raine can make frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, albeit it fal neuer so often vpon the same; and therfore he pronounceth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Reproba est &amp; maledicto proxima, cuius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suinmatis in combustimem;</hi> That is; <q>it is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, &amp; the next dore vnto malediction; whos ende or consum nation must be, fire and burning.</q>

<pb n="879" facs="tcp:14541:464"/>
to send thee (gentle reader) as my time and habilitie wil permit, the other two bookes also; especiallie, if it shal please his diuine Maiestie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte me therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with the gaine or good of any one soule by this which is alreadie done: that is to say, if I shal vnderstand, conceiue, or hope, that any one soule so dearlie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the pretious blood of the sonne of God, shalbe moued to resolution by any thing that is here said; or shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed from the bondage of sinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the seruice of our maker &amp; rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; which is the onely ende of my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as his deuine Maiestie best knoweth.</p>

And in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation he may obserue thes fewe rules following.</p>
               <p>First, that when he goeth about to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, <note place="margin">1.

               <p>Fifthly, when he hath reade out al the <note place="margin">Ruminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> matter assigned, or before, (if any special thing moue him as he readeth;) let him staie, &amp; laying a side the booke, or making some note wher he breaketh of; let him quietly reuolue and meditate in his minde that which he hath reade, and this either kneeling, fitting, walking, or lying, as he findeth most conuenient for the repose of his minde.
