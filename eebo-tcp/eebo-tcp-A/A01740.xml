            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

haue conuerted into Engliſh, although not with ſuche
eloquence as ſome other might (peradueuture) haue
done it: yet I truſt with ſuche diligence that yee ſhall
finde the intent of the Authour ſufficiently explaned. Hee
made it for the comforting of an acquaintaunce of his,
<pb facs="tcp:9092:3"/>
who beyng fallen into pouerty, did beare it very impacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wherein he hath diſcharged the duety of a friend, ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,

deſirous to content many, and

I haue ſuffered the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie
of ſom my welwillers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
ſo far with me, that I haue
yeelded them my conſent for the
publiſhing of this Treatiſe, not
being ignorant vnto what hazard
of reproch they oppoſe themſelues,
that permit their doings to be layde open to the view of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
For as the better ſort will pronounce their oppinions of
it, anſwerable to the veritie of the ſubſtaunce, that ſhalbe in the
workes contained: ſo the greater ſorte doe commonly giue their
verdit according to the vanitie of the ſurmiſes that ſhall by
them be conceaued: often kindling a kinde of miſlike with the
matter, for ſome ſecrete malice that they beare to the man: And
more oftener for a reſolute and ſetled determination that they
haue grounded in them, neuer to like well of any thing, vnleſſe it
meete iumpewtth their own doting and peeuiſh imaginations, or
be ſome pigge of their proper farrowing: being in this poynt not
vnlike the crow, who alwaies thinks her owne byrdes fayreſt. But
dayly examples teach vs, that they which vomitte forth the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
rancour of their malicious ſtomackes, againſt the lawda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
attemptes of others: moſt, are ſuch as of themſelues can doe
leaſt: who neither cary a minde to vndertake any commendable
exerciſe themſelues, nor haue a meaning to permit others that
would, to performe it without their venomous backbyting. If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons
were not odious, I woulde heere liken all ſuch whelpes of
<hi>Zoilus,</hi> to that crabbed and canckerly naturde curre, which
being layde vpon a bottle of hey, would neither feede of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
(being meat contrary to his complection) nor ſuffer the poore
hungerſtarued beaſtes to approch neere it quietly: but would lye
<pb facs="tcp:9092:4"/>
still ſnapping and ſnarling at them. But to omitte theſe pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
and come to the purpoſe, I tell thee (gentle Reader) if
thou wilt vouchſafe the ouerlooking of this comfortable recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with a mind to profit, thou maiſt reape benefit, and be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bettered by the reading of it. For the brydling and keeping
vnder of our diſordinate affections: for the reſtrayning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
of our deſires within the compaſſe of a contented meane:
For the vſe and abuſe of riches, and for the gayning and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the true and perfect tranquilitie of minde, one may reade
much, and yet not finde it more pithily and ſubſtantially ſette
downe, then in theſe Epiſtles following: And eſpecially in the firſt,
where thou ſhalt meete with ſuch plentie of ſweete and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

and applyed ſo aptly, as will mooue them, if thou haue neuer ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
taſt or feeling in them of God, or godlyneſſe, to minde thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and be thankefull vnto him for his benefits. And my hope
is, that the goodneſſe and excellencie of the matter ſhall ſo rauiſh
thy ſenſes that my imperfections in the tranſlating of them, ſhall
be paſt ouer by thee vneſpied. Neuertheles if either in the edition
of this, or other my trifles, any thing ſhal chaunce to eſcape mee,

I will brooke it moſt patiently, accounting it no leſſe commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9092:5"/>
Thus we ſhould doe, and thus (would to God) we could doe: but
as it is moſt eaſie to profeſſe patience in words when our eſtate is
in quiet: ſo is it very difficulte to expreſſe it in deedes, when our
affections are diſtempered. Such as take mens purſes from them
vndeſired, paſſe often by the ſentence of a cord, and ſhall ſuch as
robbe men of their good names vndeſerued, be ſuffered to eſcape
ſcotfree? This may be ſet downe for a rule that neuer fayles: that
as many men would be glad to be better thought of, then his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
ſhall deſerue: ſo any man would be loth to be worſe thought
of, then his doinges ſhall demerit. For to be defrauded of deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
prayſe, and purſued with vndeſerued reproch, may well bee
accounted a double iniurie. To conclude (gentle Reader) I haue
bin ſo charie in the choyce of the things contained in this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
that thou mayſt finde many thinges heerein to delight
thee, and not any thing to diſpight thee. If thou ſhalt
take pleaſure, or gaine profit by the reading of
them: be thankfull to the authors, and
vouchſafe to thinke well of the

would thee worſt,
wiſheth thee

which yee now are moleſted; and
aboue al, yée ſhould not ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue felt the bitinges of pouerty, which in your laſt letter,
yée ſo cruelly complayne of. For it is a thing moſt manifeſt
(as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> ſayth very well) that our eyes are the chiefe
cauſe, that pouerty ſeemeth ſo ſharpe and bitter vnto vs.
Take away the ſight of riches, by and by pouerty ſéemeth
light vnto me. When I ſée not the pompes, the treaſures, the
iewels, the riche attire, delicious tables, ſumptuous palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
great traynes of ſeruants in others; I neyther ſearch for
them, nor couet after them, neyther am I carefull for being
without them. But aſſoone as theſe wilde beaſtes are once
preſented before my eyes, ſtraightwayes with theyr falſe
and deceaueable beauty, like enchauntreſſes, they lyme my
deſire, which done (like infernall furies) they torment it
with a thouſand anoyes; by the meanes whereof, all quiet &amp;
tranquillity is baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mind of man; in place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
vnpleaſant cogitations, broken ſléepes, froward hatred,
blinde enuy, ſeruile feare, doubtfull hope, and diuers other
their cruell companions, and copeſmates, raigne, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
our affections. Truely, I my ſelfe, who do now thinke
<pb facs="tcp:9092:6"/>
by long experience, and ſound iudgement of mind, to be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſtabliſhed, and confirmed in temperate deſires; when
ſometimes I am conuerſant (I ſay) amongſt the pompes of
the citie, I ſéeme to féele certayne waters of vayne appetites
to bubble vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in me, which might peraduenture breed ſome
gréeuous infirmity in my mynde, if I did not ſodainly kill &amp;
kéepe them downe with the tempeſt of moderation: &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
as oft as I make repayre into theſe places, I ſéeme to be
carried on a calme Sea, with a moderate winde, without
ſwelling of the waues, or danger of any tempeſt. Yée might
(I ſay) haue done me a moſt acceptable pleaſure, if yee had
come vnto me, to haue auoyded the dangers &amp; annoyances of
pouerty amongſt theſe ſolitary woods, &amp; yée ſhould alſo haue
deliuered me of a great trouble in writing vnto you. For that
here y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gréen graſſe, the flooriſhing trées, the cryſtal ſtreames
the chirping birdes, the harmeleſſe beaſts, the open ayre, the
ſéeing of euery thing to reioyce at the giftes of nature, would
haue byn better maiſters for the inſtructing of you, then all
the ſchooles of Philoſophers in Athens. Or if this had not byn
ſufficient, yet had it béen more eaſy for me to haue tolde you
what was conuenient in walking, and (as it were) ſporting
with you, (then béeing diſtant) I can nowe doe by writing.
But a friend is neuer to be abandoned, rather wée ſhoulde
endeuour to ſearch out euery remedy, for his health; to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
any trauell; and to put our ſelues betwixt euery dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
for his ſafety. Although I beléeue, yée demaund conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

you to be both wiſe &amp; temperate; but for that (as it comes too
paſſe) yée eſtéeme the conſolation geuen by a déere friend, to
be more pleaſant than your owne. For in this yée taſte but
your ſelfe onely: in the other yee ſhall participate both of the
fruite of your ſelfe, and of your friend. I ſay vnto you (Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Dionyſius</hi>) that firſt, I know not, whether to be poore or
rich, be a thing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hath his foundation in nature, or is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
placed in the opinion of men. But this I cléerely know,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pouerty is an euil or affection, which men without neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
haue by opinion onely placed amongeſt the euils, &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9092:6"/>
which nature hath beſtowed on vs; &amp; haue made y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame
of her, as (<hi>Menander</hi> ſaith) they haue done of ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the
iniury of words; of vnlucky dreames; of wonders, &amp; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, which not being giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by nature for any euill
at al; we, neuertheles through our fooliſh imagination, accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a diſgrace y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> not a litle tormenteth vs. Through which
it comes to paſſe, that man is more vnfortunate, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liuing creature whatſoeuer. Who is he liuing according
to the vſe of men nowadayes, ſeing himſelf to fal out of fauor
 w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his maiſter, had not rather haue ten burning feuers, then
loſe this his fauor? wheras if he had ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; would
not ſuffer himſelfe to be corrupted, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> falſe imagination, he
ought rather to chooſe the diſfauour of foure maiſters, then to
ſuffer one onely feuer; for that the firſt, is an euil ſpringing
onely of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; this is grounded &amp; founded in nature it ſelf.
So likewiſe ſemeth it vnto me of pouerty, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if it be an euill
(w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I beleue not) it taketh his original onely of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fantaſies, &amp;
thoughts of men of weak vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, hauing no foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
at all in nature. And therfore Ieſus Chriſt our ſauiour moſt
prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; diuinely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, not only his diſciples, but al the
poore alſo, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this goodly &amp; moſt beautiful exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of two ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.
Is not man (ſaith Chriſt) of greater price then twoo
ſparowes? hath not God greater regard of him, then of theſe
litle byrds? &amp; yet they want nothing that is néedful for theyr
ſuſtenance. Shal any thing be wanting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto men w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are
had in greater eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God &amp; nature? And verily, it
is not to be doubted but that pouerty &amp; riches ſprang firſt of
the diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of dominions; being brought in rather by the grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
&amp; ambition of men, then by any order of nature. O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be yée litle beaſts; you féele not at al, thoſe pearcings, &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uy
bytings of pouerty, but liue freely and ioyfully in the pure
law of nature, without encombring your ſelues, with ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
riches or pouerty. Let pouerty bée what ſhée will, I
knowe not wherefore wée ſhoulde accounte of her, when
as ſhe is not of the things that are within vs, but recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the number of thoſe that are without vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9092:7"/>
For man is made and framed of ſoule and body onely, and it
is not neceſſary to the compoſition of him, that there ſhoulde
appertayne a ſoule, a body, and riches. Now if pouerty be not
of the thinges within vs, but without vs, what euil (I pray
you) can ſhée doe vs? Surely it muſt be muche leſſe, then
that which offendeth the parts of which we are truely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
ſickneſſe, and diſeaſes make death ſeeme vnto vs more
bitter then gall; likewiſe ignorance, dulneſſe, enuie, ſinne,
and wickedneſſe corrupt the beauty of our ſoules: of theſe in
parte we are framed. But what hath pouerty to doe with
vs? ſhée hath reſpect (as hath béene ſayde) to the thinges
without vs, and ſhoulde not anoy vs, if we (enemies to our
owne ſelues) tooke not her dartes in our handes, and with
them moſt bitterly pearced our owne ſoules. But I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you farther, that the reſtleſſe griefe, the lothſome irkeſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and cruell prickinges that pouerty procureth, ſpring
all from one roote: which is, the deſire of ſuperfluous things.
Take away the deſire of thoſe thinges that are néedeleſſe,
and all this troubleſome Sea will preſently become quiet,
and calme. Of a troth, that ſentence manifeſted by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
celebrated of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſages, &amp; allowed by long experience
(that nature is contented with very fewe thinges) is moſt

Wilt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> (ſaid <hi>Cleanthus</hi>) be quickly rich? be thou then poore
of deſires. I pray thée tell me how néedful is it, from defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one from the cold, to be clothed in veluet, purple or gold,
&amp; to be alwaies in ſundry faſhions? Theſe garments bring no
helpe vnto nature, but increaſe the ſmoke of our ambition;
neither yet can we euer be ſatiſfied: wherby we gayne no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing, but to make our vanities, &amp; the blind cloude of our
deſires more appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. What neceſſity is there for the féeding
of our body &amp; ſuſtentation of our life, to haue our tables loded
with a hundred diuers meates: al placed in veſſels of ſiluer &amp;
gold? Firſt this is certaine, that if nature deſire a meaſurable
quantity of meate for her ſuſtenance; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more, is
to the deſtroying &amp; corrupting both of nature &amp; life, wherby

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9092:7"/>
then by the ſword.</p>
            <p>And it is dayly ſéene, that many of them, at whome the
fooliſh commonaltie ſo greatly woonder, in the end are paide
home with a deſerued puniſhment for their ambitious
gluttonie: Some repleniſhing themſelues with rhewmes,
others gaining to themſelues the gout: other ſome waſting
and conſuming their liuer, &amp; cauſing their ſinewes to ſhrink:
others dying miſerably long before their time. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
alſo, that with their ſundry kindes of ſauces they haue
brought it ſo to paſſe, that nothing ſauoureth of it ſelfe; and
that they very ſeldome eate with appetite, or delight. O
how true is that notable ſentence, and how well proued at
all times; That hunger is the beſt ſawce of all others,
which makes all meates ſauerie and delightfull! The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Darius</hi> is no leſſe true then common; who in his
flight after a battaile being wearied, and drinking a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of muddy water, did ſweare, that in all his life time, hée
neuer dranke more pleaſauntly: Beholde therfore; the poore
men are moſt rich of thoſe things, of which the rich (through
their blinde vnſatiablenes) are moſt poore. Finally it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
that this ſuperfluous féeding is an example of crueltie:
Firſt, againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that vſe it: for becauſe (as it is ſaid)
many are diſeaſed, many killed, and many brought to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie:)
Next, againſt a number of the poore, who (if it were
well ſéene vnto) might bée relieued temperately with that
which theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume immoderately. How much better ſhould
they doe, &amp; what more praiſe might they deſerue, both of God
&amp; the world, if (reſtraining their diet to an honeſt &amp; temperat
moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) al that which is vainly ſpent, were by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
into ſome better vſe, either in marrying ſome
maides, or in giuing exhibition to yong men addicted to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
or in vſing any other bountifull curteſie. Truely, I am
not of opinion, that for being rich they had néede to eat more:
neither that their welth doubling they ſhould redouble their
eating &amp; drinking; &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they encreaſing theſe; ſhould encreaſe
more alſo. To procéed farther in the matter, I ſay what néede
is there, for the kéeping vs from the raine, the wind, and the
<pb facs="tcp:9092:8"/>
ſunne, to dwel in ſumptuous pallaces, repleniſhed with moſt
coſtly ornaments, as though a little cottage might not bée
ſufficient to fence and defend vs from ſuch impreſſions, in
which alſo, for the moſt part, more reſt and ſafetie is found,
then in the other. What a fondneſſe? yea, what a monſtrous
appetite was it of <hi>Nero,</hi> when that of all the mount <hi>Celio</hi>
and more, hée made but one onely houſe, through which it
was doubted, leaſt that therein hée would haue ſwallowed
vp all <hi>Rome:</hi> and hée was not aſhamed to ſay, that now
hée began to lyue, as was conuenient for men? It pleaſeth
mée well, that ſumptuous and ſtately buildinges bée ſéene
in the world, not for any néede and tranquilitie of man, but
for the bewtifying, and ſetting out of Cities, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of the wonderfulnes and excellencie of artes.
But hée that is without them, ſo that hée haue ſome cotage
to couer himſelfe therwith, ought not to bée troubled for not
hauing of them.</p>
            <p>What ſhal wée ſay of the quiet bed for the wearied mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
is it requiſite that it bée adorned with golde and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſtones? as the laſciuious Emperours did often vſe to
doe in times paſt at <hi>Rome?</hi> or is it ſufficient that it bée of
leaues, as was vſed in the firſt world? though but homely,
yet more naturall? True it is, that <hi>Laertes</hi> had in his houſe
none other but one olde woman, which brought him his

ambition and vanitie is out of meaſure augmented beyond
that which the neceſſitie of Nature doeth require; and with
this encreaſing, hath brought vnto mortall creatures many
troubles, diuers diſpleaſures, &amp; infinite vexations, ſpringing
onely of a fooliſh, nay rather frantike, and raging appetite
of ſuperfluitie. Onely thus much I ſay vnto you, that vnto
a wiſe man, who will not ſuffer himſelf to bée caryed away,
with falſe reſemblances, or fained apparances, it ſufficeth
that he haue wherewith to defend himſelfe from hunger and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9092:8"/>
thirſt; and from the colde and heate: ſo that the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<hi>Epictetus,</hi> with a gallant ſimilitude did ſay very well.
As the foote is the meaſure of the ſhooe: ſo the meaſure of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
is the body of the man it ſelfe; if thou deſire to be ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
héerein, a moderation muſt be obſerued in thy deſires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde
the which if thou paſſe, thou muſt of neceſſitie runne
headlong into infinite inconueniences. And to bring this
to paſſe, I thinke it not neceſſary to haue the ſubſtaunce of
<hi>Craeſus,</hi> or <hi>Lucullus;</hi> but very few thinges may ſuffice for the
attaining of it, in ſuch ſorte that almoſt euery one may attain
vnto it with little difficultie, if they would but brydle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
their deſires within the limits of an honeſt moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Verily, when I way and ponder theſe thinges with my

               </gap>d ſireth a village; hauing obtained that, he wold haue a

craueth great ſtore of mony for diuers vſes, &amp; neceſſities; alſo
this money being gotten, he hath a deſire to be Lord ouer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and to haue vaſſailes vnder him: hauing brought this
alſo to paſſe, he aſpireth to be a Marqueſſe, next a Duk, then
a King, farther, an Emperour; and in the end he would bee
Lord of all the world: yet this would not ſatiſfie his greedy
appetite: for he would (with <hi>Alexander</hi> the great) be Lord
of al the worlds of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that he that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth
moſt, is fartheſt from his end: for that greater riches
engender greater deſires. This cruell and vnmeaſurable
luſt of hauing, is ſo great, and vnſatiable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9092:9"/>
I would gladly learne when it may bée ſaide, that a man
hath ſufficient; when it may bée ſaide, that hée is rich. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Craſſus</hi> was wont to ſay, that no man was rich, vnleſſe
with his yearely reuenewes hée could kéepe and maintaine
an army. What fondneſſe? what vnſatiableneſſe is
this? Truly <hi>Aglaius Profidius</hi> did not poſſeſſe ſo much, but
had only one litle plot of ground, which he manured with his
owne handes: neuer the leſſe hée was iudged by the Oracle
to bée moſt happy of all men. But ſhall I now declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you how many men in extreame pouertie haue liued ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and contentedly, being had in eſtimation, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
greatly? My web ſhould bée ouerlong, if I ſhould héere
recount them all, but theſe ſhall ſuffiſe. Amonſt the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<hi>Ariſtides, Phocion, Epaminondus, Pelopidus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,
<hi>Lampſacus</hi> the <hi>Athenienſen, Socrates</hi> and <hi>Efialtus</hi>
were moſt poore, yet were they all wiſe and iuſt men, and
well eſtéemed in the world. Alſo of the Latines there
are many notable examples: but this of <hi>Curius</hi> and <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
ſhall ſerue for all, of whome the one would rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
him that poſſeſſed golde, then poſſeſſe it himſelfe:
The other with a bolde courage refuſed many giftes that
the <hi>Samnites</hi> did profer him. But wherof ſprange this
temperaunce in them? Without doubt no other where, but
that they had clypped the wings to the deſire of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things. Of a troth this diſtinction of the Philoſophers
is moſt true; that our appetite is of two ſortes; the one mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
and hauing end; the other infinite, and without end.
Al thoſe that deſire riches, onely for the loue that they beare
vnto them, haue neuer any end in their deſires: but like him
that hath the dropſie, the more they poſſeſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more alwaies
they couet: but they that temperately ſearch after riches,
not for méere loue they beare towardes them, but
to employ them to ſome neceſſary and determinate vſe,
finde ſome end, and repoſe in their deſires. For ſo much
they ought and commonly doe deſire, as is néedefull for
that ende and vſe, for which they did deſire it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:9092:9"/>
But diuers entangle themſelues, propoſing hurtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
endes, at the leaſt wiſe vnneceſſary. I therefore
haue made choyce of one chiefly, being both pure and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſeruation of our ſelues, and thoſe that are
begotten of vs: all other endes are corrupt, full of pride and
ambition, and vnnaturall. O that it pleaſed God, that men
might deſire riches to no other vſe, but for that onely, which
they indéed ſtand in néed of. Doubtles, great rumours, many
lamentations, infinite ſorowes ſhould bée quieted, which for
the want of theſe enticing riches, are dayly made amongſt
men. But know yée wherefore hée is alwayes penſiue, why
hee ſéemeth continually to bée poore, and what the cauſe is,
that hée is neuer contented with his eſtate? ſhall I tell you
the onely occaſion hereof? it procéedes of no other cauſe, but
that hée alwayes lookes before him, fixing his eie on him that
is more rich, and more mightie then himſelf, &amp; either prickt
forward by enuie, or drawne vnto it by couetouſneſſe, hée
would not only reach and ariue vnto the ſame, but alſo paſſe
farther: and they neuer looke backe, or caſt their eies on the
poore, which are (as it were) behinde them, but rather hold
them in a continuall contempt: and there are very few that
can, or know how to moderate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, from theſe vntem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
diſorders. Of a treath there are many (yea very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
that bitterly complaine of pouertie: who, if the whole
world were deuided into equall partes, would not haue ſo
much vnto their ſhares, as they now poſſeſſe. I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue,
that if all the men and women were placed on
the one ſide, and all the riches of the world on the other, and
that his part were equally deuided vnto euery one (as it is
ſayde <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did in <hi>Sparta</hi>) it ſhould come to paſſe, that
many that now cry out, of pouertie, ſhould apparantly
ſée, that they were ouer rich, and had more then their parts.
Amongſt which number, I thinke my ſelfe ſhould bée one,
which now account my ſelfe to bée poore, and ſo peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
would you alſo: ſo that if yée reſpect this honeſt and

make you ſeeme to bée ſo poore, as yée eſtéemed your ſelfe to
be, nor bring you ſo great affliction, finding it farre leſſe then
yée déemed it to bée. But you will ſay peraduenture (and
I denie it not) that there are a great many rich, which féele
pleaſure, contentment, and honour by them: whereas I by
my pouertie receiue ſorowe, diſpleaſure, and ſhame. What
complaintes are thoſe? Shouldeſt thou diſpayre, for not
hauing that which other men enioy? Wherefore then doe
theſe rich men (which bring you in this eſtate) diſpayre,
ſeeing others aboue them to bée Dukes, Princes, Kinges
and Emperours? Why doe not many, that delight in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and drinking hange themſelues, for not being able to
drinke ſo much as <hi>Trigungius</hi> did with the Romaines; or
becauſe they cannot deuoure a whole table of meate, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellactus</hi>
hath done in our time? and to bring a more true
and liuely example, why are not all men afflicted, and as it
were brought into diſpayre, becauſe they haue not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrength
and force of a Lion; the ſight of an Eagle; the ſwiftnes of
a Tyger; the ſenting of a Dogge; the length of the life of a

            <p>It is not néedefull to looke to that which others haue, but
to that which is conuenient for our eſtates and callings. And
heerein (according to euery mans degrée) to repoſe our chiefe
contentment and felicitie. But perhappes, you will ſay that
it is not requiſite to make ſuch an arithmeticall diuiſion of
the goods of Fortune, but rather that it were more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to make<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Geometrical, not according to the number,
but the deſart. It were well ſayde. But who ſhall iudge
of this deſart?</p>
            <p>This, doubtleſſe is the head fountaine and originall of
all errours. Euery one doeth déeme, and iudge better of
himſelfe then there is cauſe why.</p>
            <p>Selfeloue doeth corrupt our iudgement, and ſedure our
ſenſes in ſuch ſort, with falſe imaginations that it preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vnto vs, that in partiall eſtéeming of our ſelues, euery
one ſuffers himſelfe pleaſauntly to bée deceaued. Infinite
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9092:10"/>
is the number of them, vnto whome it ſéemeth, that they
haue deſerued a great deale more then they haue: but there
are very few of the other ſorte, that thinke they haue a great
deale more then they haue deſerued: whereof grieuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations,
and continuall lamentations, for the want of
riches and preferment, doe afterwards enſue. I knowe not
then how in this generall diſcourſe wée ſhould conſider of
the deſartes of euery one aright, through which, all things
might bée brought into queſtion and controuerſie.</p>
            <p>It is a great deale better to ponder by this Arithmetical
diuiſion, that the greateſt part of them, that complaine of
pouertie, ſhall finde themſelues deceaued, if the world were
deuided into equall partes. But let vs paſſe on farther, if
it pleaſe you; and let vs ſet downe, with what iuſt meaſure
riches and pouertie ought to bée meaſured. Euery one doeth
loue, honour, and reuerence riches, and couet after them.
Euery one holdeth pouertie in contempt, deſpiſeth her,
and flyeth from her. Know yée wherfore? For that euery
man onely reſpecteth the good, and commoditie of riches, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
forecaſting the euils and diſcommodities that they bring
with them. Contrarily, euery one lookes vnto the euill,
that is found to bée in pouertie, and there ſtayeth himſelfe;
but none reſpecteth or hath regarde to the good, and commedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that commeth by her: ſo that it is not to bée wondered at,
if (the eies being opened to the good that riches hath in them,
and ſhut to the euill) ſo many doe prayſe and deſire them.
Neither is it any meruaile likewiſe, if (opening them to
the euill that pouertie hath in her, and ſhutting them to the
good) euery one deſpiſeth, and eſcheweth it. Know yée then
wherof this procéedeth? ſurely of none other cauſe, but the
firſt apparaunce. For that riches doeth preſent her ſelfe vnto
vs, which a gladſome and chéerefull countenaunce, bringing
with her a certaine counterfeit bewtie, that doth daſell our
eies, and lime our ſenſes and affections, with her enticement:
in ſuch ſorte, that we are drawne, and as it were brought
beſids our ſelues, with theſe couloured encha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tments, beléeue
that euery thing of her is pleaſaunt, bewtifull and good:
<pb facs="tcp:9092:11"/>
And theſe ſhaddowes, and faigned reſemblances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſhee is ſet out vnto vs, will not permit vs to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into the naughtineſſe, that ſhée conceales within her,
nor ſuffer vs to ſée the poyſon that lyes hidden vnder her,
through which that chaunceth oftentimes, which is ſpoken
of the Marmaides, that (alluring with their ſwéete, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueable
voyces) men ſée not the great euill that lurketh
vnder them, and is prepared for them. On the other ſide,
pouertie preſenteth her ſelfe vnto vs with a filthy and
horrible countenaunce, in ſuch ſort, that none would euer
ſurmiſe, that any good thing were contained within her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
neuertheleſſe, vnder il fauoured counterfeites, moſt bewti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
figures, and wonderfull workes, both of arte and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are oftentimes comprehended. But (as I ſayd) theſe
meaſures are not iuſt, neyther can the troth euer bée boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out by them.</p>
            <p>It is not ſufficient of one thing to open onely the good,
concealing the euill; and of another, to lay forth onely the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
not reuealing the good: and troth cannot poſſible bée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned
from a doubtful matter, if a diuiſion of the good and
the euill that reſteth in eyther of them, bée not firſt made and
ſifted out, and the ſubſtaunce of the thing after conſidered
of accordingly. It being a moſt true and vnfallible princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that all things vnder the Sunne, are (I know not in
what ſorte) entermixed with good and euill, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is neither wholly good, nor wholly euill: and now it
may well bée ſayde, that riches bringes with her much euill;
and pouertie containeth in her not a little good. Neyther is
it conuenient that they, whoſe pouertie is great, ſhould bée
left without an aduocate, as wée often ſée they are: but good
&amp; iuſt Princes ſhould ſée their right graunted them without
any expence. Behold again y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> riches puffe men vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a certain
vaine kind of inſolencie, and makes them become proud, and
diſdaineful, wheras pouertie repleniſheth them with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
and makes them humble and curteous: we ſée <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes</hi>
the frée man of <hi>Clodius</hi> to bée out of meaſure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9092:11"/>
rich: we ſée him likewiſe to be paſſing proude, in ſuch ſorte,
that in a long ſeaſon, he would not vouchſafe to ſpeake to any
of his ſeruantes: we ſée <hi>Fabritius</hi> to be moſt poore, we ſée him
therewith, very lowlie and pleaſant. But one example may
ſuffice for a thouſand, for wee may daily reade, heare, and ſee
them. This firſt Dowry therefore is to be deteſted, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
brings with her, in that it makes men proude and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
as that of pouerty is to be beloued, in that it makes men
humble and curteous. Riches make not men onely to be
puft vp with pride, but alſo drowneth them in diuers kinds
of voluptuous naughtineſſe, for it maketh them laſciuious,
vaine, giuen to gluttonie, alwayes occupied in earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes,
and wallowing in worldly wantonneſſe, and filth of
the fleſhe: for that being poſſeſſors of great riches, they déem
it a priuiledge, and reckon it in place of great game, that by
the meanes of them they may feede their ſuperfluous appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
and diſordinate affections. Wheras the poore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
his eſtate, for the moſt part liues ſparingly &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratelie,
not ſo greatly corrupted, nor defiled with vaine &amp;
worldly allurements. That <hi>Plutarcke</hi> ſaide verie wel, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
pouertie to be an abundant temperance, and a ſtrict
obſeruance of the Lawes, in ſuch ſort that <hi>Arceſilaus</hi> was
accuſtomed to ſay, that pouertie was ſharpe after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of craggie <hi>Ithaca,</hi> but yet brought foorth good ſonnes,
teaching them to abſtaine and ſuffer, and making them fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
concluding that it was a notable ſchoolehouſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
wraſtling place for all vertue. What ſhal I ſay more?
Riches make men become diſpiſers of God, at the leaſtwiſe
little acknowledging his power, and bountie. For the rich
man ſeing himſelfe to abound in wealth, and encreaſe in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſemeth in his owne conceite not to ſtand in need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other aſſiſtance, wherefore he verie ſeldome hath recourſe
vnto God, and ſeldome prayeth vnto him, or is thankefull
for his benefites: but as it were, dependeth of himſelfe onely,
ſwelling and wondering at his owne wiſedome, and (as one
might ſay) playing the Peacock in his felicity. Wheras the
<pb facs="tcp:9092:12"/>
poore man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing his imbecillity, runneth vnto God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge;
&amp; acknowledging his bounty, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mits himſelfe wholy to
his cuſtodie, lauding and prayſing his name, and calling him
to his ayde and aſſiſtance. But riches doe not onely corrupt
the will; but together therewith, are a hinderance, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to the vnderſtanding: for theſe (for the moſt part) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
it ynough to be rich, ſeldome or neuer geue theyr
mindes, to good and laudable ſtudies; or noble and high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,
eyther of philoſophy, or of any other ſcience:
but rather addict theyr whole endeuours, eyther to ſome
vayn &amp; friuolous paſtimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to the encreaſe of their riches.
Whereof it comes to paſſe, that the true and right end of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is changed into a falſe, and counterfayte. For that the
right vſe to learne ſcience in déede, is, for the more, and better
perfecting and ennobling the mind of man: But the common
ſort, wreſt it cleane contrary, accounting the acquiring of
ſubſtance, to be the onely ende of the learning of Science.
Through which the rich man weaues the webbe of his owne
woe, ſaying in himſelfe; what cauſe is there, that I ſhoulde
trauell my ſelfe in ſtudie? if I be already rich, I am come to
the end; what néede is it then that I haue recourſe, eyther to
the beginning or midſt. But the poore man, mooued eyther
with the right or wrong way, with great deſire and feruent
affection followeth his ſtudie: Through which it hath béene
ſéene, and is ſéene daily that many poore men by learning,
attayne vnto great excellency, promotion, and preferment.
So that <hi>Taletus</hi> the noble Philoſopher ſaid very well; who
ſo affirmeth (quoth he) that pouerty withdraweth a man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Philoſophy, &amp; riches enflame him with the deſire of it, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
greatly. O God, how many doe we ſée, hindred rather
by abundance of ſubſtance, then by ſcarcity? is it not euident
that the poore (for the moſt part) geue themſelues to ſtudie?
that the riche buſied in other affaires, either cannot, or will
not follow their learning? So much of <hi>Taletus.</hi> But let vs
procéede farther. Who ſéeth not that the rich men with great
difficultie come to the knowledge of the troth? hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9092:12"/>
about them a company of fayned friendes: &amp; ſwarme
of flatterers? Many examples might here be alleadged of rich
men that haue bin abuſed by ſuch diſſemblers; wheras y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> poore
man is frée from this plague? none going about to circumue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
him by flattery, it being a thing moſt manifeſt, that they that
profeſſe to be his friends are true friends, it being farre from
any ſuſpition, that they ſhould come to flatter him, or fayn to
be his friends, to the end, to pluck his wealth &amp; ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from
him, who ſtandeth more in néed to be reléeued himſelf, then to
giue to others. What ſhal I here ſpeak of the ſnares that are
intended agaynſt the rich: both towards their ſubſtance and
perſons? It were better for the beaſt called the <hi>Caſtor,</hi> that
he had not thoſe vertuous ſtones, when as for them he is ſo
purſued of the hunters; it ſhould be better alſo for men y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they
had not theſe riches, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſo many ſnares &amp; deceits are laid
by other men for the getting of them. But euen as the <hi>Caſtor</hi>
(as ſome write of him) ſéeing the hunters purſue him, bytes
of his ſtones, for the ſauegard of the reſt of his body: ſo ſhould
that rich man doe, which ſéeth himſelf beſieged w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſnares, and
counter watches for his ſubſtance, &amp; rather to chooſe to caſt al
away, then not to be aſſured of his life, &amp; liberty. That déede
therfore of <hi>Crates</hi> the Philoſopher was woorth the noting:
who ſéeing himſelf encombred, and his eſtate indangered,
through a great quantity of iewels, &amp; monie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he had, threw
all into the Sea: ſaying, I had rather drowne you, then yée
ſhoulde cauſe me to periſh or be deſtroyed. Great are the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the rich men w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are iniuried and purſued of the mighty,
to the end to procure their ſubſtance from them. Wherefore
was he that was baniſhed at the inſtant requeſt of <hi>Fuluia</hi> ſo
hardly dealt with, but that <hi>Fuluia</hi> woulde haue had his faire
houſe from him? The bookes of hiſtories both old and new
are repleniſhed with examples of them, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> makes me in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to be contrary to <hi>Anacarſus.</hi> He ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the lawes were
like the ſpiders web, into w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if any light or ſmal thing fell, it
there remained, but being great, it paſſeth through, and brake
it aſunder. Contrariwiſe, I ſay that they are like vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nets
<pb facs="tcp:9092:13"/>
of hunters, into the which if any little beaſt happen, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
paſſeth through the meſhes, the nets not béeyng made
to that end: but if any good beaſt enter therein, as a hare, a
goate, or a Déere, he ſticketh faſt, and is taken, being both
good and profitable for the hunters. Verily the couetous rich
man liueth continually in great ſuſpition &amp; feare, leaſt that
his ſubſtance be taken from him; or that he be beguiled of it,
or forced to depart with it againſt his will; ſo that euery ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
ſéemeth a Bugbeare vnto him; euery little ſtirring in
the houſe diſquieteth him: ſo that both at home in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and abroade in his iourney, he is neuer without ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not vnlike the man that is ielous of ſome woman whom
he loueth. Whereas the poore man, not hauing his breſt loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with ſuch feare; and féeling himſelfe to bee light in his
iourney, ſtandes not in doubt to be robbed: As that common
verſe ſayeth,</p>
            <q>
               <l>The man, that trauelling by the way</l>
               <l>no wealth with him doth beare,</l>
               <l>Amids the troopes of theeues may ſing,</l>
               <l>not hauing cauſe of feare.</l>
            </q>
            <p>AND doubtleſſe if it be well conſidered of, the poore man
hath but one care, which is, to procure a little ſuſtenance
wherewith to liue, but the rich man hath thrée thoughts and
cares together. The one to conſerue the riches that he hath:
the other how to encreaſe them: the third how to diſpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
through which it comes to paſſe, that the poore man is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with greater hope then feare; and of the other part, the
rich man is aſſailed more with feare, then hope. He alwaies
hopeth to change his poore eſtate and miſerable fortune into
the better, béeyng already placed in the loweſt degrée that
<hi>Defilus</hi> ſayde w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:9092:13"/>
               <l>The man that is moſt poore,</l>
               <l>moſt happy is of all;</l>
               <l>For that he neuer feares</l>
               <l>in worſe eſtate to fall.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This alwayes doubteth leaſt that his ſwéete will bee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into ſower, through which it is euident, that the
poore féeleth a greater tranquillity in his minde, being reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with hope, then doth the riche being ſurpriſed with
feare. What farther? That pouerty bringeth foorth more
woorthy effects then riches, not onely in it ſelfe, but in others
alſo. For pouerty rayſeth pitie &amp; compaſſion in others which
are moſt beautifull vertues in mans minde, but riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
and ſtirre them vp to enuie, which is a moſt wicked
vice. Wherefore if good effectes come of good cauſes, and
nanghtie of naughtie cauſes, it is verie likely that pouertie
is more vertuous that ingendereth vertue, then are riches,
that produce vices in others. What more ſhal I ſay, that
riches procure delightes, delightes tendernes and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſie
of the bodie, tenderneſſe and delicaſie cauſeth weakenes
and faintneſſe, through which it happeneth that rich men
are leſſe able to tollerate trauel, heate and colde, and other
humaine diſcommodities, then the poore are, who by a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
perforce, are taught to endure all labour and trauell,
and euery little impreſſion of the ayre, neyther are brought
down w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery litle trifling diſeaſe, as the rich are. What far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Riches ingender faintneſſe of courage, in the poſſeſſors
of them, in that for feare of abandoning of them; they wil not
aduenture to hazard them ſelues in any daunger, neither for
their friendes, nor for their kinred, nor countrie, neither yet
for themſelues, but are alwayes of a timerous and fearefull
minde. But the poore man not drawne backe with the ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſie
of this worldly pelfe, ſheweth his valure boldely, and
couragiouſly expoſeth himſelfe to perils and daungers for
the loue of his freendes, &amp; countrie. What beſides this? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
riches make men ſluggiſh, not ſuffering them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
<pb facs="tcp:9092:14"/>
to any good exerciſe; wheras pouerty ſeldom permits
them to ſtand drowſie and idle, but awakens them to beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inuentions, and laudable trauels. But let vs conſider one
point that toucheth rich men to the quicke, but the poore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo muche. All men both by the law of God and nature,
of neceſſity muſt once die. But he that aboundes in riches,
with what griefe and torment doeth he depart this life? hee
would not leaue his fayre houſe, his gallant village, his coſtly
apparrel; his braue horſes, his bright ſiluer: his glittering
gold, and other infinite commodities, and delights that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
in this world: which ſéeing that he muſt néedes forgoe,
he is out of meaſure vexed, and through inward griefe killes
himſelfe, before the houre of his death approch. But the poore
man, who takes litle ioy in this world, makes no great rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
to leaue it, not taſting that bitter ſorow, with dying,
which the rich men féele: hoping to inioy a better life in the
world to come. The poore alſo in this world haue great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
and it is no ſmal comfort vnto them, to think that the
rich (wil they, nil they) muſt die, and that they are forced (in
ſpite of their téeth) to forgoe al theyr ſubſtance. Neither will
we omit to ſay, that ſomtimes honeſt pouerty bringeth with
it more liberty &amp; contentment of life, then vnmeaſurable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
for that is franke and frée, &amp; this is tyed and bounde, to
reſpects, and ſuſpitions. So that now we perceaue, that al is
not pleaſant, &amp; delightful that is found in riches, nor al vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauery,
and bitter that is tried in pouerty, but in this, much
of the ſwéete; and in the other not a litle of the ſowre: in both
ſéene, felt, and taſted. Now let vs procéed a litle farther. And
(if yée thinke it good) let it be graunted, that pouerty is euill
and contemptuous, and hath in it no conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (but truely it
hath in it all theſe comforts, of which we haue before made
mention, which béeing well taſted of the poore man, hée ſhall
féele no litle contentment in his pouerty) let this be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
farther, that he is not onely poore: &amp; that this euill is not
taken from all others, and caſt on him alone: but the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9092:14"/>
number of the poore are vnnumerable, when as of the riche
there are very few: Through which, if to haue company in
ones aduerſity, make the euill to ſéems the leſſe, howe light
ſhould the euil of pouerty be, the poore man hauing ſo great
a number of other poore men to aſſociate him? Let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
farther that pouertie doth not alwayes pinche, but onelie
then, when he féeleth the want of ſome thing that he greatly
néedeth. It is not like a quotidian Agewe, which whiles it
endureth, alwayes vexeth and tormenteth a man; but this
yéeldes the reſt and repoſe, firſt whileſt thou ſléepeſt, thou
haſt no féeling of her: whereof this auncient Prouerbe tooke
his original; That in one halfe of theyr life, there was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the happy, and vnfortunate.</p>
            <p>Further, many houres of the day, a man thinkes not of
it: but liues ioyfully, as if he were rich, and in good caſe. I
haue ſéene many poore men, leade their liues ſo iocundly, as
did neuer king nor Emperour. On the other ſide, I haue
knowne many rich men, haue theyr myndes alwayes trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and diſquieted, as if they were wrapped in extréeme
want, and miſery: neuer to laugh, neuer to be gladſome, nor
ioyful, wherby I haue noted, that the true tranquillity of the
mynde ſprings not of thinges that are without vs, but of
that delectable muſicke, and well tempered harmonie,
of the humayne affections that are within vs. Let vs
farther conſider howe that pouertie is a thing that may
bée taken from vs in a day, in an howre, and as it
were, in a moment. It is not as too bee blynde, lame,
fooliſhe, or maymed, or a calamitie whereof no hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
euer to bee cured; but pouerty may ſodaynlie
bee taken away: eyther by the beneuolence of thy prince,
or ſome noble man, or by the meanes of ſome wealthie
friende, who mooued by ſome fauourable motion, will
aduaunce thee too riches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9092:15"/>
               <hi>Abdolomenus</hi> was moſt poore, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had a
deſire to make him king, and it was done preſently. Héere-vpon
<hi>Menander</hi> ſayde well, that of all euils, pouerty was the
lighteſt, for that any friend that wil aſſiſt thée, may vnlode
thee of it. On the other ſide, riches are frayle, &amp; fugitiue, when
as a man in a moment may be bereft of all. (O God) howe
many haue wée our ſelues ſéene, either by ſpoyling on the
land, or by drowning theyr ſhippes on the Sea, or by confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of their goods, or through the diſpleaſure of the Prince,
of moſt rich, on the ſodayne to become moſt poore. Let vs far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſider that the poore man is néerer the attayning of
his ende, then is the rich: Foraſmuch as hée doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
deſire more then wherewith to ſupply his neceſſities,
which (as hath béen ſhewed before) are few, and may eaſily
be remedied. But the rich man, ſwelling through the pride
of his ſubſtance, hath his naturall, and reaſonable appetite
corrupted, and deſires to encreaſe infinitely in his riches,
whereby it may bée ſéene, that hée is farther from his ende,
then the poore man. What more? That the rich man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
in wealth, encreaſeth alſo in deſires, and by howe
much his riches are the greater, ſo much the greater alſo are
his needes. Whereof this ſentence was wiſely ſpoken.
<hi>Neceſſe eſt eum multis indigere, qui multa habeat:</hi> He that hath
many things, muſt of neceſſitie want many thinges. Let
it be conſidered farther that man is borne naked, and hath
that which he poſſeſſeth of the méere grace of God, in ſuch
ſort, that if he will rightly eſtéeme euery thing: he ought not
to be penſiue and ſorowfull for that hée hath not, but
ought rather to render immortall thankes vnto GOD, for
that which hée hath. Finally, let this bée wayde, that if
pouerty bée euill, it is very ſhorte, let it endure as long as
it can; for all the time wée haue to liue héere, béeing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the infinite eternity that endureth euerlaſtingly,
is but as it were the twinckling of an eye.</p>
            <p>But I greatly maruell, that man, knowyng how hée
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9092:15"/>
muſt die, and ſomtimes thinking thereof, doth not take
comfort of his pouertie, and (as it were) of euery other euill
that hée ſuffereth: For that, either hée beléeues that our ſoule
is immortall (as wée ought true and reſolutely to beléeue) or
thinkes (as ſome naughtie and peruerſe people doe) that ſhee
ſhall die together with the body. If hée déeme it to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
and ſées infinite rewardes in an other world, ſette
downe for the good, and euerlaſting tormentes for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
who is hée (as one might ſay) that would not little ſet by
all the euill and good of this world, to gaine the felicitie of
the other. But if hée now thinke the ſoule to bee mortall,
how can pouertie afflict him, if hée conſider of the entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of himſelfe? But if hée reſolue of neither of theſe,
it is an euil of al others moſt to bée deteſted. <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> in
his diuine Oracles, ſayeth, that when two euils afflict one
place, of which the one is great, and the other very little,
the leſſer is not felt. If then pouertie, in compariſon of the
entire deſtruction of himſelfe bée a light euill: how ſhould
it ſo pinch and torment them? But as it is moſt requiſite,
let vs bée Chriſtians, and affirme not onely the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the ſoule, but vnfaignedly beléeue the infallible lawe
of Ieſus Chriſt, reuealed vnto vs by the light of his grace,
taught vs by the diuine ſcriptures, confirmed by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of ſo many Martyrs, ſhewed by ſo many lightes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
vnderſtandinges, approued by the vniuerſall lawe of
God, by which wee are guided through this ſea of fayth. Let
vs I ſay, bée Chriſtians, and then wée ought not to account
pouertie to bée euill, but deeme it rather to bée a true imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chriſt, who whiles hée remained in this world, liued
alwayes poorely, and méekely. But beſides this imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the commaundements that the eternall veritie hath
left vs, to doe in many places, teache it vs, which
if I ſhoulde héere ſette it downe at large, I greatly
feare, that in ſtéede of a comforting friend, yée would thinke
mée to bée a tedious preacher. I will only rehearſe vnto you
his wonderfull and diuine philoſophy, when as hée ſayeth; I
ſay vnto you, Be yée not careful what to eate, nor wherwith
<pb facs="tcp:9092:16"/>
to cloath your ſelues. Is not the ſoule of more valew then
meate? and the body, then rayment? Beholde the little
fowles of the ayre, who ſow not, neither reape, nor gather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their barnes, and yet our heauenly father feedeth them al.
Are not you of more account then they? which of you is there,
that with al your thought can ad one cubyt to your ſtature?
Why are you ſo carefull for apparell? conſider the Lyllies
of the fielde in what ſorte they grow, they worke not, they
ſpinne not, and yet I ſay vnto you, that <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his
royaltie was not cloathed like vnto one of theſe. And if God
cloath the graſſe of the field, which too day is ſéene, and too
morrow is throwne into the furnace, how much rather will
hée cloath you, O yée of little fayth? wherfore bée not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in your ſelues, ſaying, What ſhal wée <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at, or, what ſhal
we drinke, and wherwith ſhall wée bée cloathed? Theſe
thoughtes are of the heathen, and not of Chriſtians. Your
heauenly father knoweth well, what yée néede. Séeke
firſt the kingdome of God, and his righteouſnes, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things that yée ſtand in néede of ſhal bée giuen vnto you.
Bée yée not carefull what to eate tomorow: but let too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
care for it ſelfe. Sufficient is vnto the day, the trauayle
thereof. O moſt diuine Philoſophy, which, if it were well
taſted of men, and not lightly paſſed ouer, no man would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bée grieued or afflicted with pouertie. But wée, (for the
moſt part) haue not any feruent deſire to enter to the quick,
in the ſearching out the troth of thinges, through which it
comes to paſſe, that wée ſeldome, or neuer vnderſtand aright.
It is not néedefull to lay vp treaſure héere on earth, where
ruſt and moathes doe conſume; but in heauen, where neither
ruſt nor moathes do conſume, nor théeues breake in &amp; ſteale.
And if wée conſider farther, how hard it is for a rich man to
enter into the kingdome of heauen, there is none of ſo little
vnderſtanding, but wil deſpiſe and abhor riches: not, but that
rich men may be ſaued: but for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part of them haue
their mindes ſo encumbred with riches, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is very hard for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9092:16"/>
them to attaine ſaluation: &amp; therefore Chriſt ſaid, it is leſſe
eaſie for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for a Camel to paſſe thorow the eie of a needle. For hée whoſe
affection is greedily ſet on riches, ſeldome thinkes reuerently
of God, but ſo fixeth his deſire on earthly things, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he makes
himſelfe vnworthy of the glory of heauen, preferring mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
vanitie, before Gods veritie. Wheras Chriſt teaching
chriſtian perfection, ſaieth otherwiſe, to the Hebrew young
man: Goe, and ſell that which thou haſt, and giue it to the
poore, &amp; after follow mée. Truely pouertie is a dowrie moſt
conuenient for a Chriſtian: Therfore, when yee know your
ſelues to bee poore, bée yée not comfortleſſe: but rather thinke
that yée are the more in Gods fauour, who in al his ſayings,
and doings, recommended the poore, prayſed them, called
them bleſſed, and receiued them into his protection, being
déere and beloued of him: ſo that it is a moſt goodly thing to
liue poorely, in this ſhort and tranſitorie life; to become moſt
rich in the life to come, which ſhalbe permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; euerlaſting:
to ſet at naught the falſe and deceaueable Iewels of this
world; to gaine moſt plentifull and abundant treaſure in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.
O moſt worthy marchandiſe! O moſt plentiful gaine!
which neither théeues can rob thée of; nor ſeruaunt beguile
thée; nor debter deceaue thée: but will fill and repleniſh thée
with farre greater, and better fruite, then by the tongue of
man may bée expreſſed. What ſhal I ſay farther? that thoſe
thinges are few, and very eaſie to bée procured, with which
our humane nature is ſuffiſed: but many and infinite, which
our appetite deſireth.</p>
            <p>And that the grace of God is neuer wanting vnto thoſe,
who filled with a feruent ſpirite, refraine their earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and reſtraine them within the limites of Chriſtian
temperaunce. Wherof Saint Paule writing vnto Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
moſt diuinly ſaid, It is a great gain of godlines, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is ſufficient. We brought nothing into
this world, &amp; it is manifeſt, that we ſhal carie nothing hence
<pb facs="tcp:9092:17"/>
with vs. But hauing conuenient foode and apparell, let vs
content our ſelues therwith: for they that would become
rich, fall into the ſnares, and temptations of the deuil, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſundry hurtfull and vnprofitable deſires, which drowne
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ruine &amp; perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for that couetouſnes is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> roote of al e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill:
which diuers falling into, ſtray from the true fayth, and
are encombred with many eares and ſorowes. O wordes
worthy to pearce into the liuely heartes of men, and ſo there
to bée grounded and grauen, that with no earthly force, they
might euer bée raſed out.</p>
            <p>The diuine wordes of Paule being throughly conſidered
of, there is no cauſe wherefore poore men ſhould bée penſiue
or ſorowfull. But wherefore wade I farther in the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them; when as it is impoſſible for mée to ſay ſo much,
but that much more will remaine vnſpoken? And I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
I haue ſcarſly launched out from the ſhore, and am far
from being halfe entred from this moſt profound, and large
ſea. And yet, herewith I know aſſuredly, that the leaſt
part of that, which hath béene ſayd, is ſufficient for the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting of any mind, that is not become eyther
beaſtly, or furious with the prickings, or pinchings that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie
may bring vnto him: ſo that, if thoſe thinges, which
I haue ſayde, and many other that I could alledge, doe not
moderate and pacifie him, beléeue mée, pouertie is not the
cauſe héereof: but this diſtemperate, and ill compoſed mind,
which alſo would haue moleſted him, if hée had béene rich.
For hée would haue found out ſome other arrow, or ſworde
wherewith to haue thorowe pearced his heart. You then,
who haue your minde ſtored with ſo many good leſſons of
Philoſophy, comfort your ſelfe, and take all thinges that
God ſendes, in good part; hope in him, who neuer fayleth
nor deceaueth them, that put their truſt in him. Hée will
open you the way, and miniſter the meane, whereby to cure
theſe woundes of pouerrie; at the leaſt hée will teach you,
how to beare them with patience: and peraduenture alſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9092:17"/>
will giue you manifeſtly to vnderſtand that it is for your
health and conſolation. Comfort your ſelfe, in that although
yée want riches, yet want yée not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> true knowledge, &amp; bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of wit &amp; vnderſtanding, and vertues of the mind, which
things are more appertinent and proper vnto you, then are
riches; which are placed among the externall things, and
are no part of you; and ſo much the more comfort your ſelf,
by how much the giftes of your mind cannot bée taken from
you, neither by men, nor fortune; but of your riches and
worldly ſubſtaunce, théeues may ſpoyle you in a moment.
Comfort your ſelfe, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> yée haue many good friendes, which
loue you entyrely, who will neuer endure to ſée you long in
poore eſtate. But rather after the maner of true and ſtedfaſt
friendes, will account your pouertie to bée their owne, and
with ſome part of their ſubſtance, will take it from you:
comfort your ſelf, with your bookes, which yée were alwaies
accuſtomed to hold in great eſtimation; they will féede and
nouriſh your vnderſtanding, and with ſingular declectation,
alwayes recreate your ſenſes: they will pacifie euery ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
and troubleſome tempeſt; and both by night and by day;
within doores, and witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t; in good fortune and bad, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
your moſt faythfull friendes, and comfortable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
            <p>Finally, comfort your ſelfe, in that, if pouertie bée euill,
yet haue yée not this euill by your owne offence, or procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
not by dicing and carding, nor by haunting the tauern;
not by playing the harlot, nor by any other ſort of lewde lyfe,
or naughtie behauiour: but in euery action your vſage hath
béene honeſt, and temperate; your minde being no leſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with lawdable cuſtomes, and conditions, then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Yée are then fallen into this neceſſitie, by the offence
of Fortune, who (as it is not vnknowne to the moſt part of
<hi>Rome</hi>) being enuious at the good courſe that yée haue taken,
hath many yeares ſithence wounded your body, and brought
you into a miſerable &amp; daungerous eſtat, oftentimes euen to
<pb facs="tcp:9092:18"/>
death; hath alſo ſetled &amp; letted you back, from all good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
&amp; operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s both of body &amp; mind; &amp; in this her rage hath
cauſed you to make far greater expence, then your abilitie
will reach vnto; in ſuch ſort, that yée are now brought into
that miſerable eſtate, in which yée now are, onely by her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
procurement: ſo that if with her great outrage, there
were not ioyned an arrogant impudencie, ſhée would not for
very ſhame of her ſelfe bée ſéene any more in the world. But
beſides theſe conſolations, let reaſon &amp; neceſſitie moue you; ye
afflict your ſelfe; what doth this affliction auaile you? is your
pouertie taken away by making of ſo great ſorowe as yée do?
if it were ſo, it were a very good remedie. But, alas, ſhée
is not yet departed, but remaines as at the firſt, or rather
greater; and this vnceſſant ſorowing doth not onely profit,
but rather endomage you greatly. Adding to the firſt euil,
the moſt grieuous euill of affliction; whereof <hi>Plato</hi> in his
bookes of a Common wealth, ſaid moſt diuinely, That it
was the beſt thing that could bée in calamitie, to take it ſo
paciently &amp; to be contented therwith as wée poſſibly can: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
firſt it is vncertain, whether the thing, for which we lament,
be good or euill. Farther, the being ſorowfull, doth not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing remedie that which is happened: beſides that, no
humaine thing ſhould bée of ſuch eſtimation, that it ſhould
moue a man to dwell in anguiſh for it.</p>
            <p>What more? that griefe and ſorow are a hinderaunce to
thoſe remedies which might ſpéedily haue béene taken. Moſt
true and worthy are thoſe reaſons of <hi>Plato,</hi> which if they
were well wayed, and duely conſidered of, who is there that
euer would afflict himſelfe for any worldly calamite? True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch ſorowing is forbidden to all: but to the learned and
vertuous, much more: whereof <hi>Fauorinus</hi> ſaide moſt wiſely,
that a man of bold courage, trained vp in the golden precepts
of true Philoſophy, ſhould haue tranquillitie of minde, ſhut
vp and ſetled in his breſt, before any ill hap light vpon him:
which is no more to ſay, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a wiſe man ſhold haue a ſtrong
Armour in a readines, wherewith to defend himſelfe againſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9092:18"/>
euery ſtroke and aſſault of fortune. But what meane I to
go forwardes to ſpeake vainely as a Philoſopher, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
reaſoned with you as a Chriſtian? The largnes of the
matter doth cary mée away; and the great affection that I
beare you, doeth prick mée forward, neither can I well ſet
downe, which of theſe two are greater. Therfore, vnleſſe I
would alwayes ſpeake, it is néedeful that I make an ende of
ſpeaking. It was an eaſie thing, to enter into the déepe ſea
of this argument, but vneaſie to get forth. Wherfore I muſt
doe héere, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great did by <hi>Gordianus</hi> his knot,
who being vnable to vndoe it, did cut it in ſunder with his
ſword. Now although pouertie haue not all that dowries of
mée, which God and Nature hath endewed her with: yet
haue I beſtowed ſo many on her, that ſhe may euery way go
richely to her huſband. Yee ought not to feare of being any
more poore, ſhée bringing ſo wealthy a dowrie to your houſe:
neither néede yée to ſtand in doubt of hauing many riualles,
to contend for her, as <hi>Eurimacus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Antinous,</hi> with other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
did for <hi>Penelope,</hi> for that pouertie (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the
perſon of <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaies very well) amongſt other her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
hath this priuiledge: that ſhée prouoketh not men, to
brawle and fight, and to deceaue and ſéeke one an others
death for the hauing of her, as it often commeth to paſſe, for
the attaining of riches, honour or kingdomes: for although
ſhée be not lockt vp, nor garded, ſhée conſerues and kéepes
her ſelfe, and that which is moſt to be eſtéemed, ſhée is ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and chaſt, that none in the houſe where ſhée dwelleth,
will bée ielous of her. Sée then whether ſhée bée honeſt, or
deſerue to bée had in reputation, or no.</p>
            <p>But know yée not why ſhée remaies without a huſband?
It is not for want of any goodneſſe, or bewtie, being endued
plentifully with eyther of them: But becauſe euery one doth
ſtaine and defile her; euery one holdes her in contempt, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her with filthineſſe, and moſt ſpitefull pollutinges, in
ſuch ſorte, that her true and natiue bewtie cannot bée ſéene.
<pb facs="tcp:9092:19"/>
But if any man would louingly bring her to his houſe, and
purifie and waſh her, adorning her with her true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ornamentes, no doubt ſhée would appeare moſt gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and bewtifull: and it will then euidently bée ſéene, how
vile and contemptible riches are in compariſon of her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
almoſt, I cannot ende, and yet I will end. Fare yée
well: and repoſe your confidence in God, who is the true
and bountifull diſpenſer of all good thinges.</p>

Whervpon <hi>Socrates</hi> would not that any particular thing

he hath his eyes blinded &amp; darkened with the ſmoke of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and cloudes of couetouſneſſe, which are the two beaſts,
compared by the Poet <hi>Dante,</hi> to a Lion, and a ſhée woolfe,
which let &amp; hinder vs from leaping to the mount of felicity.
I deny not, but that riches &amp; dignity may helpe towards the
contentment of the minde. In this point I will bee a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetike,
and purpoſe not to defend as a Stoike, that onelie
vertue ſufficeth. Let it be ſo, that riches &amp; dignity are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
towards the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhment of felicity: ſhould it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue
no end? Behold <hi>Abdolomenus</hi> borne of the ſtocke royall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in paſſing tranquility, in a litle farme, tilled, and ſowed
with his owne hands, in ſuch ſort that he neuer heard of the
bruit and rumors of the armie of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, which
had driuen all <hi>Aſia</hi> into a maze and aſtoniſhment. He taſted
farre greater felicity in this his poore calling, then when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes
by <hi>Epheſtion</hi> he was aduanced to the title of the
kingdome. Of whom being demanded how he coulde with
pacience brooke that poore and abiect eſtate, with a hawty &amp;
coragious mind, anſwered him, ſaying; O that I knew ſo
wel (if it pleaſed God) how to ſupport the troubles, &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
of the kingdome. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> a moſt prudent and pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Emperor, hauing wayed and conſidered of the annoyes,
and encombrances that bearing rule, brought with it, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to a priuate life, gaue it ouer; and at <hi>Salon</hi> a manour
of his, he planted hearbes &amp; trées with his owne hands, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could he euer be allured by any perſuaſion, nor remoued
by any occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this his fixed &amp; determinat reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quiet tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quility of this priuat life, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
turmoyles of principalities, &amp; Empires. The like wee
reade of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperor <hi>Adria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> a moſt puiſant captayne, who by
great trauel &amp; interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, obtayned licence in the ende of his
dayes, to dwel in a litle village of his, where he liued 7. yéers
<pb facs="tcp:9092:21"/>
in great eaſe and quiet. Who dying, left an apparant teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
that the life led in honour and dignity, was not the
true life. For he cauſed theſe woordes to bee graued on his
toombe: <hi>Heere lies the wight whoſe age is of many yeeres,
but he liued but onely ſeuen.</hi> I coulde heere bring to your
memorie, with how many hatred and enimities the worldly
promotions are inuironed, ſo that nothing is ſure in them,
nothing without ſuſpect, in ſuch ſort that the Poet <hi>Pindarus</hi>
ſaid that the Gods with one good had alwayes entermixed
twoo euilles. And I dare boldely aduouch that in theſe
ſmokes, and vaine pompes, for euery one contentment, yée
are attached with ten diſpleaſures. But yée know wel that
this place being of the philoſophers moſt largely intreated of,
is of many men not vnderſtoode, of otherſome deſpiſed, of
very fewe beleeued, and almoſt of none followed. But for
the better manifeſting of both our intents) I wil come nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
vnto you. Be it ſo that riches and honour are full of
theſe felicities, that are commonly beleeued to bee in them,
by them that praiſe them, and holde them in reuerent admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
What of this? is it of neceſſitie that it muſt be good
for others alſo? The natures, inſtincts, deſires, and motions
are not equall and alike in all men: either by the influxion
of the ſtarres, or the varietie of temperaments, or diuerſitie
of educations, many thinges delight and recreate ſome one
minde, which woorke contrarie effectes in another: And for
thoſe thinges that <hi>Hirachtus</hi> wept bitterlie, <hi>Democrates</hi>
laughed ioyfully. Then is it not greatly to be woondred at,
if thoſe thinges which are comfortable, and nutritiue vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens mindes, ſéeme noyſome and bitter vnto me? How
many are there that abhorre wine, a moſt healthful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
liquor? and how many are there that cannot ſauour
roſes, being flowers moſt delectable? Ought theſe therefore
to be reprooued, and made to drinke wine, and ſmel roſes by
force? And why may I not ſay y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vnto you by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which <hi>Alexauder</hi> the great did to <hi>Parmenio</hi> by reaſon
of his fortune? Who propounding a condition of peace
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9092:21"/>
vnto <hi>Darius,</hi> and profering him a part of his kingdome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<hi>Parmenio</hi> his aduice and iudgement heerein. Who
anſwered, ſaying, if I were <hi>Alexander,</hi> I woulde doe it. So
woulde I, anſwered <hi>Alexander,</hi> if I were <hi>Parmenio.</hi> So
whereas in your letter yee ſay, if that you were my ſelfe, you
woulde doe it, and ſay it: I likewiſe reply and anſwere you
that I ſhoulde peraduenture both ſay it, and doe it, if I were
you. But as <hi>Alexander</hi> eſteemed it a diſcredit to his fortune
to conſent to ſuch a peace; ſo I account it inconuenient for
my diſpoſition, and nature, to enter, and encomber my ſelfe
with that care and bondage, which yee depaint out vnto me,
whiles ye allure me thervnto with the enticing baites of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and riches: yet I would ye ſhould vnderſtande, that I
haue not a minde ſo backewarde and dull, but that I take
comfort of thoſe things, that other men commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly delight in.
Let it be graunted, that it is good for me to be aduaunced to
riches and dignitie: doeth it follow that I ſhould be deſpiſed
or blamed, or diſpaire, and thinke the woorſe of my ſelfe, if
I reach not to that preferment, which might bee deſired, or
hoped for? What woonderings? what complaints are theſe
of yours? as though yée were ignorant, that many thinges
are deſired, that are not obtayned; much hoped for, that is
not inioyed; manie more run, then get the goale: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
farre greater are the number of them that ſhoot at a mark,
then thoſe which ſtrike it? May not all this happen of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of my fortune, which wil not permit or ſuffer me, to
be lifted vp from the ground or aduanced? if it be ſo, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault
mine? Of a truth diuers Aſtrologers, by the view of the day
of my natiuity, haue found out by theyr rules and obſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that moſt vnlucky condition, vnto which I am predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is to ſay, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual féeblenes &amp; baſenes of fortune; And
although I am <hi>Didimus</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they ſay, &amp; an heretike in theyr
ſcience (as I haue often told you here in Rome) neuertheles,
in this vnlucky forewarning I haue ouer wel knowen, and
found by experience, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they haue told me the troth. Yet wil I
not lay the blame hereof vpon fortune, as on a dumbe image
<pb facs="tcp:9092:22"/>
that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not anſwere to the accuſations that are brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her, let it be graunted that the chiefeſt parte of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
proceedinges, are directed by mans wiſedome, and
let him be (as the wiſeman affirmeth) the framer of his own
fortune. What ſhoulde I then doe? with what inſtruments
(I pray you) woulde you haue me to frame and faſhion this
my good happe? with remaining long in Rome, and looking
for occaſions? it is now twentie and fiue yeeres ſithence I
came firſt into this court, and I thinke that in this long ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
I was neuer three miles diſtant, and yet neither haue I
any good or fortunate ſucceſſe by my ſeruice, neither ſtande
in hope of anie. Yet haue I been a continuall waiter, &amp; was
neuer almoſt at libertie, wherof it greatly repenteth me: not
for that the ſeruice of noble men little liked me: but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iniquitie of fortune hath (by my lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g courting) brought
me into ſuch a miſerable ſeruitude and ſlauerie, that no good
reſolution of mind can enter into me. I haue heertofore done
too much, but I tel you that hereafter, neither will I, nor can
I, neither is it conuenient that I doe it, this is a practiſe for
yong men, &amp; not of old men, amongſt which number I nowe
reckon my ſelfe. Young men abound in leaſure, and trauell
ſeemeth not tedious vnto them, which wanteth in old men,
vnto whom euerie little diſcontentment is a torment. And as
gracious and ſéemely as it is to ſée a yong man attendant on
ſome noble man: ſo vnſéemely &amp; ridiculous is it, to ſée an olde
man.</p>
            <p>Truely the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g loſſe of time that is ſpent in courting, is to me
verie noyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and chiefly in that I ſtand there, as an image or
paynted table. And rather would I employ it eyther in reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
 w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds or in learning, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt my books, or in plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuring
or profiting others, by my ſtudies; &amp; this is a laudable
meanes, wherby to mount to thoſe degrées of dignitie that ye
propound vnto me. But alas, if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nature hath geuen me ſmal
wit, not ouer great memory, weake iudgement (&amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which
more gréeueth me) vnhealthfulnes of ſtomake; ſorenes of eies
&amp; euery other part of my body il affected, what can I doe here
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9092:22"/>
in? it might here vnto be added, that at this preſent I am
toſſed with ſuch ſundry miſhaps, that they neuer permit me
quietly to encline my mind to ſtudy. Wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſire onely is
left me, my forces being inſufficient any longer to vndertake
any ſuch trauell. Wherfore if I doe not and cannot ariue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this prayſe, let the torment and anoy (I pray you) that I
taſt and ſuffer in being depriued of that ſwéete conſolation,
which ſtudie bringes with it, ſuffice, without adding newe
griefes vnto me, of the priuation of my deſarts; what I knew
to doe, I haue done, no more coulde I doe.</p>
            <p>And I aſſure my ſelfe, that although for learning I can
challenge no commendation, yet am I not vnworthy of ſome
excuſe, in that I haue alwayes taken a ſingular delight, to ſée
theſe things in other, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I find wanting in my ſelfe; I haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
reuerenced, and as it were, adored them. Neither did I
euer account any more worthy of the titles of honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
then thoſe which haue lifted vp their vnderſtandings to
beautifull contemplations, through which theyr mindes are
repleniſhed with vertuous wiſedome. And I haue put ſuch
betwixt theſe men and others, as is betwixt the liuing, and
thinges paynted.</p>
            <p>But you wil peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me whether I meane it
of thoſe that are vertuous indéede, or of ſuch as counterfaite a
certayne outward hypocriticall ſhewe of vertue: doe not ſo
much as ſurmiſe it, I beſéech you, that I ſpeake it of the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
For my nature doeth deteſt nothing more then coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfayte
vertue, and rather would I make choyce to die, then
deceaue the worlde, in enforcing my ſelfe to be holden for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute,
when as I am neyther good, nor godly. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
for troth, that there are no men in this world more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
nor greater enemies to our ſauiour Chriſt, then are
ſuch hipocrites.</p>
            <p>But as touching true bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty indéed, I tel you for certaine, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
I think nothing more pertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, &amp; ſo far forth
I déeme it proper vnto him, that a man leauing it, &amp; geuing
<pb facs="tcp:9092:23"/>
himſelfe ouer to wickednes, is no more to be counted a man,
but that rather vnder his humane ſhape, hee carrieth the
minde of a bruite beaſt. Nowe it ſéemeth not vnto me that
bounty ſhould be vſed for the hope of reward, but rather for
the band of humanity, and loue and deſire to doe well. And it
ſhineth ſo much the brighter in any man, by how much he is
not led aſtray by any other ende, then goodneſſe it ſelfe. Of
which if any ſparkle be in me, eyther by nature, or election,
it is not to be maruelled at if it want the reward yée look for;
in that firſt, I know very well, that not onely by the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
humaine debility, but by that which is proper and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to my ſelfe, I finde it ſo ſlender in me, that of it ſelfe, it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
no light at all; Farther, I neuer directed it to the end to
receiue guerdon by it, being an excerciſe (in my opinion) farre
different from the neate and pure condition of being good. I
tel you truely that I haue and doe receaue a farre greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
then that yée deſire in me. For that litle which I féele
in my ſelfe, makes me taſt, how much the life of the good, is
more bleſſed then that of the wicked: How this aboundes in
ſwéetneſſe, tranquillity and conſolation; how that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpring
and fountaine of al feares, hatreds, debates, vexations &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels.
In ſuch ſort that when a man wil not, for Gods ſake do
the déedes of an honeſt man, &amp; good Chriſtian; yet me thinks
at the leaſtwiſe he ſhould doe it for the quiet &amp; comfort that
is taſted thereby in this worlde. But you will tell mee
that rewardes enſue vertue, as the ſhadowe followeth
the bodie.</p>
            <p>Nowe, as the body béeyng not made too the ende to bring
foorth the ſhadowe, neuertheleſſe bringeth it foorth: ſo
vertue is the cauſe that rewarde is obtayned, although
it be not ſought for, or vſed to that end.</p>
            <p>You would haue mée confeſſe it, &amp; I grant it alſo, that I am
not arriued, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mortification of my body, &amp; quickning
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, to that high degrée and ſpirituall vnion, with
which the olde diuine fathers, conioyned themſelues to God;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9092:23"/>
neither am I yet come to that chriſtian perfection, which
was required in the Hebrewe youngman. I haue not
ſolde that little which I haue, and giuen it to the poore:
neither haue I denied my ſelfe, nor taken Chriſt his croſſe
on my ſhoulders, and followed him. What more? that in
ſlacke obſeruing of the commaundements of Gods lawe, I
neither merit, nor haue deſerued the title of a perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;
for that many occurrences haue happened, which
haue cauſed mée to wander wide from theſe diuine obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>What farther? that (ſetting chriſtianitie aparte) I am
not (as a morall Philoſoper) arriued to that excellencie of
manners, which are fitting and conuenient for a purifyed
minde, as in times paſt was knowne to bée in <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> in
<hi>Socrates, in Phocion,</hi> and diuers others, with moſt apparant
examples of iuſtice, temperance, and fortitude, and other
rare and diuine vertues. But rather my doubt is, that
(as a man that is not gouerned by any learning, but lyueth
onely by the inſtinct of nature) I want greatly that, which
is requiſite for that eſtate: through which I know not how
to chalenge vnto my ſelf theſe prayſes, which my conſcience
telles mée I am vnworthy of. And finally, as of no part I
déeme my ſelfe praiſewoorthy: ſo, if there bée any thing in
mée, that doth not altogether deſerue praiſe, it is this: that
I haue had a care in what I might, not to iniurie others:
then I haue done mine endeuour (when occaſion hath béene
offred mée) to pleaſure and gratifie as many as I might,
being induced thereunto by Nature, perſwaded by precepts
of good writers, and confirmed therein by iudgement, which
hath imprinted a ſetled reſolution in my minde: and this I
account to bée the chiefe fountaine, from which al other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
(that maintaine humaine ſocietie amongſt vs) firſt flow
and procéede.</p>
            <p>Now, if thoſe vertues that are requiſite to the aduauncing
of mée to the degrées of riches and honour, be not in me: wil
ye meruaile if I be not aduaunced? And if there be any ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:9092:24"/>
in me, wherfore doe yée reprehend me? ought I, in not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thoſe degrées, to haue them; and deſeruing them, to bée
reprehended for not hauing them? If I deſerue them not, for
Gods ſake let mée liue with ſo many others my equalls,
ſubiect to the like fortune, and adde not the ſinne of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie,
to the want of deſart. For it is a fooliſh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
part for a man to aſpyre to thoſe degrées, of
which hée knowes him ſelfe vnworthy. But if it ſéeme vnto
you y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I haue deſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it had bene your part rather to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
mée, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reprehend me, &amp; ye might haue ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times
my betters haue beene depriued of the fruites of their deſart
and prayſe that they haue merited; and that it is much better
to deſerue an honour, then to haue it. For honour may bée
receaued by the will of him that giues it, vertue not being
the guide of it: But no man can deſerue it, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vertue muſt
firſt make a way to the deſart. Héerevnto the example
of <hi>Cato</hi> myght bée added, who would rather that it ſhould
bée demaunded, wherefore Images were not ſet vp to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
then why they were ſet vp.</p>
            <p>And if now it ſéeme ſtraunge vnto you, that more then

in the beſt part to enterprete ſuch accidentes, and héerein
imitate the example of <hi>Pedaretus,</hi> a valiant man with
the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who amongſt thrée hundred that bare office in
their Citie,, not being elected for one, ioyed greatly: who
being demaunded (of his friende <hi>Ephorus</hi>) the cauſe of his
gladneſſe, pleaſauntly aunſwered; what ſhould I doe, but
bée ioyfull, ſéeing that there are thrée hundred men in our
Citie, better then my ſelfe? ſo ſhoulde you reioyce of <hi>Rome</hi>
in hauing ſo many good men that excell mée. And ye ought
to wiſh, that not onely two hundred, but fiue hundred, a
thouſand; yea thrée thouſand men ſhould paſſe mée in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and wiſedome, and by conſequence, in fortune and
honour: through which I déeme it would come to paſſe, that
this our Realme ſhould bée much more floriſhing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
then now it is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:9092:24"/>
I doe not ſeeme to my ſelfe to bee ſuch a one, as ſhould
deſerue thoſe dignities that yee wiſhe mee: but bee it that I
had many of theſe partes, which you cal deſart in me, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
neither coulde I, nor ſhoulde I haue any of theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
but by fauour: in that I ſtande aſſured that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
from whence theſe preferments flowe, is beyonde and
aboue all our merites and deſartes. But in the ende, I
know you wil ſay, that beeing often conuerſant with them,
in requeſting, and beeing importunate, I might haue obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
riches, and dignitie, and that this is the meanes that
hath holpen, and doeth helpe a number dayly, and that it is
the very ſame whereof mention is made by Chriſte in his
Goſpel, when hee ſaith, Aſke, and it ſhall bee giuen you;
knocke, and it ſhalbe opened. What ſhal I anſwere heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto?
but that not deſeruing it, it ſeemeth an vnaduiſed part
of mée to craue rewarde, &amp; deſeruing it, mée thinks it ſhould
come without aſking. As I haue ſaide, ſo will I ſay, that
I knowe not whether I haue deſerued it or no.</p>
            <p>Now, if there bee any that thinkes mée worthy of any
thing, let him requeſt it for mée: but not by my commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
For if I knew that I deſerued it a thouſande
times, yet would I not bée ſo ſhameleſſe and impudent to
demaund it. For I haue not directed my operations to
that end, that I ſhould craue guerdon for them; beſides
that, it is not conuenient for a Gentleman ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>What farther? that it is a thing cleane repugnaunt to
my nature and diſpoſition, and in the crauing thereof I
ſhould bée ſo colde and timerous, that (as the Prouerbe
ſaieth) I ſhould teach others to denie mée. For I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnable to demaund any thing, without ſpéech of ſome
deſart of mine, how ſhall this be done without arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
when as I knowe none to bee in me? And if there
were any, could I ſpeake of it my ſelfe, without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9092:25"/>
To conclud, I think it neither good, profitable, nor honeſt for
me.</p>
            <p>Thus I pray you, iudge of me, that although I haue no
great ſubſtance of ſound vertue: yet want I not ſome little
ſhadow of decent modeſtie. Neither would I haue you
wiſh me to become a new <hi>Satibarſanes,</hi> with <hi>Araxzrxes,</hi> or

that it for theſe twentie and fiue yeares, I haue with a bold

I hope alſo with like fortitude to ouerpaſſe the
reſt of the time that God hath appoynted mée to liue in this
world: and ſhall (perhappes) taſt greater tranquillitie in
this my poore and meane calling, then a number of others
doe, with their riches and honour.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I know this your aduice to procéede of an
incredible affection that yée beare mée, but yet I purpoſe not
to put it in practiſe, nor followe it: but as <hi>Marius,</hi> when that

that the health of his legges was not ſuch, as that it ſhould

<hi>Spinella,</hi> a gallant and bewtifull mayden, but of a high,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9092:27"/>

nor to reprehend her, but ſuffered her in euery thing to doe,
what beſt pleaſed her fancie. Within a yéere after, <hi>Piſardus</hi>
was married to another daughter of the foreſaide Taylour,

            <p>
               <hi>Fiorella</hi> hearing theſe words of her huſband, without any

Holla, hoyſt, come aloft, and they ſhewed themſelues moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient

his maiſter to lay on him, not doing any thing of that hée
bad him, but that he kickt and ſpurnde at him, now with
one foot, now with both. <hi>Piſardus</hi> ſéeing his crabbedneſſe, with

<hi>Piſardus</hi> with a troubled countenance, anſweared, I let you
vnderſtand, that al they, which eate that is mine, and doe not

and with this riuer it was moated about. Herein with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of ſluces he made certayne litle pooles, whoſe depth hée
woulde encreaſe or diminiſh at his pleaſure. Into ſome, the
water entred the depth of a man; into ſome other, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it would
reach to his eyes; others, vnto the nauel, ſome to the middle, &amp;
ſome to the knées; &amp; vnto euery of theſe pooles, an yron chaine
was faſtened. Ouer the gate of this pallace was a title writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
which ſayd, A place, wherein to heale fooles. The fame of
this pallace, in ſhort ſpace, was ſpread abrode in moſt places
of the world, &amp; fooles repayred thither in great abundance, to
be cured, but (to ſpeake more néerer the troth) to bée waſhed.
The maiſter according to the greatnes of their follies, would
plundge them in theſe pits, and ſome of theſe he would heale
with whippings, ſome with watching, ſome with faſting, &amp;
other ſome by little &amp; litle he would reſtore to their former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,

On a time in a large court, without the gates of this pallace,
as certayne of the meaneſt ſort of theſe fooles, were ſporting
themſelues in the heate of the ſunne, it fortuned that a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner came
by, which carried a ſparhawk on his fiſt, hauing a
great number of Spaniels wayting on him. Who preſently
beyng eſpird by theſe fooles, they maruelled greatly what he
meant to ride with that birde and ſpaniels: and one of them
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9092:30"/>
demanded of him what bird it was that he carried on his fiſt?
He anſwered, a Sparhawke. And to what end (quoth he) doe
yée kéepe her? (quoth the Gentleman) ſhée is a birde gréedy at
her pray, and I keepe her to kill Partridge with, which is a
great bird, and delicate in taſt: theſe are called ſpaniels which
ſpring and retrine the birdes, &amp; this ſparhauke killeth them,
and I eate them. Quoth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe Doctors being thus attirde in clowniſh apparell,

            <p>Theſe Doctors of <hi>Bergamaſke</hi> remayning in theſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,

Doctors came ryding by with great pompe, who ſéeing theſe

            <p>The <hi>Florentines</hi> hearing this aunſwere; vnto them. O

from whence comes it, that you aunſwere vs in latine?
They of <hi>Bergamaſke</hi> replyed: <hi>Ne miremini, excellentiſſimi

            </p>
            <p>Riding on their iourney a good diſtaunce off, they ſaw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
clownes, which in the broad wayes clenſed diches: and
ſtaying, ſayde vnto them. Hoe companions, God ſpéede you:
to whome they aunſwered: <hi>Et Deus vobiſcum ſemper ſit.</hi>
How farre is it to <hi>Bergamaſke?</hi> ſaide the <hi>Florentines.</hi> The
other aunſwered, <hi>Exigua vobis reſtat via.</hi> And entring from
one worde to another, they beganne at length to reaſon in
Philoſophy, and theſe clownes of <hi>Bergamaſke</hi> framed their
arguments ſo ſtrongly and profoundly, that the <hi>Florentine</hi>
Doctors were ſcarſe able to aunſwere them. At which all of
them wondring, ſaide amongſt themſelues: How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that theſe clowniſh men, brought vp in digging of the
ground, and other ruſticall exerciſes, ſhould bée ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in humane ſciences? Departing from them, they
road towardes an inne, not farre diſtant from the Citie,
which was fayre and large. As they came ſomewhat néere
it, an Oſtler came forth to inuite them, ſaying: <hi>Domini,
libèt ne vobis hoſpitari? Hîc enim vobis erit bonum hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitium.</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:9092:32"/>
And for that the <hi>Florentines</hi> were very weary, they
alighted, and meant to ryde no farther that night. As they
were mounting vp the ſtayres to goe to their lodging, the
goodman of the Inne met them, ſaying: <hi>Excellentiſsimi Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,
placétne vobis, vt praeparetur coena? híc enim ſunt
bona vina, oua recentia, carnes, volatilia, &amp; alia huiuſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</hi>
Heereat the <hi>Florentines</hi> were amaſed, and knew not
what to ſay: for that all they, with whome they had ſpéech,
ſpake latine, and pronounced no otherwiſe, then if they had
béene brought vp in ſtudie all the dayes of their lyfe. Shortly
after a maide ſeruaunt, indéed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> came vnto them, which was
a young woman, both wittie and learned, and craftily
brought thither for the purpoſe, which ſayde. <hi>Indigéntne
dominationes veſtrae re aliqua? placét vt ſternentur lectuli, vt
requiem capiatis?</hi> Theſe wordes of the Maiden brought
greater aſtoniſhment to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who began to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
with her, who hauing anſwered to many thinges excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
well, (and all in latine) they queſtioned with her of
diuinitie, of which ſhée did argue ſo catholiquely, that there
was not any y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> heard her, but gaue her ſingular commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whiles the Maiden talked with them, there came one
in, arayde like a baker, his face blackt with coales: who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the diſputation that they had with the Maiden, began
to argue in her defence, and interpreted the holy ſcriptures
ſo learnedly, that al the <hi>Florentine</hi> doctors affirmed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt
themſelues, that they had ſeldome or neuer heard his better.
This d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſputation being finiſht, the <hi>Florentine</hi> Doctors we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to ſupper, and ſo to their reſt. And the next day approching,
they tooke counſell amongſt themſelues, whether it were
better to goe forwards, or returne home againe. After great
contention had about this matter, they reſolued, that it was
better to departe, thinking thus with themſelues, that if the
Inkéepers, labourers, hoſtlers, &amp; women had ſuch profound
learning: what was to bée looked for in the Citie, where are
moſt excellent men, which continually followe nothing els
but their bookes and ſtudie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9092:33"/>
This determination being well conſidered of, without any

vnderſtoode about a thrée foote diſtant The ſeruant thinking
himſelfe now too be apparauntly aduertiſed of his maiſters

went in the citie, would ſet one end therof againſt his breſt,
and holding the other towardes his maiſters ſhoulders, ſo
followed him. The Citizens, &amp; Prentiſes, ſeyng him to goe

laugh at him vnmeaſurably. The maiſter as yet not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the balde pate of his maiſter ſucking out his blood <hi>Fortuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
like a ſimple and ignoraunt ſette, tooke a weightie peſtle
of braſſe that by chaunce lay ſome what too néere him; and
lifting it vp with great force with inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to kil the fly, knockt
out the braines of his maiſter. He ſéeing his maiſter to bée
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aine in déede, and thinking that hée ſhould bée hangd for it,
determined to runne away, and ſaue himſelfe by flight:
<pb facs="tcp:9092:35"/>
But altering this his purpoſe, hée thought it better to burie
him in ſome ſecrete place, and putting him into a ſacke, did
ſo. And then taking a great hée Goat of his maiſters, flong
him into a well, that ſtoode néere the Orchard where he ſlept.
The goodman not comming in at night, as hée was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
began to thinke euill of the ſeruaunt, and demanding
of him for her huſband, hée made anſwere, that hée ſaw him
not.</p>
            <p>Then the good wife being very ſorowfull, beganne to
wéepe bitterly, and with a ſkriking voyce, called her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but all in vaine. Her parents and kinſfolkes ſéeing
that the good man could not bée found, went to the Mayor of
the Citie, and there accuſed <hi>Fortunius</hi> the feruaunt, ſaying,
that hée ſhould bée committed to priſon, and ſo to be had on
the racke, there to bée made to confeſſe, what was become of
his maiſter.</p>
            <p>The Mayor preſently cauſed him to bée taken, and bound,
and vpon preſumptions committed him to the racke. The
ſeruaunt not being able to abyde the torment thereof, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to manifeſt the whole: ſo that hée myght bée let downe,
and being taken downe, and had before the Mayor, with a
craftie diſceate, hée ſayde, as foloweth.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday, as I was aſléepe in the orcharde, and ſodenly
a great noyſe awaked mée, which ſéemed, as though ſome
great ſtone had falne into the well. I being aſtouied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
ranne ſodeinly thither, and looking into the water, ſaw
it quiet and ſtill, ſo that I ſought no farther: whiles I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
I heard an other lyke noyſe, &amp; I ſtayde. And I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinke it was my maiſter, who being about to draw ſome
water, fell into the well. But for that the troath may bée
knowne of the matter, let vs al go thither, and I wil diſcend
into the well to ſée whether that it bée true or no, which I
gather by preſumptions.</p>
            <p>The Mayor deſirors to make proof of the troth hereof, called
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9092:35"/>
all his brethren with him, and with diuers other Gentlemen
came to the well. And with them went a great company of
the common ſort of people, both men and women, being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to ſée the iſſue of this matter. And behold as the wicked
fellow by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the Maior deſcended into the
well, &amp; ſought for his maiſter in the water, he found the goate
which he had before throwne therinto, and ther with cried out
to his miſtreſſe, (which was amongeſt the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
ſaying, hoe, miſtres; tel me, had your huſband any hornes?
I haue found one here in this well, which hath a payre both
greate and long, was hee euer your huſband? ſhe being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
with theſe ſpéeches, ſaid neuer a words. The Maior
with all the reſt of the company ſtoode ſtill, beeyng very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to ſée the dead body, which being drawen vp, when they
perceaued that it was a Goate, they made ſuch excéeding ioy,
that they were like to breake inſunder with laughter. And
the Maior ſeing the chance, adiudged the ſeruant to be truſty,
and releaſed him as innocent, and it was neuer known what
became of his maiſter; and the good wife with the ſcorne of the
horne, remayned defamed euer after.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Cknowledging my ſelfe deepely
indebted to your woorſhippe for
your profeſſed curteſies, &amp; good
opinion conceaued of me, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
by ſome one meanes or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make manifeſt my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
minde, I haue aduentured the
dedication of this trifling toy, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your protection, notdoubting
of your fauourable acceptance, in
that I beſtow it as an earneſt pennie of my wel meaning, and
teſtimonie of the vnfaigned goodwil that I beare you. The
thing that I here preſent you with, is a poſie of <hi>Gillowflowers</hi>
collected out of the garden of mine owne inuentions. Which
if they ſhal come too ſhort in ſhew and colour, or proue infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
in ſent and odour to that which is to be looked for of
ſo fragrant a flower, let the Gardiner (I pray you) be excuſed,
who hath done his goodwill and indeuour in the ſowing, &amp;
ſetting of them, and lay the fault in the barrenneſſe of the
ſoyle, wherein they were planted: which had it byn better,
their vertue would haue proued to be greater. Though al the
flowers herein contayned, carie one name, yet eche of thé
differs from other, both in colour and ſauour, the better
to ſatiſfie the diuerſitie of eyes that ſhall view them, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of noſes that ſhall ſmell them. Nowe if the ſpider ſhall
happen to ſucke any poyſon out of them, let not the flowers
be the worſe thought of, but conſider that it is his propertie
to doe the like, out of the moſt pure and delectable flowers,
that euer were. And God in geuing vnto her and other ſuch
like creatures this nature, doeth no leſſe manifeſt his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb facs="tcp:9092:37"/>
power herein, then in his other wonderful works. For
reaſon telleth, &amp; experience teacheth, that in this vale of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
there is nothing ſo beautifull, but that it hath ſome ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh;
nor ſo pure, but that it ſauours of ſome imperfection:
ſo that as long as the world is a world, corruption muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
amongſt vs. Which filthy dregs &amp; poyſoned humors, if
they were not in parte drawen &amp; drayned away by the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
beaſtes and wormes of the earth, they woulde a
great deale more annoy vs, then now they doe. And it is to
be doubted whether life could any long time be conſerued a
mogſt vs. I might here take occaſion to liken the crew of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
carpers (which more of malice then good meaning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to cauel at other mens doings, playing the ydle
drones themſelues) to the venomous beaſtes &amp; wormes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſpoken of: Whom for their congruity in condition, and
affinity in diſpoſition I might bring them within the compas
of one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, &amp; conclude that both the one &amp; the other
are neceſſary euils. But leſte that the old prouerb be obiected
agaynſt me, <hi>Ne ſutor vltra crepitam,</hi> let the Gardiner meddle
no farther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſpade, I wil leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to theyr predeceſſor
<hi>Zoilus</hi> (whoſe apes they are in imitating his conditions) &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
agayne to my <hi>Gillowflowers,</hi> eft foones beſeeching your
worſhip to accept thoſe that I preſent you with no leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
then the Gardiner doth offer them willingly, wherof
he doubtes not, calling to minde your accuſtomed curteſie.
In one thing I haue vſed ſuche circumſpection as my ſimple
ſkill, would permit me, which is that the beauty of my flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
be not blemiſhed with the weedes of wantonneſſe, that
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly grow in ſuch gardens. I hope therfore, ye ſhal finde
them rooted out in ſuch ſort, that if there remayne any, my
truſt is they ſhall not fall out, to be many. The onely thing
that I doubt of this in my dedication, is that your worſhipp
ſhall haue cauſe to account mee a deepe diſſembler and one
that hath byn more lauiſh in promiſe, then he is able to pay
with performance. For whereas by my former ſpeeches, yee
might peraduenture looke for ſome delicate <hi>Gillowflowers,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:9092:37"/>
it will fall out to be but a coppy of my countenance, hauing
done nothing els, but (as the faſhion of the worlde is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes)
ſet a good face on a bad matter. For (to deale plainly
with you) I was neuer Gardiner in all my life. And the thing
that I here preſent you with, is but a collection of ſuch verſes
and odde deuiſes as haue (at ſuch idle howres as I founde in
my maiſter his ſeruice) vpon ſundry occaſions by me byn co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
The one I confeſſe farre vnworthy your view, and yet
ſuch as when ye ſhal returne home weeried from your fielde
ſportes, may yeelde you ſome recreation. The chiefe marke
that I leuel at is, the continuance of your woorſhips curteſie
and good minde towardes me, which as they haue already
ſurmounted the reach of my deſerts, ſo if I might enioy the
fruition of them hereafter, in that fulneſſe which I hope for,
I ſhall account all the duetifull endeuour that I can poſſibly
ſhew you inſufficient, for the ſatisfaction of the leaſt part of
them. Thus for feare of being tedious, I ende, wiſhing your
worſhip, with my good miſtres your wife &amp; all yours many
yeeres of proſperitie, with dayly increaſe of worſhip, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

            <head type="sub">The Preface to a Treatiſe enſuing,
compyled by the Authour, vpon a theme giuen
by his approued friend and kinſman
Maiſter A. D.</head>
            <p>I Haue, according to my promiſe, though ſlenderly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled
this ſimple diſcourſe on the theme that yee gaue
me, which was your Farwel to the court: which although
it be nothing ſo well handled, as by ſome experienced
courtier it might haue beene done: neuertheleſſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſidered, that my education hath beene ſo far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the court, that I neuer ſawe the faſhions of the
court, I hope that the priuiledge of a pardon may bee
purchaſed for my excuſe in this behalfe. I haue heerein
introduced Witte and Wil as two domeſtical counſellers,
alwayes attendant on a man marching in this vale of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie:
The one giuing him truſtie and wholſome admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
how hee ſhould here direct his life to the glory of
God, and his ſoules health: The other with the flattering
alluremets of the ſinfull fleſh, enticeth him to the purſutes
of the pleaſures of this worlde, in the end drouning him
in the puddle of al abhomination, to the vtter confuſion
both of body and ſoule. Vnder the perſon of Wit is prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
a man, hauing a certaine carefull regarde of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which is once in a mans life inſtilled into the harts of
thoſe, whome God hath ſealed vp vnto ſaluation, and
cauſeth them cleane to caſt away the vile and vaine vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that the wicked world accounteth as precious, and
addict all their doings towards the attainement of lyfe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9092:72"/>
euerlaſting. Vnder the perſon of Wil, is picturde out, how
a man letting flippe the bridle of his affections, is caryed
from the precious paths of perfect felicitie, to the ineui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
daungers of drowning <hi>Caribdis:</hi> and ſo paſſing the
ſea of this world, not ſtopping his eares with the waxe of
vnderſtanding, the voluptuous pleaſures thereof, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<hi>Sirens,</hi> entice him to the folowing of them, whome
they preſently drown in ſuch delights, that he hath neuer
farther regarde to the preſeruing of his ſoule, but imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the nature of bruite beaſtes, addicteth himſelfe onely
vnto that, which his owne ſenſuall appetite ſhal allowe to
be good. Although this may, peraduenture ſeeme vnto
you, a too far fetched circumſtance, little or nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the purpoſe: yet my hope is, that when yee
haue throughly peruſed it, yee ſhall not finde the theme
that ye gaue me, left altogether vntouched. The beſt is, I
know your thankfull diſpoſition to be ſuch, that how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
it be, being willingly offered, it ſhal not of you be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
accepted. Thus referring the view heereof to
your diſcret conſideration, I wiſhe you and yours abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ſuch proſperitie, as your heart deſireth.</p>
