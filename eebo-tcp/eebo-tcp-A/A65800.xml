            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
AUTHOR
TO THE JUDICIOUS
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Suppose you have perus'd the Book I
here pretend to Answer; And, how do
you like it? has he done his work? I dare
not say, <hi>demonstrated,</hi> for sure he will
not offer at what he thinks impossible; but
has he <hi>prov'd,</hi> which is a modest word,
and he must not be offended at it? has he
solidly prov'd, That <hi>the position he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains
is a Truth traditionarily deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from the Apostles to us as a
<pb facs="tcp:99049:3"/>
point of Catholick Faith?</hi> Or, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>It is Defin'd either in the Bull
or Council?</hi> if he had done this, I should
heartily rejoyce in his Victory, though over
my self: But if, as to the first branch,
he have onely prov'd it the common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of later Ages; and that, without
clearing in what quality it is held, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as Faith or Opinion, even by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns:
If, instead of the Consent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
he bring but One, above Exception,
and out of that One, the first and chief te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
is indifferent both to him and me,
and the onely difficulty of the rest objected
and answer'd by my self, and unreply'd to
by him: If, of the three passages he cites
out of the publick Liturgyes, one onely
bear any shew of difficulty; the other two
being either plainly neutral or grosly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd:
And, if in the second branch, he
have onely prov'd that it was <hi>suppos'd,</hi>
or, as their Title-page warily calls it,
<hi>Contain'd</hi> in the Bull and Council, and
not <hi>Determin'd,</hi> I cannot see my case
so desperate as he imagins. Scripture it
<pb facs="tcp:99049:3"/>
self oftentimes proceeding upon Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
conformable to the fore-entertain'd
apprehensions of those it speaks to, without
engaging that every such supposition is a
reveal'd Truth. But, on the other side, if
I have plentifully alledg'd both Scriptures
and Fathers, and Liturgyes, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
too (of which me thinks a little does
well even among Divines) and to none of
these has he given the least satisfactory
answer; I cannot see but my case is
hopefull; and when you have read this
little Treatise, I cannot doubt but you
will see it so too.</p>
            <p>But all this engages onely a <hi>particular</hi>
Controversy, the next is of a far more high
and universal importance, of a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
strain from other single and ordinary
Questions. For in this, we agree that
what the Church sayes is the truth; we
agree in the words wherein the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
us that truth, our onely dispute is
about the sence of those words; or rather
what ought to be the means to come to the
knowledge of that sence. We find by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:99049:4"/>
experience the same Creed recited in the
mouths of children, of men, and of the
learned: We cannot doubt but the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of children and men are different,
and that our young thoughts are to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by Age; but whether the Learned
and the Prudential make the same appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
is the great Controversy between
us. My Antagonist seeing the largest
part of the Church consist of this degree of
Prudential men, perswades himself, that
not only their Belief, but their very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
are uncontrollable and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable:
I conceive, God has given that
priviledg to Learning, to make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the truth of our Faith better, then by
vulgar and popular conceptions. On
my side stand the endeavours of the
whole Schools, whose direct Profession it
is, to explicate and declare the true sence
of Scripture, and the words in which Faith
is left us. On his side stands the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the common People, whose fancyes
are not elevated, nor their judgments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
by Study: this Multitude he loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:99049:4"/>
calls <hi>the Church, All Christianity,</hi>
and such brave names: but be not asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
at his great words, for he distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
not between the Church, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part of it which he follows; nor offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at me that I observe not a grave and
regular Progresse, where I am set to catch
a bird that hops up and down from twig
to twig, chirps upon this a little, and then
flyes immediately to another; but rather
pity the condition of an old clumsy man too
slow and heavy for so wild a Chace.
Wherein, yet, by the help of God, I am
resolv'd to follow him, as fast as I can.
As the whole Book in a manner is made
up of little else but <hi>boutades</hi> and flashes,
so you are onely to expect from me short
hints of what might be said more dilated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which I hope may suffice to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blast
those sudden gusts. If any other,
as is threatend, come out with stronger
Ordnance, I shall endeavour to oppose
stronger Bulwarks. I hope he will write
hereafter more closely and with less di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper;
especially, since now, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<pb facs="tcp:99049:5"/>
he intends to read my Books; I
would he had done so before he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
against them; for then I might have
hop'd a few hours would have suffic'd to
make my Answer, which now has cost me
all my spare time of a whole fortnight.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAD your Answer to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Author been written in
my fresher dayes, I should have
endeavour'd to have given you an ampler
satisfaction: Now, being come forth in my
frozen Age, when my long ague hath made
me fitter to think of death than of School-quarrels,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99049:10"/>
I hope you will be patient with
me, if, in as short a method as I can, I
give you rather hints by which a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of your own may find out satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
than dilate my self so far that
every weak eye may see it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctor Hammond,</hi> as I am told,
about the same time hath bent himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my Doctrine: whom, though I much
esteem, being assured by friends common to
us both that he is a very courteous and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
person, and hath spent much time in
reading good Authors; yet have I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preferd the answering you; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I expect better quarter at your
hands, since the stricter bond of Religion
should make us apt to interpret one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more fairly; as also, and indeed far
more (for I see that Tye very slippery in
many) because you have some tincture of
the School; and, to my thinking, are much
sharper and abler to set off an argument,
and write a style solid and proper to the
matter: Whereas, that loose way of
preaching and affecttaion of words the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99049:10"/>
Doctor uses, shews more vanity than sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in his Discourses. Besides he has an
Adversary from satisfying whom he seems
to me very short; and I am gladly willing
to excuse my pains when I see the same or
more fruit come from anothers Pen.</p>
            <p>Returning then to you, I hold it my
first duty to give yon many thanks for your
work; you being the first, who (though
somewhat late for me, now scarce able to
keep my self warm by a fire) have given me
the occasion to speak for my self, that the
world may see whether those many smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
slanders, which so long have layen
heavy on me and my works, bear a value
proportionable to the noyse they have made.
Which to examin in short, I divide your
Treatise (and so, my Reply) into two
Parts; the first holding twenty two of
your Sections, and belonging chiefly to the
<hi>Middle State of Souls:</hi> the second, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the rest of your Sections, touching
upon many points of my Doctrin in which
you find fault.</p>

Section, I confess you speak
very fairly, had your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
but held out, not to
have broke your word in
that very Section: which I intend present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99049:11"/>
to declare, if first I desire you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how you take principles out of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
mouths. The Nobleman out of
whom you cite the Maxim that <hi>writing of
Controversies ought to carry as much sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as Love-letters,</hi> was a very ingenious
and worthy Person; but, if you enquire
of his Religion you shall find it in <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi>
book, in which he is thought to
have had a great hand. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi>
Religion how sound it was you may
ghess out of the answers made by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to himself which go before his book. In
one whereof he candidly professes, that if to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow
he sees more reason for another
Religion, and next day for a third, he will
change his Religion as often.</p>
               <p>Now, who can doubt but he that has his
Religion tackt on him with such slight
pins that he may change it <hi>a la mode,</hi> has
reason neither to take offence nor give any
upon that account, but civilly to proceed
with a gentile and unengag'd indifferency
as in a business that concerns him not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be angry about: And, if you
have such an esteem of your Religion, you
shall do very well to follow that Maxim:
But, if you conceit writing in Religion to
be one of the most efficacious courses to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99049:12"/>
breed an eternall and incomparable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to the readers, if it be so handled that
he may think both sides (as men call it)
<hi>probable,</hi> and that it sinks into neithers
heart, then I beleeve your pen will prove
sharp and stinging, as wee see the Fathers
is in such occasions; though some milk and
honey towards the Persons bee mingled for
Charity and Edifications sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now let me perform my promise. You
say you</hi> cannot digest their boldnes who usurp
the Authority of the supreme tribunal to
brand any opinion with the title of Heresy
whilest the Church has not done it to their
hands. <hi>Yet presently after you do it your
self, branding this opinion of Purgatory as</hi>
Hereticall, <hi>and bringing your Evidence
that you</hi> are convinc't it is condemned.</p>
               <p>And, I pray, who off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s to <hi>censure</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
but he takes himself to bee <hi>convinc't</hi>
that it is against some Rule which he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
sufficient to make a Catholick Truth;
as, against Scripture, Councils, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the Fathers, or (as you do) against
the Definition of a Pope; and this to him
is a Conviction that it is <hi>Condemned</hi> before
he censures it. Nor have you any more to
build on than your own Perswasion that it
is defin'd; your self professing that <hi>the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99049:12"/>
Question is brought to those niceties that one
need have his Vnderstanding perfectly calm
to judge of it.</hi> So that, on your <hi>perfectly
calm judgment</hi> entirely relies this your
<hi>censure.</hi> Thus much to your self: But, as
to the universall proposition of censuring
opinions, you seem a great stranger in the
world. For, what famous Divine, what Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
what Bishop is not thought fit to
censure a malignant proposition? Is there
not regularly in all Dioceses some <hi>Censor
Librorum</hi> expresly appointed? Is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Preacher subject to be forbidden the
Chair if he advance a proposition that the
Bishops Theologall thinks not fit to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd?
Are you ignorant of the pudder
at <hi>Paris</hi> about censuring <hi>Monsieur Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naulds</hi>
letters, which censure was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
at <hi>Rome?</hi> And yet you <hi>cannot digest
their boldness who usurp the Authority of
the supreme Tribunal to brand any opinion
with the title of Heresy while the Church has
not done it to their hands.</hi> Know, great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
that the Pastor or Doctor who lets a
wicked proposition run uncontroll'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people till means bee made to get

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d and forbidden in <hi>Rome</hi> (which
how hard it is if the maintainer have great
Friends may appear by the long contest
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99049:13"/>
betwixt the order of <hi>Saint Dominick</hi> and
the <hi>Jesuits</hi> about certain propositions of
<hi>Molina)</hi> wrongs his own conscience and is
unfaithfull to his vocation, in suffering the
infection to sink deeply into the hearts of
the Faithfull ere he prepare an Antidote.
Besides, when would the Pope take notice
of what is publisht in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>England</hi> if
no body cry <hi>Fire?</hi> How many, how vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
out-cryes were there in <hi>France</hi> before
the <hi>Jesuits</hi> wicked cases were condemn'd
at <hi>Rome.</hi> So that this principle of yours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes
the Church into the hands of any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Heresy that shall spring in a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Let me therefore intreat you not to
use so uncivill terms towards all the learned
Doctors of the Church.</p>
               <p>I hope you will not be offended that I
omit to answer some small-shot of yours
in this Section, that I may pass to the next;
in which I find my self taxed of a wrong
Method in seeking Truth, out of a story
which as I do not particularly remember,
so am I far from denying; for the Method
you report, as I understand you, is truly
mine; that is, as a Divine, to <hi>find out the
Truths in Philosophy, and then the Mysteries
of our Faith will square well enough with
them;</hi> and so I doubt not but I have been
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99049:13"/>
subject to declare it many times. Nor can
I conjecture who it was that gave mee the
Answer you mention, but shrewdly ghess
that he either did not understand mee, or
the matter, or both. And, because by your
proceeding I fear you are in the same Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
I will endeavour to explicate my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
and leave the judgment of the cause
to upright Understanders. My conceit of
matters of Faith is that the Scriptures and
Creeds and sometimes also our Doctors
deliver them in <hi>words</hi> well known, but
whose <hi>vulgar sence</hi> Divines see impossible
to bee true. For example, where it is sung
that <hi>the Eternall son descended from heaven,</hi>
the vulgar conceive a locall motion by
which he came down into the B. Virgins
womb: and, as I remember I saw it painted
thus at <hi>Frank ford</hi> in a Catholick Church
whither I went to Mass: The Holy Ghost
above coming towards the Virgin, and
sending rayes before it, in which was a little
child carry'd by them towards that Blessed
Mother: An apprehension which the
learned know to bee impossible. So, by
our expression of <hi>Christ's sitting at the right
hand of his father,</hi> what doth a vulgar hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
imagin but an old man sitting in an high
chair, and his young Son in another, set
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99049:14"/>
at his right hand. I cannot believe you
think it possible this meaning should be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
true. To find out then the true sense,
I conceive Philosophy a fitting instrument;
So that by Philosophy we come thus to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi>
our Faith, and by understanding it,
to be able both to defend it and propagate
science out of it. A certain sort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
(if I wrong them not in calling them
so) there is, who, conceiting as soon as they
have the <hi>words</hi> they know the <hi>meaning,</hi>
reckon not upon this way; but cast about
to find out more and other words that
shall lead them to the defence and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the known truths; and think they
must not look what Philosophy sayes, but
teach her what she ought to say. This I
conceive to have been the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and the eminent Schollar that
conferr'd with me.</p>
               <p>When I had read thus far, I expected to
see the other Method strongly maintain'd,
&amp; mine as strongly laid flat on the ground;
but, looking farther I onely find your own
<hi>censure,</hi> and that such a one as is hard to
judge whether it be a dispraise or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
But, whatsoever it is, with
mistake or addition. From which last to
begin, you suppose I intend out of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99049:14"/>
to frame a Divinity; and, if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
you right, <hi>independently from Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi>
which I am sure you can find nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in my words nor my writings; but
onely that revealed propositions were to
be explicated by Philosophical ones known
without Revelation. Do you make no
difference between inventing Divinity-truths
and finding out the Meanings of the
Words in which they are deliver'd? Do
not Lawyers dispute the meaning of the
Laws after they see the Words ly before
them? Do Scripturists invent Scriptures
when they seek out the sence hidden in
those writings? I pray then take notice
that you either add to or mistake what I
say; for, how often do I expresly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
those Mysteries could not be known
without Revelation; though, after they
are revealed, they may by nature be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and new truths propagated out of
them. You seem to be sore afraid that my
Method should bring forth <hi>a naturall and
new Divinity.</hi> Had you said <hi>a connaturall</hi>
one, I could not have desir'd a greater
praise at your hands; for so all supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Qualities, at least the good ones, are
term'd by Divines. But you say <hi>a naturall
one:</hi> what mean you by this term? That
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99049:15"/>
it shall be one never reveal'd by God, and
yet exprest by the very words in which
God reveal'd his? Truly, if this be your
meaning, I am beholding to you for a
great honour and commendation. But I
must tell you I suspect you understand not
well your own proposition. For, if it be
true that the Holy Ghost means in his
words all true senses which they afford,
there is no denying but such a Divinity will
be a <hi>revealed</hi> one, however it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by naturall Principles; For, you will
not deny but the same object sometimes
may be knowable both by Faith and by
Philosophy. If the Divinity you mean be
false, it is either against the other which
you say is <hi>revealed,</hi> or against naturall
Principles: This latter you cannot press
while you grant it is a <hi>naturall</hi> one, that
is, according to naturall Principles. The
former leaves still this quarrell undecided
which is the true Divinity, since the words
bear both the senses; and, this, by your
own plea, hath the advantage of conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to nature, as indeed any true Divinity
must have. Besides, the <hi>novelty</hi> you fear,
supposing it contradict no truth already
known, is a great praise; for to discover
new Truths especially in Divinity, and such
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99049:15"/>
as are of moment, is to advance and give a
Progress to that sacred Science, and so the
highest pitch a Divine can aym at.</p>
               <p>Thus much being spoken to your <hi>fearfull</hi>
thoughts, let me consider the two sayings,
that of your <hi>eminent Schollar,</hi> and mine
own. I desir'd to be <hi>assured of naturall
Truths,</hi> and said (as your self report) that
<hi>the mysteries of Faith would square well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with them.</hi> And I appeal to your
self whether I spoke Truth or no. If I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
not your Person you have been a
Reader of Philosophy, and so cannot be
ignorant that <hi>ex veris non sequitur falsum,</hi>
and that <hi>Verum vero minime contradicit.</hi>
If then we have once certainly found the
Truths of Philosophy, can there be any
danger that what we have so found should
contradict our Mysteries? Much help may
proceed out of such Principles, much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
no harm, no danger of erring.
So that I doubt not but your self, if you
consider it, will find this resolution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
secure.</p>
               <p>Now let us turn the leaf and examin
the course of <hi>your eminent Schollar;</hi> and
you may easily descry how he commands
us to take <hi>unkonwn</hi> Principles to prove
Truths which may be known by other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99049:16"/>
plain wayes. Do not mistake me, I call not
the Principles of Faith <hi>unknown</hi> as <hi>not</hi>
being <hi>demonstrated,</hi> but as <hi>not</hi> being <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</hi>
I grant the Letter to be certain and
certainly known, I grant a <hi>quaedam tenus</hi> of
the sence to be known; but the sence which
in rigour is literally verifiable, that I do
not grant to be alwayes and entirely
known out of the pure force of Faith. Your
self will easily apply this Doctrin to the
Article of our Saviours <hi>sitting at the right
hand of his Father.</hi> It is certainly known
those words are true; it is certainly known
the materiall sence which the vulgar takes
has a proportion to the true sence: For,
the true sence being that he arrived to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Quiet after the troublesome oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
he had passed in this world, which Rest
hath <hi>sitting</hi> for its concomitant in an active
man; That he remain'd the first and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Instrument, and in the French phrase,
<hi>le premier Ministre d' Estat</hi> in Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World; to which dignity
is annext a kind of perpetuall presence and
conference with the Prince: Now, why
this is well exprest by <hi>being on the right
hand</hi> of another, may we not consult some
other skill than that of Faith? Wherefore,
in such cases as these I cannot doubt to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99049:16"/>
affirm that true Philosophy is both an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and necessary and alwayes obedient
servant of Faith. And let your <hi>eminent
Schollar</hi> without the assistance of any other
knowledge than the bare words of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
attempt to determin out of them
what <hi>sitting,</hi> and what <hi>on the right hand</hi> is,
and this according to the way and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a Divine, I fear he will come out
with some such notion as others of his

Vbi's, Actio's, &amp;c.</hi> that is, some strange
puzzlling thing, which not onely leaves
us altogether ignorant what it is in God,
but wholly confounds the knowledge we
have of it in Nature.</p>
               <p>Neither do I deliver this purely by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
but by Experience; which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
joyntly with my reading <hi>S. Thomas</hi>
were the Instruments by which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
mee to this way. I thought it fit to
dilated my self a little in this point, that you
who are in your flourishing age, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to be a great Light in Gods Church, if
you be put in the right way, may be little
and little mark the difference of them who
go under the common name of Divines,
and see how many such as you esteem <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Schollars</hi> are onely <hi>Historicall,</hi> not <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entificall</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:99049:17"/>
Divines: They can tell you after
the manner of an history or Narrative what
the most celebrated Doctors teach; what is
in their opinion the more common sentence
of Schoolmen; and, the multitude or
reputed worth of such Doctors is the scale
in which they weigh Theologicall truths;
though they read even in those very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
that their Authority is of no more
value than the proofs they bring. Now, if
Divinity be a <hi>Science,</hi> as I am sure you will
not deny, it being voiced so by those very
Divines, though sleightly executed, there
must of necessity be, or be possible a sort of
Divines who in true speaking <hi>know</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
Truths, who therefore will properly
and with Justice claim the title of <hi>Divines,</hi>
whereas these others wil be but Discoursers
in Theologicall Subjects. If an old mans
Experience may prevaile with you, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
you to study <hi>true divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Looking into your third Section, at the
very door I met with a scruple which I must
endeavour to remove. You say, <hi>The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of our Supreme Pastor hath interposed
his sharp but justly deserved Censures against
diverse of my books.</hi> I confess it is gravely
spoken; but I find not any sence within
to maintain so peremptory an outside.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99049:17"/>
I pray which of your <hi>eminent Scholars</hi>
teach that the <hi>prohibition</hi> of a book is a <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
The holy Bible if printed I do not
say in a vulgar language, but even in an
Heretical Country, especially by an Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
is <hi>prohibited;</hi> and your way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which makes a <hi>prohibition</hi> a <hi>Censure,</hi> I
and a <hi>sharp</hi> one too, would make us beleeve
that the Bible, that is, <hi>Gods word</hi> is <hi>sharply
censured</hi> by the Pope. Can you imagin a
greater scandal, considering the place where
you live? In <hi>Luthers</hi> time there was a
Decree that whatever Book was printed
by any book seller who had printed any of
<hi>Luthers</hi> works should be prohibited. Read
the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> in the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and see how farr wide
you have stray'd from the Catholike pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and opinion.</p>
               <p>As for the special prohibition against my
book, though Doctor <hi>Holden</hi> hath learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared the quality of it and that be
sufficient, yet I have these two notes to
offer you; one, that I am now fortify'd
in my plea (which hitherto has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
as a meer shift to cover my disaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
that a simple Condemnation of a Book
at <hi>Rome,</hi> without singling out any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
proposition, leaves the whole <hi>Doctrin</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:99049:18"/>
of the Book untouch't. I am confirm'd, I
say, now by a fresh Authority out of <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brockius</hi>
his new Notes upon <hi>Wendrockius</hi>
his Commentaries on the Provinciall Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
where, at the bottom of the page be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first, you may see how unscrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
those Children of Obedience take up
the same undutifull pretence against Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Condemnations with others when
their case is the same with others. This you
may plainly see if you busy not your
thoughts too much at the seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of my words <hi>[the page before
the first]</hi> for I observe your Art is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in descanting on a Bull. But, because
the words <hi>prohibited, condemn'd,</hi> make a
noyse a great deal lowder than their signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
I shall so far comply with my
Reader's either unexperience or indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as to cite that disguis'd Jesuit <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brockius</hi>
his words; that the world may
know how <hi>Religious men</hi> and those whose
chief strictness consists in <hi>Obedience,</hi> can put
by the blow of a Superiour's command
when they are concern'd in it, how loudly
soever they exclaim against others for a
less matter. <hi>Si nihil prorsus in eo (Libro
prohibito) sigillatim config<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

editus sit. If nothing at all in particular be
struck at in that Book, but it be prohibited
in generall terms; no wise man can deny but
that it was onely in this regard prohibited,
because it was set forth against the Rules
prescrib'd by the Council of Trent;</hi> as that
the Authors name was not printed (by
which, observe, that this your Book, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Council of <hi>Trent Sess.</hi> 4.
is <hi>prohibited)</hi> or Approbation of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours

<hi>Stubrockius</hi> thus strives to defend is neither
better nor worse than the intolerable Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for the Casuists, <hi>condemn'd</hi> and <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited</hi>
by the Pope the last <hi>August.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My other Note is, that amongst <hi>all</hi> the
<hi>two</hi> Books of mine (for your <hi>diverse</hi> are
no more) prohibited in <hi>Rome,</hi> this which
you except at is none: So that your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is the first; how well grounded your
following discourse will tell us. The reason
that Court would not proceed against it
(though the Doctrin it delivers might
justly expect a stronger opposition, than
some others that have had worse luck, from
the Interest of its most zealous Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
is because they see my opinion sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99049:19"/>
by an Universality of Fathers, of
contrasting with whom they are cautious
in <hi>Rome,</hi> being persons of great prudence.
And the Ex-Jesuit who writ so bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me here in <hi>England,</hi> though sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to oppose that Book, would not, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
he knew diverse Fathers of that
mind, particularly <hi>S. Austin,</hi> whom (sayes
he) I have read over no less than fourteen
times.</p>
               <p>You promise me in the end of this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>to concern your self onely with this one
Controversy of the State of Souls dying in
grace not as yet fully purged, and with the
positions and grounds on which</hi> (my) <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Purgatory stands; unless some one
Doctrin</hi> (of mine) <hi>or other, having a neer
alliance with the business in hand so offer it
self that the Discourse and Subject would be
illustrated by it.</hi> You promise me a great
favour; for, I naturally love to speak to
one question at once, and points connected
with it, that so it may be more fully illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and the Reader inform'd; which, when
many are touch't sleightly and onely
catch't at, especially if disparate and not
tending to the same difficulty, the Reader's
eye is distractedly drawn diverse wayes,
and no occasion offerd of clearing any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99049:19"/>
thing fully. But I must not be so happy as
to hope performance from you in any
thing. You promist me formerly the sweet
style of <hi>Love-Letters;</hi> but anon very fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
and unkindly call me <hi>Epicurean,
Pagan, Heathen,</hi> and what not? You
promist you would not censure me; and
yet proceed even in the same place and all
over to censure me most sharply. You
promist <hi>p. 5. strength of sence</hi> in treating
this Subject; but have hitherto afforded
me nothing but the contrary weakness,
and I mainly fear the like performance in
the rest of your Book. You promist civility
towards my <hi>person,</hi> and that you <hi>combated
onely my Doctrin;</hi> yet more than once
quarrell with my very name, which I assure
you, Sir, is onely <hi>personall,</hi> and not a jot
<hi>doctrinall.</hi> And now you promise me the
treating onely one question and points
neerly ally'd with it, which is a procedure
worthy a Schollar; but yet afterwards you
ramble to the <hi>Apocalypse, the two wings of
the woman, the Eternall Generation of the
second person,</hi> my expression of my name
and quality, and diverse such discourses;
which are not onely <hi>not neerly</hi> but not at
all ally'd to the present question: Which
shows that you are very regardless of your
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99049:20"/>
word and credit, and unconstant to your
own thoughts; and that you aym more to
cavill and make a noise against me, by pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of my works two or three Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
here and there from their fellows
by connexion with which they subsisted (a
method which should one attempt in
God's Holy Word it self, your own heart
tels you nothing's so absurd but might be
father'd upon it) rather than to confute
any piece end wayes as a Schollar should
do.</p>
               <p>Your fourth Section (the substance of
it being nothing but the copying ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Book) I am glad to have nothing to
except against, onely you insinuate a fault
in the Translation, which not having the
Latine copy by me I cannot judge of. Had
you endeavour'd to mend it, you should
have oblig'd both the worthy Translatour
and my self.</p>
               <p>In your fifth Section by a malignant
sleight you seek to bite <hi>Sir Kenelm Digby,</hi>
saying, <hi>the book of the Immortality of the Soul
was father'd upon him.</hi> I know you would
do me the honour to entitle me to it. But,
as that eloquently proper Style, the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Discourse, the multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
even in Arts wherein I am totally
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99049:20"/>
ignorant, do exclude me from the vanity
of pretending to so excellent a piece, so do
they discover to the world the rashness of
your impotent Envy. My part follows next
in the subscription of my <hi>Peripateticall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi>
the naturall sence whereof being,
<hi>Thomas an English man, of the Whites of Essex,</hi>
you are pleas'd to transform according to
your good will. You add I say <hi>my Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are according to the Minde of that most
eminent man and excellent Philosopher.</hi> And,
as for the first Epithet I have the unanimous
Testimony of all that know him and are
able to judge in what consists the worth of
abilities in the arts both of peace and warr.
And, for the second, concur with me all
those in <hi>Italy, France, Germany</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
whom their own industry and aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of minde have made worthy to read
his Book. What your following discourse
sayes of my Institutions I candidly confess
and am bound to thank you for sealing it
with your good word; saving still what
you cite out of the <hi>Consilium Authoris,</hi>
where is no such matter as you express,
though your sincerity can allow the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in a different letter as a citation from
the place: And, therefore I see even when
you make show to cite the very words, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99049:21"/>
Reader must look the place if he will not be
mistaken. Though you seem to speak of a
Point which all Peripateticks acknowledge
to be done by <hi>Aristotle</hi> long since, and so
needs no greater excellency to perform
than to have read and understood him. It
seems by your requiring Faith in your
Reader, that in your schools you do not use
to let your schollars see evidence to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
them in your doctrin, but you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
some easy and plausible perswasion
to tickle and inveigle their belief; and so
need none of thofe strange terms, <hi>fit, sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
consequens est, &amp;c.</hi> for no one thing
follows another in your doctrin. All are
either <hi>primò nota</hi> or <hi>postremò ignota</hi> in your
Philosophy.</p>
               <p>Your next quarrell is that I say Divinity
is <hi>inaedificata</hi> to Philosophy. Lord! how
you would have been troubled if I should
have sayd that <hi>Faith</hi> is grafted upon the
stock of our naturall understanding, and
Charity on our Will; and yet I beleeve
this will prove the tenet of your <hi>eminent
Schollars.</hi> Now, if this be so, sure it is less
absurd but not less necessary that our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
be grafted into the stock of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Speech and words, whose meanings and
Definitions Philosophy must open to us. I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99049:21"/>
pray then be not offended with this word
<hi>Inaedificatàe;</hi> for it signifies not <hi>super aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catae,</hi>
nor has the force to signify that the
strength of Divinity comes from Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
but that Philosophy is the wax into
which the seal of Divinity is printed, which
no learned ingenuous man will deny. For,
if Definitions be the Principles of Science,
and Philosophy defines the words Divinity
uses, it must needs have a materiall priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to it.</p>
               <p>Next, you tell your Reader my Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
and Divinity are <hi>so perfectly squar'd,
that if I had not made a Division of the
Books it had been impossible to know where
one ended and the other began.</hi> Honour'd
Sir, you know I am but a poor man, and
cannot give rewards for good turns done
to me; therefore I beseech you to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with humble thanks: For I owe them
from my heart; First to God who gave me
to perform what you say or rather did it
by me; next, to your self who so kindly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
and divulge it. For I see not
how you could give a Schollar a greater
praise, than to signify that the contexture
of (not his Paragraphs, but) even his
Books are so closely connected. But to
check my too much feeding on your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99049:22"/>
praises, you give me a knock with every
bit; you say <hi>I banish supernaturality, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate
Christian Faith, admit nothing on
other grounds than Demonstration,</hi> all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
as false as bold; and so can do me
no harm where your bare word is not
blindly beleev'd.</p>

               <p>IN the sixth Section you seem to come to
the Question, and cite a large Text our
of my <hi>Peripateticall Institutions,</hi> adding at
the end this conclusion of your own. <hi>This
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99049:22"/>
is the Essence, the Substance of his Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
this is his whole chain or deduction of it,
this is the grief he admits in separated Souls,
&amp;c.</hi> Is it possible, Sir, you should thus
forget all truth and honesty? First, you
cite out of a Book where there is no more
mention nor thought of Purgatory than
of the Dungeon of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where
Method permitted me to treat of no more
than I had before layd grounds for, where
I had not made any mention of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Christian Felicity or Unhappiness:
Where, in a word, I could onely speak to
pure Naturalists; and yet you boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<hi>this is the Essence, the Substance of
his Purgatory, this is the grief he admits in
separated Souls;</hi> whereas the whole bufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is both in the <hi>Sacred Institutions</hi> and
<hi>Middle State</hi> (the Books which purposely
treat that Subject) so quite differently
and so at large explicated. Pray, Sir, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
your self and me with some excuse
why you omit those Books which design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
handle that matter, and cite out of
another which handles it not at all; and
then, upon this false and abusive pretence,
lay the whole Ground-work of your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
impugnation.</p>
               <p>The seventh and eighth Sections consist
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99049:23"/>
chiefly of my words, and so I may omit
them till there arise some occasion of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
examination: onely I must note that
at the end of your eighth Section you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
your great <hi>care fully to deliver the
foundations of my new Fabrick of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
yet make no mention at all of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutiones
Sacrae;</hi> or that there is either
Scripture, or Fathers, or Theologicall
reasons alledg'd in my Book of the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
State;</hi> by this sly trick seeking to draw
your credulous Reader into the conceit
that there is no other ground for my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than a Metaphysicall Argument, whose
force because they do not penetrate, you
may shake it off with crying 'tis non-sence.</p>
               <p>In the ninth Section you tell a forged sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
(whether out of Ignorance or Malice I
leave to your conscience) that my Lord of
<hi>Chalcedon admonish't me of this point and
others,</hi> and that I was ready with <hi>a preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
Apology.</hi> In which, though short,
there ly three mistakes. First, that my Lord
<hi>admonish't</hi> me: For, though he were my
<hi>Superiour;</hi> though one whom a long-well-spent
Age, great study and many writings
had made awfull to our Church, yet was he
far modester than you; and profest, as he
did dislike my opinions, so <hi>he dissented no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99049:23"/>
otherwise than as one Divine does from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and had never descended to censure any
of them.</hi> Perhaps, of this point you may
have heard the contrary, but I have it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own hand. The second mistake is,
that he admonish't me of <hi>this point;</hi> for he
never descended to any particular; and this
you might understand (as partly the other)
out of my Dedicatory of my, <hi>Ratio villica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis</hi>
written to him, and presented in his
lifetime. The third, that I had <hi>fore-prepar'd</hi>
my Book of the <hi>Middle State,</hi> and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent it him. For, the reason of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it was the many popular noises
rais'd against me by persons, some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
some malicious, as if I were an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
which forc't me to write the Treatise
in mine own defence, and I dedicated it to
my Lord, though I knew no particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of his against this point, but judged
he might have some, because the greatest
cry was against it. The Translation, as far
as came to my knowledge, was not made
by any design upon earth, though by the
event I perceive it was out of speciall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in Heaven. How things passed on

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ves
of your publishing the Bull, and that Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Council I can onely collect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99049:24"/>
from the <hi>phaenomena</hi> of all concurrent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
of which you may perhaps
hereafter hear more.</p>
               <p>You say <hi>the Publishers of the Bull had no
respect to the Letter of Vindication.</hi> I think
you aym at one I wrote in Latin to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Honour, which was presented Him,
and by him shew'd to some <hi>Jesuits</hi> that
frequented his House, and they can be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the Truth between us. This,
afterwards, as I hear, was translated into
English and printed. If this be the Letter
you speak of, I would gladly understand
why you imagin the Author conceits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>inspir'd with the Genius of Mont-alt:</hi>
whose spirit, I confess, I take to be very
solid and pious, and generously adhering
to persecuted Truth: Nor, do I find it
unlawfull that any should wish to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd
with it, but truly conceive my self
far below the hope of such Excellences.</p>
               <p>What you <hi>heard well observ'd that all the
Protestant Divines of England would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to the same Protestation which is in
that Letter,</hi> I beleeve purely upon your
report. But tell me first, may a Catholick
protest nothing that a Protestant will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to? or can a Protestant profess no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what he will perform. Again,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99049:24"/>
will any Protestant profess <hi>to renounce any
Doctrin found to contradict any Authority
constantly acknowledg'd for Infallible in the
Catholick Church,</hi> meaning the same by
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> as my writings declare
me to do, that is all those who adhere to
Tradition? Will any Protestant be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to <hi>have lost his cause if any decree of a
Pope be expresly repugnant to him,</hi> which I
there also profess? How maliciously blind
then was the <hi>observer</hi> you follow, who
could not see such distinctive expressions?
How uncharitable your self who catch at
and magnifie every rash cavill, out of a
tooth to disgrace and abuse him that never
did you injury. Your calumny of my <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
Decrees of Popes and Councils</hi> shall
be answer'd in its due place.</p>
               <p>You say <hi>the Publishers intended not to
enter into the lists of Disputation,</hi> which I
easily beleeve; and that they were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the very reciting the Bull and Canon
would have knockt down the Book (which
you say was the occasion of their setting
them forth) beyond all Reply. How weak a
conceit was this for men that saw both Bull
and Canon cited and explicated in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
book, and could not be ignorant that in
many private Conferences the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99049:25"/>
had been debated? You thought your
<hi>Capitall Letters</hi> would have dazled the
understanding, of the adverse party, so that
none would have dar'd to look further into
the meaning of those Authorities. But God
provided that al should not be so <hi>light of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi>
nor his Church led into Error by such a
misgrounded Interpretation of its Decrees.
You complain much in your tenth Section
that this <hi>pious intention of the Dispensers</hi> was
wrong'd. As though you did not know that
<hi>Intentions</hi> are secret and must expect their
reward from him that sees the heart:
Men judge of <hi>Actions,</hi> and your self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the effect was that <hi>pious</hi> (that is, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous)
<hi>persons received satisfaction;</hi> that
is, were seduced into Errour by that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
practice; and yet you think it not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
enough for an understanding man to
discover so prejudiciall an Interpretation
forc't on the Church; and would needs have
it a wrong to you that one <hi>unknown</hi> &amp; not
<hi>intended to be hurt by you</hi> should take this
pains; as if every honest and ableman were
not interessed in the Churches quarrell of
so high a nature as to set up an <hi>Opinion,</hi>
that may prove when examin'd <hi>erroneous,</hi>
for an <hi>Article of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In your eleventh Section you begin to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99049:25"/>
produce your Arguments, whereof the
first is, that <hi>all Orthodox writers who have
treated this Subject of the State of separated
Souls since the promulgation of the Bull
a foresaid suppose it as a certain Truth.</hi>
But how many such do you cite? Surely
of five hundred which have written since
those dayes your Readers might civilly
expect at least half a score that positively
assert it as an assur'd doctrin of the
Church. But, such is the irregular way of
discoursing your <hi>eminent Scholars</hi> use, that
when they have audaciously advanc't a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
whereof they know nothing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
if it be deny'd, against all Rules of
Discourse and Logick they put the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
to prove the contrary, which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
concerns not him a pin whether it
be true or no. As in the present, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
it my Faith whether many or few
interpret the Bull and Councill as you or I
say? To make a new Article of Faith the
definition must be so clear that none can
doubt of it: And <hi>ipso facto</hi> that it needs
Interpretation, 'tis evidently insufficient
to make a new obligation of Faith. Again,
suppose your Antecedent be true, does any
number of Interpreters lock up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
of those that follow that they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99049:26"/>
may not see more than their Fore-goers?
If you say <hi>yes;</hi> shew us some seal of
Infallibility in their foreheads by which
we may know so much, or else your Faith
will be but probable; but a <hi>peradventure
I, peradventure no;</hi> and Interest or Passion
must supply the rest. And, such I beleeve
is your Faith of this your new-born <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
though somewhat an older <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In your twelfth Section you enquire into
the state of the Question; and when you
have recited it out of the Bul, you presently
cry, <hi>Victory,</hi> without ever looking into the
words and sence; that one may note in
you the wonted disposition of your great
Masters, to read the words, but seldom take
pains to understand them. The Bull then
sayes, that in the dayes of the Popes Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
<hi>there rose a Question among Divines
concerning the vision of the Souls of Just men
after their death, in which nothing was to be
purg'd when they departed out of this world;
or, if there were, it was now totally purg'd;
whether they see the Divine Essence before
the re-assumption of their bodies, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Judgment, and also concerning other
matters, &amp;c.</hi> I pray you now, in vertue of
your Logick, shew us here what is the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99049:26"/>
of the Question, what the <hi>Predicate.</hi>
To my apprehension the <hi>Subject</hi> is divided
into two parts; one is of <hi>Just men in whom
at their death nothing is to be purg'd;</hi> the
other of them <hi>who at their death had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to be purg'd, but now are totally purg'd:</hi>
The <hi>Predicate</hi> is, the <hi>seeing of God's Essence
before the day of Judgment.</hi> If this be so,
then resolve me whether the <hi>Subject</hi> of the
Proposition be affirm'd by the Proposition,
or be that of which the <hi>Predicate</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd.
We whose Logick tends to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
agree that the <hi>Subject</hi> is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,
but is that of which the <hi>Predicate</hi>
is affirm'd? What your <hi>eminent Schollars</hi>
that square Philosophy and consequently
Logick to their not understood Faith, will
say to this, I expect you to teach us who
are a great Professour (I doubt not) in
their way. In the mean while give me leave
to think and tell you, that the Question
whether <hi>any Souls be purg'd before the re-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of their bodies,</hi> is no part of the
Popes Answer, and neither part of the
<hi>Predicate</hi> nor of the <hi>Copula;</hi> and this so
evidently that no ingenuous person can
reply upon it; which I may very well
ghess to be the reason why you would not
scan the Popes words. Nor need I make
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99049:27"/>
other answer to <hi>Cherubinus,</hi> he (as your
self say) agreeing with the Pope. This is
the main prop of your whole cause; and
yet how weak it proves when seriously and
indifferently examin'd! though I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confess it might easily be mistaken by an
unwary Reader fully possess't of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
perswasion.</p>
               <p>You see, now, Sir, the way a Scholar that
understands Logick would have taken here,
is, since every Question is of whether some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>be</hi> or <hi>be not</hi> (that is, of some Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that is, whether some Predicate be
identify'd to the Subject) to show that the
Predicate of the proposition you would
evince is the Predicate here; your Subject,
the Subject. By this method you might
have hop't to arrive to some <hi>strength of
sence.</hi> But instead of doing this you onely
cry aloud the words are <hi>most plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
for you, that they most clearly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
condemn us;</hi> and then to prove it,
you are very high against your Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's
<hi>over sight,</hi> his <hi>prepossession,</hi> his <hi>boldness,</hi>
his <hi>confidence,</hi> Sometimes he is blam'd for
an absurdity almost <hi>impossible</hi> in <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking</hi>
it; Anon, you say, <hi>to do him right</hi>
(as if you would confess you did him <hi>wrong</hi>
before) he did <hi>see it and cite it.</hi> Strange
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99049:27"/>
challenge of over-sight which consists with
a grant of both <hi>seeing and citing!</hi> So that
all you bring in your own behalf, and this
in the main support of your cause, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to your self, calumny of your
Adversary, many bold sayings, and not
one Schollar-like attempt of proof. Sweet
Sir, will this serve think you to prove your
Adversary a Puny, and your self a great
Clerk? or rather will not the Reader judge
that the differences of your performance
will transpose those appellations?</p>
               <p>In your thirteenth Section you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
your Adversary that he pretends
there was but <hi>one Question onely disputed
and defin'd at that time,</hi> and affirm stoutly
that <hi>it is not possible for him to perswade a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Intelligent Reader thereof;</hi> though both
the Pope and <hi>Cherubinus</hi> by your confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
call it <hi>a Question,</hi> and not <hi>Questions.</hi>
'Tis an hard case that the Pope's own word
cannot protect him, but we must be put to
prove the Pope spake what he thought.
But, let us see your Arguments. You say
the Pope makes <hi>two Questions,</hi> and that
<hi>Cherubinus does the same</hi> (their words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
equivalent, I see not why I should
make two disputings of the same case) <hi>the
first of Souls in which nothing remain'd to be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99049:28"/>
purg'd; the other of Souls in which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be purg'd.</hi> But since by your own
confession, and by the words cited by your
self they say these two made but one
<hi>Question,</hi> a man would have expected you
should bring somewhat to prove what you
say, and not upon your bare word force us
to beleeve they contradict themselves in
the same period. But, to speak sence as
well as words, who knows not that the
word <hi>Question</hi> may have two meanings;
one, to signify what may be <hi>ask't;</hi> another
what is or may be <hi>doubted.</hi> An <hi>asking</hi> may
be fram'd of any proposition we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of; a <hi>doubting</hi> onely of those against
which we have some kind of apparent
reason. Now, you are pleas'd to look no
farther than for what may be <hi>ask't;</hi> but
your Adversary goes on to what may be
<hi>doubted</hi> of; and, therefore, finding no
speciall doubt of one part of the persons
you divide which was not in the other, he
was so <hi>clear-sighted</hi> as to find that the Pope
and <hi>Cherubinus</hi> exprest themselves proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and dogmatically; whereas you make
them break the common Laws both of
Sence and Grammar; and, when they
would speak of many <hi>Questions,</hi> to use the
singular number. You add a confirmation
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99049:28"/>
out of the Title of the Bull, in which in the
plurall number <hi>Articles</hi> are sayd to be
<hi>defin'd;</hi> not distinguishing betwixt <hi>Articles</hi>
and <hi>Questions,</hi> whereas an <hi>Article</hi> must
be fore-debated to be call'd a <hi>Question.</hi> So
that, if there had been but one Article
doubted of and debated, there was but <hi>one
Question</hi> decided, though <hi>many Articles</hi>
defin'd.</p>
               <p>Nor do you well appeal to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of <hi>Cherubinus,</hi> where you onely find
that <hi>ten Heresies are condemned by this Bull.</hi>
for it is a far different thing to condemn a
known falsity, and to determin a doubted
question. So that your <hi>clear-sight</hi> fail'd
you also in this point. As for <hi>Eymericus</hi>
I easily confess of his worth, all that <hi>Pegna</hi>
writes: But, as all that doth not except him
from being a man, so neither from having
had his imperfections; and this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
that he was too censorious; which is
pardonable in him, few Saints arriving to a
perfect exinanition of proper interest, till
towards the End of their dayes. Wherefore,
as all Judges for the most part are subject
to draw causes to their own Courts, so
this Inquisitour was willing to make many
heads, upon which Delinquents might fall
within the compass of the Inquisition, by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99049:29"/>
which means he set great quarrels betwixt
his own Order and that of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi>
condemning <hi>Raymundus Lullus,</hi> whom the
<hi>Franciscans</hi> maintain to be a Saint, of
<hi>Heresy,</hi> for attempting <hi>to demonstrate the
Trinity.</hi> In which controversy our modern
Divines side much with the <hi>Franciscans.</hi>
Hence I infer you can ground little upon
this Author as to increasing Articles of
Faith. Your citation out of <hi>Spondanus</hi>
is less to the purpose, for his relation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
nothing more to your intent then
what is formally in the Bull it self; and, so,
already discuss'd: onely I may note that
this worthy Author, in that he sayes <hi>the
opinion of the Saints not seeing God was not
altogether reprov'd or condemn'd in John the
two and twentieths dayes,</hi> is mistaken with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others of your <hi>eminent Scholars,</hi> as may
appear by the Universal out-cry of the
Church against him, and the Arts and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
he was fain to use to get Doctours
to side with him, as the History of those
times doth manifest. I may conclude that
notwithstanding your strong confidence
that your Adversary never dreamt of these
subtill Mysteries you think you have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
he saw the truth more cleerly then
you with all your great intelligence; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99049:29"/>
so may return your exhortation upon your
self, to <hi>beware of heat of youth,</hi> to beware of
the secret snare of <hi>Interest,</hi> which many
times lurk undiscovered in the hearts of
men of greater age.</p>
               <p>In the fourteenth Section you come to
the other question of what is the <hi>Subject</hi> of
this Bull, which your Adversary sayes to
consist in this, whether <hi>perfect Charity
brings immediatly to Heaven.</hi> And you
very complementally beseech him to tell
you how his <hi>cleer-sighted friends could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him to impose so grosly upon you, as to
settle the state of the question in that</hi> whose
name is not recorded in the whole decree. I
confess I hold him bound to yeild you satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
And because you have imposed by
your first Section the burthen upon me to
answer for him, in return of your civility
my request is, to know how a man of your
worth and parts could perswade your self
to descend so low as to ask a question
grounded on so triviall an errour, that
every School-boy must see it. I imagin if
two words have in a Dictionary the same
signification, and a School boy should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that his Latin had the sence in English
which his Master asserted, because one of the
two words was not in it. I fear his Master
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99049:30"/>
would think him negligent enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the rod. So if the word <hi>Justus</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
one that is in charity, and you, who
take upon you so high an Authority of
censuring, will flatly and challengingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the <hi>thing</hi> to be there because the <hi>very
word</hi> is not there, you seem to me most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
unreasonable: What if instead of
an Angel of gold, I give you half a Piece,
is it not all one? or, which perhaps you
will think more like our case, instead of the
term defin'd suppose the definition? You
object therefore more strongly, that he
requires <hi>the Popes positive is or is not;</hi> And
if you do not shew that, and yet will obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
persist to draw from this Definition
that Souls are delivered before the day of
Judgment <hi>you hazard to contradict both
Bull and Council.</hi> The rest of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
though plainly and strongly urg'd
you omit at the present, what you will do
hereafter we shall see. This last point that
<hi>you hazard to contradict the Council and
Pope</hi> you stumble at. But why (I pray)
if you know not their minds about that
point do you not hazard to choose the
wrong for the right. I understand no
otherwise. But you insist upon his admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that the Pope was of that mind. First
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99049:30"/>
that admission comes after this speech of
his. Secondly it is but a permission, not a
certification, for out of it, you are never
the securer that indeed it was so, and so still
remain in <hi>hazard.</hi> As for his requiring an
<hi>is or is not,</hi> I wonder you should except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; this being the very substance of
the question in hand. I pray, reflect (as
any ingenious Reader I suppose will) that
the Pope may either <hi>think</hi> that some Souls
are purg'd before the day of Judgment, and
yet neither <hi>intend to say</hi> it, nor <hi>in fact say</hi>
it: He may again both <hi>think</hi> so and <hi>intend
to say</hi> it, and yet <hi>not say</hi> it; lastly, he may
do all three: Let us then for Argument
sake suppose, that, he did all three, and that
this would make an Article of Faith of
what was not so before, for some of <hi>your
eminent Schollars</hi> hold that. Doth any of
them say his pure <hi>thought</hi> has that power,
or his <hi>Will</hi> if it budds not into <hi>words?</hi>
None that ever I heard of. The most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
publication and affixion <hi>ad Valvas
Sancti Petri,</hi> and <hi>in acie Campi Florae,</hi> and
such like formalities, far more visible than
an ambiguous elocution or supposition;
which you, without being able to shew
any express word, will needs fix upon us
for a yoak to submit all understandings
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99049:31"/>
unto. Do not reprove so fiercely unless
you can give a better account of your
Doctrin and actions. It becomes you
not.</p>

Now, let us say a word to your
question it self. By the precedent discourse
'tis apparent there was but <hi>one</hi> formall
question disputed in those times, though
the <hi>predicate</hi> belong'd to diverse <hi>subjects</hi> as
all universall Predicates do. Of which kind
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99049:31"/>
                  <hi>(viz.</hi> universall Predicates) 'tis impossible
to see <hi>one</hi> if the Questions must be counted
as many as the subjects to which they are
applyable. Now then in our present case I
averr the Question to be <hi>Vtrum justus
nihil habens purgandum immediate potiatur
visione Dei.</hi> Nor do I see how possibly you
can deny either the Question to be <hi>One,</hi> or
to be <hi>this;</hi> Since the Pope himself both
expresly calls it <hi>one</hi> and puts it to be <hi>this.</hi>
Which being agreed on, let us see what sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the Subject, <hi>[Justus nihil habens pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandum]
Just men or Souls in which there
remaines nothing to be purg'd.</hi> To Divines a
<hi>Just man</hi> or Soul signifies one that is indu'd
with charity; and <hi>to have nothing to be
purg'd,</hi> signifies to have not so much as a
veniall Sin left to be purg'd in them, that is,
according to <hi>S. Thomas</hi> his Doctrin, to
have his Charity totally fervent &amp; perfect.
Now <hi>John</hi> the 22th. deny'd that such Souls
went to heaven before the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
His opposits, the main Body of
the Church, affirm'd it. If then this expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
be on all parts evident, what can be
answerd why this, according to your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary's
tenet, was not the onely-handled and
debated Question? unles you will return to
that triviall excuse, as to cry the <hi>word</hi> is not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99049:32"/>
there but onely the sence and meaning.
And, where I pray, does your Adversary
pretend that his <hi>very words are in the Bull,</hi>
that you challenge him so vaporingly to
shew you the Question in termes? I find
him indeed say that 'twas the <hi>Designe, aym,
drift, intention</hi> of the Definers, but I do not
see him undertake that <hi>perfect Charity
brings an immediate Heaven</hi> were precisely
the <hi>terms</hi> of the definition. Your self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but observe he severally phrases the
Question, as sometimes <hi>whether Souls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in charity see God immediatly,</hi> sometimes
in other words; attending to the sence as
sober and intelligent Writers should do,
not standing upon <hi>terms</hi> as dodging Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
do. Look but into the Testimonies
which your self cite, and indeed what all
Historians and Divines report, and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do not unanimously agree that
this was the Question. I think I may after
so much evidence excuse the answering of
your Adversary's Argument drawn from
the Pope's so pious recommends of <hi>Holy
desires;</hi> for, since the Question is not chang'd,
but by you mistaken and pitifully not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and that your whole solution
relies upon that defect, His Argument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
in its full strength. Onely, I will
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99049:32"/>
ask your pardon if I presume to direct you
in the example of the <hi>Entychians</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites.</hi>
You argue thus: <hi>when the Church
combated the Eutychians, it did not onely define
the plurality of wils against the Monothelites,
&amp;c.</hi> what you would say I cannot tell; If,
that the Church defin'd both the plurality
of Natures and Wills, you discover too much
Ignorance, for it defin'd onely the plurality
of Natures: If, that it defin'd onely the
plurality of natures not of wills, you say
right, but it comes quite crose to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
which strives to prove that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is defin'd by connexion, not formally
set down in the Definition. Wherefore
your Discourse seems to me imperfect and
perplext.</p>
               <p>Now then I may fairly proceed to your
fifteenth Section where again I meet with
<hi>Eymericus;</hi> but, because he either sayes
no more than the Bull or obliges not so
much, I shall agree with you that he is a
grave and learned Authour, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
any farther about what conduces
so little to our main Conclusion. Onely,
give me leave to note this defect in him
where he sayes these points were <hi>made of
Faith by this Bull,</hi> If that be his meaning.
twas a great weaknes in a writer so neer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99049:33"/>
those times and living when the noyse was
not yet ceas'd. For, if the truth of these
Articles were not known before this Bull,
what reverence was it in the whole Christian
world publikly to term the Pope an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
and preach against him, even in the
Court of <hi>Avignon;</hi> as an Englishman of
<hi>Eymericus</hi> his order, by name <hi>Thomas Wallis</hi>
did, and was imprison'd for it. No; these
points were the constant Tradition of the
Church, and this Bull serv'd not to bring in
a <hi>new Faith,</hi> but to quiet the world, and by
Authority to quell the spirits mov'd by
<hi>John the</hi> 22th.</p>
               <p>In your sixteenth Section you pass on to
the Council of <hi>Florence;</hi> but it's definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being exactly according to the Bull,
there is no hope of any new advantage to
your cause from thence. Yet you will try
again, though with the same Argument,
and we beg your Readers patience if we
repeat the same Answer. First you cite
the Council that some <hi>Souls are purg'd by
the punishments of Purgatory after their
body's death</hi> Which would have seemd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little to the purpose, your Adversary
professing the same, had not you long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
laid a snake in the grass to use his sting
when occasion should serve; which here
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99049:33"/>
you begin. presently adding that <hi>this can
find no admittance in your new modell. For all
the suffering of Soules which you fancy by
their irregular and now unchangeable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
avail nothing as to the purging and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Soules, &amp;c.</hi> Now I see why you
neglected my book of the <hi>middle state,</hi> and
what I write of it in my <hi>Sacred Institutions,</hi>
that you might freely slander the Catholick
truth I teach about Purgatory, to those
who know no more, then what you cited
out of a treatise of philosophy, where there
was no intention to speak either of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
or in deed Christianity. But because you
will dilate your self as I suppose more largly
herafter, I will deferr the question till
then.</p>
               <p>You will have your Adversary observe
that when the Council in the fourth Article
declares that <hi>Souls which are purg'd being
uncloth'd of their bodies are immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into heaven,</hi> this doctrine by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enthesis
of <hi>(as is abovesayd)</hi> is wholly built
upon the former Doctrin of <hi>the Purging
it self.</hi> And I, Sir, would desire you to note,
that because neither in the third nor in the
fourth Article any time of <hi>compleating</hi> the
Purgation is express'd or insinuated, that
your note is nothing to your Purpose, nor
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99049:34"/>
doth any way conduce to shew a <hi>complete
Purgation</hi> of them <hi>while uncloathed;</hi> And
this, though it were true that a Purgation
by punishment in Purgatory were against
your adversary; which is a pure conceit
of your own brain.</p>
               <p>You proceed to an Antiparallel of the
Councels Doctrin to ours, and to manage
it the better you most freely assume what
you finde not in the Councell. I mean these
words <hi>being purged uncloath'd of their
bodies,</hi> which signify in plain English that
the purgation is perfected while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
yet uncloathed. The equivalent of
which sence, if it bee not in the Council as
all my endevours cannot find it, I must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
protest that as I should be content
you wrong'd me to do the Council right,
so to slander the Council that you may
wrong me is a thing unsufferable in any,
much more in a religious Person. In the
parallel you give for my side, you put <hi>a vast
grief by reason those pleasurs are now impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be enjoy'd.</hi> Shew this in all my books
ever apply'd to the Soules in Purgatory and
carry the question: if you cannot, consider
what you make me suffer among them who
believe you. You desire your adversary
farther to note that <hi>sunt purgata</hi> is the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99049:34"/>
preter perfect tense, and show that the
purgation is pass'd. And are you so unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
as not to know the Council speaks as
well of the Souls to go out of their bodies
the following ages, as in those before?
so that this <hi>being pass'd</hi> must stay in some
even to the day of Judgment by your own
explication?</p>
               <p>After this you seek farther into the roots
of the Council even from its beginning at
<hi>Ferrara.</hi> But as far as I see you are not
very expert in the story. For at <hi>Ferrara</hi>
was deliver'd to the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
a long oration by <hi>Marcus Ephesius</hi>
who would never consent to the Councils
resolutions about Purgatory. But his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerns not us much, so we understand
the meaning of the main body of the
Greeks, whose propositions when you
have recited, you infer 'twere absurd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that <hi>the question of Purgatory was here
disputed and defined,</hi> by which you discover
a great mind to play soul, but your fingers
are not nimble enough to carry it hansom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
you craftily would perswade the incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Reader that we deny'd Purgatory,
but then you spoil all by putting a wrong
term, for truly the question of Purgatory
was not <hi>disputed,</hi> but from the beginning
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99049:35"/>
agreed on by both sides; but a question
concerning Purgatory, that is, whether
there were true fire in it was debated, and
so, for any thing the Council says, or I
know it may be debated still. Of the other
points exprest in the decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
there was an agreement without debate
betwixt the generality of the Greeks and
the Latins.</p>
               <p>You go on pronouncing that <hi>in these
professions both sides agreed against us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
and home to our point in question:</hi>
without expressing in what, or bringing
any proof of it. For your self have before
confest we hold both <hi>expiation</hi> and <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and the onely question betwixt us is
whether before the day of Judgment this
expiation end: of which (though the very
precise point we contend about) you still
have the ill luck to fall short; you offer
sometimes indeed to rack your Testimonies
to confess what you desire, were not the
words too faithfull to their Speakers sence,
to be corrupted by you: but if they will
not do in Latin, you have a trick to turn
them into English, and piece them our
with stuff of your own; making their sence
to be this, <hi>their present delivery whilst un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth'd?</hi>
this you say the Council intended
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99049:35"/>
to deliver as the Faith of the Church, in
this both the Greek and Latin Fahers
clearly agreed, and yet plainly the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I sustain was neither agreed to, nor
debated, nor question'd, if I be truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
as the first Inventer of it, nor so much
as mention'd. You conclude, it must be an
act not of understanding, but of will to say
<hi>presently</hi> signifies, <hi>at the day of Judgment.</hi>
Truly it would be so, and in the mean while
'tis an act of ill will, to impose on your
Adversary that he sayes it.</p>
               <p>Now a word to the discourse of an <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
learned Divine</hi> which you mark
with the letter C. And for his learning I
have nothing to say, why it should not be
<hi>eminently</hi> above yours, but for his wyliness
he is far short of you, and if any thing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
his Judgment, it is self-conceit and
down-right passion, his unhappy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
that strangely abound in him. But I
cannot omit to note in you, that you had
not the luck to give his Paper a convenient
title, but printed it just as he had written
it for his own memory. The entrance of
his discourse is very good; But his first
proposition concerning the matter, plainly
and unexcusably mistaken; for he sayth,
<hi>the matter in dispute betwixt the Latins
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99049:36"/>
and the Greeks was what Souls were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or to be admitted to eternal Beatitude
before the day of Judgment.</hi> A question
that neither you as far as I can guess, nor
we ever found in this Council. Neither do
I remember to have met with such a grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Saints in any Author: Therefore,
I leave this great Doctor to prove that
there ever was such a question mov'd. His
next leap though he calleth <hi>it this question,</hi>
yet is quite from the question in hand;
being whether there be <hi>fire in Purgatory</hi>
or no. Which how it appertains to his
mainly proposed question I leave to better
wits to consider. But I gather, that this
Paper was onely private notes, not written
in a form to be printed, and that you have
done very indiscreetly and to his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to expose them to the publick. He
puts next the Latins position, in which you
who <hi>cannot pardon your Adversaries sloath</hi>
in perusing of the Council, omit a sentence
most pertinent of any thing to the cause,
to wit, that <hi>he who hath committed many
offences is freed after a longer time of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but he who hath committed a few is
sooner delivered,</hi> which particularity had it
been in the <hi>decision</hi> of the Council, would
have been something to the purpose, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99049:36"/>
saved you the labour of corrupting the
Council by your additions. But I must
note that this <hi>eminent</hi> man useth this
phrase <hi>in this world,</hi> and <hi>in the next</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day of Judgment and after, not (as
I think) by affectation, but by negligence,
which still more confirms me, that the
whole draught were but private notes, and
not fram'd for the print.</p>
               <p>He goes on to give the variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning their going to Heaven, in
which he sayes <hi>the Greeks imagin that the
Souls of just men have indeed obtained Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
but not perfectly, and that they shall
perfectly enjoy it when they shall be reunited
to their bodies:</hi> which position, so far (by
his leave) is common also to some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Latin Fathers. He adds that the Greeks
say that <hi>in the mean while they remain in a
separated place, where they interiourly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
entertaining their thoughts with the
fore-seen and fore-known perfect Beatitude
and adoption which is prepared for them.</hi> But
in the conclusion he seems to say that <hi>after
many disputations</hi> the Greeks came to the
ensuing resolutions which are well known.
In which he slaunders the Greek Church,
for it was but a part of them that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this last mention'd position, upon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99049:37"/>
the like Testimonies as <hi>John</hi> the two and
twentieth did amongst the Latins, so you see
that his master piece for which he esteems
himself so highly, to wit, to understand
what the opinion of the Eastern Church was,
is a meer illusion bred out of the reading
some Schismaticks works, whom he took to
be the mouth of the Greek Church. For
the Greeks themselves who at <hi>Rome</hi> write
against Hereticks Profess that the Faith of
the Greeks concerning Purgatory is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in their <hi>Euchologies</hi> &amp; <hi>Ritualls</hi> which
are ancient and used both by Catholicks
and Schismaticks. For as to their writers,
if you read one, you know not who else
will agree with him. So various and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
are their explications. Now if their
<hi>Ritualls</hi> and <hi>Euchologies</hi> be not more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
then the Latins for your opinion, you
will easily see what will become of you,
there being not one word of delivery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day of Judgment, but all that is
any way express referr'd thither: which
you are pleased to neglect though it be the
publick profession of the Church, and to
seek birds-nests in the bushes of probable
Authours.</p>
               <p>Next then, your <hi>eminently learned man</hi>
makes his reflexions upon the word <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99049:37"/>
just as wisely as you, perswading
himself that we think the natural and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
signification of it is <hi>at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and insisting upon it, because it is
added onely to this member. As if the
reason were not evident, to wit, because
the time was to be set down uncertainly
onely in this member; <hi>Presently</hi> therefore
signifieth <hi>as soon as purg'd,</hi> whensoever that
be, according to the variety of opinions.
He goes on to tell us that <hi>neither Greeks
nor Latins doubted of the delivery of Souls at
the day of Judgment,</hi> which is very true, and
therefore also they put no more down. He
adds that the <hi>sole difficulty was of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
time, as both their declarations do
manifest.</hi> But this <hi>manifestation</hi> was made
in his learned brain, for in the text there is
no sight of any such contest betwixt them.
But it appears that the Greeks held their
tongues about it, and the Latins were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
they should do so. At last your <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man</hi> would perswade us that it is most
plain in <hi>Benedictus</hi> his Bull, and that there
the word <hi>[Presently] most manifestly signifies
before the day of Judgment.</hi> But because he
sent me not the magnifying spectacles of
Passion which he used, I could not perceive
such <hi>evidence.</hi> He concludes with, <hi>what may
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99049:38"/>
he judge of me, who call this Definition of a
holy Pope and Council, a new Doctrin.</hi> I pray
certify him that I neither believe him nor
you, that the Doctrin I call <hi>new</hi> is either the
Popes or the Councils.</p>
               <p>Which that it may appear better, I give
you a few notes for our side, upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
The first was that there was no debate
betwixt the Greeks and Latins concerning
Purgatory but onely about <hi>fire,</hi> and with
some Greeks about <hi>the Vision of God</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
<hi>just men,</hi> so that your learned mans
wilfull supposition of a strife concerning
the gradation of Saints coming to Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is a pure fiction, without any ground of
History, and his whole discourse built upon
it, nothing but the humming of a <hi>Chimaera</hi>
feeding upon <hi>entia rationis.</hi> My second
note is that whereas the Latins put in their
confession that some of those who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd
purgation came <hi>sooner</hi> to Beatitude,
others <hi>later;</hi> The Greeks after they had
seen the Latins confession, quite left out
that point, and this upon the fourteenth
day of <hi>June,</hi> whereas the Latins put in their
propositions the fourth, so that you see it
was not for hast or over-sight, but because
it was not settled amongst them, as it
seem'd to be amongst the Latins. My third
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99049:38"/>
note is, that the Greeks express the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Purgatory to consist in <hi>griefs,</hi> to
wit, for their sins and for the <hi>want of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
which are the same in which I also
think the pains of Purgatory consist, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
you please not to take notice of it.
My fourth note is that the Latins never
took notice of the Greeks disagreement in
point of coming to bliss, <hi>some sooner, some
later,</hi> but proceeded joyntly to the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with words abstracting from both
sides of this controversy. All this is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
in the letter of the Council, that there
can be no dispute, in truth, of any part;
though of this later, you and your learned
assistant will force a disputation thrusting
in a sence which the words bear not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
shame or care of your conscience in so
wicked an attempt as to corrupt a Council.</p>
               <p>Now out of these Notes I frame a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
as strong as the nature of such
a case can bear.</p>
               <p>Where a difference is so plain betwixt 2 par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that it is not possible to be hidden from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet neither part takes notice of it, it
is plain they do not hold that difference to be
materiall.</p>
               <p>But there was a known and plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concealable
difference between the Greeks and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99049:39"/>
Latines concerning this tenet whether some
Soules were purged sooner then others, the
Latines putting it down expressly, and the
Greeks after having seen the Latins confession,
leaving it quite out, and yet no quarrel or
disputation arose betwixt them about this
point.</p>
               <p>Therefore neither part took it for a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
point of Religion and Controversie.</p>
               <p>Now then you see wherin consisted the
agreement of the two Churches concerning
this point, to wit, in this that neither of
them thought it a matter to contend about.
I pray express your opinion in this point
whether if the Latins had believ'd it an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res'y</hi>
to say one Soul was not deliver'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
another, could they in conscience have
admitted the Greek Church to communion
without declaring their mind in this point,
and this after so open an opposition, as to
leave out all mention of it when the Latins
had so positively express'd it? If you think
Councils can dissemble in points of this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
I believe the world wil soon confess that
I, as stubborn as you reckon me, give far
more reverence to Councells then you do.
Wherefore I press you farther out of the
Council. If any man should say it was an
Heresy to hold there were no materiall fire
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99049:39"/>
in Purgatory, or that it was not lawfull to
consecrate in leaven'd Bread, you would
not spare to tell him that since the Council
had declared it indifferent, he stood not
with the Council, but seem'd at least to
contradict it if he held it were a matter of
Faith. So do I press you, since the Council
hath pass'd this point for an <hi>indifferent</hi> one,
He that will say the opposite is an <hi>Heresy</hi> is
malapert beyond <hi>his</hi> strength. <hi>Arrogantia
ejus plus quam fortitudo ejus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You give us another paper, which you
say was written by a nameless Schollar of
mine. I could reply I have none. For who
converse with me, I tell them they must <hi>see</hi>
themselves, not <hi>trust</hi> me; which if they
do, they are Scholars to truth, not to me;
If they trust me they follow me not, and so
are not my Scholars. But I have too much
ground to suspect you aym at some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
against me by charactering him a <hi>very
able proficient in my School,</hi> and repeating
it so often; as if you would have men think
that both Friends and Foes were all against
me. I must then once more tell you that
the Authour of that Letter never was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to my Doctrin, nor pretended to be
my follower (however you have got a trick
to call all my <hi>Followers</hi> that will not censure
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99049:40"/>
me as loud as you, nor willingly assent to
your uncharitable carriage) nor was he ever
given to be curious in such kind of disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
no not even to that degree as to have
read my <hi>middle State,</hi> which made him
more easily liable to surprise in mistaking
the Council at the first sight, taking all for
right which your <hi>learned Divine</hi> writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it; so that it was candid credulity
of your Friends wrong relation of it, not
want of Judgment which betray'd him into
the errour of imagining the Bull and
Council on your side, nor did he dream his
Letter should ever come into print, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
writ privately to the other as a Friend,
otherwise in likelihood he would have
sifted the Testimonies himself, and not
have taken them on others account. So
that you first uncivilly print a private Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his, surreptitiously procur'd, without
his knowledge; then mischaracter him <hi>an
able proficient in my School,</hi> my <hi>Follower,
&amp;c.</hi> whereas what he writes is onely like
a moderate and grave Christian, who
knows he is not even by Principles of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to interpret as disobedient one who
publickly submits to the Church; and so I
look upon it as an act of charity, not of
particular Friendship to me. But since you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99049:40"/>
love to have it thought your party can
gain some advantage against those who are
<hi>proficients</hi> by my Books, I will show you
one, your present Adversary, whom your
self character to be but a <hi>puny in my School,</hi>
and as I hear never appear'd in print, nor
set himself to write before, yet has so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
foyl'd you in every encounter in this
Question, that he hath left nothing for me
but to discover your falshood in such by-questions
as you thrust in to stuff out your

Containing an Answer to his

               <head type="sub">The Authours Doctrin of Councils expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;
This new opinion of Purgatory
in likelihood later than Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory.</head>
               <p>IN your seventeenth Section you first put
upon me that I <hi>am arm'd against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Popes and Councils,</hi> and then you
run headlong on with declamatory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99049:41"/>
upon that supposition. But, as the
world is curious, I conceive some will light
on my defence as well as on your calumny;
to whom I thus explicate the true state of
the question. It is known to all Christians
that Christ and his Apostles taught the
world the Christian faith. It is known to
all Catholicks, that this same faith has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the Catholick Church now fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ages. It is known to the same that
the means of continuing this faith hath been
by Pastours, and Fathers teaching their
Children what themselves had learn'd by
the same way. It is likewise known that in
divers ages there arose up divers Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
who endeavour'd to bring in Doctrins
contrary to the received Faith: and that
Bishops, sometimes in particular (especially
the Bishop of <hi>Rome)</hi> sometimes in Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Councils with-stood and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such Hereticks confirming the old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and rejecting all new inventions. It is
evident that to do this it fuffices to have
veracity enough to attest what the old
Doctrin was, and power enough to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
all such as stir against it; Thus far
all goes well. Of late Ages among our curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
School-men some have been so subtle
that the <hi>Old</hi> faith would not serve them,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99049:41"/>
but they thought it necessary to bring in
<hi>new</hi> points of Faith, and because what was
not <hi>of Faith</hi> could not <hi>become of Faith</hi>
without a new revelation, they look't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
for a new revelation; and, finding
the two supreme Courts of Christian di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
seated in General Councils and
the Pope, they quickly resolv'd to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the power of encreasing Christian
Faith to these two Springs of Christianity.
Now, the first difference betwixt the two
parties engag'd in the present controversy
is, whether the Faith deliver'd by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
be sufficient to govern the Church
by, or there be necessary fresh Additions
of such points as cannot be known without
a new revelation. In which they whom I
follow hold the negative, they whom I
suppose you follow, the affirmative. Out
of this question springs a second, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Councils and in the Pope is to
be acknowledg'd a Prophetical kind of
Spirit, by which towards the ordinary
government of the Church, they have a
gift to reveal some things not before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
nor deducible out of things already
revealed by the natural power of discourse
which God has left to mankind to govern
it self by. In which point also I follow them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99049:42"/>
that deny, you and your <hi>eminent learned
men</hi> stand up for the Affirmative.</p>
               <p>I hope by this any ingenious Reader
will perceive that, if the Faith deliver'd by
Jesus Christ joyn'd with the natural power
of discoursing be sufficient to govern the
Church of God, then those who give pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Councils and Popes sufficient to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
by this way, give them as much as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the Church. But if <hi>new</hi> Articles
be necessary to the government of the
Church then, and onely then, they fall
short. So that no understanding person
reading these lines can doubt but the true
question is this, whether the Faith deliver'd
by Christ be <hi>sufficient for the government of
the Church;</hi> or, that we must expect new
additions to our Faith every age, or when
occasion presents it self. Whence it will
easily appear that all the great noyse you
make, and furious Rhetorick you use, of,
<hi>my denying the Authority of Councils; my
being arm'd against them;</hi> and such like
angry stuff, are but uncharitable, uncivil,
and highly injurious clamours without any
true cause or ground at all. But we shall
hear more of these hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now, any prudent Christian that shall,
with moderate attention, have read but so
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99049:42"/>
far, will judge the question already deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
For who dare maintain Christ's
Doctrin was <hi>imperfect?</hi> And indeed all
that have any little modesty on your side,
will not say <hi>new Articles</hi> of Faith are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
but that whatsoever the Church
defines was before revealed; though when
they come to declare themselves they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
really <hi>new Articles,</hi> onely calling
them Explications of the former, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
from them: And if they would
justify that they were but such Deductions
as natural reason can deduce, there would
remain no controversy: which in very deed
the Churches practise shews to be the
truth; In the first Council it being record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that there was <hi>Conquisitio magna,</hi> and
all Councils, and Popes ever since proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the same style.</p>
               <p>But here I must remember you what
you said in the beginning concerning Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
that the reason why you write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my opinion was because <hi>it was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into English.</hi> And so I now protest,
that you are the cause why I write of this
subject in English. My books generally are
to debate what I think in the points I write
of with learned men, whose care it is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge
truths to the people, dispensing to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99049:43"/>
every one the quantity he is capable of, not
to raise any new thoughts in ignorant
heads. Your crying out against me forces
me to a necessary defence before the
people; wherefore if any disputings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this matter displease any person of
Judgment, let it light upon your head who
are the provoker, and compeller of me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this new task, which both age and other
thoughts make me slowly and unwillingly
undertake. But I must not be mine own
chuser, but follow God.</p>
               <p>As to what you say against this Doctrin:
first you desire your Reader to consider
that if these grounds, to wit, that <hi>the Pope
and the Council can err,</hi> (without distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
in what either matter or manner of
proceeding) <hi>Christian Faith is a meer
mockery.</hi> I confess the proposition grave
in words, but in sence not worthy a School-boy.
For, first, I ask you, whether you
mean in <hi>necessary</hi> points or <hi>unnecessary</hi>
ones? If you say, in both, I doubt your whole
School will desert you. For who is there
that hath an ounce of brains who will give
authority to the Church to determin all the
subtle quirks of the School? But if you say
onely <hi>necessary</hi> ones, then before you went
farther against me you should have prov'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99049:43"/>
that the verities come by inheritance from
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> are not all that are <hi>necessary,</hi>
which question you never think on, and so
brandish your Logick against the appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the clouds. Secondly, I ask you
whether without counsel or with it? If you
say without it, again your School will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
you. If you say with it, I ask you how
much counsell, and to what period? In all
which you will be at a loss. Must it hold
till by reason they see a necessary connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the deliver'd Faith? if you say so
you desert your vertue of prophesying,
and come over to our School, which you
so abominate as <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>faithless:</hi> yet
this, experience teaches us, is the way that
Popes and Councils use to take. If you say
their consulting must not hold till they see
it by reason, then tell me, what <hi>Oedipus</hi> or
Geometrician can guess or fix the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
line of counsell prerequisite? These
points a Scholar would have setled. You
distinguish nothing but jumble all your
Bells together into a confused noise, and
deafen more then instruct your Hearers.
Now 'tis to much purpose to talk of the
force of the word <hi>Anathema,</hi> whilest you
have not settled a <hi>matter</hi> in which the
Church hath a <hi>power</hi> to impose it. What
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99049:44"/>
an inconsiderate manner of arguing is
this?</p>
               <p>You say <hi>Catholiks require no other assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their Faith, then upon this firm
foundation that our holy Mother the Church
is their infallible directress.</hi> The proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the very Tenet we mainly advance
and stick to. Go but consequently to this,
and we shall have no quarrell. You add
another ground, <hi>that the Councils (her
mouth) are the unerring deliverers of truth.</hi>
This also is very true and never deny'd by
us. But there rises a great question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Councils be perpetually and in all cases
the mouth of the Church: look upon <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus</hi>
his abridgment of the Councils,
and read his division of General Councils
into <hi>approbata</hi> and <hi>reprobata,</hi> and <hi>ex parte
approbata,</hi> and <hi>ex parte improbata:</hi> and
see how ignorantly you go to work even
in the grounds of your own <hi>eminent learned
men,</hi> who will oppose you peradventure
more then I, and yet you preach <hi>Christian
Religion is a mockery</hi> if this be taken away.
I desire not to look into particulars,
unless you force me to it. For I cannot
discover even your Errours, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
too the vanity of that School
which you nickname the Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99049:44"/>
take upon you to be one of her
Masters. I doubt not if you attentively
consider your <hi>eminent Scholars</hi> you will
find many of them speak indeed gloriously
of Councils; but, unless I be strangely
deceiv'd, they give them less of inward and
reall Authority then I; while they make
them, in effect, but <hi>Cyphers</hi> to the Pope,
without whom they signify nothing,
though added perhaps to him they increase
his signification; yet surely not very much;
since, in many of those Masters opinion, he
<hi>alone</hi> is infallible, and I think in every ones
opinion, <hi>all together</hi> are not much more.
Whereas the Doctrin I follow gives them
an absolute Inerrancy in testifying receiv'd
truths; which is clearly sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and propagate the Faith of the
Church.</p>
               <p>I beleeve you mistake the meaning of
that grave and worthy Person, whom,
without any ground at all for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
you call my Scholar, since he seriously
protests, he never gave his mind that way,
nor ever read over any considerable part
of my Books, nor particularly, this of the
<hi>Middle State:</hi> his true meaning I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
is, we may know when Councils and
Consistory's apply themselves right, by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99049:45"/>
examining (not Tradition it self for
that's evident in the sence of the Faithfull,
but) their proceedings, by Tradition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be conformable to it. Which is
not onely a maintainable but excellent
truth. And by this method the Divines
of those dayes examin'd the Doctrin of
<hi>John</hi> 22. For, Tradition is the Law of
Christ planted in the hearts of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
not to be examin'd; it being to be
read, fair written there by their externall
words and conversations. Now if a Pope
or Council be supposed to delver Doctrin
against this, 'tis past darkness and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
since all the Christian world cannot
choose but resent it, and know it to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Faith and Judgment. So that
you plainly misunderstand the meaning of
<hi>Tradition,</hi> which is no hidden thing, but
the publick and settled <hi>belief</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world.</p>
               <p>You will say, 'tis impossible a Pope
or Council should proceed so grosly. I
wish there were no examples of it. But the
truth is, if instead of a Pope, consider'd
onely <hi>personally,</hi> you take him as presiding
in his Church and Seat, and joyn'd with
it, which is a kind of more then a Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Council; but much more if you take a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99049:45"/>
                  <hi>General Council,</hi> without extraordinary
violence without or within, both <hi>mainly
visible,</hi> this cannot happen, and so they
have infallibility in attesting the received
Doctrins, most absolutely sufficient to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Church against being mis-led by
them.</p>
               <p>By the same Errour you look to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
Faith by <hi>Inquest,</hi> not knowing it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unknown in a Catholick Country
to them that live there. See the story of
<hi>Luther.</hi> Were men doubtfull of their
Faith, before he and his fellows in iniquity
set themselves to snarl at it? Therefore <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi>
may be made how to answer their
Argumments, but not to understand what
the Church held before opposition rose.
How much mistaken is all your discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the proceeding to higher Tribunals
after so great diligence of scrutiny? There
is no such thing as <hi>scrutiny</hi> necessary to
find out Faith, nor ever was the Church
to seek her Faith. Since she once receiv'd it
from <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> she never lost it, and so
is to look into it, not for it. If any thing
be to be look? for, it is not faith, it may be
some Theologicall Verity, not <hi>faith.</hi> Your
discourse therefore is wholly out of the
way. No wonder then you find your self
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99049:46"/>
at a loss, and cry out like a blind man for
a hand to guide you, since instead of <hi>Christs</hi>
faith, you look for a <hi>new</hi> faith. One would
have it an Article of our <hi>Christian</hi> faith,
that his Order is a true Religious. Order,
Another, that one hang'd for treason is a
true Martyr: others seek some private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
that brings in profit, to be cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd
for faith, and other such fine questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be put in the Creeds of the Church;
and if it be not yeelded there's a power in
the Church to impose such beliefs upon
men, presently the denying Doctrin is an
<hi>Exterminating School, and pulls up by the
roots all the foundations of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor will there want some to say, that
though these things be true, they are not
to be published, but Catholicks are to be
left in ignorance of such tender points:
But will not the mischief by degrees grow
intolerable, if once it should come to that
height that the People by a preoccupated
credence, be apt to be stirr'd seditiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their naturall and lawfull Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
by any surreptitious Rescript fetch't
from beyond Sea, freshly seal'd with the
new stamp of faith: and to believe <hi>all
Christianity is rain'd</hi> if such a Rescript,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99049:46"/>
nay the Interpretation of the procurers be
any way doubted of. O strange unhappy
times!</p>
               <p>You press farther that according to me
<hi>the Church hath de facto erred in the Bull
and Council</hi> so long treated of. What a
strange boldness is this? you bring an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
against Grammar, against
Logick, and against Divinity, and if this be
not accepted of, you cry <hi>the Church has
err'd.</hi> Your Interpretation is against <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
by your own confession, complaining
of your Adversary for demanding an <hi>Is</hi>
or <hi>Is not,</hi> which is a plain acknowledgment
that your sence is not formally in the
words. It is against Logick, because you
put the <hi>subject</hi> to be part of the <hi>predicate;</hi>
Against Divinity because you would make
the grace of God and heavenly benefits be
bought like Salads in the market, by him
that has most mony. Besides other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
whereof I have explicated some
in my Book of the <hi>Middle State,</hi> and may
have occasion to say more hereafter; And
yet, forsooth, if this sweet Interpretation
be not <hi>gratis</hi> admitted of, <hi>the Church has
err'd, the Church has err'd,</hi> and all's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
well a day, well a day.</p>
               <p>You go farther and press that my rule
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99049:47"/>
of faith failes me in this very point. And
first you appeal to <hi>the consciences of all illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Persons,</hi> whether this be not their
<hi>present faith.</hi> Yau have found out a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
very fit to gain your cause in. But I
wonder you are so little skill'd in spirituall
direction, that you do not know, most il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
men never reflect upon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acts, or farther then what belongs
to the fancy, not one amongst ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand:
And you deceive me if you hold faith
to be an act of the fancy. Yet I dare not
be too bold, for I have heard of one that
wore a plush cloak and could neither read
nor write. Wherefore it is enough for me
to deny it, whether it be your opinion
or no.</p>
               <p>Besides do you not know that even <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
Persons, unless Divines, are not to
mince the doctrin taught them by their
Pastours so far as to distinguish what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
for <hi>faith</hi> what as necessary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it, or to the Practise of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
life: Further you may know that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
even of your own <hi>eminent Divines</hi> differ
not only in what points <hi>are of faith</hi> what
<hi>not,</hi> but in what <hi>makes</hi> them <hi>to be of faith</hi>
what <hi>not.</hi> Though I think they all agree
that an explication against Grammar and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99049:47"/>
Logick does not rayse a position into an
Article of faith, though the explication be
of a Popes Bull.</p>
               <p>Next, you tell your adversary that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
White him self says</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the
<hi>great was the first founder of that faith.</hi>
I know well you accompt <hi>Master White</hi>
a kind of a mad man, that dares advance
such propositions as he cannot but foresee
what strong opposition they were like to
stir up against him. But I did not think he
was so mad, as holding no doctrin to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to faith which began since the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
daies, who are the last revealers of publik
faith that he knows of, and besides profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssing
this doctrin so far from faith that it is
not true, yet should tell you that <hi>Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
founded this faith.</hi> As far as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
what I sayd was, that <hi>Saint Gregory</hi>
reported this novelty first broke out in his
dayes by the means of certain revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And this I sayd upon the authority of
<hi>Venerable Bede,</hi> who attributes the book
of Dialogues to <hi>Saint Gregory.</hi> But now I
must tell you that upon fuller considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I rather believe <hi>Venerable Bede's</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
was defective, then to attribute
so unworthy a book to so grave and
learned a Pope; nothing like such winter
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99049:48"/>
tales as are told in that book being found
in his most worthy and learned works.
And I will make your self, whom I know a
great admirer of that learned and pious
Doctour, Judg of the controversy. Do you
think there is in the next world Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
and restorings to communion as is
exprest in one of those Revelations? Do
you think that one who dy'd <hi>obstinate in
schism</hi> was sent to Purgatory because he
did many Alms as is reported in another
Revelation? do you think it is not the
fancy of an Idle brain to imagin Souls are
sent to bathes to scrub and rub men there
to be acquitted of their sins? Other things
there are in the same book worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
but these are enough to shew it unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of <hi>St. Gregory;</hi> as indeed it is for so great
a Doctour and Prelate to spend his time in
gathering together private storyes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and petty Relaters. This will set this
Doctrin an hundred years later, and into
an age one of the least cultivated since the
beginning of the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Nor is it true that <hi>this carries after it a
practise testified by Foundations, Prayers,
Masses, Almes, &amp;c.</hi> For all these were in
the Church before this Doctrin, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in Antiquity. The Church of <hi>Afrik</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:99049:48"/>
made a Canon to force the laity to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to Prayers for the dead about Saint
<hi>Austins</hi> time, who yet testifies that the
question whether Souls were deliver'd out
of Purgatory before the day of Judgment
had not yet been moved. Now <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
contradict this Doctrin, rather then
promote it. For he that makes a <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
intends it without limit of time; and
so must imagin the Soul needs the assistance
of that charity so long; which would
much cool the devotion you pretend, and
we see practis'd before our eyes, to get
Masses enow in a morning to send a Soul to
Heaven to dinner. Shew me but one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Instance where two or three thousand
Masses have been by Legacy procur'd to be
said the very next morning after the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's
departure, and little or nothing after
that morning; and I will ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it the best argument you have produc'd
in the whole managing of your cause.</p>
               <p>After the Author of the <hi>Dialogue</hi> there
was no more news of this opinion till
<hi>Odilo,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Cluny's,</hi> time: who being
a kind of a Generall of many Monasteries,
dilated this Doctrin in them, upon a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ground to build a matter of Faith on, to
wit, the report of a French Pilgrim who
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99049:49"/>
sayd he had met with an Hermite (I think
a French man) who perswaded himself he
had Visions of Souls being deliver'd out of
Purgatory by the Prayers of the Monks of
<hi>Cluny.</hi> Upon this ground the good Saint
recommended the devotion for the dead
warmly to his subjects, and they to the
people who frequented their Monasteries:
and hence this Doctrin came to be common
where his order was in esteem. And so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a pious credulity stay'd about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years till the School began. Which;
finding it very common, easily favour'd it
with such reasons and explications as they
thought fit, though not universally, for some
are found to have contradicted it, and so it
was exalted to a <hi>probable opinion.</hi> In which
state the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> found it, and
practis'd it, giving communion 'to the
Greeks, (who as is before declar'd) left it
out of their confession, after the Latins had
put it in theirs. And in this quality it
persever'd till my book <hi>de medio statu</hi> was
turn'd into English. Then it began first to
be a matter of faith, by the power of the
great letters you put in the Edition of the
Bull of <hi>Benedictus,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
For, before that, even the consorts
of your Tenet held it no otherwise then
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99049:49"/>
for the common opinion of Divines.</p>

               <p>YOur eighteenth Section you begin
with saying, <hi>my Doctrin</hi> (which is a
close adhering to Tradition) <hi>is the way to
make fools stray.</hi> You follow still the same
truantly humour of using words without
looking into the sence. For, if Tradition
signify the delivery of the Doctrin preach't
and taught by our forefathers, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99049:50"/>
signifies that to follow what we
are taught by our forefathers is the way to
make fools go astray. Neither do I deny
but that you speak consequently, if first
you make the Popes veracity the veracity
of the whole Church, and that all the
Church but he can err, and consequently
he may correct the Doctrin which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
by the Church in the age immediatly
going before him; then 'tis true that to
prefer the Belief of the former age before
the Popes word will <hi>lead fools astray.</hi> But
for my part I desire to be one of those
fools, and to go so astray. You run on
in a full careere, and tell us of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church and Councils in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and that things settled by them must
not be brought in question, not seeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you will not, that what the Church
believ'd in the last Age is more the Church's
decree, then what she speaks either by Pope
or Council, unless she speaks the same
that she believed the last Age: and so,
you continue your discoursing with
words, not taking their meaning along
with you.</p>
               <p>In your nineteenth Section you come so
home as to judge and condemn me by mine
own Doctrin, a great shame to me, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99049:50"/>
if you make it good. You argue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>what have we seen but Masses, Dirges,
Almes, &amp;c.</hi> so far is almost true; but why
did you not put in, <hi>by which in express terms
we pray'd for the welfare of the Souls at the
day of the General Judgment?</hi> but you had
reason to leave that out, for it would have
set a shrewd puzzell in your Argument.
We have <hi>heard constantly</hi> (say you) <hi>that
Souls are deliver'd out of Purgatory by these
powerfull helps before the day of Judgment?</hi>
In this part you have mended your former
fault, for there you sayd too little to serve
your purpose, if you had prov'd all you said;
and here you say more then can be prov'd
to serve your purpose: do you mean that
your way was preach't <hi>constantly,</hi> that is,
as a certain and establisht Doctrin of faith?
or that for <hi>a long time</hi> they preacht it as a
<hi>probable</hi> truth? or, without engaging at all
into the degree of its assuredness? but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you proceed more nicely, since you
onely said you <hi>heard it constantly,</hi> not that
it was <hi>preach'd constantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> For to say a thing
<hi>constantly,</hi> imports that the speaker teaches
it to be <hi>certain,</hi> and it is not enough if <hi>for a
long time</hi> he tells you it is <hi>likely</hi> to be so.
Now so far as concerns the delivery of
Souls from Purgatory by the potent means
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99049:51"/>
you speak of was ever <hi>constantly taught,</hi> but
that the delivery should be made before the
day of Judgment, was taught but as a <hi>pious
opinion,</hi> if the Preacher understood the
sence of the Doctours of the Schools them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who add no such qualification: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
their principles being either Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or Reason, they find in Authority nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fathers, nor Councils, nor Popes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
in the point, and Reasons much less
favourable, and to say the truth though
they are apt enough to dispute whether
there be a God, a Trinity, an Incarnation,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I do not remember to have heard
of any one who hath treated of his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
so directly as to dispute it <hi>pro</hi> and
<hi>con.</hi> Which being so, what certainty can
we expect a Preacher should fix upon this
Doctrin.</p>
               <p>But to declare what I think those whom
you appeal to will answer: I beleeve it is,
that they never reflected to make any
<hi>difference</hi> of the things the Preachers deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
them, and much less upon the <hi>degrees
of assent</hi> they gave to this or that point, and
as far as they can tell they gave the <hi>same</hi>
assent to any place of Scripture the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
explicated, as they did to this point; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
some particular occasion put them in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99049:51"/>
mind to qualify one and not the other. But,
as they found by experience in other things
that if any rub came to make them doubt
of any thing a Preacher sayd, then first they
began to consider on what grounds they
were bound to believe the point proposed,
so they have done in this, and of those who
have spent any competent time in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both sides, many have discover'd your
grounds unsafe to build any certainty on,
and some confest them too weak to sustain
even so much as a probability. What the
Gentleman, whose letter you cite (and
with some imprudent circumstances) will
say, why he was carryed away with your
Arguments, I know not; but had he read
my Books as much as I esteem his learning
and vertue; he would surely have met with
full answers to your very objections:
which they who read yours cannot do;
nor so much as hear of the Arguments I use
to maintain my opinion; you on set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
concealing them; and proposing, in
their stead, as my whole grounds, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
made to a meer Philosopher or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
where the method of a regular wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
oblig'd me to <hi>abstract</hi> from Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But that this answer I set down is for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99049:52"/>
the greatest part of those that follow this
opinion, a true one, is not onely manifest
to all that reflect upon what passeth within
them on the like occasions, but experience
hath taught me it in every country where I
have conversed since the publishing this
Doctrin. In all which I have found di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
who upon hearing of it acknowledg'd
that before they had in their hearts a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
dislike of your opinion, but they knew
not why; it having a kind of an uncouth
semblance, yet they could not pitch upon
any thing to say solidly against it. One
passage I will intreat your patience to let
me tell you: Before I printed it, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
this point to one of the greatest
Divines of Christendome, and confest to be
so. He presently reply'd it was against the
Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and went immediately
to his Chamber and fetcht down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
when we had a little debated the text,
and he saw it did not reach home, he shut
up the Book, with these words. <hi>Look to it,
you will draw all the Regulars upon your
back,</hi> meaning all such of them, as found
great profit by perswading the people they
should procure a sudden redemption of
their friends out of Purgatory, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
are those you speak of that <hi>hear not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99049:52"/>
of this Doctrin without horrour.</hi> Therefore,
Acute Sir, you will or may see that your
Argument is two edged, and as the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
you speak of did not distinguish the
degree of assent to this position from that
they give to Faith, so neither do they make
any difference between it and the sleightest
assent they have. Thus may your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
by your Argument conclude any
practise of the Church, or common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Preachers, or generally receiv'd Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
storyes, nay even the new holy
dayes to be points of faith, as well and as
easily as you do this. What difference of
assent, think you, do the People make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these truths, that there was a Saint
<hi>Philip</hi> or Saint <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that there was a
Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> or Saint <hi>Augustin?</hi> they
hear of these far oftner then of those, and
seldom or never, of the severall degrees
wherein they are recommended to their
assents. Even the more prudent in many
such points run currently on with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguishing
assent, till something jog
their thoughts, and awaken them to look
into the business, then they begin to make
it a question, to examin and sift it, and at
last to settle it in its true box of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
or Theological or Historical faith,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99049:53"/>
or of some other inferiour assent.</p>
               <p>You go on to perswade your Readers,
that those who <hi>accept</hi> of this Doctrin do
it through <hi>comfortable apprehensions in lieu
of great horrours before they were in, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it eases their consciences from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
care of assisting their dead friends.</hi>
In the first, you manifestly shew you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not the Doctrin of your own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;
for, we agree in the grievousness of
the punishments, or if we disagree in any
thing, it is that mine is the severer. For the
difference of our positions is not in what
the punishments are, which we both agree
to be <hi>acts of the will:</hi> Our difference is,
whether these acts of the will be caused by
the force of <hi>nature</hi> in spirits, as I say; or
by the force of <hi>material fire,</hi> as your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
maintain. Which was the cause why
when I explicated the nature of Hell in a
Divinity lecture, one of my Scholars told
me, I made Hell worse then it was. For in
truth the force of a material body is not to
be compared to the strong activity of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
spirit, as any Divine will easily
guess.</p>
               <p>In your other point you seem to have
fram'd your conceit out of conversation
with Women and Children, whose desires
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99049:53"/>
are violent at the instant, but soon pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
and not out of the consideration of
men whose counsels are govern'd by a far
prospect, and aym at perpetuity. So you
flatter poor Women with the hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
their friends the first morning, or
the first Saturday, or in some speedy time,
and get present monies fit to make merry
with for one day; never reflecting that
the ancient and manly charity for the dead
was to establish <hi>Foundations,</hi> and <hi>perpetual
Anniversaries;</hi> by which the memory of
our friends, and prayers for them was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
renew'd, and long continu'd; whereas
taking your Principles, we need neither
much <hi>fear the terrours of Purgatory,</hi> nor
seek new wayes to <hi>ease our Consciences from
the incumbent care of assisting our departed
friends,</hi> since one Mass at a priviledg'd Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
will do the work alone, and a very little
sum of mony procure that Mass without
going to the cost of Dirige's and such like
chargable Offices. And here I must ask my
Readers &amp; my Adversary's leave to correct
one suspition I had unawares entertain'd,
that Interest might have some influence
upon the Defenders of this short stay in
Purgatory; I was deceiv'd, and now I see
they are no wayes accusable of that odious
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99049:54"/>
crime: anciently great alms were given,
and those often repeated, for the assistance
of one Soul; and so the Church and
Church-men gain'd much, and grew rich
apace; Now, there is open'd a far cheaper
way; one piece alone, and that of silver
too, dispatches the business. Surely out
fair and numerous and rich Monasteryes
were not built and endow'd with such pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Contributions.</p>
               <p>After this you proceed to the arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of me before my Bishop or a <hi>Nuncius
Apostolicus.</hi> But there want two things
to make your arraignment good: first that
the people be inur'd to Tradition, and to
prefer the received Faith of the Church
before all other Doctrins. From the danger
of which your Divines will secure me,
while they teach the People that the
Church when it is sayd to be inerrable, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the Pope alone, that all the People
may err, that General Councils have no
strength till they be seal'd by the Pope, and
so I shal have this help to appeal from them
to the Pope, let my Doctrin be as opposit
as it will to all that hath been hitherto the
belief of the Christian world. The second
thing that wants to the perfect arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is that you have not yet found out so
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99049:54"/>
weak a Bishop, that will believe a Doctrin
sprung from uncertain Visions, foster'd by
unlearned zeal, and strengthen'd with an
Exposition of a Council or of a Popes Bull,
against the rules of Grammar, Logick, and
Divinity, is the belief of the present
Church. In the mean while I give you
great thanks both for your setting forth my
plea against <hi>Luther,</hi> and honouring it with
so high an approbation that it <hi>thunders and
lightens home.</hi> For, besides that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that form of proceeding against
Hereticks is very necessary, it will give me a
testimony that I am a good Christian, and
if I be not a very beast I have not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an errour to fall under so gross
and so well fore-seen a Censure. To the
charge it self, from what I have already
said you may gather my clear and full
Ansver; that the Doctrin I sustain is not
by me pretended <hi>to be of faith</hi> but onely <hi>not
against faith:</hi> as also, that the doctrin I
oppose, is not and Article of faith, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by <hi>Fathers and Monuments of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and immemorable Custome,</hi> but onely
an <hi>Opinion</hi> not very ancient, nor ratify'd
by the consent of Fathers, nor of so long a
standing that it's beginning is not well
enough known: perhaps, the later, yet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99049:55"/>
for its time as much prevailing doctrin of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd
Altars</hi> may live to be as old as this
is now, and as common too; will it therfore
deserve to be put into our Creed? or can
it ever become an <hi>Article of faith</hi> which
the whole Church professes is but an <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
now? And are not these differences
betwixt <hi>Luthers</hi> case and mine, whom you
so charitably endevour to parallel, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to distinguish our dooms? Examin
them but once more, and I will make you
my Judg. Onely forget not these words
which your self put down as part of my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to convince an heretick, <hi>That the
Authority of things which wee stand bound
to beleeve, descends handed down from
CHRIST our B. SAVIOVR and no
otherwise, even till this age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In your twentieth Section you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to examin the Councill of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
once more against me. Your first
mistake is that it was <hi>the business of the
Council</hi> in <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>declare the faith of the
Church concerning the state of Souls which
depart this life.</hi> I mean not to speak to
your History, for as much as was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
of Souls was agreed in <hi>Ferrara,</hi>
but to the word <hi>business;</hi> for their business
was onely to agree two points; one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99049:55"/>
                  <hi>material fire:</hi> the other, about the
<hi>Just Souls presently seeing God,</hi> which was
the business of <hi>Benedictus</hi> his Bull, and some
of the Greeks were of the same apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with <hi>John</hi> the 22. But you like an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomer
considering the phoenomena's of
the Definition frame the question out of
that, whereas all the rest was no <hi>business,</hi>
but the compleating of the doctrin by dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it out of tenets agreed without and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any controversy. Your next errour is,
that whereas you pretend to compare my
doctrin with the councils, you do it to the
doctrin of the parts of the Council, when it
is a clear case, the doctrin of <hi>one part</hi> is not
the doctrin of the <hi>Council,</hi> but that in
which the <hi>whole Council</hi> agrees. Your third
Errour (if it be not a willfull aequivocation)
is, that you say the Latins <hi>believe</hi> material
Fire in Purgatory; which, if you mean by
<hi>belief, Catholick faith,</hi> is extremely absurd;
Since they joyn co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the Greeks,
who profess the contrary; if you mean only
they held it <hi>as a probable opinion,</hi> you cosen
your Auditory, which expects you should
speak of <hi>Faith,</hi> and not of that from which I
may dissent by authority of the Council.
Your fourth rather malice than mistakes is,
that you impose upon me, that there is <hi>no
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99049:56"/>
purging of Souls before reunion;</hi> for all who
know that <hi>actio</hi> is <hi>prior termino</hi> will allow a
<hi>purging</hi> before a <hi>being purged,</hi> as going to
<hi>London</hi> is before being there. Besides your
oft repeated fault of mischarging me to hold
that the Soules irregular affections are the
torments of purgatory. Your fifth errour
is, that you put an opposition betwixt the
Latins and me where we perfectly agree in
all, save onely that intruded word <hi>by this
Fire</hi> which comes out of a former, and
spoils the whole tenet of the Latins from
being a matter of Faith, making it but a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable-opinion</hi>
in whole, though the other
parts belong to faith. You add, <hi>the Latins
must needs have thrust</hi> me <hi>out of communion,</hi>
not reflecting that they gave communion
to the Greeks who dissented in all you have
alledged <hi>truly</hi> against mee. As to the
Greeks. First you say I hold against them
that Souls are in no place. And though I
cannot affirm positively what the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Greeks was at the Council in
this point; yet knowing their Fathers
use, when they speak of spirits, to call
<hi>working</hi> in a place, <hi>being</hi> in a place, I
am well assur'd they would not thrust me
out of their Society for denying a true lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality
in spirits. The second objection is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99049:56"/>
by my answer to the Latins, and the
same is to be sayd to the third: Of your
last objection concerning the efficacy of the
helps because you say you will evidence it,
I must expect the fulfilling your promise, till
then it is but a threatning likely to be of
little effect.</p>
               <p>You end with a great confidence that
you have dispatch't this business, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
your adversary, unless he will stand
upon the <hi>Errability of the Council.</hi> For you
(imagining your self inerrable in your rash
and shallow interpretation of it) cannot
(alas <hi>good Christian!)</hi> imagin any other
possible way to maintain the conclusion:
I on the other side, hope I have sayd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that may help your imagination, but
dare entertain no great apprehension that
I shall <hi>convert you,</hi> knowing I have not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the main foundation of your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is setled in your will, upon
grounds beyond my removall.</p>
               <p>Yet in the 21 Section you are forced to
retire from your fair hopes, for your <hi>great
words</hi> satisfy your adversary no more then
your <hi>Capital letters.</hi> His answer in substance
is, that you misconstrue the Pope and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
as it hath been declar'd by him and me
before? And that the purgation before
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99049:57"/>
the day of Judgment may be <hi>suppos'd</hi>
but not <hi>defin'd.</hi> And clearly enough, such is
both the Popes and the Council's meaning
as is before more largely insisted on; which
being the onely knot of the controversy,
you do well to prepare loud clamours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and tell us it is a pitifull evasion.
Let us then suppose it were <hi>judg'd</hi> by the
Pope to be the <hi>more probable</hi> opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Divines that Souls were purg'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day of Judgment, though he held
the other was also probable, which I think
you will not say impossible for a Pope,
since divers have gone that way in other
matters. In this case was it fit the Pope
should define what became of such Souls or
no? if you say he could and should define,
what is become of all your clamours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
defining upon a supposition which
afterwards may be found to be <hi>impossible?</hi>
For he that judges an opinion onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
leaves a probability, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be true; since whoever sayes
one side is <hi>but probable</hi> as far as concerns
science sayes it <hi>may be false,</hi> for any thing
he knows. Now, things that have a settled
course in nature are so dispos'd that <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi>
is concomitant to <hi>falsity,</hi> nor can
it ever be prov'd to be <hi>false</hi> unless it be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99049:57"/>
prov'd to be <hi>impossible.</hi> So that the Pope in
defining <hi>the coming to heaven of such Souls,</hi>
proceeds not consequently to his <hi>opinion</hi> if he
doth not go upon a supposition that himself
confesses may be impossible, and yet in all
prudence he must define it as being but an
extension of this his main question <hi>whether
Saints go immediatly to heaven.</hi> If you say
he could not or ought not to define such a
conditionall case, who will or can believe
you that hath any prudence; since, for the
position it self, He both thought it the more
probable and saw it concern'd the most am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
part of his division <hi>of Saints going to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
For all christians imagin more go to
heaven through Purgatory, then either by
the vertue of baptism or by eminency
of Purity and Sanctity acquir'd in this
world. So that I persuade my self you
would easily allow the Pope not only could,
but ought, in case he thought both sides
probable to proceed as he did in his defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.
Now, that this was the Pope's case
is absolutely certain and more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
since we cannot doubt but it was the
case of the Latines in the Council of <hi>Flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
in which the Greeks by their leaving
our the expression of some being deliver'd
<hi>sooner,</hi> some <hi>later,</hi> directly wav'd that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99049:58"/>
and by consequence refused to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
an Article of faith, if this were one, and
yet, without any repugnance or quarrelling
about this circumstance, were admitted to
communion and a common decree made
in which the Latines position was abstracted
from, as you may plainly see in the Council,
and is before more fully declar'd.</p>
               <p>Now as to your argument, every one
can see 'tis weakly done to talk of actions
proceeding out of knowledg or apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not according to the <hi>apprehension</hi> but
according as <hi>things</hi> really are: He that
thinks two opinions probable takes both as
possible whether they be or no. For, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they are in themselves, to him they
appear so. Now to argue out of the nature
of <hi>things,</hi> which he professes not to <hi>know,</hi>
to the <hi>actions</hi> that must flow from his <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,</hi>
is a clear inconsequence. Yet all
your great clamours have no other ground,
and therefore I think I may leave out your
petty quarrells with your Adversary about
his examples, as superfluous, and nothing
conducing to the main point in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.</p>

               <p>DEar Sir, (that I may, following your
Directions though not your Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99049:59"/>
begin like a <hi>Love-Letter)</hi> by chance I
had turn'd over a leaf too much, and so
lighted on the beginning of your 22 Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
in which you design'd to <hi>give a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
view of my Doctrin,</hi> and so I hop'd to
have been quit of the former controversy,
and could willingly upon that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have endur'd the bitter dissemblings
wherewith you end this Chapter. But
finding you fall back to the same quarrel
again, I perceive you had condemn'd me to
the Oar for another Caravan: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I must repeat to you, that you talk so
unskilfully of faith, as if there were none
but in Popes Bulls, and Definitions of
Councils: As if the Apostles had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
preaching that such a Council had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
such an Article, and such a Pope the
other. And so you ask a monstrous questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>How if some Imp of Hell should arise,
and admit onely a Metaphorical and not a
real Son</hi> in Divinis, <hi>how could this blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
be repress'd by</hi> Consubstantialem Patri?
A shrewd question I confess, for it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
the termes, that it is very hard to
make sence of them. First, I would know
what you mean by that terme <hi>in Divinis;</hi>
Whether in the substance of God? or in
The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>logy, or speaking of God? For if you
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99049:59"/>
speak of the Essence, the Arrians never
held a Metaphorical son in the Essence of
<hi>God,</hi> but in the Essence of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do I think any who understand a
<hi>Modicum</hi> of Divinity, can put so foolish a
Position, that to be a <hi>Son</hi> should be to be
<hi>God,</hi> or the very <hi>Essence</hi> of God; and yet
should be so solely <hi>Metaphorical</hi> that it
should be <hi>no reality.</hi> But if you mean that
there was no Son in God, but some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
was call'd <hi>Son</hi> as the <hi>Arrians</hi> held,
then what signifies this word <hi>in Divinis?</hi>
rub over your old School-notions again a
little, before you put your self in print.
Now against these was made the <hi>Nicen</hi>
creed, and not against the former. But I
must advertise you that by your high skill
in Divinity, you should have fram'd a new
nature of <hi>Metaphors,</hi> to have come home
to your position. For I doubt not, you can
as well <hi>square Grammar</hi> as <hi>Philosophy</hi> to
<hi>Divinity.</hi> Then, in our way, who look into
nature to know what a <hi>Metaphor</hi> is, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear's
to be the use of a word in a second
sence, derived from a former. And so, how
you jumble together <hi>onely a metaphorical
and not a reall Son,</hi> I do not understand.
For they have no more connexion then
<hi>green</hi> and <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99049:60"/>
you please to compound into strong non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?
<hi>Reality</hi> speaks nature; <hi>metaphorical,</hi>
a manner of speech, yet both these must
be joyn'd to condemn some Trinobant to
be an <hi>Imp of Hell.</hi> And why such fierce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
words; <hi>Miscreant and Imp of
Hell?</hi> I remember indeed the furious zeal
of a Pharisee let fly at our blessed Saviour,
language far worse then this; but whether
my Chider be Pharisee, or Publican, or
both, or neither, I know not, God knows,
and God forgive him, and bless me with
grace to take patiently all his injuries, and
I hope he will give me strength to refute his
arguments.</p>
               <p>But let us look into the thing it self, and
seek how a <hi>Son</hi> is spoken of God. And, let
our first question be, what those people who
first brought the words of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi>
into use mean't to explicate by them. And
I know nothing, but that they mean't by
<hi>Father</hi> a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who by means of a Woman
produc't a creature like to himself; by <hi>Son,</hi>
a creature <hi>thus</hi> produc't. This then must be
evidently the <hi>first</hi> signification of the
words, and if another be attributed to
them by <hi>design,</hi> not pure hazard, they must
be acknowledg'd to be <hi>translated</hi> from this
first signification to that next; as when
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99049:60"/>
he that converts one to faith or good life
is call'd his <hi>Father,</hi> the person converted, his
<hi>Son.</hi> Now, because <hi>translations</hi> are made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
divers kinds of connexions of the things
signify'd, not all but such a one onely, as is
translated for a <hi>proportion</hi> or likeness, is
called a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> as a Governour or <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernator</hi>
in Latin, first signifies the Master
or Pilot which governs a Ship, thence its
translated by reason of similitude or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to him that in a City or Common-wealth
behaves himself as the Master or
Pilot doth in a Ship. Now, let us affirm
something of God by this word <hi>Father,</hi>
Will you say, the word was not translated
to him from a former signification, but
given him by pure hazard, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to a fore-used sense? Sure either you
or the Readers will not be so senceless. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
then to see by what connexion it
was translated. Certainly not that it was
a cause or effect, or a concomitant, for all
these are more improper, but because there
is a similitude or proportion, seeing that in
God, another Person proceeds in likeness
to him, from him. Therefore a <hi>Father</hi> is
spoken of God <hi>metaphorically.</hi> And if you
but consider the language, you use by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
and not by understanding, you would
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99049:61"/>
know it were <hi>onely metaphorically</hi> spoken of
God, that is to say in <hi>no other</hi> signification
of the Word; not by a <hi>Metonymie, Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi>
or <hi>Catachresis,</hi> nor in the <hi>first</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
For these are the termes which
are excluded when <hi>onely</hi> is added to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically:</hi>
and not the terme <hi>really,</hi>
which is a manner of <hi>being</hi> not of <hi>speaking,</hi>
and so cannot be oppos'd to metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by one who understands the words he
speaks. You will say you scorn these Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Lectures, and I believe you; but
such pride hath brought you to call the
<hi>principall</hi> Fathers of the Church, and her
best Divines, <hi>Imps of Hell,</hi> for all these
say the same I do in this point. <hi>You must</hi>
have some <hi>miscreants</hi> to accompany your
<hi>Imps:</hi> Therefore you would have a <hi>miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
teach that a moderate affection to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is a less crime then an immoderate
love to a Wife,</hi> and, because this latter is no
breach of Gods <hi>Commandments,</hi> as your
Discourse imports, therefore he must be a
<hi>miscreant</hi> that should say it. O what want
had <hi>Solomon</hi> of such a Ghostly Father? to
tell him that <hi>to love his Wives immoderately
was no breach of the Commandments,</hi> And
that to love them so, as out of that love to
fill <hi>Hierusalem</hi> with Idols and Idolatrous
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99049:61"/>
Worship, was not far worse then a
<hi>moderate,</hi> or rather an ordinary (for none
is <hi>moderate,</hi> none but is sinful enough) love
of a Concubine. Surely you have quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
that excellent sentence of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
<hi>He that hates not his Wife, can be none
of his Disciple;</hi> or, as it is expres't in ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
place, <hi>he that loveth his Wife more then
him;</hi> For I have heard say, that by these
words, is signified as much as <hi>he that loves
his Wife immoderately.</hi> Surely he was no
<hi>miscreant,</hi> that preach't to men <hi>to loavo
their Wives,</hi> if they would not let the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

serve God quietly.</p>
               <p>After this in your 22 Sect. you arm
up your Fathers, and set St. <hi>Austin</hi> in front
to make a great shew with his name, For
in his words nothing is to be found for
your purpose. And, indeed, it is an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to cite him for your opinion, who
professes expresly <hi>(ad Dulcit. quaest. 1.)</hi> the
question had not yet been handled before
his time, but might hereafter, but that he
knew not whether side would prove true.
Yet you will give him a paper in his hand
to hold forth, though it contains nothing
but the profession of your Adversary. And
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot to take notice of the doubtfulness of
the two latter Books you cite, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99049:62"/>
in them that your Adbersary will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but has already explicated them. But
if you fail in Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> you will help
it out by <hi>Origen</hi> who sayes too much for
you, being known to speak heretically
when he uses those phrases you cite out of
him. For, his opinion was that <hi>Purgatory</hi>
began <hi>after the day of Judgment,</hi> and the
sentence given by Christ; according to
which some were to be <hi>longer,</hi> some <hi>shorter</hi>
in torments, but all to be freed at last. And
this he expresses by the words you cite,
and you should have brought some words
by which it might appear he spake of Souls
before the day of Judgment. But you have
a salve against this, saying, <hi>he wrote this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was an Heretick.</hi> By which it is
clear you speak at randome, for he fell not
to be an Heretick, by a set occasion, as some
others did, but as long as he liv'd was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a great Doctor of the Church,
and his Heresies not discover'd untill after
his death, and even then defended to be
none of his, but to have been foysted in by
Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Your next Author is <hi>St. Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
a man of very great worth and au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of whom <hi>Petavius</hi> that famous Jesuit
sayes, that some in his time, more piously
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99049:62"/>
then either truly or wisely, striv'd to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
some places of his which did savour of
<hi>Origenism.</hi> But <hi>Germanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
ancienter then <hi>Photius,</hi> defends
this great man; yet not without admitting
the <hi>Origenists</hi> had mingled some sentences
of their own here and there in his works.
Now this <hi>Germanus</hi> his Book is not extant,
and therefore such places as use the <hi>Orige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
phrases are suspected ones. Specially
the Book you cite is excepted against. <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevinus</hi>
rejects it absolutely, others object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, that 'tis corrupted by the <hi>Origenists</hi>
in divers other points, so that it is neither
certain the book you cite is his, nor if it be,
that it can carry authority, where the
phrase is <hi>Origenical,</hi> as this word <hi>Ignis Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorius</hi>
is, and avoided much by Greek
Fathers, because it is so notorious in <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi>
I have not the Book, and so I cannot
speak expresly to the words. In conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you make the Judgment of the Ages
before those strange Revelations, which
<hi>Gregorius Dialogus</hi> (as the Greeks call
him, and say him to be the Pope whose suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
was <hi>Zacharias,</hi> who lived about the
midst of the eighth Age) hath left us, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Odilo</hi> who lived about six hundred
years agoe, out of three Fathers; whereof
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99049:63"/>
one sayes nothing special for your Doctrin,
and is certainly against it. The second was
notoriously an Heretick, and the words you
cite pertinent to the explication of his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy.
The third's words are certainly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the followers of the second, and
the Book out of which you cite the place
rejected by learned Catholicks, yet this you
call the <hi>consent of Fathers,</hi> and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of those ages to which I appeal.</p>
               <p>But now comes such an impiety as <hi>should
make a Christian sink for shame,</hi> to wit, that
I say <hi>Virgils Purgatory is more rational then
yours.</hi> But what would you have me do, I
did not know that all the light of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
consisted in certain private Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>quarum nox conscia sola est.</hi> Now
that you have told me so, I will mend as
soon as I shall believe you: mean while, till
then, I may conceive a man of wit may
conjecture or feign likelier thing; then we
find in such visions, as go generally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd
with some circumstance against the
nature of Christian life. Nor do I fear your
exposition of the Councils will stand cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nised
in Christian Creeds; however you
assume the confidence to nickname such
shallow conceits of your own Catholick
Faith all over your Book. You follow the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99049:63"/>
same matter by citing places out of the
publick Liturgies; of which all but one are
purely indifferent to both parties, even in
the very out side of the words; and that
one easily explicable in a sence consistent
with mine. You brave me to find out a new
construction of <hi>Ante diem rationis,</hi> and I
tell you I have found one of which I never
heard before, and 'tis in your book, and in
this very place, <hi>pag.</hi> 83. wherein striving to
apply that excellent Hymn to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
you mistake it I think as much as
'tis possible. First you make the Priest speak
in the person of the <hi>dead,</hi> whereas the
whole style of the Hymn runs clearly in the
person of him that prayes, and in the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
<hi>Quid sum miser tunc dicturus,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>supplicanti parce Deus. Contremisco, mei
finis.</hi> With which person suit these words
best? that of the <hi>dead,</hi> or of the <hi>Priest?</hi>
Secondly, your Argument must suppose
him to pray for delivery from <hi>Purgatory;</hi>
let's see how you hit it in this: <hi>Ne perenni
cremer igne,</hi> can these words agree with
<hi>Purgatory?</hi> Thirdly, you bring this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to prove he asks Delivery <hi>before the
day of Judgment.</hi> Sure, in this branch you
will have better luck; and yet he that reads
the Hymn but once unslubberingly over
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99049:64"/>
(which certainly you have often red over)
will easily pick out another meaning from
<hi>Quando Judex est venturus, &amp;c. cum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surget
creatura, &amp;c. ne me perdas illa die.</hi>
Can there be possibly words more clearly
contradictive of what you pretend? which
yet is more confirm'd &amp; made plain by the
fix last lines where the Hymn begins to
change its meeter, and then passes evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Priest to the person pray'd for,
<hi>Huic ergo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>spare him,</hi> whereas before it
ran perpetually with <hi>me;</hi> and from <hi>eternal
fire</hi> to the style us'd in praying for Souls in
<hi>Purgatory.</hi> But perhaps you saw the Latin
would not so well serve your passion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you either find or make a Translation
of it into English verse, and cite us three
lines of it. Truly I do not take my self
bound to answer such authorities, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when they are grosly mistranslated with
a soul corruption, of which I suspect you
knew well enough; since the verses are
printed in a late Book whose venerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
you often converse with, and there
they are, <hi>my long black score, &amp;c.</hi> which
you hastily if not maliciously change into
<hi>their long, &amp;c.</hi> Is this the performance of
your promise in this very Section, to be <hi>no
Niggard to your Reader?</hi> when you thus
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99049:64"/>
notably, in the Scotch phrase, <hi>spare the
truth.</hi> Which indeed appears to mean in
this Hymn, onely an expression of fear
concerning the rigorous examination at
the day of Judgment, with a desire to be
handled then in mercy, else what an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
request were it, to beg so solemnly
one hour, nay, one minutes anticipation of
delivery, for even thus much would satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
(were yours the right interpretation)
that moderate petition of <hi>Ante diem ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
But becaus you will cry out upon Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
expressions, though you use them your
self and those lewdly corrupted: I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to apprehend, this Hymn or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
was put into the Mass, not compos'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
expresly for it, as the Gospels, Epistles, and
other parts of the Mass were: but was made
for a Meditation upon the Judgment day.
And so the true meaning of the words are
<hi>before thou comest to count with me,</hi> that is,
<hi>before my death.</hi> The other citations are
not worth the writing over, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both sides.</p>
               <p>In the 23 Section, you begin to display
your Rhetorick which I am very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with for two reasons. The chief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
It is fitter then Divinity to be made a
bawble of, The other because a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99049:65"/>
will be sufficient to answer as many
leaves as you employ in it, that is some four
whole Sections, which I intend almost quite
to leave out, they being made for disport
and without proof of any thing save onely
of this, that you mightily affect the humor
of railing without sence or reason. Yet I
would desire you to note, that it is one
thing to say this <hi>is to be done,</hi> another to
say <hi>I can do it.</hi> True it is, I think demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
may be made in Divinity, but I
have not ever said of any particular point,
that I have demonstrated it. (I leave that
to the judgement of the Readers.) Nay not
so much as that I ever attempted it. In my
two <hi>Euclides</hi> I pretended to demonstrate,
but so that I preferr'd not my self before
greater demonstrators who had miss'd, and
so I went with such care, considering that
I also might err in some part. But, where
I used not the form of demonstration, as in
my Institutions and other my little Books,
I never went about to demonstrate. For
those who know never so little concerning
demonstration, know it is one thing to put
a <hi>medium</hi> which bears with it a possibility to
be fram'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto a demonstration; another,
to frame the demonstration. The first is so
common, that we cannot talk of our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99049:65"/>
without using it, in case what we
say be truly consequent. Much less can any
solid Divine frame a long discourse without
doing it. The latter, no body doth but he,
that maketh it his proper task to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in form. Whence you may see how
much you calumniate mee. Besides, you
quite forget the qualifications I ad, in
the places you cite by halves, out of
my bookes; did you not read about the
middle of <hi>Ratio Operis</hi> these words, <hi>Si
enim non potuisse rationem, &amp;c.</hi> to this sence,
<hi>If you say Reason could never have reach't
these mysteries, I freely assent, but that after
Revelation it cannot be satisfy'd I unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeve, till it be prov'd?</hi> Go on, and you
shall immediately meet another omitted
Qualification; That even assisted by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
we cannot penetrate into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
nor any Mystery, <hi>thorowly,</hi> that includes
It. Then come the words, wherein my senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is plainly containd; <hi>But these hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not, that such Demonstration as is given
of God may be found out even of these Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
that is, not thorowly or perfectly, but
some Predicates and truths concerning
them; which every Divine agrees of God,
and I onely extend that kind of demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
to other Articles. This I earnestly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99049:66"/>
intreat the Reader to observe, and when
ever he meets with this accusation laid to
my Charge, that I would <hi>evacuate faith</hi> by
Demonstration, evidence, knowledge, &amp;c.
to understand me still with these qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
which had you fairly mention'd,
they would have very much allayd the heat
of your exceptions. But you cite me som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so interruptedly, and translate me
sometimes so craftily, that I fear you rather
affect to contend plausibly, then improve
either your self, or me, or the world with
any profitable truth. One passage here
you very pardonably english to the worser
sense, for the words indeed are easily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakable;
and they are these, <hi>Sed haec om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
&amp;c.</hi> where I meant not, <hi>Things</hi> in your
sence that is, Mysteries of faith, exprest
by these terms, expressing those Mysteries;
but the <hi>Termes</hi> which <hi>were taught us before
Christ.</hi> As appears, by my words, <hi>Fides in
humano nobis Idiomate tradita est, &amp;c.</hi> words
not so far off but a shorter sight then yours
might have seen them.</p>
               <p>As for what you cite out of my letter to a
Person of worth, that <hi>Divines do not profess
demonstration.</hi> If you mean the <hi>form</hi> of
Demonstration it is so plain there can be
no question of it: If you mean onely that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99049:66"/>
they do not <hi>evidently prove;</hi> how can
those Divines pretend it who think there
is no certainty but in Faith? For the rest
I say no such matter, but hold that both
Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and others have demonstrated
many things, and that my self have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in such demonstrations. Another
accusation is, that <hi>I pretend to take away
Faith in the Manhood of the Church;</hi>
which you should have prov'd. For though
I conceive the <hi>great Scholars</hi> of that time
shall have a large portion of Scierce, yet I
do not know that I ever said the <hi>People</hi>
should have it. The same I conceive hath
ever been in the Church in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
Of which there are manifest signs in
Saint <hi>Denys</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> Saint <hi>Basil,</hi>
Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and others; as
also in the Latin Church, specially in Saint
<hi>Austin, Boetius,</hi> Saint <hi>Auselm,</hi> and others.
But I conceive demonstration will be both
in its <hi>matter,</hi> and in Divines much more
diffus'd then it is yet. So that in the Church
will ever march together <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi>
though in diverse measures.</p>
               <p>Some other little nibblings at my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
(or rather at little bits of it snatcht
from the Context, as your custom is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
taken entire 'tis too difficult for your
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99049:67"/>
teeth) interlace your jollity in these your
Sections of mirth and raillery. As that of
a <hi>dispossest Governour;</hi> which you deform
in the worst manner you can, by leaving
out the Antecedents and Consequents;
which would have let you see that my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
proceeds in the case, that onely his
own <hi>private</hi> interest or <hi>particular</hi> good be
oppos'd and counter-ballanc't to the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like;</hi>
not if the <hi>publick good</hi> be for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storement:
For then my whole Book fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
him. Wherefore to make my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
invidious against the Person you
mean, you must first subsume that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry
is against the common good, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I say nothing against him; but all for
him; and if you subsume this; I believe you
will deserve no great thanks for your offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
mistake, but approve your self his
greatest enemy.</p>
               <p>Next, you are hugely troubled that in
<hi>Rushworth's Dialogues</hi> (which you say are
mine) I make the <hi>letter of the Scripture</hi> so
<hi>uncertain.</hi> And this objection I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you borrow'd from <hi>Doctor Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
whose Book in which he has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against me, and (as I am told) this
very passage, was extant long before yours;
and I doubt not but you read very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99049:67"/>
whatever opposes me. Unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
good wits jump't in their observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which also may be likely; for you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
much (taken as Scholars) in your <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi>
of seeking for Truth. I must profess
therefore (to answer both in one) that you
are two of the prettiest men that ever I met
with, and most hard to please with reason.
Neither of you can endure I should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
&amp; profess certainty and evidence in
things capable of it, that is, in matters sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entifical;
nor yet profess uncertainty in
matters not capable of certitude; as in
our present point about the delivery of
words by way of transcriptions of Copists
or Scriveners relying upon their own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
diligence; which 'tis impossible to
secure against over-sight; besides divers
other miscarriages which the Fathers, as
well as I, complain the Letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
was lyable to. But to satisfie your
tender Conscience, and other Catholikes
like yours; I profess that that place speaks
of the Letter of Scripture, as left to
multitudes of human contingencies and
imbecillities, and as taken abstractedly
from, and unassisted by Tradition or the
Churches living voice and practice, to
guide securely the delivery of it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99049:68"/>
But I ever profess that this guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Tradition did efficaciously preserve
the Letter untainted in all that was coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
with Christian Tradition, that is, in
all points necessary to mankinds salvation;
and not onely so, but so far the rest of the
Scripture's Letter too, that nothing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
contrary to the doctrin of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Christian Faith could light into it.
So that Catholiks may with all security
accept it and hold to it. And yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the aid of tradition former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
above 2000 faults were corrected in
it by our late Pope's, since the beginning
of the Council of Trent, and more still
remain to be a mended, as the Preface to the
same Bible grants, nor is any person living
able to stint us the ultimate compleating of
the true copy. Thus much to you; How I
can satisfy <hi>Doctor Hammond</hi> (who holds
Tradition onely then when he can serve his
turn of it, and otherwhiles impugns it)
by what way in his grounds he can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of one little of it, I know not: and
therefore must leave him to the Fruits of
his Labour in impugning Tradition, that is
to a perfect uncertainty of any thing that
can concern his Faith. In a word, to a
Catholik my position onely signifies that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99049:68"/>
we are beholding to the living voyce of the
Church even for any Certainty of the
true Copy of the Scripture; which, why
it deserves more exception that Saint
<hi>Austin's</hi> noted saying of <hi>Evangelio non
crederem, &amp;c.</hi> I should be glad to learn.
But you think <hi>Rushworth</hi> has made too
<hi>long a Catalogue of uncertainties.</hi> To
which I answer that if you please to scan
the occasions of that long Catalogue, and
then tell us how many we may safely abate.
I shall in his behalf remain very much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to you; If not, 'tis plain you do not
know we can abate any, or that his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
is longer then it should be in his
case.</p>
               <p>After this you give a wipe at my deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Popes <hi>personall Infallibility;</hi> and
as for the point, you well know 'tis held but
a <hi>probable opinion,</hi> and that many learned
Authors hold the same opinion with me.
As for my <hi>censuring</hi> it, I shall hope the
reasons given for it in <hi>Tabulae Suffragiales</hi>
will stand to justify me, till something of
greater force than clamour appears to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
them, that is, till it can be shown
less than Archi-hereticall to say that an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
which confessedly is no more but
<hi>probable</hi> can be a sufficient ground to build
Christian Faith upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:99049:69"/>
Your next piece of Gallantry is your old
and oft repeated clamour of my denying
the Infallibility of Councils, which forces
me to lay open to the world how far your
Malice is above your Conscience in writing
against me. To do which I offer the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
those few notes. First that you onely
cite here three words, <hi>non est impossible,</hi> to
prove confusedly that I deny all Authority
of Councils, whereas in my <hi>Tab. Suffrag.

himself) it follows immediately,

what this word <hi>This</hi> relates to is to be seen
in the Paragraph immediately foregoing,
to wit, to the making <hi>new Articles of
Faith;</hi> so that I put Councils errable one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in such a matter that is in creating us a
<hi>new Faith,</hi> you by maiming purposely my
words make me hold them to have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in any thing. Can this consist with
honesty or fair dealing? Next is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that in the same Discourse there which
gives account of my Doctrin professedly
concerning Councils, I maintain in express
terms, that <hi>Councils</hi> are of <hi>Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99049:69"/>
in declaring Articles of Faith,</hi> that
the Pope <hi>declaring ex cathedra concerning a
matter of Faith is infallible,</hi> and that the
same is to be said of <hi>Generall and even Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
Councils, if they proceed duly in
their discussion.</hi> And must all this be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceald,
and onely three generall words
which declare neither particular manner
nor matter be barely alleadg'd as a ground
of all your spitefull Rhetorick! How
strange a proceeding is this for a Christian!
My third note is that in case Christ be a
perfect Law-giver, and that the Faith he
left be <hi>sufficient</hi> and no more <hi>necessary</hi> for
the Church, that is, if a Council have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do in making <hi>new Articles</hi> of
Faith, then I onely deny Infallibility to
Councils in things <hi>unnecessary</hi> for the
Church, and <hi>unconcerning</hi> their duty as
Definers of Faith, and give them an <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Inerrancy</hi> in all points <hi>necessary</hi> for the
Church, that is, in all that can truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
their main purpose, that is, defining
Faith. And more than this, I beleeve you
will find an hundred Catholick Doctors to
one, deny them as well as I. My fourth
note shall be that you would make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
Infallibility of Councils, abstracting
both from all matters and manners of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99049:70"/>
or acceptation of the Church (for
so you treat it) my singular opinion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thus spoken of, we have for their Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
amongst the <hi>Franciscans Castillo,</hi> and
the learned Author of <hi>Systema Fidei,</hi> who
cites him; for the Dominicans <hi>Sotus,</hi> who
tells us that <hi>if God by his secret judgment
suffers a Council to err, he will not permit it
long to be conceald from the Church, but
will take order that it be corrected by another
following Council before it be receiv'd in the
Church.</hi> For the Jesuits, <hi>Bacon,</hi> telling us <hi>it
was the opinion of Saint Austin, and of all
the writers of that Age, that the resolution
of Faith was compleated in the reception of
the whole Christian world.</hi> For the Fathers
Saint <hi>Austin</hi> himself, whose known words
are that <hi>Plenary Councils have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by following ones,</hi> where he seems also
to speak even of <hi>matters of Faith.</hi> Of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls,
<hi>Cusanus,</hi> that <hi>it may be observ'd
by all experience that an universall Council
may fail.</hi> For your own Doctors, worthy
Dean <hi>Cressy,</hi> in whom you may find most
of these Authors cited, <hi>Exomol. c.</hi> 33.
where he acknowledges the placing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of Councils ultimately in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of the Church, <hi>an opinion at least
allowable,</hi> and according to his eminent
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99049:70"/>
learning, and charity puts down the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
he observ'd in that Doctrin to
the reducing the Heterodox party. Nor
onely these, but indeed, who is there of
any note that will say a Council is Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
unless it proceed <hi>Conciliariter?</hi> and
that it may not proceed <hi>conciliarly,</hi> or after
the regular way of a Council, I beleeve you
are not unacquainted: if you be, let Pope
<hi>Martin</hi> the fifth teach it you, who in
the last Session of the Council of Constance,
declares himself to hold and observe their
Decrees made <hi>conciliariter, &amp; non aliter
nec alio modo,</hi> and this too expresly <hi>in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith,</hi> which caution of his shows
he held a possibility of their proceeding il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legally.
Now what they call <hi>Conciliariter,</hi> I
call (in definitions of Faith) <hi>attending to
Tradition:</hi> which put, I hold and maintain
them absolutely Infallible; whereas I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
all except me (if you examin the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
well, and report it candidly) put more
numerous, and more difficult conditions to
their Infallibility, and far more liable to
contingency than what I require; which is
both extremely hard to fail, and when it
does, must needs be most notorious to the
whole world, and so beyond my power to
pretend or excuse it, as you would wisely
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99049:71"/>
perswade the Reader, by saying this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
<hi>brings all into my hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we have eminently learned men
of all the chief orders in Gods Church,
Cardinalls, and Fathers (to omit many, or
rather all others) directly of my opinion in
holding a <hi>Non est impossibile,</hi> speaking in
generall; or rather I of theirs, and yet I
onely must be raild at, as if none in the
world held it or broacht it but I. Turn
now, I beseech you, valiant Sir, the mouth
of your pot-gun against all these renowned
Authors, and discharge your intemperate
spleen against them as <hi>abandoning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, denying the Authority of
Councils,</hi> and such like, (which make up a
great part of your worthy work) and see
how feeble an attempt you will make, and
whether you will not deserve as great an
hiss, as you have made a noise to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
but to breath out some of your swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
passion. At least excuse your self to
charitable Christians, why omitting to
mention all others Authority who held the
same Doctrin with mine, leaping over the
backs of all distinctions both of matter and
manner, without which your discourse sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify's
nothing; and, lastly, why leaving out
words of mine within the same <hi>comma</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:99049:71"/>
which should clear me, you rawly took
out three onely which were generall ones,
apply'd them to what particular sence you
pleas'd, nay, extended them to that which
was invidious, and which I never held, and
by these arts abus'd the veneration which
the vulgar justly have of Councils, to stir
up in them an undeserved ill opinion against
me. I pass by in my Book many such like
carriages of yours; this, because you so
often, and so maliciously glance at, I
could not leave totally unreflected on.</p>
               <p>If it would not spoil your sport, I would
crave leave to right the reader in the conceit
you would imprint in him of my <hi>Romanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Hell,</hi> as you are pleas'd to term it; the
ridiculousness of which lies in your expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
not mine. One would think by your
putting, <hi>Dancers, Bowlers, Fencers,</hi> &amp;c.
in other Letters, they were my words, but
he would be mistaken. One would think
that the words <hi>attempting now in Hell in all
their severall postures,</hi> which signify'd as if
they were playing tricks there, were my
words or sence, but would be mistaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
One would have thought you might
have had the candor not to omit the word
<hi>quasi,</hi> which would have spoild the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the postures you fancy, and so have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99049:72"/>
much qualify'd your jeft; Lastly, one that
had not known you might have imagin'd
you would have transcrib'd to the full
point, and not still take two or three
words single, and then you should have
seen the mixture of <hi>desperation, fear</hi> and
<hi>grief,</hi> marring the perfect molds your
Imagination had fram'd, and made me say
no more but that the shapes of the damned
were <hi>frightfull</hi> and <hi>distracted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (to omit other little advantages by
which you strive in the translating 3 lines
to render my sence ridiculous) I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know where you find these words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of damned <hi>Souls,</hi> as you would here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us; I would gladly know where you
find the word <hi>now</hi> which you put as mine
<hi>[attempting now in Hell]</hi> wheras the whole
Chapter is intitled &amp; declares it self in each
Paragraph, to speak of their <hi>Bodyes</hi> onely,
not <hi>Souls;</hi> and this not <hi>now,</hi> but expresly
at the day of Judgment, or rather (if it
could be) after it. Were ever three lines
singled out from their fellows so abus'd,
corrupted and falsify'd to make a little
sport! Acute Sir, when you have a mind
to make merry hereafter, take heed your
self to sober and judicious persons who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
and expect solidness and sincerity
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99049:72"/>
from you, become not the best part of the
scene; however to Gigglers, who examin
nothing, but laugh at Mares-nests, found
onely in your and their fancies, you pass
for a very comicall and witty blade. But,
as I value the judgment of one serious exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner
above a thousand of such light-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
things, so it seems by your carriage
through your whole Book, you intended
such onely for your Readers; I hear they
are your onely applauders, and that wiser
persons, even those that perhaps set you
on, seeing your passionate behaviour
throughout the whole, will not hazard
their own credits to commend your work
before any man of prudence and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Your next exception is against my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that <hi>the best happens to the damned that
could happen, and that God himself had been
worse had they been otherwise dealt with.</hi>
And this you confute very learnedly with
loud exclamations, as <hi>Pagan Fatality, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious!</hi>
and what not, wheras indeed could
you rightly open the opinion, however
told rawly 'tis to a vulgar head subject to
misapprehension, you would have found
it to be the greatest honour of God, both
in his own Attributes and in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99049:73"/>
of the world, which mankind esteems
of. In his own Attributes, because it takes
God to be essentially wise, even to the least
circumstance; and that he would be worse
if he did any thing otherwise then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rule of Wisdom, and that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in all things is the Principle to his
will. Whence follows that if it be better
to let the damned be damned than not,
he should not have done so wisely as he
now does, if they had not been dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and therefore had been less wise,
that is, worse in himself. In his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because it declares that in that very
operation in which Creatures seem to be
worft handled, even there they have the
greatest goods which were possible to
them. This Answer of mine perhaps you
may have seen given to another upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the same difficulty rais'd. Now
to oppose this Doctrin, you must either
say that God in the Government of the
world does not behave himself most wisely,
that is, does not what's most wise to do, or
permits not what's most wise to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
which if you do, I fear any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ear that hears you will abhor
your blasphemy; or else you must say that
to behave himself less wisely is not to be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99049:73"/>
worse in himself, which is nonsence;
If you grant both these you fall into my
<hi>paganism,</hi> as you call it. For if God does
what's wisest and best, and actually such or
such a creature <hi>be</hi> damn'd, it follows tis
wisest and best to permit it; therefore to
do otherwise had been to do less wisely,
that is to do worse; and so, if nothing
limited the goodness in that action but
what was in himself, to <hi>be worse.</hi> This you
should have reflected on and spoken to,
and not still think that to make a wide
month over a point of Divinity is enough
to confute it, without ever weighing, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,
or so much as mentioning the
reasons 'tis built on.</p>

               <head>SECOND DIVISION.
Containing an Answer from
Section the twenty seventh,
to Section the thirtieth.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Identification of the Soul's affections
with her self. The best corporeall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
most conducive to Beatitude. In
what sence the Soul is not the same in
the Body and out of it. Affections of
Souls not retractable during their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
Mis-informations of that
grief the Author puts in Purgatory,
rectify'd. Our Saviour's sufferings not
prejudic't by this Doctrin.</head>
               <p>IN the twenty seventh Section you begin
to speak like a man that aym'd at a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and proving, and was not content
with pure flashes of words as in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Sections: Therefore I must look to
my self, especially since you threaten me
both with designes of your own and <hi>of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99049:74"/>
Pens</hi> which will more largely confute
my errours. And I must confess you frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
me, for I do not love to take pains.
But the best remedy I can think of, is to
hasten this petty answer to you, which
peradventure may prevent some mistakes
in others into which you are fall'n; and so
shorten in part their and my labour; your
first onset is to ask <hi>how ridiculous a position
it is to say the affections got in the body are
not distinguish't from the Soul?</hi> and your
reason of doubting is because the soul <hi>was</hi>
and <hi>can be without them.</hi> I give you this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
'Tis as ridiculous, as to say, that <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is not distinguisht from its <hi>subject;</hi> That
<hi>Intension</hi> and <hi>remission</hi> are not made by <hi>add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one degree to another;</hi> or that <hi>Charity</hi>
is increast by a greater <hi>radication in the
subject;</hi> That <hi>Vnion</hi> is not distinguisht
from its <hi>Terms,</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> from the Agent
and term, when it consists not in motion;
and twenty such other position; which as I
must not doubt but you have shew'd ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in your Philosophy Papers; so because I
have not seen them I must judge to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
opinions in the sentiment of your
<hi>eminent learned men,</hi> while so many main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them in your Schools; and yet all the
Arguments you bring, are commonly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99049:75"/>
against all these opinions. The masters
whereof peradventure may be of the same
Judgment with me, that the Soul is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in its Essence immutable, but mutable
to a certain point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, so, that other things
may be joyn'd to, or sever'd from her,
whilest she remains perfectly the same, and
neither better nor worse if we respect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
her <hi>Essence.</hi> They who have a mind
to know what I think in this point, may
find it at large discours'd, in the Preface
before the Latin Edition of Sir <hi>Kenelm
Digby's</hi> Book, <hi>de Immortalitate Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your next question is, <hi>how I can say</hi> that
sinfull acts <hi>are perfections, since the Soul is
more perfect when she is depriv'd of them.</hi>
Sir, my unwariness in this was, because I
had heard that sin consists formally in a
<hi>privation</hi> or want of something, and that
all the <hi>positive</hi> act is good, and from God
<hi>as far as positive,</hi> and so must be <hi>perfective,</hi>
and in it self some <hi>perfection.</hi> Now, to your
Arguments I reply, that in create perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
many times a greater puts out the
lesser, as Science puts out Faith, Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
Hope, Innocence Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
so doth the perfection of a vertuous act dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
the imperfecter perfect on which is
in a bad action.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:99049:75"/>
Your third Scruple is, that I say <hi>the life
most full of corporall pleasure is the fittest
to attain eternall Beatitude.</hi> And I cannot
deny but I say so, and your self bring my
reason, because the Body being made for
the Soul it cannot be (regularly speaking)
but what is truly best for the Body, is also
best for the Soul. Peradventure you can
pray better when you are sick then in
health and ease, and the like is of study:
My imperfection is such I cannot. And, if
eating my meat with a good stomach gives
me health and strength to study and pray,
I think I do well to put vineger or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sauce to my meat, which may make
me eat what is fitting to perform those
Actions strongly and perfectly. Neither
do I understand that this is either against
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Doctrin of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
prescrib'd according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
who tells us, he chastis'd his body and kept
in slavery in order to attaining Heaven,
lest (saith he) I become a reprobate; to
which end all that use mortification dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
employ it. I confess this Doctrin
is against them who think God is pleas'd
with a kind of sacrificing their bodies to
his honour, without any commensuration
to their own salvation, but meerly because
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99049:76"/>
they apprehend they make God beholding
to them for the great honour they did him;
as heathen Priests were anciently, and are
yet us'd to do in some Countries.</p>
               <p>You say <hi>this Doctrine befits only Epicurus
his School, and the life of Hogs.</hi> For <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
the Eloquent <hi>Gassendus</hi> hath taken a
great deal of pains to perswade the World
you are in an Errour. And for <hi>the life of
Hogs,</hi> unless you be better acquainted with
it then a chast religious man should, I think
you no fit Judg of the Comparison. But,
whatever way you go, Ile tell you mine:
which is, to think we <hi>feel</hi> or (as I may so
speak) <hi>see</hi> no acts of our own immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but <hi>corporeal ones,</hi> therefore those sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pleasures, heats, violences of charity,
which we read of in many Saints lives are
<hi>corporeal ones,</hi> as appears by the very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
telling us of bones broken, those
that were neer them warm'd, those that
they preach'd to materially set on fire, and
the like. Now, I say, there being such vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of corporeal pleasures, the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man chuses amongst them, what are
fittest to breed in him those thoughts and
desires which are the most efficacious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of the Soul to Heaven: And these
I hold the best and noblest, and which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99049:76"/>
make a mans life the pleasantest. Of these
(speaking in abstract) are generally those
that follow or accompany Charity and
Science, but in practise those which be the
Instruments to increase solid Charity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
to the pitch of the Soul to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd,
which possibly is not capable as
yet of so great acts as the Saints we spoke
of. But there is none so low but if diligence
and industry be not wanting, hath higher
and greater pleasures then the Hogs which
were your instructers to know what <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea
pleasure</hi> is. And I cannot but marvell
much on what your thoughts were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
that whereas you cannot but have
read in the lives of Saints, and eminent
Contemplators of the excessive and ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
delight which they <hi>felt</hi> (that is,
which was even in their body too, and
affected it) so as they have judg'd it to be
inexpressible and above all contents and
delights this world could afford; yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
all these, your thoughts could onely
pitch on those which <hi>Hogs</hi> feel, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest.
Do you think a virtuous man has
not a more solid, lasting and true cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
pleasure in the calmness of his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the undisturb'd temper of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
than a vitious man, who for a dram of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99049:77"/>
delight which his mad phrenzy of passion
gave him, and scarce left him understanding
enough to know he had it, has whole
pounds of bitterest gall of discontent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
it, both in the perpetuall fight of
his fancy and appetite against reason, and
the distemperature of other naturall parts
which vice must needs disorder. Nay, why
should we not think the Saints who liv'd
mortify'd, lives felt not as much corporeal
pleasure, taking the whole extent of their
lives, as those enormous livers who cloy'd
their senses with the surfet of them. We
experience so high a difference in our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
taken in meat when we are heartily
hungry, in a warm fire when we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
pincht with cold, that we have
good ground to think their deprivement
of the degrees of the thing, is recompenc't
by the degrees of the perfect sence they
have of what they admit of; which is by
the rarity of it commended and receiv'd
with as great a welcome as a necessity both
naturall and rationall, that is, those pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
uncheck't in that action, could give it;
All which amounts but to this, that a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
life is in all respects the pleasantest to
the whole man. If this satisfy you not, what
think you of Health and Sickness? Is not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99049:77"/>
the former full of corporeall pleasure, the
other of corporeal displeasure or pain? Can
any thing be so agreeable to the Body as
that, more disagreeable or unpleasant than
this? Yet I beleeve neither your self nor
any understanding Christian had a scruple
he was in health, but gave God thanks for
it as a great benefit.</p>
               <p>This being so laid out, what have you to
except why the pleasantest life is not the
fittest to attain Heaven? You add, you
<hi>have a Scruple to translate this Doctrin,</hi> and
you justly may to do it so raw and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
as to make a quite wrong apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in your Auditory of its being from
what it is. But as you have a confidence
<hi>of your Readers vertue to abhor the Doctrin</hi>
as you set it down, so have I, that any hath
heard of me will give no credit to your
shameless calumny.</p>
               <p>You begin your twenty eighth Section
with my <hi>frivolous concluding that corporall
affections remain in the Soul after Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And you seem to bring two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to shew it. First, that <hi>all these desires
rise from the body,</hi> which being taken away,
they remain no longer in the Soul; you
may as wisely perswade a man not to seal
his Letter, because the impression coming
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99049:78"/>
from the seal, as soon as he puts that in his
pocket, there would remain no more print
in the Wax. No, sweet Sir, Our foul hath
certain <hi>Prints</hi> of efficacious judgements,
which though they begin from the <hi>flesh,</hi> yet
sink into <hi>her,</hi> and become as it were Limbs
of her. For, as beasts work by Legs and
Arms, and Teeth, so our soul by her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Your second Argument presses, that as
it <hi>will not concern the soul to see or hear,</hi> so
neither to have corporeal pleasures when
she hath all fulness of knowledge, so that
you would make the unpurg'd souls follow
reason, and desire nothing but what is fit
for them; that is, to be <hi>totally purged,</hi> and
by consequence go <hi>immediately</hi> to Heaven,
and all to be <hi>Saints,</hi> and that their works
follow them not. At least, you think <hi>a
Schollar could endure no punishment, who had
no other irregular desires but of knowledge.
Qui est hic? &amp; laudabimus eum:</hi> but, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the case (how impossible soever in the
judgment of Christians, who hold grace
necessary,) we must remember, he that
hath much science, hath a better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his last end, how great it is, and
seeing himself deprived of that, hath a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
share in the high part of damnation,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99049:78"/>
which is in the <hi>poena damni</hi> then any other.
But this you knew nothing of, nor care to
consider, diverted by reflecting upon <hi>an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
non-sence</hi> of mine. And, truly I do
not wonder, that you who cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that a thing may be changed in <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or that water powr'd out of a square
vessel into a round one, can change its fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
without taking away one company
of little <hi>Jacks of the Box,</hi> and adding as
many more, should conceive how a thing
can be <hi>substantially</hi> chang'd, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the same <hi>thing.</hi> Neither do I intend
to perswade you, onely I presume to open
how the one case is consequent to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Which consists in this; that if a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
be <hi>divisible</hi> in the formal ingredients
which make it a substance, then also is it
<hi>mutable</hi> according to its substance. Now
the Ingredients of substance in this pitiful
way of Philosophizing, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and
St. <hi>Thomas</hi> have taught me, are called <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Form,</hi> and <hi>Existence.</hi> Whereof
<hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> constitute the essence of
the <hi>individuum,</hi> and if either be chang'd,
the Individuum is chang'd: But it is not so
of <hi>Existence.</hi> For some of your great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
will tell you, that Christ's Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were the same individual Humanity
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99049:79"/>
whether it had a proper human Existence
or the Divine. Now, that which we speak
of the soul is somewhat less then this. For,
we put the soul to continue the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,
but to have it sometimes joyntly
with the body, sometimes in her sole self;
and, because Existence belongs to her <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
we say she is substantially chang'd,
and yet remains the same. But to answer
your difficulty formally, I pray remember
that the notion of <hi>ens</hi> or a <hi>thing is habens
Existentiam,</hi> or that which hath being.
Now <hi>habens Existentiam</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
two wayes; for one that hath <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
Being; or, for one that hath an <hi>apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
to Being. Now, if you take it in this
latter sense, the soul is still the same, for in
the body it is capable to have its existence
without the body, and out of the body
'tis capable to have it with the body. But,
in the former sence, in the body it hath it
commonly with the body; when the Whole,
not She, is that which hath Being; whereas
out of the Body, She, not the Whole, is that
which hath being, and so in this sence,
she is another thing out of the body then
she was in it. There is your distinction,
sweet Sir, with which I must intreat you to
be content, since you will easily see your
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99049:79"/>
arguments or inconvenients, drawn from
your mistake of the opinion, have no force
against it, for we speak not of higher and
lower degrees of <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Anima ut sic,</hi> but
onely of composition in the individual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>In your 29 Section you fall upon a kind
of rational question, whether an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
creature <hi>can wish what's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and you handle it as if you had never
seen a man do against reason. Let my first
question be, whether in all the explications
you have heard of the fall of Angels, you
find any but of some <hi>impossible</hi> object?
some say they desir'd to be God; some
the sight of God without due means; some
a supreme Government of this World;
some an hypostatical Union; none any
thing but what depended of God, without
whose pleasure they affected it. Therefore
all put an absolute <hi>impossibility</hi> in the object,
which made in the Angel a damned will.
Are you better acquainted with human
affairs? Did you never hear of Niggards
that hang'd themselves because of some
great loss they had receiv'd? Never of an
ambitious Courtier, that took a grief and
dy'd upon a disgrace offer'd him from his
Prince? Did you never hear of a Lover
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99049:80"/>
that made himself away, because he could
not compass the enjoying of his Mistress?
Our life is so full of such instances, that 'tis
a wonder you could not reflect on them.
Are not all these griefs for what men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help? And doth not a grief include a
desire of the contrary?</p>
               <p>But you reply these are <hi>phrenetick</hi> men,
our disputation goes of soul's <hi>perfect in
knowledg, whose understandings represent
unto them the lowness, vileness, baseness,
unworthiness, &amp;c. of these objects,</hi> and above
all the <hi>impossibility</hi> which (as you say) <hi>at
one blow cuts off all the will's pursuit:</hi> Thus
you; but give me leave to tell you, all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
desires are a kind of Phrensy's, there
is no difference but of degrees in them; one
hinders reason, the other masters it: and,
besides, Wilfulness is as great or greater
phrenzy then Passion. So that, though Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
be not in souls, Wilfulness is. And as
Passion hinders all those fine considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which you mention of the baseness and
foulness, &amp;c. so much more doth Wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>You reply again, that according to my
Doctrin, the <hi>affections remain in the soul in
the same proportion which they have in the
body,</hi> out of which your adversary will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99049:80"/>
that as they in the body conquer all
good considerations, so they will in wicked
souls out of the body. But you subsume
that in this World they make no vast or
<hi>considerable</hi> griefs, instancing that <hi>the most
gluttonous or luxurious man, when he is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,
desires no more the same pleasure till
his Body be fit again.</hi> I wonder to hear one
that lives (as the <hi>French</hi> call it) <hi>an grand
mond,</hi> in all companies, talk so unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedly
of human affairs. Look upon Lovers,
look upon those that seek after monies, see
whether their whole employments be not
to think on their Mistresses, and gathering
of Wealth? Remember how many have
held envy and malice a greater torture
then Artificers could invent. How doth
<hi>Tully</hi> seem to compassionat himself for the
torment of ambition? How pitiful a man
was he when <hi>Clodius</hi> prevail'd against him?
But the great melancholies and disastrous
ends I spake of, make all this too plain to
need many words. You conceit that in this
Doctrin he that goes <hi>out of the World in a
great thirst, shall be tormented with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of drinking.</hi> No Sir, but he that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
well but when his nose is at the tap,
shall have that torment. For he loves
drink and makes it his last end, The other
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99049:81"/>
desires it out of <hi>need,</hi> not out of <hi>love,</hi> and
so the <hi>need</hi> being past, desires it no longer.
At last you take notice of the <hi>sordidness of
Souls in separation, if they be troubled with
such desires,</hi> I confess it Sir. I do conceive
damned Souls in the next world, and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ones in this to be baser far then beasts.
I confess, all you say of the contempt of
drunkenness and carnality (which you
seem to take for the onely corporall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures)
to be perfectly true; save onely your
opinion of <hi>Avicena,</hi> who kill'd himself by
the excess of lust.</p>
               <p>Then you go on and teach me what I
should have settled for the griefs of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
And to shew how apt a Scholar I
am, and how ready to follow your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
I present you with two short
lines out of <hi>Institutiones Sacrae,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
concluded that those who dy'd in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
affections towards corporall objects,
were not worthy the sight of God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
add <hi>&amp; per consequens cum illum
(Deum) pro ultimo fine habeant, ex deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio
Ejus &amp; paenitentia negligentiae suae gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vissimas
paenas sustinere, Tomi 2. lib. 3.
Lect.</hi> 10. which is exactly your full sence,
and not very different from your words:
wherefore I hope since I have prov'd an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99049:81"/>
obedient Scholar to my power, you will
inform those your friends who intend to
write against me, that we are agreed in this
point, and that it is a wrong to report I say
of Purgatory that the Souls are tormented
with the desires of corporall pleasures,
much less that I place the whole misery of
Purgatory in the deprivement of those.
And likewise that a farther design was
cause that this would not content me, for
you see I put no other but in <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You charge me farther to say that all
external torments in Purgatory would be
pure pleasures, because they were suffered
out of an extreme desire to come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by a courage that yeelded nothing to
the force of the torments which the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
see to be their onely way to felicity.
I do not see any great difficulty in this to a
sober Interpreter, that what an external
Agent inflicts <hi>is not</hi> the grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but breeds it;
nor will it reach so far as to breed grief, if
prevented still with a strong apprehension
of an over-ballancing advantage to be
gain'd by it; which yet does not hinder,
but that such outward punishments are, in
their nature, properly torments; and 'tis
the extraordinary considerations of the
benefits they bring, that can sweeten them
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99049:82"/>
into pleasures; and, however, the want of
Heaven must needs be cause of an excessive
grief. You go on to object that this
Doctrin changes all your pious Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on our <hi>SAVIOVRS</hi> Passion. Be
of good courage man, and let no other
pretence divert you, but proceed constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and faithfully every day in those holy
Exercises, and I fear not, God will assist
you to satisfy all those scruples and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty's,
which seldom become unanswerable
till we grow cold and negligent in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
our Meditations. Thus then you
argue, Christ sufferd with invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
therefore all pains were pleasures
to Him: I think you know there was in
Christ two parts of his Soul, the <hi>Rational</hi>
and the <hi>Animal.</hi> I do not know so much of
the Souls of Purgatory. When you say
then he sufferd with an invincible courage,
do you mean of both parts, or onely of the
rational? If you ask him, he will tell you,
<hi>Spiritus promptus est, Caro autem infirma.</hi>
If you reflect on his prayer in the Garden,
you shall see when he speaks out of the
motion of his <hi>inferiour part,</hi> how earnest
he is against his passion, you shall see he
did <hi>pavere,</hi> and <hi>taedere;</hi> I pray put these
points into your Meditations, and you
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99049:82"/>
will find room enough for pains, though
the rational part was still fixt upon a <hi>fiat
Voluntas tua.</hi> And this our Saviour suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd
because he would. For the strength of
his Soul was so great, that he could have
had pure pleasures, but would not; that He
might give us example, how to fix our
<hi>upper Souls</hi> when we are not strong enough
to confirm the <hi>lower part.</hi>

               <head>THIRD DIVISION.
Containing an Answer from

               <head type="sub">The Duration of pure Spirits free'd from

               <p>IN the thirtieth Section you examin the
<hi>Duration of separated Souls.</hi> And you
readily advance a Conclusion that as it lyes
I shal not deny, but onely beg leave to offer
a distinction. For there being three parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Angels, Souls, and their Operations, of
which you pronounce, I distinguish upon
your third or last branch of Operations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:99049:83"/>
which Schollars divide into external and
internal ones, in the external ones I agree
with you, that they are measur'd by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
and by succession of time, as being
corporal motions: But for their internall
acts of understanding and will, I hold of
them as of the substances: Your Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
so jumble them together, that I know
not what you say separately of them, and
what in complexion: but because I defend
the same both singly and in complexion, it
doth not much concern me.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, you say, <hi>it is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
false, that to coexist to a greater or
lesser part of time, adds or diminishes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to them:</hi> I ask, whether, that a greater
or lesser time coexists to an Angel, makes
any intrinsecal change in the Angel? I think
you must be a little besides your Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
if you say it doth, since common sence
teaches the pure passing of time doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
even to us, much less to spirits. My
next question is, whether if there be no
intrinsecal <hi>change,</hi> there can be any <hi>addition</hi>
intrinsecally made? I think this also will
appear a plain truth, unless the fear of the
sequel force you to contradict evidence:
For the inference will manifestly follow,
that purely to coexist to more or less time,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99049:84"/>
(which is the same as that more or less
time coexists to the Angel, for the variety
and quantity of coexistency holds it self on
the part of time) adds nothing to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</p>
               <p>Now let us see your Arguments. Your
first is drawn from God, in whose Closet
you have been, and can perfectly tell what
he can do, what not, and so you press, what
if on a sodain God should make a new An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
would his duration be as long as that
of the former Angels, or separated spirits?</p>
               <p>But Sir, I would advertise you, that when
the speech is of an Action done, it is not
enough to examin his Omnipotence, for
that onely reaches to a possibility of
the creature; but you must also consult
with his Wisdom as well as with his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency:
For example, if you first ask
whether it was in Gods <hi>power</hi> to make, or
not make the World, and finding it was,
presently you would suppose; then, let
him have made it and not made it, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
would not be granted you. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
your assumption, that if there were no
time at all, God could at his pleasure cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and destroy a soul, would be deny'd
you, or rather that God could have the
pleasure to create and destroy a soul in that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99049:84"/>
case. And to shew your own consent in this
point, mark your discourse; God could
not do it in the same moment, therefore in
two moments. Do you not see, as soon as
you have deny'd time, you immediately put
two moments, which cannot be without
time. I pray remember St. <hi>Austin,</hi> St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
and others, answering the Heathens
question, <hi>Why God made not the World
sooner,</hi> say because <hi>sooner</hi> signifies in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time, and that a former time, could not
be, unless God had created it. Your other
suppositions too of Gods creating and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating
souls, proceed from an unworthy
apprehension of Almighty God, as if he
should make and destroy Spirits, onely to
shew tricks, they having no more difficulty
to be answer'd, then the plain instance of
one Souls separation before anothers; and
therefore is but the repetition of the same
case.</p>
               <p>But well, what must be said to St. <hi>Peters</hi>
Soul and the Soul of St. <hi>Teresa,</hi> hath not
St. <hi>Peters</hi> a greater duration then St. <hi>Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's?</hi>
To this I answer, what is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loosed out of God Almighty's hand, hath
no respect to time, but is created for eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the World and the Angels are. But,
what God doth by the mediation of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99049:85"/>
takes a tang from them, and so hath
some savour of time from the very loose.
Therefore Souls when they go out of their
bodies, have a kind of individual difference
from the causes and time by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
This is a kind of a difference, when you
compare one Soul to another, nothing if
you compare the same Soul to it self. And
out of this is taken that diversity of dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is found in several Souls.</p>
               <p>Your next Argument is from the time,
as the Divines call it, of the <hi>way</hi> of Angels
to bliss, where you ask, <hi>who hath made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that it could be done in one instant?</hi> to
which I have nothing to say, though there
want not Divines who hold it; but that
St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath made it evident, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
position prejudices Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore 'tis lawful to hold either
side, and so let Divines dispute it, for no
Argument can be drawn from thence, why
succession should be necessary in the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal
operations of Angels.</p>
               <p>Your third Argument consists of some
expressions cited out of Scripture, to which
I answer, if you bring any Texts of the
<hi>thoughts</hi> of Angels, I shall yield; but if
they be onely of <hi>outward actions,</hi> those are
measur'd by time, as by twenty dayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:99049:85"/>
and so argue no special duration in the
inward acts of Angels. Those cryes of the
Martyrs under the Altar, are so plainly Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical,
that it were lost time to shew
they signifie nothing of importance to our
controversie.</p>
               <p>In the 31 Section, you say <hi>it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
assumed,</hi> that the <hi>Identification of the
body and soul is required for the Action of a
bodily Agent upon the soul,</hi> and I cannot
deny you have said it. But one that had
spoken like a Philosopher, would have
brought the seeming grounds on which it
is built, and shew'd the vanity of them, and
not oppos'd his bare <hi>word</hi> against anothers
<hi>reasons.</hi> You ask, who ever fancy'd such an
Identity betwixt the Body and Soul? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
no body, no more then they can fancy
that parts are not <hi>actu in continuo.</hi> But as
<hi>Aristotle</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> have rais'd their
speculations above fancy, and <hi>understood</hi>
this, and taught it their Scholars, so hath
the Church done about this Identification
of the Body and Soul, if the notion of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
corporis</hi> be rightly comprehended. Then
you demand <hi>who ever believ'd, our Souls in
this life are truly and really our Bodies, and
our Bodies our Souls?</hi> No body Sir, that I
know of, is so grosly senseless; and so I
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99049:86"/>
think you are at the end of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Now let us see your <hi>belief,</hi> which is, <hi>that
the Soul and Body, as two distinct parts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
to the building up of one man, who is one,
not by simplicity, nor Identification of the
parts, but by substantial Vnion or compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
O how gay a thing it is to speak words
and not understand them? We say the
same you do; and nothing more, if you
would make your words good. For if there
be a substantial Union, then there must be
an <hi>Unum substantialiter, or per se, or properly
one.</hi> And if there be a <hi>truly one,</hi> it is not
<hi>truly many,</hi> that is not many <hi>substances</hi> or
things. And if there be not truly <hi>many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
or things, the parts of this truly
one, are not distinguish'd really into
<hi>things</hi> which are actually, but formally
into things that <hi>may be made</hi> of this one
thing: which is, to have its part in <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>
Now if truly and really the thing be
but one <hi>thing,</hi> all that is spoken of that
thing signifies nothing but <hi>that thing,</hi> so
that the man is <hi>body</hi> according to the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of one word. Another word will
signifie him as he is <hi>Soul,</hi> another as he hath
the vertue of holding, and so he will be a
<hi>hand;</hi> another as he hath the vertue of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99049:86"/>
walking, and that will speak of him by the
name of <hi>foot:</hi> and all this be but one
thing, which we call <hi>man.</hi> Now Sir, this
is a Catholick verity, defined by ancient
Councils, in the Unity of a Person, that is,
an individual substance or thing, against
the <hi>Nestorians.</hi> The same was done in
latter times under the notion of our souls
being truly the <hi>Form,</hi> or giving the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of being a thing. Now the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt us is, that you examin
the words by fancy, and we by understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and discourse.</p>
               <p>You add further, <hi>it can never be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc'd
that so much as a substantial union
is necessary for a Soul to suffer from the
Body.</hi> For <hi>who</hi> (say you) <hi>shall render
it evident, that in the state of separation,
by the omnipotent hand of God she may not
be made passive by fire?</hi> Sir, I am so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of your abilities, that I believe you
are able to shew, that God by his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
hand cannot turn a separated Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wood, or straw, or some other combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible
matter, by which she shall become
<hi>passive by fire.</hi> And therefore your Divines
use to speak more warily, when they say,
God elevates the Action of the <hi>fire,</hi> not
disposes the subject or <hi>soul.</hi> But this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99049:87"/>
he that can prove Fire is but a body,
and his action either rarefaction, or locall
motion, or some such other, may to such as
carry sence along with their words, shew,
that, seeing an action cannot be <hi>elevated</hi>
unless it <hi>be,</hi> that is, Fire cannot burn
<hi>violently,</hi> unless it <hi>burn;</hi> and that the
Action of fire can have no place in a spirit,
which it cannot divide or burn, neither
may it be elevated to torment a separated
soul.</p>
               <p>Your 32 Section tells us, <hi>it is a purely
voluntary and false assertion, that separated
Souls know all things perpetually and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
And, as for the <hi>falsity,</hi> we may guess
by your Arguments. But to say it is <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi>
you have no reason: since the
proofs are set down in <hi>Institutiones Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticae,</hi>
which I suppose you read (as all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Adversaries do) before you went about
to confute: Your Arguments are first, <hi>Our
Angel Guardians every day learn our
Actions</hi> what they be, as it were by seeing
the <hi>outward effects</hi> of them. You speak
this so confidently, that I may imagin you
have talk'd with some of them, and they
have told you so, and then who dares deny
it? Otherwise I must confess I am hard of
belief. But you ground it upon this, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99049:87"/>
                  <hi>Onely God is the searcher of the Hearts,</hi>
which although one might interpret to
signifie the <hi>revealer of Hearts,</hi> and find
Texts of Scripture to that purpose, yet I
go not that way; but tell you, when God
is said to be the <hi>knower of Hearts,</hi> he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguish'd
onely to men, and if you will
have the sence reach farther, you must
prove it. For it is against the principles
your self uses, to wit, that Angels know all
our material motions of our phantasie, and
sensitive appeal. Now if there be no act of
the understanding without a fancy agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, Nor an act of will without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
motion in the appetite, you will
leave few actions unknowable to Angels.

truly if he had not included himself in the
same phrase, the place would have born a
great shew, but since he that is to be the
Judg, cannot be thought ignorant of what
he is to do, I believe the meaning is, that
none <hi>makes</hi> that day <hi>known,</hi> but onely the
heavenly Father, whose proper day it is, in
which he shall receive into his own hands
the Kingdom which he had put in his Sons
hands to be administred till that day, as

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99049:88"/>

And this is a known Hebraism, for in the

Your other place that <hi>they rejoyce
at the new conversion of a sinner,</hi> wants one
word to make it fit for your purpose, to
wit, that they rejoyce <hi>of new,</hi> For if they
rejoyce from the beginning, as God doth
from all eternity, it will come but lamely to
your design.</p>
               <p>In your 33 Section, you go on with
your questions; easie to ask, but long agoe
resolved? but as to you, to little purpose,
seeing you do not take the pains to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the answers. As for the Arguments
you bring out of Scripture, they are already
answer'd in my <hi>Institutiones sacrae,</hi> but must
be repeated, because you take no notice of
them; yet so shortly that they may not be
tedious to them who have read them. You
object then that <hi>the Dragon drew after him
the third part of the Starrs;</hi> but why
this was not done in a moment, you
bring not a word. You say also, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99049:88"/>
that Angels cannot immediately act
one upon the other, <hi>destroyes their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
for all eternity. Sure you mean their
<hi>Grayes-Inn</hi> Walks, or <hi>Spring Garden,</hi>
where they use to walk together and treat
one another, or their Academies where
they meet at Musicks, or bring their Poems
or discourse of news, or some such like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments.
Are you not asham'd to
dream of such follies in <hi>pure Spirits?</hi> learn
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that man is a sociable creature,
but beasts or pure spirits not: the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
below it, the other above it: But did not
in the great Battel in Heaven one Angel
work immediatly on another? Yes, but not
by gossiping and tampering one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to dispute or perswade them into the
conspiracy, but by example, and by being
the Objects one to another: As when one
scandalizes another by sinning in his sight.
But say you, the <hi>Indivisibility of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which is the foundation of this Doctrin
is unsound, since it <hi>will never be evinced,
that an act of a spirit cannot coexist to a
greater or lesser part of time.</hi> Sir, If you
gave us security of your spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
we would believe what you say of
things to come; till then we will grant
your Proposition as it lies unwarily
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99049:89"/>
couch'd, but not as you mean it. For the
Acts of one spirit may be longer then those
of another, as we said before of different
souls, but that is not your meaning; but
that the same spirit hath successive acts,
one of more duration, another of less. And
this you should have prophesy'd of, why
the Argument of <hi>Indivisibility</hi> did not
convince. For speaking of one onely An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
either he is in some act or in none? If
in none, either his nature with the pure
force of his <hi>Power,</hi> (which the schools call
<hi>Actus primus)</hi> can burst into an <hi>act,</hi> or it
cannot? If you say it can, then you must
put a thing first <hi>not to do,</hi> after <hi>to do</hi> without
any change, that is to be <hi>not productive,</hi> and
<hi>productive</hi> of an Act, that is, two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories,
without any variety. Put him
now <hi>in act,</hi> either his Essence with this
Act, abstracting from all other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
is productive of a 2d act, or it is not? If
it be not, then out of this Essence &amp; this act
abstracting from all accidents, he will never
have a second. But if the Essence with this
Act is productive of a second act, then as
soon as he hath <hi>this act,</hi> he produces the
<hi>second,</hi> that is both together (or else as we
said before, the same thing without change
will be productive and not productive, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:99049:89"/>
so of as many acts as follow in this sort one
of another, that is, all that be in an Angel
by his own power, without external help
or determination. So that the conclusion
is, all such acts must be in the same moment
altogether. Your answer is that <hi>this is true
of one act but not of all.</hi> But you must shew
that the Argument doth not convince as
much of every one as of any one, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is but your bare word against a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Reason, though you boldly term
it <hi>a gross Errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you press that I hold <hi>all causes are
fixt, and set as to all effects whatsoever, from
the very beginning to all future succession.</hi>
I pray distinguish the proposition you infer
against me, from this other, <hi>There is no
effect but had a cause, and its cause had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause, and so till the beginning of the
World.</hi> For if you mean no more then
this, I must admit it, howsoever you will
please to miscall it. If you have another
meaning, when you teach it me, I shall tell
you whether it be concurrent with my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
or no. As for your crying out that
<hi>'tis Pagan Fatality, that it destroyes the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God,</hi> and the <hi>Contingency of all created
things,</hi> if of these three words (though I
doubt not but you have talkt them over
often enough) you understand any one, I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99049:90"/>
will yeeld you the honour of being my
learned Master, and shall not contest with
you in Divinity.</p>
               <p>But in the mean while I must defend my
self from your assaults in your four and
thirtieth Section, wherein you accuse me
that I fix upon <hi>Christianity and the Church
an Ignorance of separated substances,</hi> meaning
by these great words, those that hold the
probable opinion which you maintain: as
also, a <hi>most gross abuse</hi> upon <hi>the Angelicall
St. Thomas.</hi> My fault is, that I say the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Souls being deliver'd before the
day of Judgment <hi>proceeded from the not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
a Doctrin of St. Thomas, That in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
Spirits there is no discourse, or any
manner of composition of knowledg.</hi> Whence
I infer, <hi>there can be no falsity in them.</hi> This
is my position, of which you tell us, that <hi>it
importeth not to consider whether the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Angels be by true discourse, or onely
by virtuall,</hi> to which, say you, suffices <hi>a
priority of causality.</hi> But if a man should
tell you, that the <hi>causality</hi> you imagin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without true time, then peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it would be necessary to dispute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a true discourse in Angels;
and this is the very case. For, take away
succession, and all corporeall causes which
depend on time are taken away. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99049:90"/>
then nothing but the spirituall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Angels to be causes, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are distinguished from one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor from their subject, and so all
notion of <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> as they are
proper to the Efficient, are quite taken
away, and so there will not remain any
discourse at all, but a pure cleer sight fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd
on them by their Creatour, in which
I beleeve you will not say there is any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or can be. So that the whole question
resteth upon this, whether there be <hi>true
discourse</hi> or no.</p>
               <p>Now how do you prove what you say is
to the purpose? to wit, that it doth not
follow out of this Doctrin of <hi>St. Thomas</hi>
that there is no Errour in Angels? Your
proof is because <hi>St. Thomas</hi> notwitstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Doctrin, acknowledges <hi>Errours in
Devils.</hi> Good Sir, as long as you have
been a Divine, did you ever hear that it
was a gross injury to <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> to say
some opinion of his was <hi>not true,</hi> or <hi>not
consequent</hi> to another? Truly I desire not
to do an injury to any, much less to my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenc'd
Master, to whom, after God, I
acknowledg it, if I know any thing either
in Philosophy or Divinity. Yet I have no
fear not to follow all his opinions, much
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99049:91"/>
less not to make good all his <hi>consequences.</hi>
And so, Sir, I hope I am rid of your objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of <hi>St. Thomas.</hi> Onely because you
often repeat, that to say every thing hath
a cause to make it before it be, is an Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,
Lucretian, Pagan principle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
must intreat you again to look to the sence
of your words, and not to beat so carelesly
the Ayre. If at anytime you happen to
dispute of Liberty, I will endeavour to
shew you your Ignorance, but for vapou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
words let others judge how far they
become you.</p>
               <p>You go on in the same strain to except
against the comparison of an Embryoes
designing the Child to be born, and mans
life framing the Soul deliver'd into the
next World. But what you dislike I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, you say it has no connexion with
the immutability of the future state. The
answer is, it was not brought to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but to open the Readers understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to aym at, of what disposition the Soul
is at her going out. But if the Antecedent
reach home, you say 'tis a position destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of all Christianity. But you say not to
what it should reach, but fain something as
if you imagin'd I would have the body of a
Child never grow in strength or good
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99049:91"/>
parts. When I shall know what you aym
at I may know what to answer. So we may
leave you to conclude your Chapter with
a high conceit of the Victories you have
obtain'd.</p>

long a digression, remember'd again the
question of Purgatory. And intend to shew
that prayers for the dead are of no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
if Souls go not to Heaven before the
day of Judgment: An objection of every
Gentlewoman, but I hope seeing you have
come into the lifts as their Champion, you
will set it high. And so you do, for scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lower waies of others, who press
this difficulty, That the day of Judgment
will come of it self at the time appointed,
and Then every one shal receive according
to his deserts, whether any prayers have
been said for them or no; you fly so high
as to tell us, that though the prayers made
for the dead impetrate eternal bliss for
those in Purgatory, yet they are of no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
Is not this a gallant attempt? What
may be your Arms fit for so great an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievment?
Why (say you) the duration
of separated Souls is (according to me)
above time and comprehensive of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is but a moment whether bliss ever
come or never, therefore there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
in the prayers, though they bring bliss,
and this is the full import of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
Could a man have expected such
an Argument from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Logick Master? not
to distinguish betwixt substance and an
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99049:92"/>
Accident? yet undoubtedly, according to
his ordinary phrase, <hi>All Christianity is
ruin'd</hi> unless this consequence be good.
You were assuredly in a great Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
rapture, when in the same short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
you took two such hyper-Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
propositions, as that it was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to have or not to have the greatest
good God hath created for a Person, and
that there could <hi>actually</hi> be an infinite
Quantity or Time; I must confess they are
both very fit for your sort of Learning,
to bolt out words without looking into
what they signify.</p>
               <p>But because this is onely your private
errour, and the World is to be contented
too, which doth not apprehend any great
benefit in hastning of Christ's coming; I
must a little shew the good that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the faithfull do for the dead. Let us
then consider that our chief Good is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the perfect sight of God, at which
we aym in all our actions and progresses,
from the first basis of our inclination to
the End of nature, even to the highest step
of Charity from whence we immediately
reach it; This depends on two created
causes, The perfection of the World; and
The perfection of the private Person, which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99049:93"/>
is to attain it. For God hath made the
work of the World in so exact a method,
that it shall happen to be wound up all in a
day. St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us, he would not
have the foregoers be perfected before the
rest, the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> expresses the same. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ taught us in his own Prayer, to
say to his and our Father, <hi>Thy Kingdom
come:</hi> Therefore he bad us, when we saw
signs of the approaching Judgment, to lift
up our Heads with <hi>hope,</hi> because our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
was near. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi>
calls the good Christians, <hi>Those who love
his coming:</hi> Therefore in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi>
Christ shews himself as coming, and adds,
<hi>My Reward is with me.</hi> Therefore in the
end of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> we read that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
calling on him, <hi>Come, and let him that
hears, say Come:</hi> and this was the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
devotion, to desire to be with Christ.
Now, to conclude, he that by his Prayers
effects the coming of the day of Judgment,
as far as he doth that, so far he procures to
his Friend the eternal Reward, the main
good, the compleat satisfaction of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of Nature elevated by Grace.</p>
               <p>The next consideration reaches to the
particular good that accrews to the party
pray'd for. For the understanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99049:93"/>
you are to remember the Doctrin of
the Saints, that for our selves we are heard
as often as we ask in due manner what is
good for us; for our friends not so, but
according as is suitable to the rest of Gods
providence. Yet it is agreed, that many
times such Prayers bring some advantage,
even to the special party for whom they
are made: but when and how Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
doth carry such graces, we know
not, unless the effect prove visible. Now
we pray for the change of the soul of our
friend from misery to bliss; If he be in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to be help'd, without doubt our
prayers are heard, but when, and in what
degree, onely he knows who grants it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he hath reveal'd it. And, as when we
pray for a living sinner, the effect of our
prayers (if it be fit they should be heard)
is, that circumstances are so cast, in respect
of this prayer, that he lights into conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
dispositions to bring on his conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so our prayers for the dead, work, that
in the Resurrection such grace is increas'd
to the party pray'd for, as is fitting to be
retributed to the prayers and affections de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
powr'd out for him.</p>
               <p>The third Consideration reaches even to
the rendring less and more tolerable to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99049:94"/>
them those pains they suffer before the day
of Judgment in Purgatory; which is to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
them there. To understand which,
we are to consider, that the State of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
differs from that of Hell, mainly in
this; that this of Hell is ever accompany'd
with the horrour of Despair; that of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
with the comfort of Hope to see
God's divine face. Now all Hope of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
good, if it be rational, is grounded in
knowing the strength and efficacy of the
causes which are to effect and bring it; and
the stronger causes appear to be layd in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to such an effect, the livelier and firmer
is our Hope, and by consequence more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and sweet the Comfort which
springs from that hope thus erected: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the suffering souls, by knowing that
the releasment of all in generall, and each
in particular, is procur'd by the prayers of
the Church; the more, and the more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
prayers they see powr'd out for them,
the stronger hope and comfort they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
To apply then this to particulars,
as the aym and hope and present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of each Soul, is its future eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
as best improovable to it, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Causes laid by Gods Wisdom and
Goodness; so the fore-knowledg that the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99049:94"/>
prayers of Friends will bring to each with
proportionable advantage their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(as I exprest it in my second Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
gives each soul anticipatedly <hi>present</hi>
sentiments even in Purgatory of Hope, Joy
and Comforts for those advantages their
Friends Prayers shall procure them in the
day of Judgment, which surely none that
understand it can deny to be a very great
<hi>relief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth consideration extends this
advantage of prayers for a particular Soul,
even to the state of Heaven it self: which
to explicate, we may remember the pious
opinion commonly receiv'd, that S. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and other Saints in Heaven
have new accidental Joyes there, for any
good effect perform'd by the Order they
founded, that is, for the arrivement of any
good towards which they as Causes had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
influence in this World: now, of all
Goods imaginable, none is or can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to the bringing of the Kingdom of
Heaven or universal Bliss (this being the
But and End of all our wishes, and of all,
both natural and supernatural motion,
nay the onely aym of his Providence, who
is Goodness it self) most certainly then
they who in this World layd means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99049:95"/>
efficacious prayers for the dead and for
themselves in particular, will (in my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin)
see themselves, and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to have been particularly influential
towards that happiest and noblest effect of
bringing that day; Add, that this will be
gratefully acknowledg'd by the whole
Court of Heaven, and they respected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
which will cause almost infinit
multiplications of the best accidental Joyes;
which they who in this World neglected to
use and procure this devotion, will deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
want. Reflecting then this thought
back upon a Soul in Purgatory, who has
deserv'd by her carriage in this World, and
taken order to be efficaciously pray'd for,
that is, to have a particular share in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ's coming in Glory, she has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently
even in Purgatory by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
of those accidental Joyes she
shall futurely reap thereby, a sence of
them at present, by meanes of the certain
Hope to attain them; and thence in due
measure a proportionable comfort, ease
and <hi>relief,</hi> even in Purgatory. So that you
see according to my Doctrin, both Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Bliss, and best accidental Joyes in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and (from the foreknown efficacy of
prayers to accomplish these) a present
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99049:95"/>
comfort accrues to the Souls in that State,
through our suffrages for them.</p>
               <p>You will say these motives will not be
efficacious enough to stir up the hearts of
your penitents. I can answer nothing, but
that I doubt they are not well instructed
and exhorted. And that it is the Preachers
duty to endeavour to stir up their hearts
with solid Christian truths, not by incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties
guilded over with a shew of piety.
For indeed, what is not true cannot be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
When such Inventions have taken a
good effect I bless God, that shews his
goodness as wel by weakness as by strength.
But to advise any man to teach or preach
that, out of which he and the Church
thorough him may be upbraided to cozen
the credulous faithfull into false and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
confidences, and make them rely
upon such Doctrins and Practises as have
no reality in them, I am not a fit Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour;
I leave that to you who like it.</p>
               <p>In your thirty sixth Section you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd
me again, for by your beginning I
perswaded my self I was come to a period
of my pains, and that the rest had been but
personal quarrels, which I could easily have
swallow'd, how bitterly soever prepar'd
by your rash and angry hand. But looking
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99049:96"/>
a little farther I perceiv'd I must tug again.
And first, as for that question whether you
had intention to wrong me in printing
your Bull, I beleive you had not because
you say so, and that onely you pretended to
make the Doctrin pass for an Article of
faith, the contrary of which all the world
knew to be maintain'd by me. Secondly, I
must remember you that you do indeed
and inexcusably wrong me, when you say I
deny that <hi>such Souls are receiv'd presently
into Heaven:</hi> if you mean by the word
<hi>such,</hi> Souls <hi>purg'd after separation,</hi> 'tis no
better then a cunning calumny, and would
represent me as holding directly contrary
to the Bull and Council. Whereas our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
is whether Souls may be so purg'd out
of their bodies before the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
not, if they be so purg'd, whether
they go to Heaven before that Day: this I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to, and is of faith; that I deny, &amp; is but
an Opinion. Thirdly, you do not well justify
your Friends for changing the Title from
<hi>Concerning the Vision of God &amp; the Beatitude
and Damnation of Souls,</hi> to this shorter, but
more generall one. <hi>Concerning the State of
departed Souls:</hi> while your answer signifies
onely that they are severall expressions for
the same thing, which to a wary considerer
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99049:96"/>
will easily appear an artifice. Is it all one to
contend about white and black, and about
colours in generall? No more is it all one
to define concerning Beatitude and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and to define concerning a State
which is neither of them both. Fourthly,
you often up and down your Book brand
me with <hi>faithless Theology.</hi> What do you
mean? do not your Doctors generally
agree that somthing in Religion is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable?
are they all therefore presently to
be condemn'd as faithless? cannot your self
demonstrate there's a God? and will you
think your self an Infidel for it. Or dare
you tell the Ladyes that for your part you
are not so silly as to <hi>believe</hi> there's a God,
you know it, and that as for belief of such
things it belongs to the simple unlearned,
not to Scolars. I hope in your next work
you will proceed with more candor and
manliness.</p>
               <p>Your thirty seventh Section being
spent in petty quarrels, though some
lines in it be both false and malicious, yet I
will let all pass and go on to the thirty
eighth Section where you rip up again the
question, whether the matter of the Decree
be, that perfect charity carries separated
Souls immediately to Heaven. In which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99049:97"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:99049:98"/>
you tell us your Publisher is indifferent,
and may yet chuse whether he will say that
good Souls at their decease be wholly
purg'd from all irrationall affections or no,
in the first Instant. And this may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
be true. But if I am not deceiv'd
he will not say they are purg'd: For I am
sure you would censure it deeply in me, if
I should say that after this life there is any
more disposing it self or meriting towards
life eternal. But I must not be over confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
you may have two censures in your
brest, for the same saying in the mouths
of different Persons. You ask, if <hi>Charity
brings a Soul immediately to Bliss: What
then does</hi> your Adversary <hi>think of Lumen
Gloriae?</hi> It is to me a hard question what
he will think of it, for I see your great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
cannot agree what to think of it. But
I guess he may think, either Charity it
self when perfect in a pure Spirit, is the
<hi>Light of Glory,</hi> or causes it, as well as the
Beatificall Vision. You press farther the
perfection of Charity <hi>in this life</hi> doth not
give the Beatificall Vision, therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>abstracted Souls.</hi> But, if I should
ask you how you knew the Antecedent,
you would be at a stop. I can hear it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
that <hi>St. Benedict</hi> had the clear sight
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99049:98"/>
of God; And I was at a Sermon in <hi>Alcala</hi>
made to the whole University, in which
the Preacher asserted our Lady had Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
Vision in the first Instant of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and prov'd it out of his Text,
which was <hi>Fundamenta ejus in montibus
Sanctis. Fundamenta ejus</hi> her conception,
<hi>in montibus Sanctis,</hi> in the heighths or tops
of Sanctity. Therefore <hi>believing Divines</hi>
must take heed of denying as well as of
saying. Besides I have read in <hi>St. Thomas</hi>
and others, both more Ancient and more
Modern, that there is a certain pitch of
Charity to which when men arrive, God
takes them out of this World. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that stand, I think there is a large
difference betwixt the Charity of pure
Spirits and of men. So that the consequence
may be true of one, and not of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Farther on you mention some reasons of
mine against <hi>corporall punishing of Spirits:</hi>
but you knock them all on the head with a
Canon of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the state of the question, it is not
amiss to consider that a Sin, specially a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
one, hath three effects or parts.
One in the rational Soul, where it is a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or resolution, or affection, that such
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99049:99"/>
an Action is to be done: A second in the
Appetite or Body, where it makes certain
motions and their causes which bring a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of falling into the same sin. The
third part is in the external action, where
it brings in some disorder, which is subject
to propagate it self farther into other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
The disorderly Judgment and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is that, which our School-men, when
they speak formally, call the <hi>Sin;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the sin remitted, when that is duly
blotted out, whatever that signifies. But it
is supposed to be done by <hi>Contrition</hi> and
<hi>Absolution.</hi> And although they admit this
to be sufficient to go to Heaven if one
dyes, yet in a living man they with reason
require that the other two parts or effects
of sin should also be taken away; which
is to be done by <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> So may the
Reader understand what Satisfaction is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
for.</p>
               <p>Now let us see what you urge out of the
Council. First you object the Council
teaches that <hi>it is against the word of God to
say that the fault is never remitted but that
all the punishment is also forgiven.</hi> And
so you see by the discourse above made that
we say also. Secondly, the Council sayes,
that <hi>it becomes the Divine clemency that sins
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99049:99"/>
should not be par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on'd without any</hi> Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
So we say also by the fore-made dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
Thirdly, the Council charges
Priests <hi>to impose Satisfaction so, that it be not
onely as to the guard of a new life, but also as
in revenge and chastisement of their past sins:</hi>
which is clearly necessary for the mending
of the outward excesses brought in by the
sin; and so we say directly the same. You
press farther that the Council sayes, <hi>in
Baptism the whole pains are remitted;</hi> And
if you speak in opposition to sins remitted
<hi>in Penance,</hi> the cause is clear. For the sins
committed <hi>before Baptism</hi> belong not to
the Churches Court. But if you speak in
regard of God Almighty, I fear it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
I should ask your Judgment of a
Case. Your Divines tell us that he who
receives Baptisme <hi>cum fiction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> receives
Baptism truly, yet if he dye immediately, I
suspect whether you will send him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
into Heaven, though neither the
Councils nor the Popes words make any
exception. I doubt then, when it is said,
<hi>all pains are remitted in Baptism,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
suppose that Baptism is receiv'd with
that disposition which out of the property
of the Sacrament is due to it. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
your question is none of the intended
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99049:100"/>
ones, but onely by the by, I need not give a
more positive Answer to it, but leave it to
your consideration.</p>
               <p>It being by this clear, that your calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of saying I deny Satisfaction is fictitious:
I may go to your nine and thirtieth Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
where having translated a long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of mine, you learnedly ask in what
mood and figure it is? imagining your
Reader to have so little understanding as to
think a Demonstrative discourse ought to
be just one Syllogism. How favourable, or
otherwise your translation is I examin not,
since your chief aym is onely to make a
little sport, which you seldom have the
luck to do with the least degree of good
manners. The Gentleman that translated
the Book you mention, is a Person whom
all that have the happiness of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
know to be compleatly civil and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
and one who wants but the <hi>name</hi>
(which you indeed have) to be every way
accounted Religious; a name I confess
very honourable, and which carryes with
it a presumption of vertue; but I have seen
some instances where I fear it went no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then a bare presumption. I did not
say how faithfull, but how <hi>favourable;</hi>
since every Scholar knows the difficulty of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99049:100"/>
rendring into significant and unbarbarous
English, the terms of art used by the most
abstemious School-men in their discourses
both of Philosophy and Theology. All
whom your rashness cares not to wound
so it be thorough my sides. Yet this fair
offer I make you, translate but your
Dictates into smooth <hi>Love-letter</hi> English,
and I will freely forgive you for my part
all you have unhandsomly written in this

               <p>IN your fortieth Section you are troubled
that after the griefs of Purgatory the
sight of Christ should change the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Affections which are in Souls while
they remain in Purgatory. So little do you
understand the course of Nature, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
<hi>motion</hi> is quite of a different nature
from the following <hi>quiet,</hi> which is the
term of that motion. And, forgetting you
had given leave to your publisher, to say
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99049:101"/>
his Souls were purg'd in Purgatory, now
you will have it the <hi>faith of all Christians,</hi>
that there is <hi>no acting for Bliss at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
By which if you mean <hi>meriting,</hi>
'tis nothing to the purpose, for 'tis but your
own fiction to put merit at the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But, if you mean there is no change
towards Beatitude, you are not well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.
Neither is it a wonder, that this
is a <hi>pleasure,</hi> seeing it is the very taking
possession of Bliss after the pains of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
or as Philosophers would term it the
<hi>Purgatum esse,</hi> which yet hinders not but
what went before, and was their <hi>purging</hi> or
purgation <hi>in via</hi> was painful enough. After
this, to make your Comedy compleat,
you will have a touch at Hell, which (God
be thanked) for my ease, you will reserve
to a <hi>new discovery.</hi> Yet you very heartily
beg to know, why the <hi>damned</hi> Souls do not
repent themselves at the day of Judgment,
and become Saints? Which is a sign you
understand not what you read, though you
are able to put it in English. And that you
conceive, this putting in the body again,
makes the Soul not only fit to be perfected
or totally fram'd to the proportion of her

forgetting, working by abstract notions,

of her changeable condition in

what you intend to oppose, I
shall be willing to contribute on my part
what I can. In the mean while, (having
already answer'd the other things you
touch at in this Section) let me follow you
in what you do understand.</p>
               <p>In your 41 Section, you accuse your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
of scoffing at hallowed Grains,
sanctify'd Beads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which it seems you
will not permit to be held <hi>external devices,</hi>
(whatsoever your meaning is.) Nor <hi>Vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils
of a thriving devotion:</hi> which is a term
of an indifferent signification, and there
must be somewhat in you to make you
wince at it. The next words of <hi>deluding
priviledges</hi> I lookt for, but could not find
in this place; yet afterwards reading them
in the Post-script, I conceive by their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to <hi>Quamcun<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> voluerit,</hi> that they
glance at the too much confidence of such
a promise: so large, that were it true, (and
Doctors say the value of Indulgences is to
be taken as they sound) I should reckon it
a great temptation to neglect wholly both
all venial sins, and all satisfaction for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99049:102"/>
in this life. The onely advantage that
I know a priviledg'd Altar pretends, (if we
may believe the words of the Priviledg it
self) is to deliver a soul out of Purgatory,
by saying Mass there. This Mass we have
daily experience may be procur'd, to say
truth, at no unreasonable rate. What need
I then, according to these Principles, be
much frighted at Purgatory, and those
dreadful pains they so often preach to me,
when all may be healed with a little wisely-bestow'd
alms, if these men be as good as
their words? But they say, 'tis advisable
not to be too confident in one Mass, but to
get more: and is there no suspicion inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to an advice so unnecessary, if the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
speak true? and, however, so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
in all cases? Pray you tell me in your
next Discovery, to how many Masses on
our <hi>common</hi> Altars is one of your <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd</hi>
Ones equivalent? to ten? then
the Priviledg alone is equal to nine; then
which I think a greater blasphemy can
scarce be spoken. Perhaps you may reply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I hold you too severely to your word, and
that by our promising a full Delivery, we
mean onely to contribute extraordinarily
towards it; but why do you give me your
word, if I must not take it as it signifies?
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99049:103"/>
why do you not play fair, and tell me, that
one Mass there, is something better then
half two elsewhere? for at the end of the
account, that's all your vast promises come
to, for ought I see. Besides, may not all
the other Altars, where the same great
work is perform'd, justly complain, that
you endeavour their impoverishment? o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
questions there are as easie to make,
and as hard to answer: but of this enough,
the Theam's too plentiful, and I am even
weary with thinking on't.</p>
               <p>Next you accuse your Adversary, that he
sayes you think such things promote souls
in <hi>Holy desires,</hi> though for my part, I think
it is a great reason of the use of them,
to make people be devout, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they would not. And for
souls going to Heaven by them, if they
take away the pains of Purgatory, with
what face can you deny it? I remember a
Doctor of Divinity, who having obtain'd
a Scapular from the <hi>Carmes,</hi> and a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
from the <hi>Jesuits</hi> to be admitted a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,</hi>
at the hour of his death, was as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
to go directly to Heaven, as if he had
had a Patent for it under <hi>Jesus Christs</hi>
own Hand. Why then are you so touchy,
as if there could not be abuses in these
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99049:103"/>
things? why cannot you be patient in this
case, as well as the Church is content to
admit some abuses to have crept even into
the administration of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Your last note I believe is quite mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for I do not conceive your Adversary
intended to make any comparisons; both
because he does not specifie any particular
man to whom he should be suppos'd to
compare me, and because there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for it. But peradventure he would
not have the good life of any man, be an
Argument to bear down a contrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.
For my self, I profess no exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
If my life be such as may not unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seem
my Calling, I have as much as I desire
from men: neither do I see any reason,
why any one should engage for me, <hi>supra
id quod videt in me.</hi> I pray let not opinion-quarrels
break into Personal dissentions.
<hi>Si invicem mordetis invicem consumemini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the same uncharitable end, I fear,
tends your often repetition of diminishing
words to those persons who think well of
me or my Doctrin, insisting especially on
their small number: but I pray you tell me,
how many you think have impartially and
attentively read these few Books I have
made? I believe, in proportion to them, it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99049:104"/>
is not a small number who profess to have
met, in many points, with great satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor do I expect they should in all; I
may sometimes be mistaken my self, and
there I desire none to follow me; others
may sometimes be mistaken in me; and
there, I am so far from being followed, that
my obscurity (which I confess a defect)
will not let me be found: Nor do I see so
much cause to be troubled at the fewness,
as to bless God for the qualities of those
who profess to have found good in my
writings, being Persons both ingenuous,
and vertuous, and of such frank and unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed
Principles, as well by their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as the influence my way may have
had upon them, that I am confident, they
desire nothing more then to see my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
thorowly examin'd, and speedily
brought to a fair &amp; impartial Tryal, by the
sharpest Arguments that a pertinent oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
can make; and indeed they themselves
have been the strongest, though not the
fiercest Objectors I have met with. One
reason possibly of this little number may
be, that my Books have not as yet been
long enough in the World to be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd
by many: what time may produce
God onely knowes, to whom I submit
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:99049:104"/>
But to return to my self and speak to
what you dislike in me, you absolve me
from being an <hi>Heretick,</hi> to make me a
<hi>Pagan.</hi> Nor will I refuse to be what you
shall please when you have explicated your
self. But this not marking nor understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your own words, makes all the misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.
You make me a <hi>Pagan,</hi> but such
an one as acknowledges Christ, and every
word and tittle either of the Scripture, or
any other Law of his. Such a <hi>Pagan,</hi> such
a <hi>Naturalist</hi> was never heard of before.
Will you have me give you an Instance?
take this Bull and Canons which you cite,
and put them to my self or your Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and see whether we will either refuse
to subscribe, or even swear to them. Then
our <hi>Paganisus</hi> lyes in this, that we do not
think you have the right sence. And this
is my <hi>Paganism</hi> thorough all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Christian Faith. You say <hi>I agree
onely in words with the Church;</hi> but, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, you say, <hi>I agree in words;</hi> and by
consequence, the whole disagreement is
about the <hi>sence of the words.</hi> In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
because I proceed out of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
and reason, and you out of what Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Dictatts I know not, you leave a great
prejudice that my explication is the more
reasonable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:99049:105"/>
Wherein consists then my <hi>Paganism?</hi>
Because I pretend to demonstrate what you
think is not to be known but by Faith.
Then if I do not pretend to demonstrate
but onely profess that they are demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and exhort men to seek out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
(which is the true case, and
what you add is out of the fulness of your
heart) why do I not hold all the Articles
by Faith? and where is my <hi>Paganism?</hi>
But suppose some great Scholar possibly
or impossibly (as the Schools speak)
should have the demonstration of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, would he therefore be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a
<hi>Pagan?</hi> sure you never thought what a
<hi>Pagan</hi> signify'd when you spake so chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
a word: That peradventure might
make him more then a man, or more then
a Christian, as a Comprehensour is, if it
reach'd to Gods Essence, less it could not
make him. Faith is not desirable for its
Obscurity, but for its Certainty. We go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
our lives by <hi>knowing</hi> the objects, not
by the <hi>defect</hi> in the knowledge. Let a man
see his way by the clear Sun, and sure he
will be as able to walk in it as by the dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
light of a Star.</p>
               <p>But you complain <hi>I reduce the mysteries
of our faith to our narrow brains.</hi> Sir, you
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99049:105"/>
are mistaken. It is the quite contrary;
you should rather accuse me of endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to dilate our brains to the capacity of
the mysteries by the help of Faith. Why
God cannot elevate our brains to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

though the word remains, your Faith is

Faith; and so, that as many Christians as
fancy divers explications of the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
have so many faiths, but by this way I
see very few in the whole Church would
be of the same faith, 'pray consider a little
that reflexion.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more clear then your next
Example. You say <hi>you believe that Faith,
Hope, and Charity are infused by the Holy
Ghost into our Souls in Baptism.</hi> A Pope
and a generall Council too, declar'd that
of two opinions of Divines, this was the
<hi>probabler;</hi> and, by saying so, said this was
not the <hi>faith</hi> of the Church, and yet if this
be not true, your faith is gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:99049:106"/>
Your next Example is to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that <hi>supernatural qualities are of a
different series then nature.</hi> It is indeed <hi>St.
Thomas</hi> his opinion, and a pure Scholastical
one, nor Universally receiv'd. Yet if this
notion of <hi>supernaturality</hi> be lost, your
faith is gone: Good Sir, take faster hold
on it, and let not your faith slip away so
easily from you. Again you <hi>believe the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Trinity,</hi> but if it depends as to
its deducibleness on what is <hi>Essential in
God,</hi> you doubt it is not your faith, though
all Divines will tell you, all that is in God
is <hi>Essential.</hi> If <hi>St. Thomas</hi> explicate the
Unity and Plurality in God by the Unity
of Action and Passion in motion, your
faith is lost. But chiefly, if any <hi>miscreant,</hi>
or <hi>Imp of Hell</hi> (as your Love-letter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
is) should say the names of
<hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> were derived to God from
what we observe in natural Generation of
living Creatures, which being a materiall
thing can be no otherwise in God then by
<hi>Metaphor,</hi> then your faith is different from
those who explicate it so, that is all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
I have either read or heard of, who
universally agree in transferring <hi>Aristotles</hi>
Definition of Generation to the blessed
Trinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:99049:106"/>
You go on and tell us you have hitherto
believ'd that <hi>God most freely and of his own
goodness built this Vniverse, and that he is
not necessarily ty'd to the order and course of
Nature:</hi> All this is well, but now you are
taught that <hi>God must contradict himself, if
he act any thing against nature.</hi> And what
signifies this, but what is consequent to
that? for if God be the builder of nature,
He hath setled this order which we call na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
most freely, but yet he <hi>hath done</hi> it:
and if he hath done it, he cannot undo it
again, without undoing what he hath done?
which in English is called contradicting
himself. For one to contradict himself, is to
change his mind or will, which it seems is
your faith that God can do.</p>
               <p>Another Article of your faith seems to
be, that out of the <hi>very series of nature, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
might have escaped being damn'd;
whereas all Catholicks agree, that out of
the pure <hi>series</hi> of Nature, St. <hi>Peter</hi> could
not have scap'd being damn'd. At last your
faith descends to <hi>flyes,</hi> and wheras peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
if you had thought, should God have
<hi>had</hi> the mind he <hi>had not</hi> formerly to make
another fly, his resolution (that is his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence)
had not been the same it is now, your
faith might have been the same with mine.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99049:107"/>
But by falling immediately upon the <hi>fly,</hi>
you have quite lost your faith. And your
conclusion comes to be the same with this,
that if God ties himself to any thing, and
so remains ty'd, he is become a <hi>pagan Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
I confess this is not my faith. You
march forward, telling us, <hi>if God neither
command nor forbid any thing, all morality
is lost.</hi> All this would be well, if you told
us what you meant by <hi>Command;</hi> if no
more then Commonwealths do, when they
appoint rewards for them who do well,
and punishments for malefactors, upon
which morality consists, your faith may be
the same that mine is. For so I profess,
God commands not onely by setting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and punishments, but by denouncing
them. But if you have a special notion of
commands importing a meer will or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to command without designing any
benefit to the obeyer, then I cannot help
your faith, though we agree in these words,
<hi>God forbids to steal, commands to honour him,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then you begin to prognosticate how
you will discover out of my works <hi>a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
that Escobar never thought on.</hi> And
truly I hope you will, if you take pains to
understand them. But, if you only use words,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99049:107"/>
and never look what they signifie, you will
do good neither to your self nor others.
To give an Essay of my Morality, you
bring this position of mine, that <hi>Another
man is no otherwise to me, then a peece of
Cloth or Wood, which I cut and shape after
my will. Even though I do him harm, or seek
to ruin him, I do him no wrong.</hi> And you
ask how this agrees with that Principle of
Nature, that <hi>we ought to do to others, as we
would have them do to us.</hi> I can onely say,
if it doth not agree I was mistaken; for I
brought it to shew the ground the second
Principle had in nature, and my deduction
is this. Reason teaches me to use Cloth like
Cloth, and Wood like Wood, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
a <hi>man</hi> like a <hi>man,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to think
that fitting for him, I think to be fitting for
my self, seeing a <hi>man</hi> is of the same nature
with the Considerer.</p>
               <p>Lastly you are afraid, if faith yield to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
our <hi>notions must be chang'd;</hi> and
in that you are not much amiss. For I also
conceive the notions of one who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
what he sayes, are different from the
notions of him who doth not, and upon
this subject, I will propose you a place of
St. <hi>Austin,</hi> which seems to me very home
to the purpose. 'Tis too long to copy out,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99049:108"/>
therefore I pray read the 26, 27, and 28
Chapters of the 12th Book of his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and specially reflect upon the divers
sences or understandings which divers
Christians have of the same places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and I may say of the same delivery
of Faith. The example in the end of the
27th, and the beginning of the 28th, is
in a manner our very case. There are
two understandings of the Creation of
the World; one weak, the other strong,
both necessary for divers sorts of people.
If the weak man when he hears the more
intelligent explicate his faith, should cry
him down for a <hi>Pagan,</hi> as taking away
faith, it were no wonder. For so we read
of a good Monk that had been an <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphite,</hi>
who when he was taught that
God was a Spirit: that is, had no hands,
feet, face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he before had fancy'd
him, cry'd out, <hi>he had lost his God,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
was likely enough to call him a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
too, that deny'd God such a shape, and
explicated to him, according to the nature
of a Spirit and like a Scholar, those places
of Scripture which begot and so suted to
that fancy of his; But no Scholar would
judg him a great Divine for doing so. If
you read these latter Books of St. <hi>Austins</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:99049:108"/>
Confessions you shall find that by natural
knowledg he directed his understanding
of Scripture and Faith, and consequently
was as very a <hi>Pagan</hi> as my self. And so
did all the Fathers by <hi>reason</hi> convince He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
<hi>follyes,</hi> when they could, and this is
the duty of a Scholar, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
preaches to us, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> told us he
practised <hi>among the Perfect,</hi> giving to
weaker stomacks Milk, and not strong
Meat.</p>
               <p>By this, Sir, you easily perceive my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
aym, to wit, what I have learned by
Faith and Tradition the same to understand
and defend by the help of Sciences; which
I think I cannot do, unless I first understand
the Sciences themselves, and not frame the
Sciences to Faith before we understand
what Faith it self teaches us. How ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
is it that what apprehensions we made
of our Creed when we were Children, the
same we should retain when we are men.
Or what Conceptions clowns frame to
themselves in Religion, Philosophers and
Divines should be oblig'd not to transcend,
under pain of being esteem'd <hi>Supplanters
of Christ and his Doctrin, Evacuaters of
Faith, Miscreants,</hi> and I know not how
many other such ill-favoured names as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99049:109"/>
you give me too often up and down your
Book. Think but how contrary 'tis to mans
Nature, and the profession of the Church,
to forbid Learning? to hinder men from
searching the true Meaning of Gods word?
from endeavouring to come to Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as near as we can? to cut off all hopes
of Certainty? and confound all Sciences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Chaos of probability? Good Sir, since
God hath created us to <hi>Science,</hi> and set our
Bliss in the <hi>knowledg</hi> of himself, since he
hath given us a strong inclination to it, do
not seek to plunge us into a despair of it,
and confine us to the eternal darkness of
knowing nothing. If your self be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd,
hinder not others to endeavour.
Should six persons find out but six conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
there's so far advanc'd: those six
may each of them produce six more; and
so go on with an unbounded improvement;
whose multiplying fruitfulness as we cannot
conjecture, so surely we ought not either
to envy or obstruct.</p>
               <p>IN your Postscript where you promise to
make all such things good as depend
on matter of fact, before any Person of
Honour. I understand not well your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by this word <hi>matter of fact.</hi> But
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99049:109"/>
if false citations go under that name, I pray
clear your self of this imputation I charge
you with, that you say I put the pains of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
to be the irregular affections to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. A proposition you have so often rve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
and urged, that you cannot deny it to be
deliberately and examinedly done; So false
and injurious, that you cannot refuse to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
your self if you be indeed Innocent.</p>
               <p>And for a Close give me leave against your
next Vindication, to offer you this note; not
as a Rule (for who made me your Superiour,
that I should flatter my self with thinking you
would perhaps obey me?) but as a friendly
intreaty, that since we have experience enough
of your power in Rhetorick, you would wholy
apply your self to solid and usefull reason;
This if you deny, at least let me prevail with
you to put at the beginning and end of those
periods where you intend to be bitter, some
visible mark; that I may save the labour of
reading stuff so unsuitable both to you and
me; as also, that some other of your Readers,
whose ears delight in such janglings, may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
pick out the parts that most agree with
them, and not be diverted by your other less
impertinent discourses: whereas in your last
work all is so jumbled together and closely
woven quite through the whole piece, that for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99049:110"/>
my part I can scarce distinguish the <hi>strong
sence</hi> from the blustring <hi>Satyr.</hi> If you intend
to write like a Man and like a Scholar, take
some Treatise or Book of mine end wayes;
then show either the Principles weak, or the
Consequences slack; else every one knows
that in Discourses single Paragraphs subsist
by their fellows; and so, to impugn such taken
apart signifies nothing.</p>
