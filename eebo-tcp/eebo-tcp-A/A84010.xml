         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Anti-Parliamentarians,</hi> under the Command of that inhumane Prince <hi>Rupert, Digby,</hi> and the reſt. VVherein the barbarous Crueltie of our Civill uncivill Warres is briefly diſcovered.</head>

            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the middle of <hi>September,</hi> 1642.
a baſe and barbarous act was performed againſt
that faithfull Commander, Captain <hi>Wingate,</hi>
a Member of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, being
taken priſoner by the Kings partie in fight neere <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
he was carried priſoner to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and there
brought before the two <hi>Germane</hi> Princes, <hi>Rupert</hi> and
<hi>Maurice,</hi> and by them with many baſe reproachfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings
examined, concerning his being in Arms againſt
the King, which he wiſely, and as reſolutely declared.
At which the bloudy Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> being incenſed to
heare, with an outragious fury, call'd the ſaid Captaine
<hi>Parliament dog,</hi> telling him, if he had ſuch a gift of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
he ſhould ſpeedily be made a rare martyr. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after this they marched from <hi>Worceſter</hi> to <hi>Ludlow,</hi>
and this Captain being bound with his hands behind him
was ſet on horſebacke, bound faſt to the horſe, guarded
by Troopers that ſwore Dam them they would piſtoll
him. And having rode about ſix or ſeven miles, having
oft ſet their charg'd Piſtolls to his breaſt, if he would not
turne they would ſhoot him. But Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> himſelfe
coming to him gave command, if he would not renounce
the <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſervice, and turne to the King, he ſhould
preſently be ſtript and ride ſtarke naked before them to
<hi>Ludlow.</hi> But this faithful Captain ſtill continued his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reſolution, and was preſently ſtript, (receiving, as he
ſaid, more hurt by the cold, then trouble at their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and ſcorne.) And thus the Prince cauſd him to ride
through the ſtreet at <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and with jeeres askt him,
If he had now learn'd to ſuffer, vowing if he would not
recant, to proceed againſt him with cruell torments to
put him to death: but he perſiſted ſtill in his conſtancy,
and being ſent to priſon, was uſed moſt cruelly, being
allowed but bread and water. This truth is confirmed
and publiſhed by Authoritie of Parliament formerly.</p>
            <p>2. Amongſt the reſt one that was hang'd three ſeverall
times, one after another, the halter broke every time as
he was caſt from the ladder, &amp; the laſt time of the three,
in a rage they tooke two halters, and twiſted them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but this alſo ſnapt in ſunder. When he was caſt off,
and the man was ſtill perfectly alive and well, at which
they were ſtruck to the heart, yet caſt him into priſon,
and there ſtarved him to death; which upon occaſion by
witneſſe is to be verified.</p>
            <p>3. Their common ſaying is, They will not be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God to ſave them, and that they had rather be
in hell with their Comrades, then in heaven with the
<hi>Round-heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. After the Parliaments Forces were out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and without the Workes, the Cavaliers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilingly
and blaſphemouſly told them, they were ſorry
they could not butcher them, upbraiding them, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where is now your God? where are your faſtings
and profeſſions? where is your King Jeſus, and ſaid,
King <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould be King for all King Jeſus.</p>
            <p>5. Another ſaving of theirs is; The Devill that made
us, dam us, and Dam me and Ram me into the mouth of
a Cannon, and ſhoot me nine miles into hell.</p>
            <p>6. They drinke a health to King <hi>Charles,</hi> in whom
they live, move, and have their being.</p>
            <p>7. How ſhould wee forget that bloudy maſſacre of
<hi>Byron</hi> in Cheſhire, that in coole bloud murthered no leſſe
then 1500. that fled into a Church for ſhelter, by fiering
the ſame, and all theſe innocent poore ſoules burnt
therein.</p>
            <p>8. At <hi>Crowland</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> about the middle of
<hi>May,</hi> 1643. the Cavaliers coming to a neighbour Town
call'd <hi>Spawling,</hi> they beſet the houſe of one Maſter <hi>Ram,</hi>
a godly painfull Miniſter of that Towne, they took him
with one Maſter <hi>Harington,</hi> Maſter <hi>Horn,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
all worthy religious Gentlemen, and carried them
away priſoners, and there kept them at <hi>Crowland</hi> for
three weeks.</p>
            <p>9. After which time they of <hi>Spawling</hi> beſet <hi>Crowland,</hi>
hoping to releaſe theſe worthy Gentlemen and their
Miniſter. Whereupon theſe Cavalerian <hi>Crowlanders</hi>
tooke theſe worthy Gentlemen out of priſon, apiniond
them all together, and ſet them on the top of their breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes
of the Towne, in the face of their friends that
came to relieve them, who not knowing who they were
at ſuch a diſtance, ſhot fiercely at them, and one Captain
<hi>Harington,</hi> ſon to Maſter <hi>Harington,</hi> then priſoner, ſhot
three ſeverall times at his own father not knowing him,
but at laſt perceiving this curſed wile, the fight abated
on that ſide where they were plac't.</p>
            <p>10. Herein appeared the admirable providence of
God, that in ſo many violent and furious ſhots, not one
of theſe worthy Gentlemen were toucht or hurt by the
ſhot, God guiding the Bullets not to hurt his ſervants.
Thus they were miraculouſly preſerv'd, and the Town
taken.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Ciceſter</hi> priſoners coming neere to <hi>Oxford,</hi> divers
Inhabitants went to ſee them, the priſoners were tyed
two and two together with cords or Match, two Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
traſht through the durt as the reſt: when they came
before his Majeſty, in the mire they fell upon their knees for his Majeſties fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
but it was in vaine, his Majeſty return'd this anſwer, they had brought
that miſery upon themſelves: five or ſix dyed the ſame night they came to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
with their miſerable uſage; and one to end his miſery cut his own throat.</p>
            <p>12. They alſo tooke after the fight five of the Parliaments Souldiers, and
tyed them by the hands with ropes, and forc't them into the Thames, where they
were drown'd.</p>
            <p>13. Amongſt the reſt one honeſt woman, <hi>Jane White,</hi> that reprov'd them for
ſwearing, was ſhot with a brace of Bullets through the backe and belly, being
great with childe, and within three weeks of her delivery, ſhe dyed immediately.</p>
            <p>14. At <hi>Banbury,</hi> though his Majeſty gave his hand and ſeale to the contrary,
that no injury ſhould be done, yet moſt barbarouſly they fell to plunder the
whole Towne, to the utter ruine of the ſaid Inhabitants, ſaying, The King did
not know the ſtate and condition of warre.</p>
            <p>15. One <hi>William Wright,</hi> of <hi>Abington,</hi> being well affected to the Parliament,
advis'd the Inhabitants to ſtand upon their guard, and oppoſe the enemy, who
being diſcovered, by Prince Plunderers command was condemn'd by martiall
Law, and hang'd at his own dore.</p>
            <p>16. A Gentleman of good worth they hang'd up in a With upon a tree, for
ſaying, he was for the King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>17. At <hi>Ipbeworth</hi> an honeſt religious man, ſaying he was for the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
they cut off both his eares, and gave him thirtie wounds; and after threw
him on the dunghill, ſaying in a ſcoffing manner, Let the dogs lick him whole.</p>
            <p>18. They tooke another man in the ſame Towne, and faſtened a coard to his
feete, and drag'd him about the ſtreets: at laſt being weary of their crueltie, thus
they ſaid; Why ſhould we weary our ſelves with this P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rliament dog, and ſo
diſcharg'd three Piſtolls at him to end his torment and life together.</p>
            <p>19. A young man at <hi>Leeds</hi> for refuſing to beare Arms againſt the Parliament,
was horſt by the Cavaliers, and great weights hung at his legs, which ſo hurt him
that he bled and fild his boots with bloud, and his Mother weeping offered large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take him off, but they would not, ſo that within a ſmall ſpace after he dyed.</p>
            <p>20. Great cruelty was uſed to the priſoners at <hi>Oxford</hi> to force them to take
the Proteſtation by the tyrant <hi>Smith,</hi> by tying lighted Match between their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
burning them to the bones, of which there were eye-witneſſes.</p>
            <p>21. Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> coming to <hi>Brainford</hi> with his cruell Cavaliers, he exerciſed
moſt inhumane outrages there, plundering a Brewers houſe, ſpoyled and let out
his beere, tooke from him ten or twelve Horſes, drew his wife out adores in her
ſmoake, with her young infant in her armes, having layen in but a weeke before;
ſhee dyed ſoone after.</p>
            <p>22. All thoſe Priſoners which were taken at <hi>Brainford</hi> fight, they pinion'd to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether
with match and ropes, ſtript them to their ſhirts, whipt them, and drave
them before them like dogges to <hi>Hounſlo,</hi> over ſurres and prickly buſhes, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
and bare-foote. Some of theſe poore wretches fled from them into the
Thames for hoped ſafety, were ſhot by theſe barbarous Cavaliers; and thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were drown'd.</p>
            <p>23. In <hi>November</hi> 1642. by that cruell and devilliſh <hi>Cataline,</hi> the Lord <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
entering the Towne of <hi>Malbrough</hi> with his cruell companion Sir <hi>Daniel O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neale,</hi>
that <hi>Iriſh</hi> bloudy Rebell, having with granadoes fired the Towne in foure
ſeverall places, rod furiouſly through the ſtreets, and with drawne ſwords cut
and hackt all they could meet with, whether men or women.</p>
            <p>24. Then they brake open their ſhops, and took away
all ſorts of goods they met with, ſetting their ſwords
and piſtolls to men and womens breaſts, threatening to
kill them, if they would not confeſſe where their money
was, and what goods they could not carry away, they
brake and ſpoyl'd.</p>
            <p>25. One Cavalier above all the reſt coming an honeſt
Gentlemans houſe in <hi>Malbrough,</hi> utter'd theſe words in
a moſt inſolent outragious manner; God dam me, ram
me, ſink me nine miles into hell, if I ſuffer one Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
to continue here.</p>
            <p>26. In a ſhort time after the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> or <hi>Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
came into the ſame Gentlemans houſe, who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
children, and told him he muſt pay 500.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>. within foure
dayes after at fartheſt; the Gentleman told him he had
not wherewith poſſible to pay 100.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>. he had been ſo
plunderd lately; and beſides he had 18. children to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and now nothing left to keepe them: but this Lord
ſwearing his common Oath, God dam him, what did he
tell him of 18. children, why did he not tye them two by
two together and drown'd them; then demanding where
they were, he ſaid, if he would not drown them he would
and then ſwore the ſame oath as formerly, if he would
not pay that ſum, he would hang him at his own dore.</p>
            <p>27. Another Cavalier in the Town profferd a Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
twenty ſhillings, to teach him a new Oath, that he
had never heard ſworne.</p>
            <p>28. The ſpoyle at this time was moſt lamentable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what they convayd away, letting out whole hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
of oyle, and veſſels of ſtrong water, Aqua vitae,
Treakles, ſpice, and fruit, which was all throwne about
the ſhops, and ſtreets, beſides the burning and taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of large Bibles, and all ſorts of good books, with
which they made great fires.</p>
            <p>29. In one mans ſhop, wherein was Hemp, Flax, Oyle,
Pitch, Tarre, Roſin, and ſuch like combuſtables, they
kindled a fire, and left it burning when they left the
Towne, which was timely diſcovered and quenched.</p>
            <p>30. At this time they drave at leaſt 200. priſoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them to <hi>Oxford,</hi> bound two by two, &amp; forced them
on foote through all the dirt and mire where their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
went: of which number about thirtie were honeſt
able Townſmen; they were moſt cruelly uſed in the
Tower of the Caſtle, not being allowed fire, candle, or
ſtraw to lie on, but the bare boards and plankes of the
roome, and a peny in bread, and a farthing beere, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them of all friends, or ſupply otherwayes.</p>
            <p>31. And when <hi>Smith</hi> their cruell Gaoler was ſolicited
to pitie them; his anſwer was, Hang them damn'd rogues,
villaines, traytors, the Devill take them, they are uſed
too well, and when ſome of them were ready to dye,
and he told of it, he would ſuffer nothing to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
for their helpe or recovery.</p>
            <p>32. Note moreover, that beſides all this ſpoyle by
plunder, and otherwayes, of this diſtreſſed Towne, theſe
wicked Cavaliers burnt downe 35. dwelling houſes, and
made at leaſt 150. able perſons homeleſſe and harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe;
ſix or ſeven barnes full of Corne burnt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
beſides ſtables, wood piles, and out-houſes, and
all their horſe taken away: the loſſe of this Towne in all
is by eye-witneſſes and ſufferers confirmed to be 50000.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>.</p>
            <p>33. This Tyger-like Tyrant <hi>Smith</hi> hath ſo pincht his
priſoners with cold and thirſt, denying them water to
drinke, that when they have been brought forth and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by their mercileſſe Judges, they have gladly drank
the water wherein Gentlemen had waſht their hands,
and raine-water in the Caſtle Court, yea, many have
drunke their own urin.</p>
            <p>34. After ſome were brought to ſuch miſery, then
they were promis'd a peny a day in cheeſe, and their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
at length, if they would take that <hi>Oxonian</hi> curſed
Proteſtation. Whereupon divers poore ſoules tooke the
ſame, and within three dayes after their cheeſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
them, and all hope of libertie, unleſſe they would
pay the Tyrant <hi>Smith</hi> large fees, or ſerve in armes for
the King.</p>
            <p>35. And others had their heeles and neckes tyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for 44. houres, not ſuffering them to have one bit
of bread all that time, or drop of water: ſome were ſo
tyed or manacled three weeks together, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
becauſe they would not take that Proteſtation.</p>
            <p>36. The perfidious dealing of Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi>
violating all Articles of agreement at the ſurrender of the
Towne, as ſoone as they had entred plundering all hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as well Malignants as others.</p>
            <p>37. They alſo tooke women by the throats, one eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
and put a rope about her neck, threatening to
throttle her, if ſhee would not reveale where her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
money lay, and ty'd a ſheafe of hemp to her body,
and began to ſet it on fire, thereby to force her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
the ſame.</p>
            <p>38. Some gave money to ſeverall Officers, that they
might eſcape, yet were plundred, and found no redreſſe;
others were greatly fined to recover thoſe goods that
were taken away.</p>
