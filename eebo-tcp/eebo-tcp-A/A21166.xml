            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The writers of them, were both of honour and worship, besides that, our owne Countrey-men, and such as for their learnyng and grauitie, might be accoumpted of among the wisest. Furthermore, the ditties both pithie and pleasaunt, as well for the Inuention as Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will yeld a farre greater delight, beyng as they are, so aptly made to be set to any song in fiue partes, or song to Instrument. Which well considering, I purposed not to forsake so good an occasion, beseeching your honour to accept in good part, chiefly for the Aucthours sakes: who though some of them are departed this life, yet their worthy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings shall continue for euer, for like as the shadow followeth the body, so prayse followeth vertue, and as the shadow goeth sometymes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and sometymes behinde, so doth prayse also to vertue: but the later it commeth, the greater it is, and to bee the better esteemed. Thus fearing to offend your Honour with these my rude speaches, I ende, wishyng your Lordshyp many yeares of ioye.</p>

                  <l>UUho blessing me with trembling hand, these wordes gan say to me:</l>
                  <l>My sonne, God guide thy way, and shield thee from mischaunce,</l>
                  <l>And make thy iust desartes in Court, thy poore estate to aduaunce:</l>
                  <l>Yet when thou art become, one of the Courtly trayne,</l>
                  <l>Thinke on this Prouerbe old (quoth he) that faire wordes make fooles faine.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This counsell grauely giuen, most straunge appeares to me,</l>
                  <l>Till tract of time with open eyes, had made me plainly see:</l>
                  <l>UUhat subtill sleightes are wrought, by painted tales deuise,</l>
                  <l>UUhen hollow hartes with frendly shewes, the simple do entise,</l>
                  <l>To thinke all gold that shines, to feede their fond desire,</l>

                  <l>Fayre speech alway doth well, where deedes insue faire wordes,</l>
                  <l>Faire speech againe alway doth euill, that bushes giue for birdes:</l>
                  <l>Who hopes to haue fayre wordes, to trie his luckie lot,</l>
                  <l>If I may counsell, let him strike it while the Iron is hot.</l>
                  <l>But them that feed on cloddes, in steed of pleasant grapes,</l>
                  <l>And after warning often giuen, for better lucke still gapes:</l>
                  <l>Full loath I am, yet must I tell them in wordes plaine,</l>
                  <l>This prouerb old proues true in them, that faire wordes make fooles faine.</l>

                  <l>But thrise wo worth the time, that truth away is fled,</l>
                  <l>UUherein I see how simple hartes, with wordes are vainely fed.</l>
                  <l>Trust not fayre wordes therefore, where no deedes do insue,</l>
                  <l>Trust wordes as skilfull Falkners do, trust Haukes that neuer flue:</l>
                  <l>Trust deedes, let wordes be wordes, which neuer wrought me gaine,</l>
                  <l>Let my experience make you wise, and let wordes make fooles faine.</l>

               <l>Dispatching all that stuck to Christ, with hot consuming fire.</l>
               <l>At length a man of tender yeares, was brought before his sight,</l>
               <l>Such one as nature seemed to make, a witnesse of her might:</l>
               <l>For euery part so well was set, that nothing was depraued.</l>
               <l>So that the cruell king himselfe, would gladly him haue saued.</l>
               <l>So loth he was to see a worke, so rare of natures power,</l>
               <l>So finely built, so sodainly destroyed within an hower:</l>
               <l>Then meanes he sought to ouercome, or win him at the lest,</l>
               <l>To slip from Christ, whom he before, had earnestly profest:</l>
               <l>A bed prepard, so finely dect, such diuers pleasaunt smells,</l>
               <l>That well it might appeare a place, where pleasure onely dwells:</l>
               <l>By him he layd a naked wench, a <hi>Venus</hi> darling sure,</l>
               <l>With sugred speach and louely toyes, that might his mynde allure.</l>
               <l>such wanton louers as these he thought, might easly him entise.</l>
               <l>Which thinges he knew with lustie youth, had alwayes bene in prise:</l>
               <l>such wayes I thinke the Gods them selues, could haue inuented none.</l>
               <l>For flattering <hi>Venus</hi> ouercomes, the sences euerychone.</l>
               <l>And he himselfe was euen at point, to <hi>Venus</hi> to consent,</l>
               <l>Had his stout and manly minde, resisted his entent:</l>
               <l>When he perceiued his flesh to yeld, to pleasure not wanton toyes,</l>
               <l>And was by slight almost prouoked, to cast of <hi>Venus</hi> ioyes.</l>
               <l>More cruell to himselfe then those, that glad would him vndoo,</l>
               <l>With bloudy tooth, his tender tongue, bit quite and cleane in twoo:</l>
               <l>Thus was the payne so passing great, of this his bloudy bit,</l>
               <l>That all the fire and carnall lust, was quenched euery whit.</l>
               <l>Do ill and all thy pleasures then, full soone will passe away,</l>
