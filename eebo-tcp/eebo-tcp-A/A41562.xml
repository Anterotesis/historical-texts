            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>HAving lately publiſhed a Book, intituled, <hi>A Teſtimony to the
true Saviour;</hi> the tendency whereof was, to bear witneſs in
theſe latter and dangerous times, (as concurring with, and
conſenting unto the voices of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in
the dayes of old) To the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> as the <hi>Lords
Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>our only Saviour;</hi> And unto reconciliation, juſtification and
redemption, as already in being in <hi>him,</hi> purchaſed, compleated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with God for ſinners, by the price of his whole, intire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience to his Fathers will in his crueified body <hi>without us;</hi>
to be made effectual by the workings and operations of his Spirit in all
ſuch, who through faith in <hi>him</hi> receive that attonement: And hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
the errours which tend to the darkening or denying of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
truths, ſo plainly teſtified unto in the holy Scriptures, among whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were lodged without reflection upon any perſons or people whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The great oppoſition and contradiction raiſed againſt this <hi>my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
and the reproach thrown upon me becauſe of it, fully ſatisfies
me, that a publick Teſtifying unto thoſe truths was and is both ſeaſonable
and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43551:3"/>
A faithful account of the exceptions brought by theſe <hi>Four Men</hi>
againſt this <hi>Doctrine of Chriſtianity,</hi> and therewith of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of truth teſtified unto in the holy Scriptures by the <hi>Prophets</hi> and
<hi>Apostles,</hi> whereby may be ſeen their agreement or difference with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is the matter in this following Diſcourſe; where I do invite the
<hi>Reader</hi> to be no farther concerned, then as be is <hi>a Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If their Book in anſwer to <hi>my ſaid Teſtimony,</hi> intituled by them, <hi>The
light of truth triumphing</hi> hath or ſhall come to thy view, judge not of it
by its fair title; the nature of things doth not alwayes anſwer the names
or inſcriptions put upon them; <hi>Hereticks</hi> of old have named themſelves
<hi>Orthodox;</hi> there is nothing more common then for men to adora errours
with the robes of truth, and to deform truth with the rags of errours:
Therefore I would not have thee judge the better of theſe mens Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have named it, <hi>Light of truth triumphing;</hi> Or the worſe of
what is aſſerted in <hi>my late Teſtimony,</hi> becauſe of the black mark of
<hi>darkneſs, ignorance, errour and envy,</hi> they have branded it with.</p>
            <p>Wonder not that in theſe laſt times even <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf in its very
foundation (the Perſon of our Lord Jeſus, who is that Rock upon whom
it is built, and faith in him as being <hi>the Son of Man</hi> now bodily glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
without us) is ſtruck at and denied; and that among us in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
where ſo many years <hi>He</hi> as Saviour, and faith in <hi>him</hi> for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hath been openly owned and profeſſed: Which as it may be looked-upon
as a juſt rebuke from the Lord againſt ſuch among us, who having long
profeſſed him in words, yet have and do deny him in their converſations:
So it is alſo no leſs then what was plainly foretold by the Holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to
come to paſs in the laſt times, to wit, <hi>that ſome ſhould depart from the
faith, even denying the Lord that bought them; and that many
ſhould follow their pernicious waies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although theſe men who have thus appeared againſt <hi>my Teſtimony
to the true Saviour,</hi> are called by the name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> as reckoning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of that Sect or Company, yet let it not be ſo looked upon, as if there
were not many among thoſe people, who (not knowing theſe depths of Satan
as they ſpeak) are not in their underſtandings intangled in theſe errours;
and therefore every one being to give an account for himſelf of his own faith,
we are in charity no farther to determine upon perſons among that people, as
carried away in this Apoſtacy <hi>from the faith as it was once delivered to
the Saints,</hi> then as they acknowledge and own it to be ſo, each for himſelf:
<pb facs="tcp:43551:3"/>
But that there are ſome pretending to be Teachers among them, and ſome
others alſo, making a fair ſhew, under the diſguiſe of the names of Light
and power within, thereby bringing in damnable errours to pervert the faith
of ſome, is too too manifeſt; among whom theſe Four Men have numbred
themſelves, by this their voluntary oppoſition they have raiſed of their own
accord againſt the plain truth, left to us upon record by the <hi>Prophets</hi> and
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and Teſtified unto by me; Againſt whom I own no other oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then in and by the Spirit and Doctrine of Truth to ſtop the mouthes of
theſe and ſuch gain-ſayers.</p>
            <p>Not any delight I have in re-joynders of this kind, hath led me thus forth
to take notice of theſe mens exceptions againſt the truth; But their wreſting
and miſapplying the words of the Holy Men of Old recorded in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and jumbling the truths diſtinctly teſtified unto in them, thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſimple people to deface and darken the truth publiſhed by the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
and aſſerted by me, by forcing them to appear as a heap of confuſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
and there openly charging me as ſmiting in the dark, and as it
were daring me to ſpeak more particularly, hath forced and conſtrained m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for
the very Truths ſake, to this reply; &amp; therein to name the very books wherein
and by whom theſe errours are aſſerted as truth; that I might vindicate <hi>my
Teſtimony</hi> to the bleſſed myſtery of Chriſt crucified; againſt theſe, and
ſuch oppoſers, ſo far as they appear againſt that myſtery teſtifyed unto, in it;
And that by removing all their exceptions againſt the truth, I might in my
meaſure aſſert and juſtifie the bleſſed harmony which is betwixt the perfect
redemption that is already finiſhed in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> for us; and the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of <hi>Him</hi> in us, againſt unbelievers in this age; who judging of this
myſtery by the reaſon of man, cry out, Confuſion, contradiction, how can
theſe things be ſo? And that ſuch who through theſe and ſuch mens fair,
and high pretences (who are really mighty to deceive) are apt to be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
from the truth as it is in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> might diſcern this <hi>myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
in its root and tendency, ſo far differing from, and contrary unto the
Doctrine of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After peruſal of this following diſcourſe, judge impartially between
me and theſe men according to the Scriptures of truth, and that doctrine,
theirs or mine, which is moſt agreeable thereunto, let it be received, and let
the other for ever be rejected.</p>

            <p>I Begin with thee as being the <hi>firſt man</hi> I meet with of this
<hi>four-fold combination</hi> againſt a plain <hi>Teſtimony to the true Saviour;</hi>
and thou enters upon this work, as if through high ſwelling
words, thou couldeſt at the very firſt daſh overthrow <hi>the whole
boſt of Iſrael,</hi> to wit, <hi>the voices of all the Propbets and Apoſtles</hi> in this
matter; and being thus puffed up with thy aiery notions, and drunk
with the conceit of thy own abilities, thou reckons another as <hi>bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and reeling,</hi> who ſtands upon <hi>that rock</hi> againſt which the powers
of darkneſs cannot prevail, and thou in vain kicks.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing I take notice of, is, that thou chargeſt me as <hi>fighting
againſt the light of truth;</hi> and afterward that my words ſpeaking of
Chriſt as having the iniquities of us all in his own body upon the tree,
<hi>verge nigh to blaſphemy;</hi> and that <hi>in effect I make Chriſt as ſpiritually
within us an allegory;</hi> all which I only mention to let the impartial.
Reader ſee how forward thou art to cavil, and what little reaſon thou
haſt for it, from my words.</p>
            <p>The next thing I mark, is this, thou telleſt me,—<hi>that I ſeem to take
it for granted, that the Quakers deny that body that ſuffered at Jeruſalem—</hi>
But I do require thee to point to me in what page of my Book, thou
couldeſt find any ground to faſten this charge upon me, having not ſo
much as mentioned that people in all my Book: But thou having
forged this, thou ſtrengthens it with another of its own kind, ſaying
of me—<hi>That I labour to prove the exiſtence of that body in the day
of its ſervice;</hi>—a matter not ſo much as intended by me; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that as a truth already received, I aſſerted in the expreſs words
of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth, a man approved of God
among the people</hi> was, and now is the true Chriſt and our only Saviour:
and hence I rejected that Doctrine among whomſoever it was lodged,
as another then that already delivered by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to wit, <hi>that he</hi>
[the God-head only] <hi>that was manifeſt in that body of fleſh is he, the true
and only Chriſt, and the light in every man that comes into the world, as it is
manifeſt in every man, is he the ſame Chriſt, and ſo as in him, ſo in every
man; GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH:</hi> Thus while
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43551:5"/>
thou pretends to be aſtoniſhed, to find me (as thou saieſt) cudgelling
down my own ſhadow, thou thy ſelf art not aſhamed to be found
plainly ſo doing, even then when thou doſt forge it againſt me. And
next as if thou were got off with flying Colours,—<hi>thou dares me and all
men upon earth to prove that ever the Quakers denied the exiſtence of that
body in the day of its ſervice:—</hi> My ſoul hates this deceitful ſhifting the
matter in Queſtion; It is very like that you do believe that there was
ſuch a man, who (as Hiſtories mention) ſuffered death at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
about ſixteen hundred years agoe, and ſo do the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jewes;</hi>
yet ſeeing thou puts me to it, let me ask thee this queſtion, What
means theſe and ſuch like words from among you concerning that
body?—<hi>how can we tell there was ever ſuch a man, we were not then

thoſe words; however hadſt thou dared me to prove, that the now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
glorified exiſtence of that bodie that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is
denied by ſome Teachers, yea, even among that people: then I could
have told thee (and it is commonly delivered as truth among you) that
they have aſſerted, that <hi>Chriſt hath no other body then his Church what a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Monſter, one head and two bodies:</hi> nay, look over the exceptions of thy
partner G. L. againſt <hi>my Teſtimony,</hi> and thou wilt there find him plainly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
confeſſing this thing, aſſerting <hi>that it is contrary to the Scriptures, to ſay
of the child born according to the fleſh,</hi> (to wit, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of
<hi>Mary,</hi> whom old <hi>Simeon</hi> had in his arms] <hi>there ſhould be no end of his
Government, for he ſuffered death:</hi> ſo that according to this doctrine, the
death of the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> called <hi>the Son of
man,</hi> hath put an end to his Government, and thence to his now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
glorified, bodily exiſtence; though our Lord himſelf ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
even ſince his being aſcended and glorified, <hi>I am Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth;</hi>
plainly affirming the now preſent exiſtence of <hi>Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi>
the Son of man; according to that which he foretold of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Matth. 24. 30. <hi>And they ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in the
clouds of Heaven with power and great glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next thou expreſſeſt thy ſelf to me in theſe words,—<hi>I take notice
of thy acknowledgment, that the manifeſtation of God in the fleſh of Chriſt
was that whereby way might be opened for the miniſtration of the other my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
Chriſt within us, ſeparating them, and making the one ſubſervient to
the other; and yet after runs againſt it in the whole Scope of thy work.</hi>—
I anſwer, I have not otherwiſe ſpoken of theſe two Goſpel-myſteries
then as they are teſtified unto in the holy Scriptures; ſo that I have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43551:5"/>
not divided them, but declared of them all along my Book, as joyntly
concurring together as neceſſary to us, yet in their order; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
jumbling them together, or making the Goſpel-diſtinction of
them appear as oppoſites, and ſo as contradictory to each other; as
doth thy partner <hi>G. W.</hi> But I have diſtinguiſhed them according to
the order and method of the Goſpel, the firſt as wrought in Chriſt
our Head for us, the laſt as to be wrought by Chriſt in us; the firſt
as the ground and cauſe, the ſecond as the conſequence and effect;
the firſt as in the one crucified body of Chriſt, finiſhed and perfected
at once, by that one attonement and propitiatory Sacrifice once offered
for ſins without the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſecond as in our bodies, or
in us, who through faith <hi>in him receive that attonement,</hi> ſo daily doing,
and in many bodies till mortalitie be ſwallowed up of life: And that
this is the ſcope and tendencie of my Book is ſufficiently manifeſt,
only thou haſt a mind to pick a quarrel where there is no juſt
ground.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of the 1. Page, thou brings in ſome of my words,
torn from the ſentence they relate to, and then thou tells me, that
it is contrary to the Scriptures, and to my ſelf within a few lines; and
thus hath thy partners alſo dealt with me: For clearing whereof, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Reader to my own words in thoſe places of my Book where
they are mentioned, as too long here to be repeated: And to you as
brethren in this iniquity, I ſay, might not ſuch as your ſelves deal ſo
with the Scriptures of Truth with the like out-cry; and if ſo, could
it be reckoned leſs then a piece of deceit, and it is the ſame in you to
deal ſo with my words: And I leave it with the impartial Reader to
be conſidered, whether it be equal dealing among men, that while
<hi>G. W.</hi> in the 13. Page of his Part chargeth it upon me, as injurious,
diſingenious, and falſe in not giving a true account of the Principles
of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which I undertook not, and therefore I did not ſo much
as mention that people; that even in that ſame Book theſe men ſhould
deal ſo with my words, in not giving a true account of what they
plainly expreſs, though they have of their own accord taken it upon
themſelves to anſwer it: But what anſwer can rationally be expected
from theſe men, who have not been ſo honeſt as to repreſent faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
what I really and plainly publiſhed in that <hi>Teſtimony?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing I obſerve, is, where thou clamours after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;—
<hi>what! Chriſt a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, paſt,
preſent, and to come, and yet a generation pleading faith in it, and not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43551:6"/>
ſheltered from the wrath of the Father thereby; what incongruous work is
this?</hi>—I anſwer, the one propitiatory ſacrifice of the body of Chriſt;
is not the leſs ſufficient in it ſelf, to have been a propitiation for the
ſins of the whole world; and ſo to have ſheltered even all mankind
from the wrath of the Father; Gods love, and this great propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſet forth by him, was large enough even for this though it prove
not ſo to unbelievers and hypocrites. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpoke truth, 1 <hi>John</hi>
2. 2. <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, he is a propitiation for the ſins of the
whole world;</hi> and our Lord alſo ſpoke truth of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 3. 36.
<hi>He that believes not the wrath of the Father abides on him;</hi> and in effect
I have expreſſed no more then what thoſe Scriptures holds forth. Hence
I ſay, who but one like thy ſelf, who dares even call the Scriptures
themſelves contradictory, durſt thus boldly reckon this doctrine of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> incongruous?</p>
            <p>In the end of the 2: Page, repeating ſome of my words, thou tels
me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—<hi>there is a ſuppoſition and queſtion of thy own forming, and then
preſently thou concludes it a doctrine of ſome others;</hi> and then thou adds,
<hi>it is a ſmiting of the Quakers in the dark:</hi>—I anſwer, I did not aſſert
that ſuppoſition and queſtion to be a doctrine maintained by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but I propoſed them as neceſſary conſequences of a Doctrine a
little before mentioned in that part of my Book; to wit, of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which aſſerts,—<hi>that redemption is not of ſinners that delight in
ſin, but of a light or ſeed within, to be raiſed and redeemed within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
which the promiſe of redemption is; which ſeed is the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>to
whom the promiſe is, which Jeſus Chriſt takes upon him after the fleſh:</hi>—
A Doctrine mentioned in a Book, often printed and publiſhed by and
among you, called, <hi>Love to the Loſt,</hi> pa. 46. 47, 48. But that which
thou dares not meddle with, leſt thy ſpeech ſhould bewray thee; now
I offer it to the underſtanding <hi>Reader,</hi> whether this queſtion may not
pertinently be propoſed to the maintainters of that Doctrine.—<hi>Is the
Seed or Chriſt within, ſo under condemnation and the Curſe, that he needs
to be redeemed therefrom? and if this Seed or Chriſt be not ſaved in every
man, doth it remain in ſome for ever under condemnation?</hi> Thy Partner
<hi>G. K.</hi> in the 16. Page, anſwers thus,—<hi>We ſay indeed that the Seed
ſuffers under fin, and is to be raiſed from under it; yet the ſoul, yea, and
the whole man is alſo to be ſaved within; but the ſeed is not for ever under
condemnation; for though for a time it ſuffers, yet in the time appointed
of God, it is raiſed up in all, yea, in the moſt ungodly to miniſter in them
wrath without mercy.</hi>—This Doctrine <hi>G. K.</hi> aſſerts, but it agreeth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43551:6"/>
not with the Scriptures, ſpeaking thus, <hi>That Chriſt died for ſinners, the
whole need not the Phyſitian but the ſick; for a good man one may even dare
to die, but Chriſt died for the ungodly;</hi> By what Scripture can
he prove that Chriſt died for a ſeed in man, which needed
redemption, which ſeed is Chriſt in every man, and that Chriſt
ſuffers under ſin in every man, and is to be raiſed from under it? for
if ſo, he came to redeem himſelf in every man, who never conſented
to ſin; ſo not the man, the ſinner that was under condemnation and
the curſe, and delighted in ſin: But conſider the words of <hi>Iſay,
Iſa. 53. 6. We all like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to
his own way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all;</hi> and
this <hi>Peter</hi> teſtifieth, 1. <hi>Ep. 2. 24. He who did no ſin, his own ſelf bare
our ſins in his own body on the Tree;</hi> how expreſly doth theſe Scriptures
refute that aſſertion of <hi>G. K.</hi> neither can he ſhow any Scripture to prove
that the man Jeſus Chriſt doth bear our ſins, but as he did bear them in
his crucified body when he ſuffered for us, <hi>the juſt for the unjuſt;</hi> of
which I ſhall write more fully in anſwer to <hi>G. K.</hi> his part. And
whereas he ſaith, The Seed is raiſed in the moſt ungodly in Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time, to miniſter wrath in them without mercy; he ſhould
have expreſſed himſelf whether he underſtands by ungodly, men and
women; and whether this Seed, which he calls Chriſt, or this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of wrath raiſed in them without mercy, be after their bodily
death? for if ſo, the worm in Devils and damned perſons that never
dieth, is Chriſt in them; <hi>G. K.</hi> ſhould prove this confuſed Doctrine
of his, by the Scriptures, or keep it to himself. And ſince he ſaith, the
Soul is alſo to be ſaved within, and the whole man; what an imperfect
account doth he expreſs in this matter? as if the full and compleat
redemption and ſalvation purchaſed by Chriſt, and in hope waited
for by believers, were only a ſalvation or a being ſaved from ſin
within; wherein he is reproved by the <hi>Apoſtle, Rom. 8. 23. We have
the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, waiting for the redemption of our body; we are
ſaved by hope; we do wait in patience for it:</hi> yet theſe Saints thus wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the redemption hoped for, already witneſſed in meaſure a
being ſaved from ſin within: And for him to ſay the ſoul is to be
ſaved, how doth it agree with the Doctrine publiſhed by <hi>G. F.</hi> in a
Book, Intituled, <hi>The great myſtery of the great Whore?</hi> ſpeaking thus, p. 29.
68. 90. and 258. of the ſoul, which is part of man as he is a man, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe in man, being called his ſoul, but what is a part of him,—
that, <hi>It is infinite in it ſelf, more then all the world, a part of God, of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43551:7"/>
his being, and ſo divine, without beginning and ending, coming from
God, and returning to God again; the power of God, and God doth not
change, nor his Spirit, nor the Soul; God doth not change in his being,
neither doth that which cometh from him:</hi>—Doth a part of God infinite
in it ſelf, without beginning, that changeth not, need to be ſaved?
And if the ſoul be ſuch as is here expreſſed, then the end of ſuch mens
exhortations and preachings cannot be to gather ſouls to God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
being a part of God, without beginning, that changeth not, it
could never, nor can never be ſeparate from God; and ſo contrary to
that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the end of whoſe Miniſtry, was to beget men
and women into the faith, and hope of the reſurrection of the dead,
<hi>That at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, they might receive the end of their
faith, even the ſalvation of their ſouls 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 9. As for thy charge of
<hi>ſiniting the Quakers in the dark;</hi> I anſwer, if their own conſciences
accuſe them not, neither do I; only ſuch Preachers as this (<hi>G. K.</hi>)
doth impoſe upon them ſuch doctrine; how far they do receive it, it
doth concern them not a little ſeriouſly to conſider.</p>
            <p>In the concluſion thou tells me,—<hi>That if others had not ſet my work
before me, thou might'ſt have found in thy heart to have dealt with my Book
throughout.</hi>—And what thou wouldſt have brought forth is ſufficiently
manifeſt by the little thou haſt publiſhed; and really if a man may judge
of a work by the introduction thereunto, thou haſt given the <hi>Reader</hi>
a true account of the following Work brought forth by thy Partners;
who alſo have produced a piece of work ſutable to thy Introduction;
wherein thou haſt made thy ſelf manifeſt, as ſmiting againſt the <hi>true
Saviour, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and redemption through faith in him,
Teſtified unto by me; a work too heavy for thee, though raſhly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken

            <p>THou art the next Man I meet with oppoſing <hi>my Teſtimony;</hi> and
thou pretends in words much higher then the reſt, telling me,
<hi>That thou finds ſomewhat in thee from the Lord to anſwer me in love to my
ſoul:</hi>—But re-examine thy ſelf; didſt thou ever to this very day in
word or writing (though thou waſt in the ſame town with me) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43551:7"/>
this to me? nay verily; It is true I ſaw this anſwer of thine
another way then through thee; thou haſt therefore either never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any thing from the Lord to anſwer me in love to my ſoul, (and
it is but the product of thy own deceived mind fathered upon the
Lord, as the manner is too too often among you) or elſe thou haſt
proved rebellious and unfaithful to him that ſent thee, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable

            <p>In the Title thou tells me that I have diſingeniouſly repreſented the
<hi>Quakers</hi> and their Principles, and ſo faith thy Partner <hi>G. W.</hi> But I
ſay again, if their conſciences accuſe them not, neither have I, who
have not ſo much as mentioned them; and truly I do not find ſuch a
plain conſiſtency in thoſe Principles publiſhed as theirs by their
Teachers, or ſuch an unanimous reception of them by every perſon
among them, as that I could have undertaken to repreſent them as
the principles of every one among that people: But you are herein
like thoſe <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who when the Lord reproved the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſaid
unto him, <hi>Maſter, thus ſaying, thou reproacheſt us alſo;</hi> and thus it is
with you: Errours lodged among <hi>Turks, Jews, Arrians, Papiſts,

Truth, as recorded in the Holy Scriptures; But neceſſarily the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry

mainly concerned therein, though they are not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of thy work thou ſpeaks thus to me,—<hi>the youngeſt
child of truth may ſee thy weakneſs and confuſion;</hi>—What an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency
is there between thy words and this work, publiſhed by you
Four againſt <hi>my Teſtimony?</hi> why was there ſuch a ſtir raiſed about it?
why was it not left in its own ſimple weakneſs, without being branded
with nick-names of their nature who ſo named it? and why have ſo
many of you joyned together (as if it were for your very lives) againſt
it, yea, and forcing it to ſpeak what it intended not? And that not
by the youngeſt among you; But even by <hi>G. W.</hi> himſelf, reputed the

            <p>In the 5. page, thou expreſſeſt thy ſelf in theſe words,—<hi>Though
Redemption is wrought within by the Spirit of Chriſt, yet not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to Chriſt even as outwardly born and crucified:</hi>—Here I take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of thy ſlighting that great work of mans Redemption as already
purchaſed by Chriſt for ſinners, by that one ſacrifice of his crucified-body
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43551:8"/>
once offered for ſins; to be made effectual in all ſuch as receive
that attonement by the operations of his Spirit within, through faith
in <hi>Him</hi> the Attoner; Speaking firſt of a Redemdtion wrought in us by
the Spirit, as if that were the cauſe and foundation thereof; only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as ſomething in order thereunto, <hi>yet not without reſpect to Chriſt
as outwardly born:</hi> And this is the Doctrine of thy Partner <hi>G. W.</hi> in
the 9. <hi>page</hi> of his part in theſe words,—<hi>See Reader how erroneouſly he
hath excluded the works of God and Chriſt from within, as to ranſoming
and freeing man from ſin, and making him righteous; ſo bringing him
into unity and friendſhip with God; which is the true ſenſe of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
juſtification and reconciliation, which are not obtained without the
operation of the Spirit of holineſs within: (though Chriſts Teſtimony ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
and example had a tendency thereunto) And</hi> R. G. <hi>would impoſe
on people a faith concerning a redemption, reconciliation and juſtification,
as being all finiſhed, wrought or purchaſed without them, without reſpect
to any work wrought or to be wrought within them by any light or ſpirit
whatſoever</hi>—That I exclude the operations of the ſpirit of holineſs
within, from being neceſſary for bringing the believer into union and
friendſhip with God, is falſly charged upon me; yea, had not paſſion
blinded this man, he might have read in <hi>my Teſtimony,</hi> that I aſſerted
the neceſſity thereof in order thereunto: But that the operations of
the ſpirit of holineſs in us, are the attonement, the propitiatory ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<hi>as</hi> the ranſome, price or cauſe of our redemption, and that to
be the true ſenſe of redemption, that I deny; And this man by affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, plainly contradicts the Scriptures, ſpeaking thus of our Lord,
and the propitiatory ſacrifice of his crucified body, <hi>That he ſlew the
enmity in himſelf ſo making peace, that God reconciled us to himſelf through
the death of his Son, while we were yet enemies,</hi> ſo no qualification
wrought in us by any ſpirit whatſoever in order to the perfecting of
the purchaſe of a redemption, and paying the ranſome for ſinners:
Hence not I, who only Teſtified to the Truth of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſs
Doctrine; But this man is more truly and properly an impoſer of
this his unſcriptural Doctrine; eſpecially being a Teacher of
a people, to whom it is not allowed to queſtion, examine or diſſent
from the Doctrine delivered to them by the ancient friends of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry:
But to theſe men I ſay, that the works wrought for us by
Chriſt in his crucified body, is the firſt Myſtery, the foundation of all
our mercies, the ground of the poſſibility of having any works
wrought in us by the Spirit of God, tending to our being made like
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43551:8"/>
unto him: yea, had not our Lord finiſhed the work the Father gave
him to do, when he ſet him forth as a propitiation for the ſins of the
whole world, and had he not triamphed over all things that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us for us, and had he not obtained eternal redemption for us
by the price of his blood, we had not witneſſed the benefit thereof by
receiving that attonement through faith in him; if he had not died
(not for himſelf, but) for our-ſins, and riſen for our juſtification, we
had died in our ſins, and remained in death for ever; the works
wrought in us who believe, being but the conſequence and effect of
what he did for us, even when ſinners, before we believed; <hi>He
loved us first, he ſaw us in our blood, and ſaid onto us, live, and it was
a time of love; he died for us while we were yet ſinners, and reconciled us
to God, while we were enemies:</hi> And this Doctrine doth not invalidate
the inward operations of God within us, neither is it <hi>the Devils or
his Agents inſtrument,</hi> to exclude the inward works of Chriſt, as if
not neceſſary to us, thereby to make us partakers of his Divine Nature,
and give us fellowſhip with the Son of God; as <hi>G. W.</hi> in his laſt
words of his part would make people believe; But it is the very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> thus Teſtifying of Chriſt, <hi>That he ſlew the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in himſelf, ſo making peace;</hi> who having finiſhed the work the
Father ſent him to do, by purchaſing and perfecting Redemption
und Reconciliation with God for ſinners, by the ranſome of himſelf;
and being aſcended and glorified, ſent forth his Ambaſſadours, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
men to be reconciled to God;</hi> That in all Ages and Generations
ſuch as <hi>through faith in him receive that attonement</hi> might witneſs what
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> teſtifieth of the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 11. in theſe words,
<hi>But ye are waſhed but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name
of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God;</hi> a place of Scripture
mentioned by <hi>G. W.</hi> in his laſt words of his part, but miſerably
perverted, contrary to the true intent of the Spirit, by leaving out
theſe words, as preſſing him to hard [<hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus</hi>]
as if of purpoſe to exclude the ſufferings and ſacrifice of Chriſt as the
price of our Redemption, and the ground and cauſe of our witneſſing
a being waſhed, ſanctified and juſtified by the Spirit: whereas had
not the firſt been, the other had never been; and this man oppoſing
and denying the firſt, ſhuts out himſelf from the benefit of the ſecond.
Whileſt indeed it hath been the work of the Devil and his Agents in
ſeveral generations to darken this Doctrine of the juſtification of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
through the death of Chriſt, as a work already perfected with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43551:9"/>
God, to be witneſſed by the ſpirit through faith in Chriſt; By pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
through an obedience to be wrought by us, or in us to ſome
law or other, (as the only way) to bleſſedneſs and perfection; being a
principle agreeing with <hi>the reaſon of man;</hi> Thereby darkning and
plainly denying the attonement, and one propitiatory ſacrifice of the
Body of the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> once offered for ſins, and redemption
as already obtained through his blood, ſo plainly Teſtified unto
throughout the Scriptures; as being known only to believers through
the revelation of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But further, that thou derogates from the honour and dignity that
belongs to the Son of God, appears by thy next words, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. ſaying
—<hi>That Chriſt offered up his very fleſh through the eternal Spirit, in the
outward as an attonment unto God, in order unto our juſtification, ſo as
thereby he made ready way for our juſtification, though our juſtification
was not ſimply and abſolutely wrought thereby, as if no more were to be
done by him, or his ſpirit in us.</hi>—I do acknowledge that although I
do aſſert, that redemption and juſtification is already purchaſed for
ſinners, by the intire and perfect obedience of the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as
he whom God ſent forth as a propitiation for the ſins of the whole
world, and that he finiſhed and perfected what he came to do for us;
yet I do not ſay that he ſo finiſhed it for us, as if no more were to be
done within us by his ſpirit, in order to our receiving that attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But thou as doth thy Partner <hi>G. W.</hi> jumbles theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly
together, and ſo divides not the word aright; ſpeaking of
the works wrought for us by Chriſt, as lame and imperfect, not as
having purchaſed redemption, and reconciliation with God for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but only having done it in part; ſo not as having finiſhed the
work given him to do (though he ſo Teſtifieth of himſelf) but that
he did ſomething in order thereunto, that his Sufferings, Teſtimony
and Example had a tendency thereunto; not telling how much or
what he did, or what he left undone; and what further tendency the
Sufferings, Teſtimony and Example of Chriſt had hereunto, then that
of <hi>Pauls,</hi> or any other Martyrs, whoſe Teſtimony, Sufferings and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
had alſo a real tendency hereunto; which you ſhould have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
done, had you intended plainneſs, in honeſty to bring forth
your doctrine to be tryed in the light: Therefore although in the
13. <hi>pag.</hi> thou acknowledges, <hi>That Chriſts outward coming was not a
bare Example, but had a real influence and ſervice in its place;</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thon ſtill keeps thy ſelf in the dark, unwilling to be manifeſted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43551:9"/>
in the light, not telling us what that further influence and ſervice
was, more then being a bare example; and oppoſeſt him as the great
propitiatory ſacrifice for the ſins of the whole world, as having by the
ſacrifice of himſelf taken away ſin, and obtained Eternal Redemption
for us by his blood, as being a work already perfected by that one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
once for all, telling us plainly that Chriſt did only ſomething
in order hereunto; May I not therefore underſtand by thy ſaying, that
Chriſt was more then a bare example, that thy meaning is, that he
was ſent, to publiſh the univerſal love of God to mankind, in a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of life and ſalvation to all that believed and followed him (the
Light) in all righteouſneſs; To aboliſh the ſhadows of the Law, To
confirm his Doctrine by Miracles and an innocent life; and laſtly, to
offer up his body to be crucified by wicked hands, as a compleat Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and perfect Example; which is the fulleſt account of the ends of
his coming, enumerated by <hi>W. P.</hi> in his Book, Intituled, <hi>The ſandy
Foundation,</hi> pa. 19. Thus ſhuffling out <hi>Him, the Son of Man,</hi> As having
laid down his life a ranſome for ſins; and as having offered up his
body, and ſhed his blood without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the
blood of attonement, that ſpeaks better things then the blood of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
and as the one propitiatory ſacrifice to take away ſins; denying
him as having already aboliſhed ſin, ſlain the enmity in himſelf, ſo
making peace, as having made reconciliation, purchaſed juſtification
for remiſſion of ſins, and obtained Eternal Redemption for ſinners;
That all believers in all generations through this work ſo finiſhed and
perfected by him in his body of fleſh, might through faith in Him,
<hi>the Son of Man, the Attoner,</hi> receive that attonement for the remiſſion
of their ſins, and as a ground of hope to them after their being dead,
to be raiſed again unto life eternal by the reſurrection of the dead,
unto all which the Holy Scriptures expreſly Teſtifie, and of all which
this man ſpeaks not one word, but rather pleads againſt it: agreeable
to that Doctrine publiſhed among you, ſpeaking thus in a Book, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>Sauls errand to Damaſcus,</hi> pa. 8. <hi>Chriſt in his people is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of all figures, types and ſhadows, fulfilling them in them, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them free from them: But as he is held forth in the Scripture-letter
without them, and in the fleſh without them, he is their example or figure,
which is both one, that the ſame things might be fulfilled in them that was
in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>—But if thou tell me that thou haſt mentioned an
attonement, a ſacrifice, a propitiation, yet I ſay, thou not having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of them, as only of the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or of thoſe ends in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43551:10"/>
to us they are made mention of in Scripture, may I not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
account thee one with thy Partner <hi>G. W.</hi> who in the 12. <hi>pa.</hi> of
his Part, plainly expreſſeth himſelf in theſe words;—<hi>That Chriſt in
his outward death was a ranſome, an attonement, an acceptable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
ſacrifice to God, a propitiation for mankind, and to be a living Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
through all, not only to end the Law and Sacrifices without, but to
bring the believers beyond and through the miniſtration of death, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and wrath within, into peace and union with God:</hi>—But which
of all the <hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ever ſo wrote, of a ranſome, an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a propitiation, a purchaſe, a price of our Redemption, as of a
work to be done in us, as it was in Chriſt, or that in theſe Chriſt was
an Example to us, that they might over again be effected in us, or that
Chriſt was a figure; And which of all thoſe Holy Men ever ſo wrote,
of a believers being brought through the miniſtration of death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
and wrath, after the Example of the <hi>Man Chriſt,</hi> as he
not having already in his body of fleſh born all theſe things for us, and
by his reſurrection from the dead triumphed over all theſe things that
were againſt us, for us: And which of all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſo wrote of theſe
things as thou haſt done, telling us that <hi>Chriſt did ſomewhat in the
outward, in order to our juſtification, though our juſtification was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
wrought thereby:</hi> Now ſince in the Holy Scriptures this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of faith in the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> for our Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as already purchaſed by his obedience in the body of his fleſh, is
plainly and fully expreſſed; this new coyned myſtery of faith in the
light in your conſciences, or within you, as it is within you, and in
every man as he comes into the world, as your <hi>Saviour,</hi> and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thereunto to be done and perfected in your bodies or within you,
by his Spirit and after his example, as the cauſe of your juſtification for
the remiſſion of ſins, and the ground of your hope for eternal Life,
and ſalvation of the Soul and whole man; I ſay this Doctrine
of yours being another then that of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cannot take place,
but in them who having rejected the truth, are therefore given up to
ſtrong deluſions.</p>
            <p>But as having a mind yet further to cavil, In the 7. <hi>pa.</hi> thou argues
thus;—<hi>Is not this confuſion and contradiction to thy ſelf, firſt to ſay, a
man dead in ſins, unſanctified, altogether a child of wrath, and yet God
is fully attoned, perfectly reconciled to them,</hi> I anſwer, Were it not
more honeſty in thee, to charge the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> then me, who wreſts not,
but only repeats the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words, ſaying, <hi>we were reconciled to God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43551:10"/>
by the death of his Son while we were yet enemies?</hi> thou ſhouldſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
clamour againſt the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> thus, is not this palpable confuſion
and contradiction to thy ſelf, <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſay of enemies, while yet ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
ſo unſanctified perſons, God fully to be reconciled with ſuch,
even while ſuch? doſt thou think this clamour of thine, will make
void the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> plain poſitive aſſertion? and ſhall we therefore ſay,
the Apoſtle was miſtaken, and is now corrected by <hi>G. K.</hi> But that
thou mayſt appear not ſo plainly to contradict the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the 13. <hi>page,</hi> thou tells me,—<hi>And though the Apoſtle ſaith,
while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
yet he adds, much more ſhall we be ſaved by his life:</hi> I anſwer, Is it
any wonder that thou unfaithfully repeats my words, to make them
ſpeak what I intended not, when thou dare do the ſame with the
very <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words, leaving that part of the ſentence out which is
moſt weighty againſt thee? the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. being theſe,
<hi>much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life;</hi> and what doth
this make for thee? the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, that while we were enemies we
were reconciled, in the time paſt, and he ſpake truth, although thou
dares quarrel it as a contradiction, and alſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>being
reconciled</hi> (in the time paſt) <hi>we ſhall be ſaved by his life;</hi> in the time to
come, as to be done, although they were already reconciled; and
from this alſo thou diſſents, as I have already proved by thy own
words, <hi>page</hi> 16. ſpeaking of the Soul, yea, and the whole man being
ſaved within; although the Apoſtle ſpoke truth, that being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
we ſhall be ſaved by his life; that as God raiſed him from the
dead, and as he now lives and ſhall die no more, we alſo whom
while enemies, God reconciled to himſelf by the death of his Son, we
who ſince we believed, having received that attonement, ſhall after our
bodily death be raiſed from the grave, and be made partakers of that
ſalvation, which through faith and hope we wait for while in the
body; for we are ſaved by hope: And in the next words of that 13.
<hi>pag.</hi> thou ſayſt to me—<hi>And though thou uſes this Scripture to prove, that
men are reconciled to God through the death of Chriſt, excluding any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
wrought by him in them, yet it is but an abuſe of the place;</hi>
(though I only repeat the Apoſtles expreſs words, and mentioned no
more then what is plainly aſſerted by them) <hi>nor need I go further then
thy own confeſſion to alledge a more ſafe way of underſtanding that Scripture,
as where thou ſayſt, although in the dayes of</hi> Iſaias <hi>Chriſt was not then
come in our fleſh, yet the Prophet ſpeaks of it as a thing already done, it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43551:11"/>
being ſo in the purpoſe of God; and ſo why may not</hi> Paul <hi>after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
—I anſwer. <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be underſtood ſo to ſpeak, becauſe the
death of the Man Chriſt was paſt before he ſo wrote: And if we
ſhould ſo underſtand theſe words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> it confirms that I
aſſerted; for as Chriſts ſufferings ſpoken of by the <hi>Prophet Iſaias</hi> as
done in his time, becauſe according to the Scriptures (and therefore
my confeſſion) <hi>were what his band and his Counſel determined before
to be done;</hi> therefore they were in the fulneſs of time ſo really accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
as God before determined; thus if <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of Gods being
in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf, and that while we were
enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, it being ſo
in the purpoſe of God before the foundation of the world, ſurely then,
when Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to finiſh what the counſel of
God before hand had determined, he really, actually finiſhed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
it; or elſe the purpoſe of God was fruſtrate, and Chriſt
finiſhed not what God before hand determined he ſhould do, and ſet
him forth for to do; which to aſſert either of God or Chriſt are alike
impiouſly blaſphemous.</p>
            <p>Thy Partner <hi>G. W.</hi> in the 15. <hi>page</hi> of his Part, ſaith,—<hi>This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
tends to make a merry world in their ſins;</hi>—But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> as
if of purpoſe to rebuke this ſpirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. ſaith, <hi>Shall we therefore
ſin that grace may abound, God forbid!</hi> and in another place, <hi>The grace
of God teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs:</hi> And in the 16. <hi>page, G. W.</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argues thus,—<hi>Could that be an anſwer of divine juſtice, ſo to take
vengeance on the innocent, and let the guilty go with their ſins paſt, preſent,
and to come? and how can God then in juſtice execute wrath on any for
ſin?</hi>—I anſwer, It is ſtrange to find this man, ſo very dark, thus to
argue againſt God! However he is reproved by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> who ſaith
in expreſs words (as if of purpoſe to check this cavelling ſpirit) of the
<hi>Man Chriſt; He died, the juſt for the unjuſt; though in him was no
guile found, yet he was made ſin and a curſe for us; though be had done
no violence, neither was any deceit</hi> in his <hi>mouth; yet it pleaſed the Lord
to bruiſe him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was ſmitten of God, wounded for our tranſgreſſims, the
chaſtiſements of our peace were upon him though we had turned every one to
his own way; the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all:</hi> This, man
ſhould thus anſwer the Prophet <hi>Iſaias,</hi> is that divine juſtice, to take
vengeance on, wound ſinite, bruiſe the innocent, and let the guilty
go free: And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> aſſerts in ſo many words. <hi>Thu Jeſus Chriſt
the righteous is a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world;</hi> may I not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43551:11"/>
thence in truth aſſert <hi>Him</hi> to have been <hi>a propitiation for all ſins, paſt,
preſent, and to come;</hi> which ſince this man ſo much quarrels, narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the extent of Chriſts death; of whom it is written, That <hi>He taſted
death for every man,</hi> Let him plainly anſwer, (God having ſo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before the foundation of the world) whether there was any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
that the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhould have been offered up as a ſacrifice
for remiſſion of ſins at all; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>That without blood
there was no remiſſion;</hi> which if ſo, that if for the remiſſion of every
ſin there be a neceſſity of that blood of attonement, if he did not then
when he was offered up, attone for all ſins, muſt he then come again
to be offered up again for thoſe remaining ſins, not already attoned
for, by that one Sacrifice of his Body, already once offered never to be
offered again? And though this one propitiatory ſacrifice once for all
be ſufficient in it ſelf for the ſins of the whole world, yet ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it not, but through unbelief reject him, Chriſt ſaith of ſuch; <hi>The
wrath of the Father abides on them;</hi> they remaining ſtill in unbelief, the
ſentence of the Law, (<hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things
which we written in the Book of the Law to do them</hi>) remaining alſo in
them, becauſe they have not received this attonement, but putting
that word of God, ſpoken to them from them, have judged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unworthy of everlaſting life.</p>
            <p>In the 7. <hi>Page,</hi> I find another exception againſt this Doctrine of
the <hi>Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 5. 8, 19. The Apoſtles words are, Hath reconciled
us,</hi> viz. <hi>Vs who believe and are ſanctified; but of the world he ſaith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling,
ſo not reconciled; yea, in that ſame place he mentions a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
on their part to be wrought by the ſpirit in order to their full reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
be ye reconciled to God.</hi>—I anſwer, thou art here very hard
put to it, who though thou be a Maſter of Arts, muſt be deſired to ask
the Boyes in the Grammar-School, whether <hi>was reconciling,</hi> and hath
<hi>reconciled,</hi> do not both denote a time paſt; And if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpoke
truth, ſaying in the time paſt, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world
to himſelf</hi> and if <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo ſpoke truth of himſelf, <hi>John 14. 4. I have
finiſhed the work the Father gave me to do;</hi> then ſurely what God was
doing in time paſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to wit, reconciling the world to himſelf,
he finiſhed it; and ſo it is a work already done and perfected on God,
part: And for that qualification mentioned by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> on their
part, it confirms what I aſſerted, and I have alſo affirmed it in <hi>my
Teſtimony,</hi> that in order to make the reconciliation with God already
finiſhed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> effectual in every man, we are (as a qualification
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43551:12"/>
required on our part, as to receiving that attonement already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected)
invited to be reconciled to God, who in Chriſt Jeſus is already
reconciled to us, even while enemies; which qualification on our
part is not the reaſon or cauſe of our reconcilation with God; for the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the next words, plainly points out to us the reaſon and
cauſe thereof; <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin,
that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> here is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all our hopes, the ground of our confidence, the reaſon
why we are invited to be reconciled to God, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt who knew
noſin, was made ſin for us,</hi> a work already done and perfected; the
fruit and conſequence whereof is, <hi>that we might be made the righteouſneſs
of God in him:</hi> Had not the firſt been done and perfected by
Chriſt without us, we had never witneſſed the ſecond within us:
They that ſleight and reject the ſecond, really neither know nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the firſt; they that oppoſe and reject the firſt, they ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
out from the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude this matter, in the 13. <hi>Page,</hi> as if thou hadſt ſet
thy ſelf of purpoſe to print thy ſelf-contradictions, after a great deal
of vain jangling thou confeſſeſt to the truth in plain words though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thy ſelf and Partners; therefore I ſhall ſum up this Doctrine
which I have according to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> affirmed, and which thou
contrary to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> haſt cavelled againſt and denied, in thy own
very words,—<hi>We do willingly acknowledge, the full and perfect redemption
was in Chriſt, while we were enemies; but now ſince we believed,
we have received the attonement.</hi>—</p>
            <p>But I further take notice of thy next words in the 5. <hi>Page,</hi> thus;—
<hi>Our juſtification was not abſolutely wrought by Chriſt as manifeſt in his
body of fleſh; As if his outward body, fleſh and blood were the only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
excluding the inward.</hi>—I anſwer, neither do I aſſert that his
fleſh and blood was the only ſacrifice; <hi>for his ſoul was made an offering
for ſin,</hi> ſo that thou ſhouldſt have more fully expreſt thy ſelf herein:
For if thou underſtands, <hi>by excluding the inward,</hi> the inward works
of the ſpirit as wrought within us, then with thee, Chriſt in offering
up himſelf a ranſome and ſacrifice for ſin, is an imperfect, unſufficient
propitiation excluding thoſe inward works, as if theſe were a part
thereof; thou ſhouldſt have ſpoken more plainly in this matter, as
doth one <hi>W. S.</hi> a Teacher among you, in his Book, Intituled, <hi>A new
Catechiſme,</hi> pa. 64. in theſe words, As the Foundation and Principle
of the <hi>Quakers;—We believe that Chriſt in us doth offer up himſelf</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43551:12"/>
(mark that, a work yet a doing) <hi>a living ſacrifice unto God for us, by
which the wrath and juſtice of God is appeaſed towards us; and that
through the Offering and Sacrifice of CHRIST the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
of Ordinances which ſtood againſt us, is blotted out;</hi>
(mark that, in the preſent time, as now doing,)—How plainly
doth this man ſet himſelf to ſpeak another Doctrine then that of the
<hi>Apoſtles;</hi> the ſacrifice offered up to God for ſin is called by the <hi>Apoſtle,
one offering, once offered;</hi> and therefore alſo is called the offering of
the body of Jeſus: Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith plainly, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 5, 6. there
is one Mediatour between God, and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> (mark that,
the Man Chriſt Jeſus, as Son of Man) <hi>who gave,</hi> (mark that, in the time
paſt) <hi>himſelf;</hi> mark that, not meekneſs, humility, patience; or the
like in every man, but-himſelf) <hi>a ranſom for all:</hi> hence Chriſt the Son of
Man was the ranſome for all; And ſo it is, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 2. Who hath given
himſelf an offering to God for us:</hi> This man tells us; that it is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the <hi>Quakers, to believe Chriſt in us</hi> (as ſpiritually manifeſted
in us ſo not as Son of Man without us) <hi>doth offer</hi> up himſelf a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto God for us: This man ſaith, <hi>The hand-writing of Ordinances
which ſtood againſt us is blotted out,</hi> (as doing in us.) The Apoſtle ſaid,
<hi>blotting it out,</hi> and took it out of the way, as done; Thus he renders
the Foundation and Principle of the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be another then that
of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> And ſuch kind of doctrine doth thy Partner <hi>G. W.</hi>
mention in the 14. and 15. <hi>Pag.</hi> of his Part, in theſe words—<hi>That
in reſpect of our being renewed by the Spirit of Chriſt, we are ſaid to be
purchaſed to God; and in this ſenſe it is ſaid, God hath purchaſed his
Church with his own blood.</hi> How darkly and confuſedly doth this man
write: It is true, by being renewed by the ſpirit within, it comes to
be manifeſt that we are theſe whom Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath purchaſed; but that
theſe works of the ſpirit wrought in us are the Ranſome, the Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the propitiatory Sacrifice, or any part of it, or the ground
and cauſe of our being redeemed, that I deny as contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
Teſtifying the Sacrifice and purchaſe of our Redemption
thereby, to be a work done at once, by the one offering of the Body
of the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in this ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>God hath purchaſed</hi> (a
work done and perfected) <hi>his Church by his own blood;</hi> whereas
<hi>G. W.</hi> his confuſed doctrine renders this purchaſe, as a work, dayly
doing, in every generation, in many bodies, as every man comes to
be renewed by the ſpirit: And really this is in effect no leſs then in a
more fine dreſs of new coyned words a bringing in another, unbloody
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43551:13"/>
ſacrifice, like that <hi>Rome,</hi> with this difference; that is an offering
of a piece of Bread, which they ſay is the Body of Chriſt, this new
one is Faith and Patience, and the like graces of the Spirit of God,
which theſe men ſay, is offered up in us for us to God, as a ranſome,
an attonement, and purchaſe of our Redemption: Both agreeing in
this, that there is another offering, another ſacrifice dayly offered up
for ſin, then that one ſacrifice of the Body of the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then and there once offered up to God through
the Eternal Spirit for the ſins of the whole world.</p>
            <p>In the 6. <hi>Pa.</hi> thou acknowledges,—<hi>That our ſalvation and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath a neceſſary reſpect to the death of Chriſt in the outward, God ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſo ordained it.</hi>—Now conſider thy words, that which our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and juſtification hath a <hi>neceſſary</hi> reſpect unto, without the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof (to wit, the death of the Man <hi>Chriſt</hi>) we could never have
been ſaved or juſtified: Now let <hi>G. L.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> thy Partners in
this work Teſtifie whether thou haſt ſpoken the truth herein, or not:
<hi>G. L.</hi> writes thus to me, as is afterward mentioned in his Part,—
<hi>It is not names and things done abroad, but the life within that redeems
the ſoul to God;</hi>—The death of Chriſt in the outward, being a name
and thing done abroad, doth not (ſaith <hi>G. L.</hi>) redeem the ſoul to God;
he allows not, but plainly excludes any ſuch neceſſary reſpect our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
hath to Chriſts death in the outward: <hi>G. W.</hi> in the 16. <hi>pa.</hi>
of his Part tells me,—<hi>That it is a blaſphemous oppoſing the Omnipotency
of God, and an undervaluing him as if he were no Saviour,</hi> to aſſert any
ſuch neceſſary reſpect our Redemption hath to the death of <hi>Chriſt;
eſpecially</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>while R. G. thinks God was ſo diſpleaſed, and his
wrath ſo ſtirred up, that it would hold man captive in death; unleſs Chriſt
as Son of</hi> Mary <hi>ſhould ſatisfie and anſwer this wrath, and undergo this
death.</hi>—Thus as it was ſaid of old of thoſe falſe witneſſes who bore
Teſtimony againſt the Perſon of our Lord; ſo may it alſo be ſaid of
you who have joyned your ſelves againſt <hi>my Teſtimony</hi> both to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Doctrine; <hi>And their witneſs agreed not together:</hi> But to help
thee out of this ſtrait, that thou mayſt joyn hands again with thy
Brethren, turn to the 8. <hi>Pa.</hi> of thy Book, where repeating theſe
words out of my Book, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is another ſnare, that carrieth
death in the boſome of it; and it is that ſpirit that publiſheth, that
the light in every man is the true Chriſt our only Saviour, and there
is not another; And that man is to be joyned to this light, which of
it ſelf is able to redeem him as he becomes obedient thereunto: To
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43551:13"/>
all which thou adds theſe words,—<hi>here with open mouth thou ſmites
againſt our Principle,</hi>—then ſurely by thy confeſſion this muſt be thy
Principle; and if ſo, thou plainly contradicts thy ſelf; for here is no
mention of Chriſts death in the outward, nor any room left for any
ſuch neceſſary reſpect our Redemption hath thereunto, that being a
part of that ſnare, to pretend to Redemption without any ſuch neceſſary
reſpect to the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 8. page thou argues againſt me from ſome of my words thus,
—<hi>Thou ſayeſt, light and power in Chriſt conſidered as diſtinct from his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man, and the light in every man as he comes into the World, aſſerted to
be he the true Chriſt, is to aſſert another Saviour then him, Jeſus Chriſt of
Nazareth born of</hi> Mary, <hi>and yet thou expreſly pleads for Chriſt being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
within men; who of the weakeſt diſcerning cannot ſee thy ſelf-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
here:</hi>—I anſwer, thou art reproved by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who plainly
teſtified <hi>that the ſame Jeſus whom the Jews Crucified is both Lord and
Chriſt, and there is not another;</hi> and yet alſo pleaded that <hi>Chriſt might
beformed in them;</hi> By the firſt telling us who the true Chriſt was and
is, the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> the ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom the Jews
Crucified. In the other expreſſion they tell us how we partake of his
nature, to wit, by his being formed within us, called <hi>Chriſt within the
hope of glory; Chriſt dwelling in us by Faith:</hi> Now thou jumbles and
confounds theſe, not dividing the word of truth aright. <hi>The man
Chriſt Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> to be the true and only Chriſt, thou doſt not
confeſs, which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> plainly did; Chriſt as formed within, the
hope of glory, dwelling in us by Faith, as manifeſt within us; this
manifeſtation of him as in us, thou calls the true Chriſt, our only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> never did. Thus ſetting thy ſelf to ſpeak
contrary to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> thou dares boldly (though blindly) call their
plain poſitive Aſſertions, Contradictions.</p>
            <p>And ſutable to this thy Doctrine, is thy Confeſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the
13. page, in theſe words,—<hi>We believe and acknowledg him who was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
in that body of fleſh, to be he the true and only Chriſt.</hi> This is a
new coined Confeſſion; differing, and quite another then that of
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in theſe words, 16. <hi>Matth. 16. Thou art</hi> (not he that is
manifeſt in that body of thine, but, thou) <hi>art the Son of the living God:</hi>
and after his being aſcended and glorified, they confeſs him in theſe
words, <hi>Acts 2. 36. Let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly that God hath
made that ſame Jeſus</hi> (not him that was manifeſt in that body of fleſh,
but the ſame Jeſus) <hi>whom ye have crucified both</hi> Lord and Chriſt: Is it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43551:14"/>
becauſe he was hanged on a tree that thou art aſhamed to own him as
Saviour? Or that thou doſt not believe that God raiſed him from the
dead? or rather art thou afraid to confeſs him, becauſe of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi>
leſt they ſhould put thee out of their Synagogue, as they have
done ſome others, becauſe they openly confeſſed him? Oh conſider
the words of our Lord, <hi>Luke 12. 8, 9. Whoſoever ſhall confeſs me</hi> (not
him in me, but me) <hi>before men, him ſhall the Son of man</hi> (not him in the
Son of Man conſidered as diſtinct from him, a man) <hi>alſo confeſs him
before the Angels of God; But he that denyeth me</hi> (to wit the Son of
Man) <hi>ſhall be denyed before the Angels of God:</hi> Doſt thou think that
thou haſt found out a better manner of expreſſing this truth, then the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> had? or doſt thou not really change their Doctrine by thy
new coyned manner of expreſſing it; for by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> the <hi>Man</hi> is
acknowledged as Saviour, <hi>That ſame Jeſus whom ye Crucified, a man
approved of God among the people; unto you this day is born a Saviour,
Jeſus; there is one Mediatour, the man Chriſt Jeſus; by man came death,
by man came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead.</hi> By thee the <hi>man</hi> is left
out and ſhuffled by, not confeſſing <hi>him the Son of Man</hi> (as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
ever did) to be <hi>he;</hi> but <hi>him</hi> (to wit the God-head conſidered as diſtinct
from his being a man) that was manifeſt in that body of Fleſh, to be
<hi>he;</hi> the true and only Chriſt our Mediatour, which the Apoſtles never
did; herein agreeing with the Doctrine of <hi>H. W.</hi> a Preacher among
you, who in a Book intituled, <hi>A Declaration to the Baptiſts,</hi> pag. 13.
tells plainly—<hi>Chriſt was never ſeen with any carnal eye, nor his voice
heard with any carnal ear</hi>—hereby plainly denying <hi>him</hi> to be the <hi>Son of
Man,</hi> who, as of purpoſe to rebuke this lying Spirit, teſtified of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he was both ſeen and heard by the bodily eyes and ears of
thoſe among whom he converſed, <hi>John</hi> 9. 35. he ſaith to the man
that was born blind, <hi>Doſt thou believe on the Son of God? he anſwered
and ſaid, Who is he Lord that I might believe on him? And Jeſus ſaid
unto him, thou haſt both ſeen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</hi> Mark
this if our Lord ſpoke truth, he whom this man both ſaw and talked
with, with his bodily eyes and tongue, was the <hi>Meſſias, the Son of God.</hi>
And ſince he was aſcended and glorified, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. was it not the true
Chriſt, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> who appeared and ſpoke unto <hi>Saul,</hi> as he
was going with his Perſecuting companions to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> he ſaid ſo
of himſelf, <hi>I am Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> yet it is added in the 9. verſe, <hi>and
the men which journeyed with him ſtood ſpeechleſs, hearing a Voice, but
ſeeing no man.</hi> Thus that <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Preached, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43551:14"/>
believed in as the true Chriſt, the Son of God, was both ſeen and heard
by the bodily eyes and ears of unbelievers: And hence <hi>Peter 1 Epiſtle</hi>
chap. 7. ver. 8. writes thus to Believers, elect through the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Spirit unto obedience, who therefore in and by Faith
had ſeen him, <hi>Faith being the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> yet to ſuch he
ſaith, <hi>that the tryal of your Faith might be found unto praiſe, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of Jeſus Chriſt, whom having not ſeen, ye love, in whom, though
now ye ſee him not, yet believing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye rejoyce:</hi> And hence our Lord ſaid to
<hi>Thomas, John 20. 29. Becauſe thou haſt ſeen me</hi> (and this was with his
bodily eyes) <hi>thou haſt believed, bleſſed are they which have not ſeen</hi> (and
ſurely this is not of an inward ſight of him by Faith) <hi>and yet have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:</hi>
Here is a being ſanctified unto obedience in Chriſt with joy,
and yet, in him whom they now ſee not.</p>
            <p>And to maintain this Doctrine, in the 17. page thou mentions theſe
words;—<hi>Though it be ſaid by ſome of us, that Chriſt was ſometime prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
as crucified to the Jews, but more generally a light to the Gentiles,
which imports but one Chriſt in a twofold way of appearance; for though
the Apoſtles Preached him in the form of a man, yet they Preached him alſo,
and that more generally, a light to the Gentiles.</hi>—What ſtrange Doctrine
is this? If the Apoſtles Preached Chriſt in the form of a man; when
they ſo Preached him, was he not a real man? And if ſo, (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you neither confeſs nor Preach him as a man, but as a light in
that man Chriſt, and as a light in every man, as it is in every man, as
he comes into the World) tell us plainly what is become of that man?
Hath he now any real, individual glorified bodily exiſtence? and was
there ever, or will there ever be remiſſion of ſins Preached by the
Spirit of God, but through that man? and where doſt thou find in
the Scriptures that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Preached one way of appearance of
Chriſt to the Jews, and another to the Gentiles? Was not he whom
they Preached in the form of a man to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and him they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the light of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> one and the ſame Chriſt, to wit, <hi>the
man Chriſt Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> Old <hi>Simeon</hi> plainly tells us, (if he may
be believed) that the <hi>man Chriſt,</hi> the child then born of <hi>Mary,</hi> whom
he had in his arms, <hi>is a light to lighten the Gentiles;</hi> And he, the man
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I am the light of the World;</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
they preached <hi>him</hi> as <hi>a man</hi> (though he was and is alſo God) to be
believed infor remiſſion of ſins, both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and to the <hi>Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
that very ſame man they preached to be the <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Jews, him</hi>
alſo, and <hi>none but him,</hi> they preached a glory and a light both to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43551:15"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> And this <hi>Peters</hi> diſcourſe to the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 2, and
to the <hi>Gentiles Acts</hi> 10. doth plainly teſtifie. So the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but one and the ſame Chriſt both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to wit, <hi>the
man Chriſt Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> and but one and the ſame way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the man Chriſt, both in the <hi>Jews</hi> and in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to
wit, through Faith in <hi>him:</hi> And to <hi>him,</hi> as Saviour, and to this way
of his appearance in Believers, through Faith by his Spirit, for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and remiſſion of ſins, through him, I have in plain words teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and you have oppoſed; but in the day of the coming of <hi>this Son of
Man,</hi> even at the appearing of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
when he ſhall come the ſecond time without ſin unto Salvation (which
haſmeth) which of us have confeſſed or denyed him, will then be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.</p>
            <p>From page 9, to 12. thou uſeſt many words to prove the Doctrine
of Juſtification through obedience to the light in every man as he
comes into the World, not to be an eſtabliſhing of the Covenant of
Works: In all which, thou haſt not touched that Doctrine as I laid it
down; only (to ſhift the matter) thou tells me, - <hi>That the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
requires both Faith and Works upon our part;</hi>—This I deny not:
But I do deny that either Faith or Works wrought by us, or in us by
the Spirit of Chriſt, are the previous, procuring, purchaſing cauſe of
the Love of God to us while ſinners, and thence as the ground or cauſe
of our Juſtification with God, or Salvation: This thou meddles not
directly with, only to weaken and darken the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
for remiſſion of ſins, and redemption through Jeſus Chriſt,
freely through grace without works, <hi>even through Faith in his blood,
whom God hath ſet forth</hi> (in the time paſt ſo already done) <hi>to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
to declare his righteouſneſs for remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, even
the righteouſneſs of God manifeſted without the Law, witneſſed by the Law
and the Prophets, even the righteouſneſs of God which is by Faith of Chriſt
Jeſus, unto all, and upon all them that believe:</hi> I ſay, to obſcure and
oppoſe this Doctrine, thou tells me thus,—<hi>Thou art ignorant of the
nature of the New Covenant, as if doing were proper only to the Old and
firſt Covenant in order to Juſtification, which is falſe:</hi>—Thus according
to thy manner, thou confuſedly jumbles this matter; but the better
to inform me, why didſt thou not diſtinctly prove by the Scriptures,
that under the <hi>New Covenant</hi> doing is properly required in order to
Juſtification with God, as the previous procuring cauſe thereof? But
not being able to do this, thou tells me in ſum this,—<hi>That the works
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43551:15"/>
the Law excluded by the Apoſtle from juſtification, is when the Law is done,
without life or ſpirit, the firſt Covenant or Law coming before the Seed be
raiſed, ſo the works not done in Chriſt the Seed, do not juſtifie; And that
the righteouſneſs by Faith is when the Law is performed in us by works in
the Spirit, a righteouſneſs in the Elect Seed and works thereof:</hi>—Theſe
are ſtrange unſcriptural expreſſions, in effect renewing again the old
<hi>Popiſh</hi> trick, to elude the force of ſuch Scriptures as do indefinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all works wrought in us or by us as the ground or cauſe of our
juſtification with God for remiſſion of ſins, without any ſuch <hi>ſtrange
diſtinction;</hi> which in plainer words they of <hi>Rome</hi> thus expreſs, the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> excludes from juſtification works which we our ſelves do, by
our own ſtrength, without the help of the Grace of God, not thoſe
works we do by the aid of the Spirit; which really confounds the
Old and New Covenant, making them but one and the ſame: for
that which requireth works to be wrought in us, as the ground and
procuring cauſe of our righteouſneſs and juſtification, though wrought
in and through the Spirit of God, whether by obedience to a Law
without or within us, whether the works be done (as thou words it)
before the Seed be raiſed, or in the Elect Seed, is a Law of works ſtill,
and but the <hi>firſt Covenant</hi> ſtill, which ſaith <hi>the man that doth theſe things
ſhall live by them;</hi> and ſo a being juſtified by works, contrary to the
<hi>Apoſtle,</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. 3. 5. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done:</hi>
Rom. 11. 6. <hi>If it be of works, then were Grace no more Grace;</hi> But plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one with that of <hi>Rome:</hi> And although it is God who worketh all
our works in us and for us, and that works which God accepts, are
performed by the help of his Spirit within us; yet the works ſo
wrought are called in Scripture our faith, our hope, our good works;
for it is the man that believes and obeyes, not God in the man, as ſome
have fondly imagined: Hence notwithſtanding of this far-fetched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
thy Doctrine is no other then the old <hi>Law-working-ſpirit,</hi>
ſetting up an attonement, a propitiation, a righteouſneſs by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of works done (as thou ſpeaks) in the Elect ſeed raiſed in us;
thereby denying that one propitiatory Sacrifice of the one Crucified
body of the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and that blood of attonement, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and righteouſneſs as purchaſed thereby; and ſo already in
being in him as our head; which hath this real tendency, even to blot
out of our hearts the name and remembrance of that <hi>one great propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
once offered for ſins, and redemption, righteouſneſs and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
with God as already purchaſed and perfected thereby, until
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43551:16"/>
no other righteouſneſs or redemption be known, but by obedience to
the light in every man, as in every man; And thus <hi>ſo much obedience,
ſo much redemption, and no more,</hi> ſaith this Law-working Spirit from
among you; In this one principle agreeing with all the falſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the World, to wit, that obedience to ſome Law or other, is the
ground and cauſe of Righteouſneſs and bleſſedneſs with God; as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the <hi>Wiſdome of the Greeks,</hi> and <hi>reaſon of man:</hi> Whereas the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> ſpeaketh thus of our Lord, <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> hath done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
receive the attonement, be ye reconciled to God, believe and be
ſaved; exalting the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the perfection of Grace and
Righteouſneſs, as having already by the blood of his Croſs, put an end
to the miniſtration of the Law, ſlain the enmity in himſelf, the power
of ſin death and the Law for us; and thus he is our Saviour: And by
receiving this attonement ſo already finiſhed through Faith in him the
Attoner, by the workings of his Spirit within us, redemption and
righteouſneſs is known and witneſſed: And this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the firſt and ſecond Covenant, that we return to bleſſedneſs with
God, not by an obedience to be done and perfected by or in us, as the
ground and cauſe thereof, but through that one propitiatory Sacrifice
of the body of Chriſt once offered for all; thus by a living Faith being
united to <hi>him</hi> the Saviour, his Victory and triumph becomes the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
who thus is compleat in him; and who can therefore truly
ſay in the words of the <hi>Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 15. 55. O death, where is thy
ſting! O grave where is thy victory? the ſting of death is ſin, and the
ſtrength of ſin is the Law; But thanks be to God which giveth us Victory,</hi>
(mark that, how boaſting becauſe of works is excluded, he giveth us
Victory) <hi>through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> But though thou mention a
firſt and ſecond Covenant, yet with thee they are in effect but one;
eſpecially whilſt thou tells me of a firſt Covenant and Law which is
aboliſhed as a carnal Commandment, and yet calleſt the Law planted
in every man as he comes into the World, the Law of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus; which if ſo, the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Law thereof being aboliſhed, what new Covenant and Law
thereof is brought in the place of it? with thee none at all, but ſtill
the ſame as was before, in the time of the Law, and afterward in all
Ages, ſince the day that God created <hi>Adam,</hi> to wit, the Law planted
in every man as he comes into the World: thou ſhouldſt rid thy ſelf
of ſuch confuſion before thou judg another mans work confuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:43551:16"/>
In Page 7. thou reckons this Doctrine, which excludes Faith from
being the previous procuring cauſe of juſtification with God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, the principle of the <hi>Antinomians:</hi> But this charge of
being againſt the Law, or an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> is falſly caſt upon me, who
owns and declares, that the Law is holy, ſpiritual, juſt and good; and
that it remains in force as a Law, ſummed up by our Lord, in the love
to God and to our Neighbour: And thou art rather an <hi>Antinomian,</hi>
that is againſt the holy Law of God, ſaying in the 10 page,—<hi>That the
firſt Covenant or Law is called in the Scripture, a carnal Commandment,</hi>—which
is ſpoken by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> of the Law of the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Prieſt-hood, and not of the Law of the firſt Covenant, either as it
is in every man by nature, or as it was adminiſtred by <hi>Moſes,</hi> called the
ten Commandments, of which Law the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Law is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:
thy ignorance of the Scriptures is very great:</hi> And that ſpirit alſo
from among you is alſo an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> againſt the holy Law of God
that ſpeaketh thus, <hi>That the Law written in Tables of ſtone, ſtood in meats
and drinks, was faulty, made nothing perfect, and therefore was to be done
away becauſe of its unprofitableneſs;</hi> Whereas the Law is <hi>holy, ſpiritual,
juſt and good,</hi> and Chriſt came not to aboliſh it, but it remains in force,
and is ſtill profitable to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who came to
fulfill it, thereby to take away (not the Law, but) that Covenant of
Works, as being an adminiſtration of condemnation and death, which
he aboliſhed and conquered, and put an end to thoſe typical ſervices,
which pointed, and gave place to <hi>him</hi> the ſubſtance, who is <hi>a Mediator</hi>
of a better Covenant eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes; that what the
Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh (mark that)
not as if it were weak or inſufficient in it ſelf, as thou ſayeſt in the
10. Page,—<hi>that it cannot give to man to perform perfect obedience to God;</hi>
But the Law was weak through the fleſh; <hi>God ſent his own Son in the
likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of the Law</hi> (which through the weakneſs of the fleſh could not
be fulfilled by us, but was fulfilled by Chriſt Jeſus for us) <hi>might be
fulfilled in us, who walk</hi> not after the fleſh but after the Spirit; being
through Faith in him under the adminiſtration of righteouſneſs and
of the Spirit; and through his fulfilling the Law for us, thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the condemnation and curſe thereof; from which man
could not by his future obedience performed by or in him by vertue
of any Law or light in him, have been delivered, ſo as to have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby Juſtification with God for remiſſion of ſins which were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43551:17"/>
paſt, without a Sacrifice, and his blood of attonement in whoſe mouth
was no guile; becauſe without blood there was no remiſſion, and
mans future obedience was but his duty: Wherefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2.
<hi>When he comes into the World he ſaith, burnt Offerings and Sacrifices for
ſin which are offered by the Law thou haſt no pleaſure in, but a body thou
haſt prepared me, lo I come to do thy will O God, by which will we are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
through the offering of the body of Jeſus once for all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 13. page thou writes theſe words,—<hi>But that I may make it
appear that thou denyes the true Chriſt, I ſhall bring thy own words, expreſly
denying that this light which enlightens every man that comes into the world
is Chriſt;</hi> and in the 17. page thou adds, <hi>So John Preached him, and
ſo did others:</hi>—I
anſwer, thou ſhould rather have added, ſo <hi>G. F.</hi>
Preached him, and ſo have others among us called Quakers; and this
had been truly ſaid, as may be read in that Book already mentioned,
publiſhed by <hi>G. F.</hi> p. 16, 19, 20, 22, 45, 47, 94, 102, 279. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little Book publiſhed by <hi>G. F.</hi> Intituled <hi>A Catechiſm for Children,</hi>
throughout that Book: But how dares thou write ſo of this holy
man <hi>John,</hi> or of any of the Penmen of the holy Scriptures, who never
ſo wrote of Chriſt, neither canſt thou ſhow me one place of Scripture
wherein it is aſſerted of Chriſt, that the light enlightning every man
that comes into the World, as it is in every man as he is born of a
Woman, is he the true Chriſt; and this thou muſt prove, or thou
proves nothing, but aſſerts thy own and other mens vain aery notions.
It is true, the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I am the light of the
World;</hi> but this proves not thy notion, the light in every man as he
comes into the World is he, the true Chriſt. Conſider the words of
<hi>Eſayas 9. 2. The people that walk in darkneſs have ſeen great light, they
that dwell in the Land of the ſhadow of death, upon them hath the Light
ſhined:</hi> Compare this with <hi>Math. 4. 14, 15. And Jeſus departed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Galilee, and dwelt in Capernaum, that it might be fulfilled which was
ſpoken by Eſayas, ſaying, the people which ſate in darkneſs ſaw great light.</hi>
Thus the man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in his Perſon, by his Doctrine and Miracles,
where he came and abode, was a light to them that ſate in darkneſs;
and hence he ſaid of himſelf, <hi>While you have the light believe in the light,
yet a little while is the light with you;</hi> I <hi>the Son of Man</hi> (who as long as
I am in the World, am the light of the World) <hi>muſt be lifted up, and be
glorified with my Father, for I go to my Father; but I will not leave you
comfortleſs; I will ſend the Comforter unto you, who ſhall receive of mine
and ſhew it unto you; he ſhall glorifie me:</hi> Hence the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43551:17"/>
being aſcended and bodily glorified, by the miniſtration of his Spirit,
in the children of Faith, cauſeth the light of his glorious Goſpel to ſhine
in their hearts: And further though it be said, <hi>Chriſt is our life, in
God we live and move and have our being, and Chriſt is all in all and
through all,</hi> wilt thou therefore aſſert that our life is Chriſt? that the life in all is God? that all in us is God? This agreeth indeed with
that Doctrine publiſhed by <hi>G. F.</hi> in his Book already mentioned,
Page 91, 229.—<hi>The ſoul is a part of God, of his being, divine, infinite in
it ſelf, without beginning, that God doth not change, nor the Soul; and
every one turned to the Light, they ſhall ſee Chriſt, who brings the Soul up
to God, whereby they come to be one Soul:</hi> And this is the very root of
<hi>Rantiſme,</hi> hence concluding, <hi>the life in man and beaſt, yea in every thing
to be God: and all to be one God at laſt, denying the real individual exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtences
of Angels, Saints, Devils, or wicked men in eternity:</hi> and what
theſe notions terminate in, is ſufficiently known: <hi>Let us eat and drink
for to morrow we ſhall dye, the earthly bodies periſh, and the Spirit, Soul
or Life of every thing comes to be all one Soul in God, and ſo God is all in
all:</hi> And although it hath been ſaid by ſome among you, that theſe
termes, Chriſt is the Light, and the Light in every man is Chriſt, are
convertible termes, yet that is apparently fals, and deceitful <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie;</hi>
for if ſo, then what might be truly and properly ſpoken of the one,
might be alſo <hi>ſo</hi> ſpoken of the other; for ſo it is with all propoſitions
convertible; And hence as it was truly, and properly ſpoken of the
man Chriſt, our onely Saviour, and the true Chriſt, who is the Light
of the world, that he was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that he was hanged on a
Tree, and gave up the Ghoſt, might alſo be truly and properly ſpoken,
of the Light in every man that comes into the world, as it is in every
man, which is moſt abſurd: I alſo acknowledg that it is ſaid 1 <hi>John</hi> 1
9. of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>That was the true Light which</hi>

it is in the Greek; in the preſent time enlighteth every man coming

verſes, <hi>there was a man ſent from</hi> God <hi>whoſe name was John, he was not
that Light, but was ſent to bear witneſs of that Light;</hi> thus teſtifying,
not onely of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> as Lighted by <hi>him,</hi> whom he was ſent
to point out; but that every man coming into the world to bear witneſs
unto <hi>him,</hi> Is alſo Lighted by <hi>him, Chriſt Jeſus who is the true Light:</hi> &amp;
although <hi>it</hi> be true, that every man that cometh into the world, as he
is a man, born of the ſeed of man, through natural generation, is enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43551:18"/>
by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as he <hi>is the Word</hi> that made the World, yet the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath not aſſerted it in this place of Scripture, neither doth he
here ſay, that there is a Light in every man, or that the enlighting
in every man as he cometh into the World, as he is a man, is He,
the true Chriſt; and it is a moſt miſerable wreſting this Place of
Scripture, to force it to ſpeak thus, that there is a Light in every
man as he comes into the world, by natural generation, as an elect
ſeed in him, which is the true Chriſt, and mans onely Saviour: and
thou haſt belyed this Holy man; in ſaying of him, that he ſo preached,
to wit; the Light, or enlighting in every man as he comes into the
world, is <hi>He, the true Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the 14 Pag thou mentions theſe words;—<hi>But that Law
and nature, by which the Gentiles did the things contained in the Law, thou
wilt not have it to be the Law and Nature of Chriſt, but ſome other thing,
but what thou tels not.</hi>—I anſwer, I ſaid in the words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
2. <hi>Rom. that it is the work of the Law written in their hearts</hi> (and
in every man as he cometh into the world) <hi>whereby they which had
not the Law</hi> (to wit in Tables of Stone) <hi>did by nature the things contained
in the Law, theſe not having the Law, were a Law unto themſelves:</hi>
It is a Law or enlightning planted in Mans nature by that word
which created him a Man, and without whch he differeth not from a
beaſt; hence it is not improperly called by ſome that <hi>univerſal
reaſon</hi> that is in every man as he is a man, which alſo <hi>G. W.</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi>
6. ſeems to ſay of it; And though man through his diſobedience
wholly loſt fellowſhip and communion with God, and hope of eternal
life, with a poſſibility under that Covenant of works, through his
future obedience, of ever being reſtored, yet he continued a man ſtill,
even under all this loſs, and alſo enlightned by this Law, though
more darkly, whereby he knew he had diſobeyed his Maker, and
therefore was aſhamed and hid himſelf; and of which, had he been
utterly deprived, he had ceaſed from being a man; and ſo from
being capable of condemnation, or of receiving the promiſe of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
of which he knew nothing by this enlightning remaining
in him, untill God publiſhed it to him, by promiſing him the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſias,</hi>
the Womans feed to break the Serpents head; for that Law
(as thou acknowledges, <hi>pag,</hi> 10. in theſe words)—<hi>only condemns him;
and gives him the knowledge of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This Law or enlightning thus plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in mans nature by creation, is by generation conveyed into
every man as the comes into the world, and is hence called by
<hi>Solomon,</hi> 20. Chap. <hi>Proverbs.</hi> 27. verſe <hi>The Spirit of man which is the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43551:18"/>
Candle of the Lord, ſearching the inward parts of his belly;</hi> and of the
ſpirit of man the <hi>Prophet 12. Zach.</hi> 1. writeth thus, <hi>Thus ſaith the
Lord which ſtretcheth forth the Heavens, and layeth the foundation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and formeth the ſpirit of man within him;</hi> hence this Law in every man
as it is in every man, is that which God hath formed, &amp; therefore
of it the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> truly and properly hath ſpoken, <hi>they do by nature the
things contained in the Law;</hi> as being born of the ſeed and after the
kind of man, they are naturally or by nature men, ſo being born of the
ſeed of man they do naturally or by nature the things contained in the
Law, the work of the Law being written in their hearts as they are
men: hence this Law or enlightning in every man as he comes into
the world, being the formed ſpirit of man enlightned by him that
made it, Is not God that formed it, the word by which the world was
made, as <hi>G. F.</hi> in that Book above mentioned <hi>pag.</hi> 185. aſſerts; neither
is it the word manifeſt in fleſh, as <hi>G. W.</hi> aſſerts, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. So what <hi>pag.</hi>
6. he would have to be <hi>right reaſon,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 3. with him is, <hi>God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
in fleſh:</hi> Neither is it the end of the Law, the Saviour, the
Mediator, the Righteouſneſs of God, the foundation of God, as
<hi>G. F.</hi> in that Book already named, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. 57. 102. 168. and 277.
aſſerts; for by theſe aſſertions, the creature is, and is worſhipped inſtead
of him, the creator, who is God bleſſed for ever: wherefore (if it be not
too late) I would have theſe men conſider the words of the Lord ſpoken
by <hi>Eſayas 50. 11. Behold all ye that kindle a fire, that compaſs about your
ſelves with ſparks, walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks that ye
have kindled, this ſhall ye have of my hand, ye ſhall lie down in Sorrow:</hi>
And although by this Law or enlighting in every man, he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to receive the glad tydings of the Goſpel when preached to him,
through the promiſed ſeed of the Woman, yet it is not <hi>he,</hi> the promiſed
ſeed, neither is it the light of the Goſpel ſhining in our hearts by faith,
as <hi>G. W.</hi> would have it to be <hi>pag.</hi> 6. Neither is it Chriſt within the
hope of glory, nor the word of faith, nor the ingrafted word within
that is able to ſave the Soul (though it be that which receives it, and
where it abides when received) though thou ſeems ſo to aſſert in
thy Book: Yet neither thou, nor any of you have proved or can prove
what you have ſo aſſerted by the Scriptures of truth: And although
by this Law in every mans nature, the eternal power and God-head
may be known by the things that are made, and equity and ſobriety
among men may be obſerved, yet the glorious Goſpel ſhining in our
hearts by faith, is not thereby diſcerned, although <hi>G. W. pag.</hi> 6. ſo
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43551:19"/>
affirmeth of it, aſſerting as much as if, right reaſon in every man as
becomes into the World by natural generation, diſcerneth the light
of the glorious Goſpel; which if ſo, why is the word of faith preached?
how comes faith by hearing? and indeed to what end was the
Comforter, the ſpirit of truth promiſed, and ſent to reveal this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery?
and how is it fooliſhneſs to the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of <hi>the Greeks?</hi>
But I find it not ſo aſſerted in the Scriptures of truth of this Law in
every man as he comes into the World, that it diſcerneth or diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
to man the purpoſe of grace that was in God before the
world began; preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> foretold by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> typified
<hi>under the Law,</hi> pointed out by <hi>John the fore-runner,</hi> whom laſt of all
his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preached, as do all his Miniſters in all Ages, proclaiming
this meſſage of Gods love to the world, <hi>not that we loved God, but that
he loved us, and ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our ſins, that whoſoever
believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life;</hi> all in one
joynt voice pointing to this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> this <hi>Son of man,</hi>
with an <hi>Hoſanna to this Son of David,</hi> and to none before him, or
to any ever ſince, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of
the world;</hi> a voice not heard among you of the Man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the
Son of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> as now exiſting outwardly bodily, without us,
but applyed by ſome among you to meekneſs, humility, and
the like within you: Therefore not the Law in every man as he
comes into the world; but the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
ſhining in the hearts of Believers manifeſts to them <hi>the Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
and Salvation through faith in <hi>him;</hi> That being graven in the
heart of a man, as he is a man, this being revealed only by that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which the world never ſaw, nor can receive; as the Apoſtle plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſerts 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 14. And hence theſe Laws are not therefore
one and the ſame, becauſe both of them are written in the heart, the
one being within man, as he is a man, the other as he is a believer:
And as theſe Laws are different ſo the teachings of them differ; hence
the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>doth not even nature it ſelf teach,</hi> as being far below the
teachings of the new Covenant; the teachings of this Law in every man,
either as in every man, or as outwardly adminiſtred, leading no farther
then, as it was ſaid of old, <hi>eye for eye, tooth for tooth, what you would not men
ſhould do unto you, that do ye not unto them;</hi> But when he came who
brought in a better Covenant, a more glorious Law, even that of the
Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>he</hi> preached a higher Doctrine, <hi>But I ſay
unto you love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43551:19"/>
you;</hi> a Doctrine firſt preached by the <hi>Prince of peace</hi> himſelf, which
the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> were ignorant of, &amp; the practice whereof theſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
among you of this Law in every man to be Chriſt, are yet to learn.</p>
            <p>Now according to what I have thus in plainneſs aſſerted according
to the Scriptures, thy Queries in the 15. <hi>pag.</hi> are thus anſwered.
—1. <hi>How could they do the things of the Law but by the divine nature of
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f Chriſt?</hi>—The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> anſwers thee, <hi>they did the things of the Law
by nature, the work of the Law being written in their hearts.</hi>—2. <hi>How
could they be excuſed but by Chriſt?</hi>—The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> anſwers thee, <hi>by
doing by nature the things contained in the Law, their conſcience bearing
witneſs, or their thoughts accuſing or excuſing one another.</hi>—3. <hi>How
could they be without excuſe who diſobeyed, if they had not a ſufficient
principle given to perform their obedience, which is Chriſt only?</hi>—I
anſwer, Conſider ſome of thy dark confuſed Doctrine; in the 9.
<hi>pag.</hi> thou aſſerts,—<hi>that the Law or firſt covenant putteth man upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without giving grace which is ſufficient to make his works acceptable to
God, and ſo man can give no perfect obedience to this Law;</hi>—In this queſtion
thou affirms the Law by which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did by nature the
thngs contained in the Law to be a ſufficient Principle,
given to perform obedience, becauſe <hi>an inſufficient principle had been
a ſufficient excuſe:</hi> But to thy queſtion I ſay, the work of the
Law written in their hearts was a ſufficient principle to have ſhewed
them the things contained in the Law; thus, <hi>that which may be known
of God being manifeſt in them,</hi> God having thus ſhewed it to them,
they are left without excuſe; And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>that principle
is only Chriſt,</hi> that I deny, neither canſt thou prove it by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but it is the work of the Law written in their hearts.—4. <hi>How
did ſome of them perfect the Law and were Jews inwardly, if not by Chriſt?</hi>
I anſwer, it is more then the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> affirms, that any of theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi>
did perfect the Law; only, 2 <hi>Rom.</hi> 26. he ſaith, <hi>if the circumciſion
keep the righteouſneſs of the Law:</hi> But however the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> anſwers
thy queſtion, <hi>if the circumciſion which is by nature fulfil the Law, it is
by doing by nature thoſe things contained in the Law, the work of the Law
being written in their hearts.</hi>—5. <hi>How could they clearly ſee the inviſible
things of God, but by Chriſt the Son, ſeeing it is ſaid, none knows the
Father, but the Son and he to whom the Son reveals him?</hi>—The
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> anſwers thee, <hi>the inviſible things of God are clearly ſeen by the
things that he hath made;</hi> that of God which is manifeſt in them,
even the work of the Law written in their hearts, gave them an eye
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43551:20"/>
to ſee his inviſible power and God-head, to know God, and glorifie
him as God.</p>
            <p>In the 16. Page, thou ſayſt,—<hi>Is there not a Divine elect Seed in the
Saints by which he is formed in them?</hi>—But becauſe here, and in other
places thou ſpeaks of a ſeed, Chriſt within, that ſuffers under ſin, and
is to be raiſed, of a juſtification and righteouſneſs in the elect Seed, and
that the firſt Covenant and Law comes before the ſeed be raiſed; All
which as new imagined notions, whereof (as thou expreſſeth them)
there is no mention made in the Scriptures of truth, I return back to
thy ſelf, and ſhall therefore plainly aſſert, what I find in this matter,
in the holy Scriptures: Hence know that I do own, that there is an
ingraffted word in the hearts of ſuch, to whom the meſſage of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
with God, through the promiſed ſeed, being ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according to the good pleaſure of God conveyed, have not put
this Word of God ſpoken to them, far from them, but have received
it in an honeſt and good heart, keep it, and bring forth fruit with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
living and dying in the faith and hope of the reſurrection of
the dead unto everlaſting life, through the Man Chriſt Jeſus, whom
God alſo raiſed from the dead, the firſt that ſhould riſe; as a living
demonſtration, to all Beleevers in all generations, that he who was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to raiſe the Man Chriſt Jeſus from the dead, is alſo after their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead, able to raiſe their mortal bodies, and faſhion them like to his
glorious body; And that this word ſpoken to them, and received
and planted in the hearts of Beleevers, is the ingrafted word able to
ſave the Soul, and that it is, and is alſo called <hi>the Seed</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
ſown by <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> which in the children of Faith, takes
deep root downwards, and brings forth fruit upward in their lives
and converſations, I acknowledge: But that the Law or enlightning
in every man as he comes into the world, is this ingrafted word; or
that this ingrafted word is in every man, as he by natural genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
comes into the world, as a ſeed within him, that hath received
Redemption for him, I do deny as not according to the Scriptures:
As for thoſe words, <hi>Amos 2. 13. Behold I am preſſed under you as a cart
is preſſed;</hi> It is ſuch words as is ſpoken of God, <hi>Gen. 6. 6. It repented
the Lord that he made Man on the Earth, and it grieved him at the heart:</hi>
as God is in himſelf unchangeably the ſame, ſo this cannot be properly
ſpoken of him; neither is it thus to be underſtood, that God in thoſe
wicked men repented or was preſſed down; neither is it ſo expreſſed
in Scripture; But God is ſaid to be grieved for and preſſed down
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43551:20"/>
under the abominations of the wicked, becauſe when through his
Prophets and Miniſters he witneſſeth againſt, and proclaims judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
becauſe of, their abominations, the word of the Lord through
them being rejected, in them ſo ſent forth by him, he is ſaid to be
grieved for and preſſed down under their wickedneſs; And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with the teſtimony of <hi>Stephen 5. Acts</hi> 51. 52. where their
perſecuting the Prophets, their betraying and murthering the juſt
one, and rejecting the teſtimony of his choſen witneſſes, is called
<hi>a reſiſting of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and for thoſe expreſſions 6. <hi>Heb. 6 of
ſome crucifying to themſelves the Son of God afreſh;</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith
not, they that crucifie <hi>him in himſelf,</hi> but <hi>to themſelves;</hi> they who have
been enlightned by the Holy Ghoſt, if ſuch fall away, they crucifie the
efficacy of his death to themſelves, it is impoſſible to renew them again
unto Repentance, becauſe rejecting <hi>him</hi> as the only propitiatory
Sacrifice for remiſſion of ſins, there remaines to them no more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for ſin, and ſo no remiſſion; O Conſider this and fear, before it
be too late. And concerning that word of faith in the heart, 10. <hi>Rom
the Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>it is the word of faith which we preach</hi> and what it is
he tells in the 9. ver. <hi>if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus
and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead,
thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> But that this Law in every man as he comes into the
world, is this word of faith, that I deny, and thou haſt not proved it:
for <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> not by natural generation.</p>
            <p>And further concerning the ſeed which is Chriſt, the <hi>Apoſtle 3 Gal.</hi>
16. ſaith, <hi>To Abraham and to his ſeed were the promiſes made; he
ſaith not to ſeeds as to many, but as of one, and to thy ſeed which is Chriſt;</hi>
thus <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he is the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is the one ſeed to whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſe
belongs; what the promiſ was we have it in the 8. <hi>ver. in thee ſhall
all the nations be bleſſed;</hi> &amp; in the 3. <hi>Acts 25. Peter mentions this promiſe as</hi>
ſpoken of <hi>that Jeſus whom the Jews delivered up in the preſence of Pilate,</hi> &amp;
not otherwiſe do I find in Scripture, Jeſus Chriſt called the ſeed to
whom the promiſe belongs: And this unſcriptural Doctrine, the Light
in every man as he comes into world to be Chriſt, a ſeed within, hath
hatched among us of late theſe and ſuch aſſertions from among you,
<hi>the light the ſeed within is Chriſt, then I am he that ſpeaketh, Then Hoſanna:
The Son is equal with the Father, I witneſs the Son in me, ſo I witneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
with the Father: the light in me is Chriſt, Chriſt is the word by
which the world was made, then, it was ſaid of Chriſt, that he was in the
world, and the world was made by him, &amp; the world knew him not, ſo it may
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43551:21"/>
be ſaid of this Prophet</hi> G. F. as is ſaid by S. E. in his Paper intituled, the
Quakers challenge, <hi>pag. 6. Chriſt is the way, the truth, and the life,
Chriſt is in me, and muſt he not ſay where he is, I am the way, the truth,
and the life: he that hath the ſame ſpirit that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead
is equal with God: Jeſus Chriſt the Myſtery paſſed before, the ſame ſpirit
takes upon it the ſame ſeed where it is manifeſted:</hi> as is mentioned in the
Book intituled <hi>Sauls</hi> errand to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> pag. 7. 8. which of all the
Saints of old ever ſo ſpoke or wrote: But herein among you are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the words of our Lord; ſaying, <hi>fals Chriſts ſhall ariſe, and many
ſhall ſay, I am Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, I do alſo acknowledge, that Men and Women who are of
the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are called, and are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi>
And thus they are the brethren and Siſters of our Lord,
who that he might be their Elder brother, <hi>a real man,</hi> took part of
fleſh and bloud, by being <hi>the one ſeed of Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> according
to the fleſh: And this agreeth with the whole tendency of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<hi>viz.</hi> that man, (not only ſomething in man) fell from God through
diſobedience; that men thus dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in ſin, needed Redemption, not ſomething in men that never
conſented to ſin; that the redeemer of Man, was and alſo is a real
man, not only ſomething in man.</p>
            <p>Thus having anſwered thy chief Objections againſt <hi>my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
and by aſſerting the plain' truth according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,

thou mayeſt ſeem to go off with ſome credit, telling me—<hi>that I made
a man of ſtraw and then knocks him down, that my Book is almoſt wholly
ſpent in proving that which none of you deny, to wit, that Chriſt is come

that thou mayeſt be ſeen through it by the weakeſt diſcerning, as not

my private Letter (written to thee as my Friend) without my

            <p>In thy Letter thou writes theſe words,—<hi>I find thy mind in this

whom, and what he did for Man-kind, thou ſayeſt (it

            <p>Another exception of thine was, in theſe words—<hi>ſo it is contrary

My anſwer was, ſurely either paſſion hath blinded thee, or a cloud of

            <p>Another charge was, That I write of the child born according to
the fleſh (to wit, of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary</hi>)—<hi>There ſhould be
no end of his Government; contrary to the Scripture that ſaith, he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
death and continued not many years upon earth:</hi>—My anſwer was,
I aſſert according to the Scriptures, that the Son that was conceived
in the womb of, &amp; broughtforth by <hi>Mary, he ſhall Reign over the Houſe
of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end;</hi> and doth it in
thy underſtanding make void his Government, becauſe he ſuffered
death? tell plainly, did the Grave hold him? did his fleſh ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?
did he not riſe from the dead? and if ſo, art thou not in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with thoſe who gave money to the Souldiers to hire them to ſay,
<hi>that his Diſciples came by night and ſtole him away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another charge was—<hi>That I aſſert out of the natural ſeed of</hi> David
<hi>is the Saviour, which is blaſphemy, contray to the Scriptures, which ſay
he was without beginning and end of dayes,</hi> and who <hi>could tell his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43551:22"/>
which it ſeems thou ſeeks to count.</hi> My anſwer was, that <hi>out of
the man</hi> Davids <hi>ſeed God hath according to his promiſe raiſed unto.</hi> Iſrael
<hi>a Saviour Jeſus;</hi> and is this blaſphemy with thee? then ſurely the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> were blaſphemers: And if I did count his Generation, ſo did
<hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in anſwer to that part of my Letter publiſhed by thee, I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert
again that in thoſe Scriptures mentioned by thee, it is not ſaid who
the true Chriſt was or is, but what and how he is in Believers; as
thus, <hi>if Chriſt be in you, he that hath the Son hath life, greater is he that
is in you,</hi> &amp;c. The queſtion ſtill remains, who is he that is thus in us,
and how is he in us?</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt—<hi>It is thy miſtake to ſay that Chriſt in believers is but
the operation of his ſpirit in us, not he the operator,</hi>—I anſwer, tell
plainly, is the anointing in us as in us, <hi>he</hi> the anointed one? are the
motions of his Spirit as in us, <hi>he</hi> the mover? are the gifts and graces
of the Spirit in us, <hi>he</hi> the giver of them? I own that the <hi>man Chriſt
Jeſns of Nazareth</hi> is the Operator and Author of Faith in us, but are
faith, hope, meekneſs, &amp;c. as they are in us, <hi>he</hi> the Son of man, the
Author of them? how darkly doſt thou write of theſe things? not
according to the Holy Scriptures, though agreeing with the Doctrine
of <hi>W. B.</hi> a Teacher among yon, in his Book intituled, <hi>from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truth to all perſecuting enemies,</hi> 39. pag. ſaying—<hi>humility meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the heart of Gods child is a Mediatour to aſſwage and ſtop the wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
anger which lieth in the enmity-ſeed, and it is the Lamb of God in whom
he is well-pleaſed, that takes away the ſin, to whom the Soul is to hearken,
as a true Prophet, guide, and Saviour:</hi> And this is like the Doctrine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
by G. F. in his Book already mentioned, <hi>p.</hi> 257. in theſe words;
—<hi>That which humbles people which brings down ſin, is the humility
which bears the ſin and iniquity, which is Chriſt:</hi>—Is there in the
whole Scriptures any mention made of ſuch Doctrine? nay verily, it is
quite another, and indeed a plain denying of the Teſtimony of the
<hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> joyntly teſtifying to the <hi>man Jeſus of Nazareth, as
the only Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the world, who his own
ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree;</hi> and there is not another
man, name or thing ever in Scripture, called the Lamb of God which
takes away ſin, but <hi>he,</hi> the man Chriſt: the very mentioning theſe
things, is enough to refute them among ſuch, with whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have any credit. I wiſh for thy own ſake thou hadſt not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43551:23"/>

            <p>THou art the laſt Man I meet with of this Company, who have
joyned your ſelves together againſt <hi>my Teſtimony:</hi> And thy
part in this matter is that of a <hi>clamorous Woman,</hi> having only brought
forth a <hi>meer Libel</hi> ſtuffed with a parcel of <hi>ſcurrilous expreſſions,</hi> which
I paſs by as not fit to be repeated among ſober perſons; however it
ſufficiently manifeſts whoſe Off-ſpring thou art, and whence thy
work is.</p>
            <p>But to give <hi>the Reader</hi> ſome account of thy Spirit by thy work, let
this be conſidered: I find thee very forward in faſhioning my words at
thy pleaſure, to make them appear contradictions, which are really
no further ſo, then as ſnch as thy ſelf might reckon the Scriptures of
truth to be: But conſider thy own words in a Book Printed 1669,
intituled, <hi>Chriſt aſcended above the Clouds,</hi> in the Preface (being an
anſwer to one <hi>J. N.</hi>)—<hi>The main ſubject of this</hi> J. N. <hi>in his Book is
to prove the light in every man not to be Chriſt; which he ſhould not need
to have done until it had been ſo affirmed by us; for though we do affirm a
ſpiritual divine light of God and his Son to be in every man, yet it is not
our principle to ſay Chriſt is in every man, or that every man hath the Son:</hi>
Now read over thy words, <hi>p.</hi> 16. of thy part ſpeaking Thus of me—
<hi>let the impartial Reader judge of</hi> R. G. <hi>his confuſion and ignorance, not
owning the light that lightens every man to be Chriſt; or the Son of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scriptures;</hi> O strange! be aſhamed; was it never affirmed
before the year 1669, by any of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> among the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
That the light in every man is Chriſt, That Chriſt is in every man: if
this man honeſtly intends what he hath aſſerted, without any mental
reſervation, wherewith at his pleaſure to twiſt his words, meaning
another thing then plainly he expreſſeth, Then ſurely, I ſuppoſe
there may be ſo much honeſty in G. F. to rebuke him openly, and
bring him to a publick Confeſſion before him; thereby at leaſt to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43551:23"/>
vindicate his own Book already mentioned Printed 1659; wherein
it is often affirmed by him, that the light in every man is Chriſt, and
wherein he pleads, That Chriſt is in every Man: See <hi>pag.</hi> 9. 10, 19,
20. and many other places through that great Book: Now which of
theſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſpeaking ſo contrary to one another, ſhall the people
called <hi>Quakers</hi> (who depend upon ſuch Teachers) believe? verily
it is high time for ſuch among them, who have known any thing of
the Teachings of the Spirit of Jeſus to ceaſe from theſe men, and to
deliver themſelves from being thus impoſed upon; however theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions
of <hi>G. W.</hi> compared together ſufficiently manifeſts <hi>his ſelf-contradictions,</hi>
to ſuch as are not willing to be deluded by him; For
if the Quakers will believe <hi>G. W.</hi> it is not their principle in the year
1669, to ſay, Chriſt is in every man; but if they will believe <hi>G.
F.</hi> it was their principle 10. years before; And if they will believe the
ſame <hi>G. W.</hi> in the year 1670, then they muſt condemn <hi>R. G.</hi> as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-chriſtian
and ignorant, becauſe denying the light in every man
to be Chriſt, or Chriſt to be in every man.</p>
            <p>Next let it be further conſidered (to manifeſt thy Spirit by thy
work,) that in my <hi>Teſtimony</hi> I metioned two Goſpel-Miſteries decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of in the Scriptures, both joyntly concurring as neceſſary to us,
yet in their order; and that it was the work of the enemy in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
to divide them, and ſet them as oppoſites each to other,
thence to render them as contradictory; Now this is really the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of thy work, quarrelling and fighting againſt the works
wrought for us by the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> in his Crucified body, as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
and contradictory to the works he worketh in us by his
Spirit: hence what Spirit drives thee is plainly manifeſt.</p>
            <p>But let it be conſidered what it is I have aſſerted, againſt which
thou ſo much clamours; I have teſtified in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> expreſs words
that <hi>the man Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth, even that ſame Jeſus whom the
Jews Crucified, him God hath raiſed from the dead, and he is both Lord
and Chriſt:</hi> If this be ſo, why art thou angry? if it be falſe, tell us
plainly: Thy quarrel againſt what I have aſſerted is manifeſt, firſt in
the 13. <hi>pag.</hi> in theſe words—<hi>for whom doth</hi> R. G. <hi>reckon, hath this
God-man, as he calls him, or God in Chriſt in Vnion, wrought and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
and purchaſed all,</hi> &amp;c.—An expreſſion fitter at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
then at <hi>London;</hi> however hence it is manifeſt that with thee, <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt of Nazareth is God-man as</hi> R. G. <hi>calls him; not as</hi> G. W. <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems
him:</hi> But thou art reproved by our Lord who ſaid of himſelf,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43551:24"/>
who was but one Perſon, theſe (may be contradictions to thee, if thou
durſt ſay ſo) ſeeming contrary expreſſions, and yet in both he ſpoke
the very truth, <hi>I and the Father am one, yet the Father is greater then I:</hi>
thus plainly he is both <hi>God and man, in one undivided perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next turn to the 16. <hi>pag.</hi> where repeating ſome of my words by
which I proved the <hi>true Chriſt</hi> to have been and ſtill to be <hi>a man, not
the word only, but the word made fleſh, Jeſus Chriſt the Son of</hi> Mary;
To this thou anſwers in theſe words—<hi>Note his errour in denying the
light to be Chriſt, and ſo oppoſing Chriſts Divinity;</hi>—Mark thy words,
If becauſe of my aſſerting the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have been and to be a
man, even then when I alſo aſſerted his being God, be with thee an
oppoſing of Chriſts Divinity, as thou ſayeſt it is, <hi>then with thee the
true Chriſt was not, is not a man:</hi> Wherein thou art led by the Spirit
and wiſdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who eſteemed the Preaching of Remidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſins, and the Reſurrection of the dead through the <hi>man Chriſt
Jeſus</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> Crucified, as fooliſhneſs: But art reproved
by our Lord himſelf, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 30. teſtifying thus of himſelf, <hi>And
they ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in the Clouds of heaven with power
and great glory:</hi> and art contrary to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who teſtified of <hi>the
true Chriſt</hi> both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even after his being aſcended
and glorified, that he was and is a <hi>man;</hi> as is mentioned in ſeveral
places of the <hi>Acts;</hi> adding 10. <hi>Acts 43. that to him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
witneſs, that through his name whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again turn to the 7. p. where thou expreſſeſt thy ſelf in theſe
words,—<hi>Nor was the Son of God and his light to be under ſuch a
limitation either as to time or place</hi> (to wit, in the Womb of the <hi>Virgin
Mary) as a finite creature; for his out-goings were of old from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>—Mark
thy words, if that <hi>holything conceived of the Holy Ghoſt,
and born of Mary,</hi> is not, was not therefore <hi>the Son of God whoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings
were from everlaſting,</hi> becauſe (as thou words it) he was under
a limitation as to time and place in the Womb of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi>
then plainly with thee the <hi>man Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth,</hi> who was
that Son of the <hi>Virgin Mary, was not, is not the Son of God:</hi> whereby
(as in ſo many words) thou haſt given the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> the lye,
<hi>Luke</hi> 26. 35, who being ſent of God to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> ſaid, <hi>that holy
thing that ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God:</hi> thus thou
art in union with theſe <hi>Jews</hi> of old, who reckoned him but <hi>a meer man,
the Carpenters Son, John 10. 33. for a good work we ſtone thee not, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43551:24"/>
for blaſphemy, and becauſe that being a man</hi> [Mark thy own very
Spirit] <hi>thou makeſt thyſelf God;</hi> therefore I do reprove thee in thoſe
very words our Lord reproved theſe unbelievers of old. 36. <hi>ver. Say ye
of him whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the world, thou
blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next let thy cavils and exceptions againſt the works wrought for
us by the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> be a little examined. In the 1. p. thou
argues thus, <hi>how is ſin finiſhed without man, while no good is wrought
within him? Seeing Chriſt works all things in us by his Spirit, how is
all things finiſhed without them, before any good wrought in them?</hi>—I
anſwer, all things relating to the one propitiatory Sacrifice of the
body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> once offered for the ſins of the whole World, as an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
of his own bloud to be received and believed in for Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſins as the ground of our hope of the Reſurrection of the
dead unto life eternal, are finiſhed: All things relating to our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that attonement, and making that bleſſed work, ſo already fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by him without us for us, effectual within us, are wrought and
to be wrought not at once, but by degrees, by the workings of his
Spirit within us, untill mortality be ſwallowed up of life.</p>
            <p>By what I have already written in anſwer to <hi>G. K.</hi> I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
vindicated theſe truths teſtified unto by me, from the cavils
of this man, according to the Scriptures; who either ignorantly or
wilfully jumbles theſe things confuſedly together, not dividing the
word of truth aright; And hence it is that he reckons it erroneous
in me, and a contradicting, oppoſing and invalidating the inward
operations of the Spirit of God within (which is falſly charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me) To aſſert of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> that
<hi>he finiſhed tranſgreſſion, made an end of ſin, brought in everlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
fulfilled the Law, aboliſhed condemnation, Curſs and death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
ſin in the fleſh, took part of our fleſh, and in it deſtroyed death, and
him that had the power of death, aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, ſo making
peace, that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Croſs;</hi>
And all this for <hi>ſinners, ungodly, unjuſt, enemies, even while enemies,</hi>
ſo no good wrought in them by any light or ſpirit whatſoever, ſo
as to have purchaſed or perfected that bleſſed work: all which and
much more being the expreſs <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
concerning him and the work effected by him for ſinners thou
<hi>G. W.</hi> art juſtly reproved by them, as having manifeſted thy ſelf a
plain denier of them; and thy work is ſeen in the light of Chriſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43551:25"/>
Jeſus, and by it, the Spirit that leads thee; ſo that theſe Scripture
words thou ſteals out of the writings of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cannot cover
thee from being diſcerned, while thou doſt not plainly and honeſtly
mention, what is intended by them; writing (as thy manner is in
thy works) darkly and confuſedly, thereby the more eaſily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:
And this is ſo plain in all this thy work, that to mention
it in every place, would prove tedious: I would therefore only have
<hi>the Reader</hi> conſider thy words in the 12. p. thus—<hi>God ſent his Son to
ſave man from ſin and death, whoſe ſufferings, ſacrifice, mediation, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
and offices (with the bleſſed effects thereof within) we own and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
according to the Scriptures of truth as inwardly revealed:</hi>—I own
and acknowledge that the bleſſed effects of Chriſts ſufferings
Sacrifice and Offices are to be witneſſed within, as inwardly
revealed: But how confuſedly doſt thou write? If what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
revealed within us, be the effects of the death, ſufferings, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
mediation, interceſſion and offices of the Son of God, then
there is a cauſe of thoſe effects, as previous and antecedent to them,
to wit, his ſufferings and ſacrifice, which is therefore neceſſarily fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
perfected and accompliſhed by him for us, without us, in his
Crucified body, before the effects thereof could be witneſſed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in us: And this is that which I plead for, and thou haſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
as do alſo thy partners; ſpeaking other whiles of an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a ſacrifice, a Mediation to be done by Chriſt within us for us;
and at another time ſpeaking of the bleſſed effects of them to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
within; and therefore only mentioning theſe words of the
<hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to catch ſimple Souls thereby, among a people
where the Scriptures have had, and have ſome credit; while you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſpeak another Doctrine then that teſtified unto by thoſe Holy
Men of old, by theſe and ſuch expreſſions, But were you to Preach
among a people to whom the report of the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the
Son of God, his Sufferings and Sacrifice is not conveyed, would it
be accounted neceſſary by you to Preach Remiſſion and forgiveneſs of
ſins through <hi>that man,</hi> and that one Sacrifice of his Crucified body;
and the hope of the Reſurrection from the dead unto eternal life
through faith in that man, even the ſame Jeſus whom the <hi>Jews</hi> Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and whom God raiſed from the dead, and that he is both <hi>Lord
and Chrſt,</hi> and that there is no other Saviour, and no other Salvation,
but through faith in that <hi>man,</hi> and no other ground of hope or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of ever being ſaved, but through that ſacrifice already offered
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43551:25"/>
up, and that perfect obedience by <hi>him</hi> already performed to the will
of the Father? What you would Preach to ſuch is manifeſt by your
Doctrine, and by ſuch like words from among you, <hi>that you would
Preach to the Indians, nothing but what they knew already:</hi> However, to
<hi>him</hi> the man Chriſt Jeſus the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> teſtified, as Saviour, and
through <hi>him</hi> they preached Remiſſion of ſins, and the Reſurrection
of the dead, To the <hi>unbelieving Greeks,</hi> with whom the Teſtimony of
<hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> had no credit; and ſo they Preached to
them what they knew not before, ſtrange (Gods ſay) they, <hi>one Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
that was dead, whom they preached to be alive,</hi> and Remiſſion of ſins
&amp; the Reſurrection of the dead through faith in him; <hi>May we know</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>what this new Doctrine thou preacheſt is?</hi> In the 18. pag. thou
expreſſeſt thy ſelf thus,—<hi>This man thinks that he is gotten beyond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in his Paradoxes; every rational man may ſee his darkneſs herein,
to conclude, the believer in warfare, and imperfections in the body, and in
Victory in perfection in Chriſt, which is all one as to ſay, he is in Chriſt
and out of Chriſt, perfect and imperfect at the ſame inſtant.</hi>—I anſwer,
there are <hi>Scripture Paradoxes</hi> relating to the Myſtery of the Goſpel,
which mans wiſdom and reaſon which is fooliſhneſs with God, cannot
comprehend; hence to the wiſe <hi>Greeks, Philoſophers and Stoicks,</hi> the
Preaching of Jeſus and the Reſurrection from the dead, and of the day
in which God will judge the World by that man, whereof he hath
given aſſurance unto all men in that he hath raiſed him from the
dead, I ſay, this Doctrine thoſe <hi>wiſe rational men</hi> counted Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes
gotten beyond reaſon; ſaying of <hi>Paul, what will this babler ſay?
he ſets forth ſtrange Gods; becauſe he preached to them Jeſus and the
Reſurrection.</hi> But I do acknowledge that among thoſe Paradoxes,
this is one; a believer lives at one and the ſame time in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
ſtate: by faith he is a <hi>man in Chriſt Jeſus, in him he is compleat,</hi>
while according to ſenſe, he is <hi>a man in the fleſh,</hi> ſubject to infirmities
and death; <hi>in the body he hath a Law of ſin, in the Lord he hath put it
off;</hi> as he walks by faith he is in reſt, victory and perfection; as he
walks by ſight he is in labours, warfare and imperfections: hence
the Apoſtle teſtifieth 8 <hi>Rom. 23. we who have received the fruits of the
ſpirit, even we our ſelves groan within ourſelves, waiting for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our body; for we are ſaved by hope; but hope that is ſeen is not
hope; for what a man ſees, why doth he yet hope for? but if we hope for
that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it; likewiſe, the ſpirit alſo
helpeth our infirmities: hence alſo faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43551:26"/>
for, the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> Thus the Believer is in a ſtate of
hope and faith, having received but the earneſt of the inheritance, not
the full fruition, not as if already perfected, is daily preſſing forward
to that which is before, in groans, and infirmities in the body, waiting
the Redemption thereof; to which if this man hath already attained, the
end of faith and hope, and ſo the Reſurrection of the dead, where
they are as the Angels, neither Marrying nor giving in Marriage;
why is he then like unto us mortals, marrying, and giving in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
eating, and drinking, and not above ſickneſs and death? But
theſe preſumptuous ſpirits that dare thus intrude into things they
have not ſeen, <hi>not holding the head,</hi> ſo boaſting of things above their
meaſure, are reproved by the wiſe <hi>Solomon 30. Prov. 12 There is a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not waſhed from their
filthineſs:</hi> whilſt thou pleads for a being perfected in the ſelf, hadſt
thou not been a Servant to corruption, thou hadſt not brought forth
ſuch a piece of work.</p>
            <p>In the 10. pag. thou writes thus—<hi>thus for</hi> R. G. <hi>hath ſhewn himſelf
one while like a Quaker</hi> (ſo called) <hi>having gotten many of their words,
another while like a Presbyterian or Independent.</hi> In anſwer to this I
am to let thee know, that even in that wherein thou acknowledges I
have ſhown my ſelf like a <hi>Quaker,</hi> I have therein teſtified to what
partly and in my meaſure I received of the Lord, and witneſſed
through and under the Miniſtry of thoſe thou calls <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or
<hi>Independent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas thou reproacheſt other Perſons whom thou names in
that 10. p. as <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> in departing from your company; that
charge cannot be faſtned upon them, while they departed from among
you, becauſe they ſaw and knew that you were departed from the
faith <hi>as it was once delivered to the Saints;</hi> are the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> really
<hi>Apoſtates</hi> in departing from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whom they ſaw and knew to
be departed from the Doctrine of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> though the Papiſts
clamoured after them as <hi>Apoſtates?</hi> no more are they ſuch in depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from you upon this account.</p>
            <p>As for my ſelf, notwithſtanding of all that I have met with from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you (not fit to be mentioned among ſober men) I am not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
aſhamed in that I have owned and confeſſed, <hi>the Son of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men;</hi> knowing that as thoſe of old who believed not in him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
him, <hi>with his Trade, A Carpenter, with his Countrey, a Galele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
with his Doctrine, a blaſphemer, with his Company, a Companion of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43551:26"/>

            <p>THus having anſwered thoſe objections, and taken off that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
of confuſion and contradiction that theſe <hi>four men</hi> have
brought againſt <hi>my Teſtimony to the true Saviour;</hi> what I therein aſſerted,
to wit, That <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> is the true Chriſt, and our
only Saviour; and that he hath by his intire obedience to his Fathers
will in his own Crucified body, by that one Sacrifice thereof, once
offered for ſins, as the only propitiation and attonement whom God
ſet forth, already purchaſed Redemption, Righteouſneſs and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with God for ſinners; To be revealed by his Spirit within, where
by the effect and benefit thereof is witneſſed, known and felt within, by
all ſuch to whom this word of Reconciliation being preached, through
faith <hi>in him</hi> receive that attonement, ſo already done and perfected,
as the ground of their faith and hope, for the Remiſſion of their ſins,
and of eternal life by the Reſurrection of the dead: I ſay this bleſſed
truth publiſhed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp; teſtified unto by me, ſtands above all
the weapons and darts, cavils and exceptions, formed, ſhot and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

Principalities nor Powers of darkneſs ſhall ever prevail.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I would have you who have thus haſtily thruſt your
ſelves forth againſt <hi>my Teſtimony,</hi> (if yet you may be in all meekneſs
and love adviſed, and that you reckon it not below you, a poor begarly,
carnal thing) re-examine this your work by the Scriptures of truth;
for know you aſſuredly, that whoſoever believes not the Record that
God hath given of his Son, hath made God a Lyar: And this is the
Record that <hi>John</hi> who was ſent of God to point him out, did bear of
him, 1. <hi>John 19. &amp;c. he confeſſed, I am not be, the Chriſt,</hi> but ſeeing Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
coming unto him (Mark that, not meekneſs, humility, a light or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43551:27"/>
manifeſtation of Chriſt in himſelf as in him) ſaid <hi>Behold the Lamb of
God which takes away the ſin of the world; this is he of whom I ſaid after me
cometh a MAN</hi> (Mark that, the Lamb of God pointed out by <hi>John,</hi> which
takes away the ſin of the world, was and is a <hi>MAN.</hi>) <hi>which is preferred
before me; he that ſent me to Baptize, ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhall
ſee the Spirit deſcending, the ſame is he;</hi> and this was an outward ſeeing
(with his bodily eyes) of the ſpirit, in the form of a Dove de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
and remaining on the man Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>and I ſaw</hi>
(ſaith <hi>John</hi>) and bare Record, that this is the Son of God: And this
is he whom the Apoſtles ſaw after his being riſen from the dead, and
of whom they all teſtified, and believed in, as the true Chriſt, mans
only true Saviour and mediator, whom God ſent forth to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation
for our ſins, and to be the Saviour of the World; and this is
the will of God, that we ſhould believe in him whom he hath thus
ſent into the World; And this is <hi>HE,</hi> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Son of
man, the only begotten ſon of God, to whom I have teſtified, as the
true Chriſt, wherein you have taken upon you to oppoſe me; whom
nevertheleſs I do beſeech and intreat, to conſider ſeriouſly (for this is
a weighty matter, in reſpect of him, <hi>the Son of man, the man Chriſt
Jeſus,</hi> a Teſtimony unto whom as Saviour you have dared to oppoſe)
the words of our Lord, 8. <hi>John</hi> 14. (if his words, who ſpoke as never
man ſpake hath any weight with you) <hi>If you will not believe that I am

labour of love in ſetting your work before you, that if it it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
you might repent of this your joynt enterprize againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, you ſhall ſtill continue your oppoſition
againſt him, and his bleſſed Goſpel preached by <hi>his Holy Apoſtles,</hi> and
left by them to us upon Record in the Scriptures of truth, and teſtified
unto by me, and ſhall caſt up more reproach againſt me for the truth
ſake, I can and do in my heart ſay, <hi>the Lord lay it not to your charge;</hi>
Only let me alſo tell you, your labour will be but in vain: Read 4. <hi>Acts</hi> 25.
compared with the 2. <hi>Pſal. Why do the Heathen rage, and the people
imagine vain things, againſt the Lord and his Chriſt? for of a truth againſt
the Holy Child Jeſus whom God anointed, both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
<hi>with the Gentiles and people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were gathered together; But the
Lord hath ſet his King upon the holy hill of Sion, and hath declared his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,

man) <hi>thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That I may finiſh this Diſcourſe I ſhall only leave theſe two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43551:27"/>
with <hi>the Reader,</hi> as being what I intended in <hi>my Teſtimony.</hi>
Firſt, cheat not thy own Soul by profeſſing in words the <hi>Prophets</hi> and
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> Teſtimony to the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the true Chriſt, and
our only Saviour, and to Redemption through his bloud, while thou
art not in any meaſure a partaker of that living faith, and lively hope,
theſe Holy men lived and dyed in: An Hiſtorical bare aſſent to thoſe
truths, with an hypocritical extolling of the Perſon of Chriſt in his
ſufferings, mediation, and offices, as perſonally without thee, will not
avail thee, in the day of the appearance of <hi>the Son of man,</hi> while thou
haſt not through a <hi>living</hi> ſaith (being thereby ingrafted in him the
true Vine) a real, ſubſtantial evidence within thy ſelf, that thou art in
ſome meaſure a partaker of his Divine nature, by the workings of
the Spirit of God within thee; which whilſt thou ſlights and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
notwithſtanding of thy pretences to his death and ſufferings,
Redemption and Righteouſneſs, thou wilt find it verified on thee,
<hi>that the hope of the hypocrite ſhall periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, whatſoever Spirit in or through any man (though even an
Angel from Heaven) ſhall point you, to any other name or thing,
within or without, then to <hi>him</hi> the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> even that <hi>ſame
Jeſus</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> Crucified, to be <hi>he</hi> the Lords Chriſt our only
Saviour; or ſhall preach an obedience to be done and performed in
our bodies, or by the ſpirit of God within us, as a ranſome, a Sacrifice,
an attonement and bloud of the Croſs, to be offered up to God for
our ſins, through which Redemption is to be purchaſed, Reconcilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made with God, the Law fulfilled, the Curſe and condemnation
thereof taken away, and Juſtification for Remiſſion of ſins procured as
the ground, bottom and cauſe of our faith hope &amp; confidence in God
for Salvation and eternal life, I ſay <hi>Believe him not:</hi> For this ſpirit is no
other then a denyer of the true Chriſt, and of Redemption through
faith in him; ſetting up another Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another Mediatour,
then him the man Chriſt Jeſus, whom the holy men of old believed in;
and another attonement, propitiation and bloud, than that one ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of his Crucified body and the bloud of his Croſs teſtified of in the
Scriptures; as already offered up for ſins once for all; preaching
him in and through all theſe only as an example, and as a good man
dying without cauſe by the hands of wicked men; that we following
him (the light in our Conſciences) in all his Righteouſneſs, might alſo
come to God, as he did, to wit, by an obedience of works, That is to
ſay, <hi>without a Mediatour:</hi> the dreadful conſequence of which Doctrine I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43551:28"/>
tremble to think on. I ſhall leave theſe Scriptures to be weighed and
examined by ſuch as are intangled in this ſnare, if their Authority have
any room in them, 1 <hi>Gal. 6. 7, 8. 9. I marvell that you are ſo ſoon removed
from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel,
which is not another; but there be ſome that trouble you, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Goſpel of Chriſt. But though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach
any other Goſpel then that which we have preached unto you; then that ye
have received, Let him be accurſed.</hi> And this is the Goſpel they preached,
Rom. 5. 15, 19. <hi>As by one MANS diſobedience many were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
ſo by the obedience of one MAN Chriſt Jeſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall many be made
Righteous,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 21, <hi>For ſince by MAN came death, by MAN
alſo came the Reſurrection of the dead.</hi>
