         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS all things have their revolutions, so hath naturall History the same chance. It was held for a goddess, and much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in former times; witnesse the writings of <hi>Aristotle, Pliny, Dioscorides,</hi> and other famous men: but now a dayes it is so despised, that it is of no esteem at all; this mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er needs no proving. I confesse the history of Plants is adorned by many, and Mineralls are made mention of; yet I doubt whether it be entirely professed in any University or School, (except <hi>Bononia, where</hi> Aldrovandus <hi>was). They that search out the secrets of Nature, in cursory discourses, fall unfortunatly upon the thorns of subtilties and snares of questions, and do nothing but weave and unweave them with a fine thred of controversies.</hi> Whence young Schollers suppose themselves fit to be Masters in Philosophy, when they know how to quote <hi>Aristotle</hi> for some things, confusedly and unreasonably for generall matters. Most <hi>gracious Lords,</hi> how unfit and hurtfull that is, I leave to every man to judge. As for me, what <hi>Goudanus</hi> the Mr. of great <hi>Erasmus</hi> speaks of <hi>Pliny,</hi> I dare to apply to natural History. <hi>That it is such, that who reads it not, is thought to be unlearned; he that disdaigns to read it, is more ignorant; and he that cannot rellish it, is most ignorant of all: And if there be any consideration had of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, really it is more comely and more convenient for it, and for us to know wonderfull nature, and her motions; to learn the forces and natures of living creatures, mettals, sprouts, plants, to look into the Anatomy of man, and to
<pb facs="tcp:52474:3"/>
contemplate other rare admirable things in nature, than to rest satisfied in a few general things of motion, of the heavens, of meteors, and of the soul, (Johannes valent. Andr. in Jnstit. Magica.) and oft times to agitate these things againe, till we grow ridiculous.</hi> And indeed if the general Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of natural Philosophy be lookt into, it will appeare they cannot consist without knowledg of History. For being that universalls are built upon particulars, illustrated, demonstrated, determined, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by them, how can he be skilled in Philosophy, who is ignorant of History? or how can he salve the many defects thereof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Axioms that are introductive to action, and search out the forms, <hi>&amp;c</hi>? The same will befall him as it befell <hi>Ixion,</hi> who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Clowd for <hi>Juno</hi> the powerfull goddess, whom he intended to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and so is reported to have begotten <hi>Centaures</hi> and <hi>Chimaera's.</hi> As for what concerns action, he shall never change any other mettal into Gold, who knows not the natures of the weight, the yellow colour, of the malleablenesse, the extensivenesse, the fixt and volatile sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of them, and hath not diligently lookt into the menstruum, and seeds of minerals. He can never hope to retard old age, who hath not first the knowledge of the nature of driness, and of the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Spirits upon solid bodies; of assimilation, and alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But the straightning of nature, and daily contesting with her, is the principall thing whereunto the knowledge of the same is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He is to me a true Son of natural Philosophy who knows how to augment, and multiply the Winds, to produce new mettals, to make mineral Waters; Artificial, of Vitriol, Brimstone, Allum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to bring forth new plants and animals. He is a legitimate enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer into Nature, who knowes how to prolong life, keep back old age, change statures and complexions, raise the force of imagination up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any body, cure diseases hitherto uncurable, ease pains, and can hasten the times of maturity, clarification, putrefaction, concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and germination. I will now say nothing of Natures book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may behold the supreme power, as the Sun is seen in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For it is certain, that he is comprehended under the title of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural history, and it is farr more easy to find out his goodnesse wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power, by the apparition of new Starrs, the flowing of the Sea about <hi>Maccareo,</hi> the increase of Iron in <hi>Ilva,</hi> the marriage of palme Trees, the flowring of Mulberries, the ingenuity of Elephants, the Kingdom of Bees, the harvest of Pismires, the foresight of Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins, and the infinite Sympathies and Antipathies of things created, than out of those vast discourses of the entity of <hi>materia prima,</hi> identity of motion, the measure of time, <hi>&amp;c</hi>: which are found in <hi>Albertus, Thomas, Scotus, Fonseca, Masius, Ruvius Toletus</hi> and others. Who knows not but that the knowledge of God is the principall end of Sciences? When I had diligently considered of these things, first induced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the writings of that reverend man D. <hi>Johannes Andreas,</hi> my much honoured friend, I not only conceived a high love of naturall History, but I thought my self obliged to perswade young men that
<pb facs="tcp:52474:3"/>
were studious, to do the same. But because I observed that the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreticall part was shut up in huge Volums, and the practick invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with great difficulties; and I saw that Youth that are given to idlenesse, would hate labour; and being addicted to pleasure, would not endure difficult things; I, imitating the Sons of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> (who allure the sick to use bitter things, use also syrups confections electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) have culled out the most pleasant things, (and if any be doubtfull, it was done to spur them on) as much as my other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would suffer me, which I had in <hi>Poland,</hi> being Tutor to the most noble <hi>Kurtzbachius de Zwada</hi>: as also by my proper studies in the low Countries, out of the huge volumes of <hi>Pliny,</hi> (concerning whom, I like that saying of <hi>Lipsius He that calls Pliny his works Pandects, in my opinion shall not err; for that man read, knew all, and shut up Greece and Italy in one volume) Agricola, Gesner Aldrovandus, Libavius, Mathiolus, Scaliger, Cardan,</hi> and many more writings, and by these my purpose was to invite with intreaty the studious youth, that labour so much in the common principles of natural Philosophy, to a more serious scrutiny of Nature. But, most illustrious Princes and Lords, when, as the manner is, I sought for a Patron, I thought this work did of duty belong unto your Name. For If it be considered; the examples of <hi>Solomon, Alexander, Mithridates, Diocletian, Francis the first King of France,</hi> and others, will teach you, that the knowledge of natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy belongs also to Princes and to great men. If you; I confesse, the hope of <hi>Poland</hi> now, and in time may be the Starrs, of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that with the beams of their light, will vouchsafe to illuminate the Church, the Common-wealth, and schooles of learning. If I; I have drawn these things forth chiefly for the good of my Nation, and I study other things, if God please to lend me space to perfect my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Yet I deny not, but it may be I owe more to you already than I can pay. For, most Illustriuos Prince <hi>Janusius,</hi> you were pleased at <hi>Lipsia</hi> to invite me to your Table, and to discourse with me. And the most illustrious Lord <hi>Alexander Przybkowic Przybkowsky,</hi> your high treasurer, thought me worthy, to have the offer of a place in your illustrious family, if occasion were. Most illustrious Lord, how great your Noblenesse was to me, my conversation at <hi>Lesna</hi> with the most learned Lord <hi>Michael Henry,</hi> a most excellent Chymist, and your hof-master; and with the reverend Mr. <hi>David Ursin,</hi> a man of singular fidelity and prudence, who sojourns with you, may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently witnesse. Also, most Illustrious Lord <hi>Boguslaus,</hi> your letters are sufficient testimonies, whereby you often spake to me when I lived in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the good words you spake of me being absent, most lovingly when you departed from <hi>Lesna.</hi> Wherefore, most illustrious Lords, whatsoever this small work is, I lay it down at your feet; and you I hope will receive a small gift of a thankfull mind, with that Heroick humanity that is bred in you; and think, that I owe you much more, but I cannot give you more than I do. God grant that the Majesty of Arts buried in our minds, may be recall'd and brought to life
<pb facs="tcp:52474:4"/>
again by your promoting voyce, and be restored to its former luster. As for me, if I find that you accept of these things, and that they are usefull for our students, I shall indeavour to handle these things more accurately, and to frame a compleat Circle of Arts and Sciences in a small history, that young students may have the fruit of it, and may more happily be promoted in the course of their studies. I wish it. In the mean while, that you most Illustrious Lords, may live long for the glory of God, and good of your Country. Given at <hi>London,</hi> May 15 old style, Anno 1631.</p>

            <p>THis Excellent <hi>HISTORY</hi> concerning <hi>The Wonderfull Things of Nature,</hi> was written in Latin; and digested into <hi>Ten Classes,</hi> by a Native of another Countrey: who was himself indeed <hi>A Wonder in Nature,</hi> and might well make up the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Classis</hi> with the History of himself, for his generall and vast under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Universe, as will appear to all men that will take the pains (so full of profit and delight) to read his Writings. In his Life-time he was much conversant in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to search out the Wonderfull Things in these Nations. And if Englishmen well weigh and consider it, they cannot but thankfully make their returns unto Almighty God for it, since there is no Countrey of the World that is in all things comparable to <hi>Great Britany</hi> it self, being adorned with so many strange and wonderfull things. I shall not need to mention the particulars (which have furnished the Author in severall Classes with some varieties.) For I fear the World will judge that I have said too much already unto your Honour upon this Subject (who is far better acquainted with the Wonders and Rarities of these Nations than my self) and that I have betray'd my own Ignorance, to offer a Translation of mine, unto your Honour, who is so well versed in the Originall, and which cannot be parallel'd when it is made to speak any other Language. But I hope your Honour will excuse this Attempt, because the Authour was a great Lover of our Countrey, and therefore it was held convenient to make him a free Denizon, and to speak <hi>English</hi> for the publick Good, which your Honour hath alwaies labour'd to advance by your honourable Actions; and I fear not, but your Noblenesse will tenderly Embrace what is undertaken for that end; though this Translation can adde nothing to your Honour, but seeks for honour from your noble Patronage. Yet since it pleased God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me this opportunity to put your Honour in remembrance of me, who was formerly a Schollar at <hi>Eaton</hi> Colledge, and contemporary with your Honour; and that I once had the happinesse to be domestick Servant unto your Honour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the knowledge of God is free from errour. The eternity of <hi>Cardan</hi> drawn from the salt of the Sea, <hi>lib. de subtil.</hi> is as easily rejected as propounded. It is a weak proof, that all pure things were made at first; I adde, and a false one. <hi>Chrysippus apud Laertium</hi> amongst the Stoicks, speaks boldly: <hi>If there be any thing, that can do that, which a man with his reason cannot do, that thing is greater, stronger and wiser than man; but a man cannot make heavenly things: Therefore he that made them excells man in Art, Counsel, Prudence and Power.</hi> What therefore can that be but God? All that is, was made of nothing, and by the Word let it be made. <hi>Empedocles</hi> is false, concerning the concourse of Atoms; (of matter and quantity co-eternal) also that is false in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, That the essence and matter whereof the World was made, was not first created, but was alwayes ready for the Workmaster, and was fit to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and digested, and made, as far as possible it might be to his own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> But nothing was with God, before he made it, that was not God himself. He it is, that calls things that are not, as though they were. <hi>Hermes in Pimander, The Workmaster made the whole World, not by hands, but by his Word. Moses</hi> writes, that all things were made in six dayes; Some think this was onely for order sake, and for our instruction. <hi>Augustine</hi> thinks, all things were made together in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Philo</hi> writes acutely of the making of the World. <hi>Moses</hi> saith, The World was made in six dayes; not that God the Maker of it needed time to do it, (for God is not onely thought to work by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, but by contemplating) but because it was needfull that things should be created in some order: and this is a proper number for order; and six amongst all numbers is fittest for generation, for it is the first perfect number after a Unite, consisting of parts whereof it is made; of three that is one half of it; and two a third part, and one a sixth part, being of a masculine and feminine nature. As for the time, it is supposed to be Autumn, as it is collected from the Feast of gathering in of fruits in the end of the year, and from the moneth <hi>Tisri,</hi> which answers to September, <hi>Bartolin. c. ult. gener. Phys.</hi> Some say, the Spring: <hi>Ambrosius in Hexametro: Thence it behoved the World to begin, where there was a Spring-like temper fit for all things. Whence it is that the year sets forth the Image of the World at first beginning, and after winter cold, and frost and mists, the clearer brightnesse of the Spring shines forth more than ordinary. Macianus Scotus</hi> puts the Lords Day on the 15th of the Calends of April. <hi>Macrobius</hi> describes the Generation. His words are; <hi>In the making of the World,</hi> Aries <hi>was in the middle of the Heavens; the Moon in</hi> Cancer; <hi>the Sun rose with</hi> Leo; Virgo <hi>with</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; Libra <hi>with</hi> Venus; Mars <hi>with</hi> Scorpio; Jupiter <hi>was in</hi> Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius; Saturn <hi>in</hi> Capricorn. We shall say with <hi>Firmicus, The Day it was made upon, is uncertain.</hi> For the time is different in places; nor was there any then. For all secular things began with the World. If you look at the end, it is the glory of God, and the good of Man. Look which way I will, I see exquisite marks of Gods Wisdome, Goodnesse, and Power. Contraries are here parted, and yet coupled by bands in the mediums. Hence his wisdom appears; The actions

have recourse in order; hence appears unity: there is neither old age, nor change, nor wearinesse; thence his power is manifest: every thing had a sufficient perfection given to it, and is content with it; thence we see his goodnesse. They are all from God, and they tend unto God; thence is glory.</p>

And when all things were undivided, and not set in order; they were parted; and things that were leight, chose the uppermost place; heavy, the lowest; moyst, the dry Land: all of them being divided by the Fire, and hanging in the Ayr, and carried by it. And the Heaven appeared in</hi> 7. <hi>circles, and the gods appearing in the Aspects of the Stars, with all their signs, and the whole circumference was distinguished, and with the gods that are in it was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed with the circumambient Ayr, and carried by a moving Divine spirit.

For the Sabbath for the earth, and the yeare of <hi>Jubilee</hi> was wont to return every 7th year, and every 49, yeares. <hi>Leo Hebraeus toucheth upon this opinion, Dialog de Amore</hi>; where he saith, <hi>The inferior world by the opinion of the old divines is generated corrupted and renewd once in</hi> 7000 <hi>years.</hi> But because we see nothing moved in it confusedly, nor any thing set without it, whither shall we go out of it? Our desire is answered. For in the end of our cogitations, the same question al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies returns. Wherefore we say, that there is but one world, and the figure of it is plain, like to a skin stretched forth very large, saith <hi>Basilius.</hi> But <hi>Plato</hi> held, that it was like a Circumvex, pointed with many Angles. <hi>Sanchumates Berytius</hi> the most ancient writer of the affaires of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> said it was like to an Egge, wherefore at the feasts of <hi>Bacchus</hi> they religiously adored an egg, as the emblem of the world.

Hence grew that description by its parts. <hi>The Starr,</hi> (saith Plutarch <hi>of the face of the Moon) are shining eyes in the face of the world, they run their race; the Sun is in place of the Heart: as this affords blood and spirit, so that sends forth heat and light; the world useth the Earth and the Sea, as a living creature doth its belly and bladder; The Moon between the Sun and the Earth is as the Liver between the heart and belly, or some soft bowel, and attenuating its respirations by some concoction, and purgation, scatters them about.</hi> Elegantly, but not true! For the world hath no known soul; if we ascribe any thing to it, all will be but a diffused force, common to all, and in proportion we may call it a soul. For what the soul is in bodies, the same is force diffused in the universe. <hi>Combach. in Phys. cap. de Mundo.</hi>

                  <p>I Said, that natural bodies were containd in the world; now I say that they are so ordered that they have their peculiar vertues, and in some things they are partakers. Every one hath its nature, they are containd in place, measur'd by time, defined by number, they begin, they perish, they move, augment, diminish, they act, and suffer. Amongst the rest hidden qualities are admirable according to which there is either consent in things, or jarring and discord; Philosophers call this sympathy and antipathy. The first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond qualities are no causes of these things; examples of them are spred through the whole field of Nature. The raging Elephant growes calme if he see a Ram; and if he see a <hi>Rhinoreros,</hi> he is angry. The tender flesh of sheep bitten by a Wolfe, and the wooll woven also, will breed Worms. Cattel almost dead, and men faint, are revived by the smell of bread. <hi>Pencerus de divin. sect. de Astrolog. Porphyrio</hi> a bird will dye if it look on a Whore. Woodpeckers will, with grasse, drive out wedges. A Stag draws out Arrows with dittany.

One swounded with the combing of his hair. <hi>Demohon</hi> the builder of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was cold in the Sun or a hot Bath, and hot in the shade.

                  <p>GOd was not pleased onely to make all these things, but he would have them all under his Government, and Providence. Hence comes the preservation of the beings and vertues of things; and the disposing of them all after the freedom of his will, the wise ordering of all things. In this are the ends set orderly, the means to these ends are exquisitely disposed, and being disposed, are most wisely direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This Providence was so often and forcibly maintain'd by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> that they became a sport and a jest to their adversaries, who call'd this, <hi>The fatall old Wife of the Stoicks that foretold future things. Epictetus</hi> in <hi>Arrianus,</hi> speaks admirably; <hi>What concerns the gods, some deny there is any God. Some say there is, but an idle carelesse Deity, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for nothing. There is a third sort, that maintain there is a God, and that his Providence governs, yet onely in great and heavenly matters, but in no earthly thing. A fourth sort say, That he takes care for heavenly and earthly things, but in generall onely, not for particulars, and for every one severally. But there are a fifth sort, wherein</hi> Ulysses <hi>and</hi> Socrates, <hi>who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That I cannot, O God, be hid or deceive thee in the smallest motion.</hi> There is here no place for fortune, nor for casual and needless violence, That Eternal Light spreads his beams every way, and at the same instant he pierceth into all the windings and depths of the Heavens, Earth, and Seas; nor is his Divine Nature onely President over all these things, but is in them all.</p>

               <p>THe Wisemen ascribed the first place amongst bodies to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; both because it is simple, and also is set in the highest place as principall. Some write, that it is of the same nature with sublunary things, and not amisse; for the Scripture writes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. that <hi>it shall wax old like a garment.</hi> Also the generation of new Stars seems to intimate as much: All the space in these that reacheth to the fixt Stars, is filled with ayr; and it is so much the more pure, light, and hot, as it comes nearer unto them, &amp;c. If you consider the magnitude, the Heavens are the greatest body; the Earth is but a point in comparison to it. The number is but one; yet Astronomers have distinguished it into divers orbs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Eudoxus</hi> into 23. <hi>Calippus</hi> into 30. <hi>Aristotle</hi> 47. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> 31: <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> 33. The common opinion is, that there be Ten; to which if you adde the Heaven of heavens, (<hi>Aquiba</hi> call'd it, the marble Table of the World, <hi>Maimon. l.</hi> 1. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex</hi>). they will be eleven. The consideration of the Tenth amongst them is wonderfull; For they say, it is ten times greater than the eighth sphere, and than the earth 1960; and they say, that in 24 hours it goes 469562845 miles, <hi>Bodin. l.</hi> 5. <hi>Theatr.</hi> The Miracles of the 9th are not small. The Antients say, it proceeded one degree in one hundred years; the <hi>Neotericks</hi> have observed 44 minutes.

It is a wonderfull Engine, and all the great works of men compared with it, are lesse than nothing. <hi>Plato l.</hi> 10. <hi>de Repub.</hi> imagined a certain spindle, as bright as a Diamond, contain'd in 8 wheels; and he makes the Heaven to hang by that, lest it should fall.

                     <hi>MAhomet</hi> said, That the Stars hang in the Ayr by golden chains: That the Workmaster set them in the Heavens, bright &amp; round, we religiously acknowledge; that they were made for signs and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; All men know, that they shine and communicate their vertue to sublunary things; which is done, by sending forth their beams: the

will of man, and works of Artificers, are out of this account. There is in these no mixture of new qualities; but onely an accidentall spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is induced to a body ready made. The mind is free from the Elements; if it suffer any thing, it is by the mediation of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body, the temperament whereof Mens manners easily follow. Hence you may see an errour; <hi>That the characters were formed by a certain position of the Heavens, and are moved by a stronger power from the Heavens. Plato</hi> saith false, <hi>That the Souls before they come into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were made subject to some Star.</hi> These are toyes, That Stars are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for every one of us, bright Stars for rich men; little ones for poor men; dark ones for defects; and some for every mans condition, <hi>Pliny l.</hi> 2. <hi>Histor.

That all that space which the Sun and the rest of the Planets and the Moon wander up and down in, on this side and that side of the Eccliptick, may have moysture for their nourishment.

                  <p>THe Thalmudists hold that the light of the Sun was seven times greater in the Creation, but was lost afterwards. We see it very great and ruling almost every where.

                  <p>THe motion of the Sun through the Zodiack makes a Year. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians make this to be twofold. The one is the space in which the Sun goes from the Spring Equinox, and returns to the same again; and it consists of 365 dayes, five hours, 49 first minutes, 10 seconds. The other is from the time the Sun departs from the first Star in <hi>Aries,</hi> and returns to the same again; and it consists of 365, 6 hours, 9 first minutes, seconds 23. <hi>Copernicus</hi> appointed this, and he deserved great thanks for it, Of the former there are four parts, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter: Spring and Autumn make the Equinoxes; this the Winter Equinox, that the Summer. They both happen, when the Sun passeth the Line. The most certain sign of the Springs approach, is the Butterfly, being a weak creature. <hi>Pliny in histor. Natural.

It is inflamed by the rising of the Dog-star, saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> l. 2. c. 40. yet it were more Philosophicall to say, that when the Sun repeats his Journey, he raiseth hot blasts and wind; whence our bodies partake of great heat. Truly, sometimes it is extream, if we credit Histories. I read in <hi>Livy, l.</hi> 4. <hi>Histor. That in the year of</hi> Rome 322. <hi>not onely rain from Heaven was wanting, but the Earth also wanted its inbred moysture, that the Rivers that run continually were almost dry; that many Fountains and Rivers wanted water, that the Cattel dyed for thirst.</hi>

                  <p>IT was easie to observe, how powerfully this Eye of the World would work upon Inferiour bodies by his lighter and publique motion. There is nothing in the parts of the year, or dayes, or nights, or variety of shadowes, but must be ascribed to it. When the Sun ariseth, all things are enlightened; when it sets, all are in the dark. Things flourish, when he approacheth; fade, when he departeth: These are generals, and if we respect particulars, are not much lesse. It is certain, that tempests, and seasonable weather are from the Sun. About the middle of <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> and the constellation of <hi>Pisces</hi> by the help of Stars that are in them, and rise, it blowes warm to those that are under it; and, the humours that were frozen being mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the earth being watered with them, it produceth the fruitful Western blasts, and stirs up the force of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> and <hi>Hyades</hi> in <hi>Taurus,</hi> and of the Kids from the North, from the South or Orient that is near unto it; and of <hi>Arcturus</hi> that lyes opposite to it, which raise up Southern winds, and for some dayes do water the seed sown with continual rain. <hi>Peucer in Astrol.</hi> When the Herbs are grown and want moisture again for their just magnitude, it affords it and drawes it forth by it, coming up toward the Stars of <hi>Cancer.

                  <p>THe <hi>Stoicks</hi> thought the Moon to be a dark and hairy light. <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> supposed it was a ball, white on one side, and blew on the other.

whom they called the Night-Suns. <hi>Pliny,</hi> l. 2. c. 82.

Whence it comes that she hath so many Aspects;

she is alwaies increasing or decaying, and sometimes she is crook'd with horns, sometimes she is equally divided; sometimes she is crooked, sometimes full, sometimes she is suddenly wane, and the same appears suddenly again. <hi>Pliny,</hi> l. 2. c. 9. The Ancients adored the full Moon as a type of beauty.</p>
                  <p>There is a merry Tale in <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Symposiacks</hi> of <hi>Wiseman</hi> concerning the Moon decreasing, That the Moon asked of her Mother a Coat fit for her; and she answered, <hi>How can I do that? for sometimes thou art a full Moon, sometime a half Moon, and sometimes with two horns.</hi> In <hi>Biarmia</hi> she is never seen but with a full circle toward the surface of the Earth, of a fiery colour, and like a cole. <hi>Olaus,</hi> l. 1.</p>

                     <hi>Artic. 2.</hi> Of the Spots and Eclipse of the Moon.</head>
                  <p>THe substance of the Moon is spotted: if you ask the reason, wise men have said that the parts of the Moon are unequally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted. The Poets thought she carryed a Boy with her whom she lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who covered his face for shame. When she is deprived of the Suns light, she is Eclipsed. But that is only in a diametricall oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, when the Moon hath no declination from the Ecliptick, or that which is lesse then 67, minuts, and so it either enters the shadow of the Earth, or cannot avoid it. The antients thought she might be drawn from Heaven by Charms, and being thrust down, she might be compelled. That she powereth forth her venome and force into the hearbs that are subject to her, which may be more succesfully used in Magick arts. Hence it was that they tinkled in Cymballs, that the Charms might not be heard. There are no Eclipses of Sun or Moon, but there follow some changes in sublunary things. There was one in the yeare, 3459. And <hi>Darius</hi> at <hi>Marathon</hi> was overthrown by the <hi>Athenians</hi> with wonderfull ruine. another was, 3782. and <hi>Perseus</hi> King of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> was conquered by consul <hi>Aemilius,</hi> and an end was put to the Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia, Alsted. in thesauro Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolog</hi>: Some observe them superstitiously: for example, <hi>Niceas</hi> of <hi>Athens (Ubbo Emmius Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>vet. Graec.</hi>) being beaten at <hi>Epipolas</hi> in <hi>Sicilia</hi>; when his Country was in danger, he should have marched away, as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> and <hi>Eurymedon</hi> perswaded him: When he did march, the Moon was Eclipsed. Many took that for an ill Omen: this so moved <hi>Niceas,</hi> that he said he would decree nothing, to remove his Tents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till three times 9, days were over, that the Wizards had foreshew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Plin: l.</hi> 2. <hi>C.</hi> 12.

                  </p>
                  <p>To this may be referred, the ridiculous opinion of some, who think that an Asse drank up the Moon: for when the Asse drank, the Moon was seen in the water, when the Asse went away, she was covered with a Cloud, and could not be seen. Wherefore they cast the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Asse <hi>Silenus</hi> rod on, into Prison, and cut up his belly, that they might have the Moon again, and they most cruelly took out his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells. <hi>Delrius, disquisit: Magic: l.</hi> 2. <hi>quest.</hi> 11.

               <p>WEe have spoken of those things that ordinarily are done by Nature in Heaven. I will now adde some things which the right hand of God hath produced above nature. I mean new Stars, which have appeared, and not being of long continuance, have shortly disappear'd again, and vanish'd from our sight. The Star at our Saviours birth is the chief, which (<hi>Fulgentius</hi> saith) had no place in the Firmament, nor in the Ayr. It went forward with an uncertain motion, sometimes it shewed it self, and sometimes it was hid. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascenus,</hi> l. 2. <hi>Orthodox. fidei. Chalcides</hi> the Platonist, speaks thus of it, upon <hi>Timaeus</hi> of <hi>Plato; There is also a more holy and more venerable History that relates, that by the rising of a Star that was unusual, not Death and Diseases were foreshewed, but the venerable descending of God, for man's salvation, and in favour of mortall things, which men testifie to have been observed by the</hi> Chaldaeans, <hi>who adored God with gifts, who was newly born.</hi> Whence they learned the knowledge of its apparition, is shewed in the Books of <hi>Balaam</hi> the Southsayer, wherein are many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous things.</p>
               <p>The other is that which appeared in the year 1572. This is that year, wherein that Bartholmy-slaughter was acted at <hi>Paris,</hi> in which (not excluding other places) 30000 men were slain, 100000 of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi> Families were oppressed in three dayes, Widows and Orphan Children innumerable being brought to the greatest beggery or want. <hi>Prisbach. in Respons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Diameter of it contained the Diameter of the Earth 7. times and ½ part; and it was greater than the Earth 361 times and ½, it was bigger than the Sun twice and 2/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It had no motion, except that which it had common with the fixed Stars, it alwayes held the same Position to the neighbouring Stars in <hi>Cassiopaea.</hi> It lasted 16 months. What was foreshewed by it, is variously determined by divers men. <hi>Gemma Frisius in Cosmocritica,</hi> writes, That since the birth of Christ there was hardly any apparition to be compared with it, whether we consider the height of the sign, or the rarity, or the long continuance of it. The <hi>Britans</hi> ascribed it to the lamentable death of <hi>Mary.</hi> An <hi>Oxford</hi> Astrologer was Authour of this opinion, who by <hi>Cassiopaea,</hi> the Sister to King <hi>Cepheus,</hi> said, That some Queen in the North must be noted out by it; and by its 16 moneths continuance he foreshewed, (I know not according to what calculation of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and the ascending of the Star into the upper parts,) That that Northern Queen after 16 years should ascend up into heaven. The event made good his praediction. <hi>Thuan.</hi> l. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4 <hi>Molerus</hi> seemed to expect a new Prophet by it, in the year, 1590, and the conquest of the Gospel over all through the World.</p>

seasons, because they have determinate causes in the position of the Starrs, may be foretold by them. Yet because the matter of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is mutable and flitting, many particular causes overthrow gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral causes, and many Starrs in both motions are yet unknown; and some of them somtimes are opposite to the others forces: also most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Artists are few: and lastly there is a vast distance in placing the beginning and ends of the Houses, and proprieties, and therefore it is no wonder if error creep in. <hi>Bartholin de caelo.</hi> And if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve particular and individuall actions, the errour will be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for beside the generall influence of the Starrs, there is a special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which ariseth from the speciall complexion. The indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter hinders the good influence of Heaven; and the goodnesse of the temper derived from the Parents, keeps off the bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. We know that <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> were born at the same time, in respect of the Heavens position, yet was their fortune most different. In civil actions the Starrs have nothing to do. It is an elegant saying of <hi>Bodinus. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Repub. Cap,</hi> 3. <hi>There is but one Rule,</hi> saith he, <hi>of all Philosophers, even of those that idly dispute of what is done in the Heavens; that a wiseman is not under the affection and power of the Starrs, but only those who like beasts are ruled by their appetites and desires, and will not be subject to reason and good lawes, whom</hi> Solomon, <hi>the Master of wisdome, threatned sharply with punishment of the rack</hi>: yet many have adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make triall. The <hi>Caldeans</hi> by mens actions collected the day of a mans Birth, and from the day of a mans Birth, the fortune of his whole life; And that men should not reject them, they boasted they had spent 470, thousand yeares in the experience of this Art. And so bold they were, that they vaunted that it was a thing as necessary to be known, how the position of the Starrs and the force of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were, when a man would build a house, or make, sow, or put on his Cloths, as to know how they were disposed when Children were new born. <hi>Lucius Tarutius Firmianus,</hi> by the acts of <hi>Romulus,</hi> his Life, and Death, found that he was born in the first yeare of the second <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 23, day of the Month; <hi>Peucer de divinat. sect. de Astrolog</hi>: and born in the 21, day of the month <hi>Toth,</hi> about Sun rising. And hence he found out the first day that <hi>Rome</hi> was built, and that it began when the Moon was in <hi>Libra,</hi> the Sun with <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Taurus, Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Pisces,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> with <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Scorpio.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose we may refer him, who by the first day of <hi>Jannuary,</hi> would fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell all events.</p>

Therefore <hi>Alexius</hi> the Emperour, desired long to know when he might seasonably return to <hi>Blacherna</hi>; at last the day and houre were chosen according to the Starrs. He return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that so happily, that the Earth opened very deep before him, and he escaped, but his Son in law <hi>Alexius,</hi> and many of his Nobles fell into the pit, and were hurt, and one <hi>Eunuchus</hi> that was a favorite perished.

                  <hi>Constantinus</hi> a famous man prepares himself, but he was once more called back again; because the Prince had found, that the inquiry was not so certainly and wisely made as it ought to be, and there had been some errour. The Scheme was therefore set once more, and <hi>Constantinus</hi> was sent forth on the day chosen: He was scarce got to Sea, but he and all his forces were taken; <hi>Lips.</hi> in <hi>monit. polit.</hi> A brave art; yet I wonder, since I read of some that were sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome frustrate of their ends. <hi>Nigidius Figulus,</hi> foretold to <hi>Augustus,</hi> that he should be Emperour, <hi>(Xiphilinus). Thrasyllus</hi> foresaw the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and his own danger when he was on the <hi>Tower</hi> with the Prince, and should have been cast down headlong; <hi>Sueton. in Octavio. Largius Proculus</hi> gave notice of the day that <hi>Domitian</hi> should dye; <hi>Ascletarius</hi> foretold the kind: and being required of him to answer what kind of death, he himself should dye, he said he should be eaten with Doggs: and so it was. For though <hi>Domitian to</hi> disprove him, commanded that he should be burnt, and he was then burning, yet a tempest rose suddenly, and put out the fire. The spectators ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Doggs came and devoured him, <hi>Sueton.</hi> in <hi>Domitian. Josephus</hi> that wrote the Antiquities of the <hi>Jews,</hi> saith, that he foretold to the Emperour <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and to his Son <hi>Titus,</hi> that they should be Emperours.

For in the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pope Sixtus the fourth</hi> in a sudden uprore he was hanged. <hi>Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Cervinus</hi> had foretold to his son <hi>Marcellus</hi> that he should come to

great dignity in the Church. Hence he conceiving hope of it, when he was invited by his Mother <hi>Cassandra Benna,</hi> to marry, refused it stoutly; saying, <hi>He would not with the bands of Matrimony bind himself from a greater fortune that the Stars foreshew'd unto him, living single and unmarried:</hi> Thuan. l. 15.

When <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> was Emperour, fire was seen to come forth of the Earth, in the land of the Town of <hi>Colein,</hi> and it burnt the Fields, Villages, Houses; now because the matter of it was bituminous, and could be quenched nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by raine, nor River waters, nor by any other moisture, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished by Stones and old Garments. In <hi>Misena</hi> a Country of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> a Mountain of Coles burns continually, the trenches falling down by degrees in the superficies, which if any man behold, they appear to be burning Furnaces. The fire kindles any thing neere to it, at four foot distance, but not put close to it. <hi>Agricol. de natur. effluent. ex terr. Vesuvius,</hi> also a Mountain in <hi>Campania,</hi> burned, when <hi>Titus Vespasianus,</hi> and <hi>Flavius Domitianus</hi> the seventh, were Consuls. First it cast out Stones from the top broken open; after that, it cast forth such Flames, that two Towns, <hi>Herculaneum,</hi> and <hi>Pompeti</hi> were set on fire; and it sent forth such thick smoak, that it obscured the Sun; and lastly it blew forth such a quantity of Ashes, that like snow it covered the Neighbour Country, which by force of winds was carryed into <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Aegypt, Syria; Dion.

                  <p>WEe will now search out the original of these Fires, and what it is that kindles and nourisheth them. The Poets speak Fables concerning <hi>Aetna,</hi> (but of this, more in the 4th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) <hi>Hyginius Mytholog. cap.</hi> 152. <hi>Hell, of the Earth begat Typhon, of a vast magnitude, and a wonderfull shape, who had</hi> 100 <hi>Dragons heads that sprang from his shoulders; He challenged</hi> Jupiter, <hi>to strive for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Jupiter <hi>hit him on the breast with a burning Thunder-bolt, and having fired him, he cast</hi> Mount Aetna <hi>upon him, which is in</hi> Sicilia, <hi>and from that time it is said to burn yet. Isidor. l.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 8. ascribes it to Brimstone that is kindled by the blasts of winds. <hi>Justinus</hi> affirms, that it is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by water. <hi>Bleskenius</hi> relates of <hi>Hecla,</hi> that no man knowes by what fire, or what matter it burneth; but since that brimstone is dug forth of all <hi>Islandia,</hi> it should appear, that a brimstony matter was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52474:24"/>
sometimes kindled there. Not far from <hi>Hecla</hi> are Pits of brimstone, saith <hi>Bertius,</hi> in <hi>Islandia.</hi> That is certain, that brimstone affords nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment for this fire under ground, and it is such as will burn in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For in these Mountains Writers make mention of waters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we have shew'd, that it hath sometimes burned in the Sea. But <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat, L. de orig. font.</hi> thinks, That in the gulfs of the Sea, a most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fire is contained; and he demonstrates this by Earth-quakes. Therefore the food of it cannot be dry, and like to the Earth which we call <hi>Dorfa</hi>; for that is quickly consumed by fire, and is quenched by water. Nor is it <hi>Marle,</hi> for that will not burn, unlesse it be sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and bituminous. Brimstone burns indeed, but it is soon put out with water; therefore it is Bitumen; and this seems to be the subject of it.</p>

                  <p>SOme Fires are perpetuall. The stone <hi>Asbestos,</hi> once lighted, can never be extinguished; therefore Writers say it was placed in Idol Temples, and the Sepulchres of the dead; <hi>Solinus, c.</hi> 12. There was a Monument once dug up, wherein was a Candle that had burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above 1500 years; when it was touched with the hands, it went to fine ashes: <hi>Vives ad lib.</hi> 21. <hi>de Civitat. Dei. Vives</hi> saw wicks at <hi>Paris,</hi> which once lighted, were never consumed. In <hi>Britany</hi> the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Minerva</hi> had a perpetual fire; when it consumed, it was turned into balls of stone; <hi>Solinus, c.</hi> 24. <hi>Polyhist.</hi> The same thing is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of a certain Wood near to <hi>Urabia</hi> in the New-found World. There are some fires that burn not, either not at all, or in some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain matter, or else miraculously. In <hi>Pythecusis,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. c.</hi> 35. there is a fervent and hot fire that burns not: An Ash that shadowes the Waters called <hi>Scantiae,</hi> is alwayes green. <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 107. In the Mountain of <hi>Puteoli</hi> consisting of Brimstone, there is a fire comes forth, that is neither kindled nor augmented by oyl, nor wax, or any fat matter, nor is it quenched with water, or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and it will not burn towe cast into it, nor can any Candle be lighted by it. <hi>Mayolus Colloq.</hi> 22. he conceives it is not fire, but fiery water. Near <hi>Patara</hi> in <hi>Lycia,</hi> flame is cast forth of a field, you shall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52474:25"/>
feel the heat if you put your hands to it, but it will never burn. The parts of the ambient ayr that are cold and moist, are said to be the cause of it, that by their thinnesse entring into the fire, do hinder the burning of it. Some napkins made of a kind of Flax will not burn: and being durty, they are never washed; but being cast into the fire they are made clean; <hi>Lemnius in l.</hi> 2. <hi>de occult.</hi> That kind growes in the deserts of <hi>India,</hi> where such is the condition of the Ayr, and the quality of the Earth, which causeth such a temper of the Plants, that they may be spun and woven into linnen Cloth.

Nor will posts painted with a green colour, so you do it thick, and Allom with the ashes of white lead be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully mingled with the paint: Because the wood is thickned and hardened, the fire cannot enter. Hence it was, that <hi>Sylla</hi> could not fire a Tower that was smeered with Allom. <hi>C. Caesar</hi> set fire to a Castle near to <hi>Po,</hi> that was built of Larch-tree, and it would not burn, <hi>Vitruv. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. for the Larch tree is not onely free from rottennesse, nor will it resolve into coles. The cause is the compacted matter, <hi>Lemnius, l. c.</hi> What shall we say of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> on whose great joynt of his right foot, fire could not prevail? What of <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> whose heart was not touched after his body was consumed by fire, <hi>Thuan. l.</hi> 5. <hi>Histor.</hi> The Salamander lives safe in the midst of the flames, if we credit <hi>Pliny</hi>; And the bottom of the Cauldron is cold, when it stands in the midst of the fire, and the water boyles, the sides are red hot. Yet <hi>Dioscorid.</hi> writes, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 52. That the Cauldron being cold by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth for a while keep off the fire by being so near to it, but at last it burns and wastes. The reason of this is from the Pyramidall figure of the fire, which ascends in a point, and the thin parts rise up first; the thicker are cast to the sides; <hi>Keckerm: Disp:</hi> 4. <hi>Phys: coral:</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>In the Scriptures we have examples, God appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> in a flaming bush, the bush did not burn, <hi>Exod.</hi> Ch. 3. <hi>Elias</hi> was taken up into Heaven, with a fiery Chariot and horses.

                  <p>Now for putting it out: A certain fire came forth of Mount <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla,</hi> which is extinguished with Towe; that which comes forth of the <hi>Mount Chimaera,</hi> is put out with Hay, or Earth: At <hi>Cullen</hi> of the <hi>Ubii,</hi> with stones, or cloathes. But when <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had taken the City of <hi>Geldria,</hi> the ground was burnt, the grasse and roots burned, the fire could be extinguished by no art of man; it penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Burgundy; Fulgosius, l.</hi> 1. To these I shall adde those Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall devices of <hi>Tritenhemius,</hi> whereby he procured everlasting fires, as an <hi>Anonymus</hi> reports in <hi>Aureo vellere,</hi> in the name of <hi>Bartholmaeus Korndorferus.</hi> Now there are two Eternal Lights.

This is the food of it. Afterwards the Wick must be thus ordered; The small shords of the stone <hi>Asbestos,</hi> about the length of the little finger, and about half so thick, must be tyed together with white silk. The Wick thus made, is sprinkled with brimstone, of the foresaid matter in a Venice-glasse, and it is put under ground, and is boyled in hot sand 24 hours, the brimstone alwaies boyling up. The wick so anointed and wet, is put into a hollow glasse, that it may a little come forth, the prepared Brimstone is heap'd on, the glasse is set into hot sand, that the Brimstone may melt and hold fast to the wick, then will this set on fire, burn with a continual flame: you may see the Lamp in any place. This is the first eternal Fire.</p>
                  <p>The latter is made thus: To a pound of decrepit Salt pour on strong Wine Vinegar; Draw it off to the consistence of oyl, put on new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let it steep, distill it as before, and do this four times. Infuse in this Vinegar glasse of Antimony finely powdered, one pound; set the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in hot ashes 6 hours in a close vessel, and draw out a red tincture; Pour off that vinegar, and pour on more, and draw it off again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the labour, untill all the colour be resolved and drawn forth. Coagulate the extractions to the consistence of oyl, and rectifie it in Balneo till it be pure: Then take the powder of <hi>Antimony,</hi> out of which the rednesse was drawn, and make fine flower of it, put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a glasse, and pour on the rectified oyl; draw it off, and pour it on 7 times, untill the body have drank in all its oyl, and become dry. Draw out this by the spirit of wine, changed so often untill all the substance be drawn forth; distill the <hi>Menstruums</hi> collected in a Venice Viol, covering it with a five doubled paper, that the spirit coming forth, the incombustible ayr may remain in the bottom; which must be used with a Wick, as that of Brimstone before.</p>

                  <p>The Ayre doth not allwaies retain its own qualities, it is infected somtimes with hurtful things. They that go out of the Province of <hi>Peru,</hi> into <hi>Chila</hi> thorow the Mountains meet with a deadly ayr, and before the passengers perceive it, their limbs fall from their bodies, as Apples fall from Trees without any corruptions, <hi>Liburius de Origine rerum.</hi> In the Mount of <hi>Peru Pariacacca,</hi> the ayr being singular, brings them that go up, in despair of their lives. It causeth vomit so violent that the blood follows, it afflicts them most that ascend from the Sea, and not only Man but Beasts are exposed to the danger. It is held to be the highest, and most full of Snow in the World, and in three or four houres a man may passe over it. In the Mountains of <hi>Chilium,</hi> a Boy sustained himself three dayes, lying behind a multitude of Carcases, so that at last he escaped safe from the Venomous blasts. In a Book concerning the proper causes of the Elements, it is written that a wind killed the people in <hi>Hadramot.</hi> The same Authour reports that the same thing hapned in the time of King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedo,</hi> that in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way between two Mountaines at a set hour, what horseman soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver past, he fell down ready to die. The cause was not known. The foot were in the same condition, untill one <hi>Socrates</hi> by setting on high, a steel Looking-Glasse, beheld in both Mountains two Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons casting their venomous breath one at the other; and whatsoever this hit upon, died, <hi>Liban.</hi> l. <hi>cit.</hi> But the true cause of this mischief was a mineral ayr, stuft with nitrous and other metallick Spirits.

know that the Common Saltpeter is full of Spirits; it is moved dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously and forcibly if fire be put to it, and cast into water, it cools them much. But that bodies corrupt not, that we ascribe to cold, but it may be attributed to the Spirits of cold by mixture, such as are in some Thunder-bolts, for the bodies of living Creatures killed by them do not easily corrupt, and they last long, unlesse some more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cause coming, drive it out.</p>

                  <p>THe Pestilence comes from putrefaction of the ayr: which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of divers constitutions is divers.

It lasted so long somtimes at <hi>Tholouse,</hi> and in that Province, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued seven years. It perseveres so long, and oftimes, amongst the Northern people, and rageth so cruelly, that it depopulates whole Countries; <hi>Scaliger, exercit,</hi> 32. It is observed in the Southern parts, that it goes toward the Sun setting, and scarse ever but in winter, and lasts but three months at most. In the year 1524, it so raged at <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> that new baked bread set into the ayr but one night, was not only musty, but was full of Worms, those that were well, died in 6, or 8, hours; <hi>Cardan de rer. varietat. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 45. In the year 1500 it destroyed 30000 at London, somtimes 300000 at <hi>Constantinople</hi>; and as many in the Cities of the Vandalls, all the autumne thorow. In <hi>Petrarchs</hi> dayes, it was so strong in <hi>Italy,</hi> that of 1000 Men scarse ten remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Alsted in Chronolog.</hi> But that in divers Countries it works so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously on some men and severall Creatures, that proceeds from the force of the active causes, and the disposition of the passive. <hi>Forest. l.</hi> 6. <hi>observ. de Febre.</hi> If the active cause from the uncleanness of the Earth or water be not strong, it only affects those beasts that are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for such a venome; but if it be violent, it ceazeth on Mankind; yet so that of its own nature, it would leave neither Countrey, not Cittie, nor Village, nor Town free. This layes hold on men in one place only. But if the active force be from a superiour cause, or be from the ayr, corrupted below, Mankind alone are endangered by it. But if both a superiour and an inferiour cause concur, then may all living Creatures be infected with the <hi>Plague,</hi> yet it must be according to the disposition of their bodies.</p>

                  <p>NO man almost is ignorant, but that the Ayr serves for the Life of man; for the branches of <hi>arteria venosa,</hi> drink in blood from the whole Lungs, brought to them by the <hi>arteria venosa,</hi> and it is made more pure in them. The Ayr drawn in at the mouth is mingled with the blood, and this mixture is carried to the left ventricle of the heart, to be made spirituous blood; <hi>Ludovi: du Gardin Anatom: c.</hi> 40. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn in heaps it strangles, <hi>Zwinger, Physiol. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 23. For if you compasse a burning Candle in the open ayr, with wine from above, you put it out; because it cannot attract the Ayr prepared on each side, by reason the wine is betwixt, and it cannot from below draw the crude and unprepared Ayr. The desaphoretick force of it will appear in an Egg; when that is new, a pure spirit sweats through its shell, whilest it rosts, like unto dew. What will this do in the body of man? It will make that full of chinks, if it be touched by a small heat: otherwise it fills and penetrates all things. It pierceth thorow a brick, and there it inflates the concocted lime, so that the quantity of it is increased till it break it.</p>

                  <p>SO much for Ayr: Now followes the Element of Water. And first we shall consider the quantity, and the colour of it. In the Country of the great <hi>Cham,</hi> near the City <hi>Simqui,</hi> there is the River <hi>Quian,</hi> which is 10 miles broad; and waters 200 Cities, and it is so long, that it cannot be sailed in 100 dayes. <hi>Polus</hi> writes, That he told in the Haven of it 50000 Ships.

                  <p>THere is no lesse variety of Waters in their tastes: Some are sweet, some taste like wine: you shall find every where, salt, Allom tasted, sharp bitter waters every where. The Waters of <hi>Eleus, Chocops,</hi> Rivers, are sweet: The Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> drank of them, and transported them to far Countries. The water of <hi>Cardia</hi> in a field called <hi>Albus,</hi> is sweeter then warm milk. <hi>Pausanias.</hi> So is <hi>Vinosa</hi> near <hi>Paphlagonia</hi>; whence so many strangers come thither to drink of it. In the bosome of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, where it turns to <hi>Aquileia</hi>; there are 7.

                     <hi>Artic. 7.</hi> Of some Floods or Waters; and of the Universall Deluge.</head>
                  <p>THe Floods were signs of Gods anger, and so much the more as that was greater, and mens sins more grievous. The greatest was that we call the generall Deluge, which began about the end of the year of the World, 1656. All the bars of the Channels were broken, and for 40 dayes a vaste quantity of water was poured down. Also the Fountains of the great Deep were cut asunder; so that the Waters increased continually for 150 dayes, and passed above the highest Mountains 15 Cubits. At length they abated by degrees; for after 70 dayes the tops began to appear. The Inhabitants of the New World say, they had it from their Ancestours. Those of <hi>Peru</hi> say, that all those Lands lay under waters, and that men were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except a few, who got into woodden Vessels like Ships; and having provision sufficient, they continued there, till the waters were gone: Which they knew by their dogs which they sent forth of doors; and when the dogs came in wet, they knew they were put to swim; but when they returned dry, that the waters were gone, <hi>August. Carat.</hi> But they of <hi>Mexico</hi> say, that five Suns did then shine, and that the first of them perished in the waters, and men with it, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was in the earth.</p>
                  <p>These things they have described in Pictures and Characters from their Ancestors; giving credit to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Flood, which was said to have hapned in the Island <hi>Atlantis. Lupus Gomara.</hi> But <hi>Lydiat</hi> ascribes the cause of that universal Deluge to a subterraneal fire in a hotter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, increasing the magnitude by rarefaction, so long as it could not g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Fountains of the great Deep are said to be broken open; and that a wind was sent forth after 40 dayes, and the waters were quieted. We must understand a wind from a dry Exhalation, which a subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous fire much increased, had most abundantly raised out of the deep of the Sea, which was then thrust forth of them, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the motion of the ayr that it laid hold of, together with the revolution of the Heavens, and the vehemency of the Firmament. But there were other miraculous Deluges besides this.</p>

Sea by passages under the Earth. The Sea alone is sufficient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all Springs; and when we see that it no wayes increaseth by the Rivers that run into it, it is apparent that they run to their Fountains by secret channels. But the question is, of the manner how they ascend. <hi>Socrates</hi> ascribes it to the Tossing of them; <hi>Pliny</hi> to the wind, <hi>l.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 65. <hi>Bodin, l.</hi> 2. <hi>Theatr.</hi> to the weight of the Earth dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth the water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Scaliger,</hi> to the Bulk of the Sea; others, to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours redoubled into themselves. It is a hard matter to define all things, nor is it our purpose.</p>
               <p>But because <hi>Thom: Lydiat,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Man, hath written most acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this Subject, we will set down his opinion here, contracted into a few Propositions:</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>The Rolling of the Water is not the cause of its ascending to the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Earth.</hi> For there is no cause for its tossing, and wherefore then should it not at length stand levell?</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>To be driven with the wind, is not the cause.</hi> 1. For it seems not to be raised in the Sea by a fixed Law of Nature, but by way of Tempest. 2. The Channels are winding, and should carry it rather to the sides than to the superficies. 3. If a contrary wind cannot do so much in any water, what then can the wind do here? Also if there were any receptacles for the waters forced upwards, Miners, those that dig in mines, would have found them out, as <hi>Vallesius</hi> saith.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The weight of the Earth squeesing out the water is not the Cause.</hi> For the Earth doth not lye upon the waters, but contrarily where the Conduits are not full, the lower part is not empty, but the upper part.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Nor the Bulk of the Sea. Scaliger</hi> thinks that the Waters being pressed in the channels by the Sea lying upon them, do seek to get forth. His Example is of a stone in a vessel. But two things are here assumed. 1. That the gravity is every where, the same as in the weight of a stone. 2. That a great part of the Sea water is out of its place.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Nor yet vapours redoubled into themselves, and so drawing; nor the spungy Nature of the Earth, nor the veins of the Earth, whereby the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the water may be drawn forth.</hi> For 1. attracting forces would be more fit for Champion ground, than for Mountains. 2. If they should attract, it were for that purpose that they might have the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, but from whence are there such Rivers? 3 The veins of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are no where found so full, as that reason requireth, whether it be for blood in living creatures, or for squirts.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>The water is raised out of the Caves of the Earth, to the Tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as the Sea is raised above the middle Region of the Ayr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>But this Elevation is made by the force of heat resolving the water into vapours. Aristotle</hi> himself intimates, that heat is required; but that water may be made of a vapour, there needs no cold, but a more remisse heat.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The heat of the Earth proceeds not from the heat of the Sun, namely of the Earth in its Intralls.</hi> For first, it can penetrate but two yards deep, and therefore the <hi>Troglodites</hi> make their Caves no deeper. 2. In
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52474:32"/>
the hottest Summer a woodden post, that is but one or two Inches thick is not penetrated. 3. The entralls of the Earth about 8 or 10 yards deep are found colder in Summer then in Winter.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>The Antiperistasis of the cold Ayr in the superficies of the Earth, is nothing to the purpose.</hi> 1. It is more weak than the cold of the firm Earth. 2. What ever of the Suns heat is bred within, passeth out by the pores and vanisheth. 3. It perisheth being besieged by both colds to which it bears no proportion.</p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>The heat that is in the bowells of the Earth, is from a double cause.</hi> For in the parts nearest the superficies it proceeds from the Sun beams, but in the bowels of the Earth from other causes. That passeth out by the pores of the Earth in Summer, being opened by the Sun, and therefore it vanisheth when as being removed from its original it is weaker; but in winter it is bound in by the cold. XI. <hi>The heat in the bowels of the Earth, is known by the heat of the Waters; but these are neither hot by the Sun nor from brimstone, or quicklime in the conduits, but only from a subterraneal fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not from the Sun. For. 1. That cannot penetrate so far. 2. If it were from thence it would be most in Summer. Not from brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone or quick lime, for brimstone heats not unlesse it be actually heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and quick-lime, only then when it is resolved by Water. Also the vast quantity of it would be resolved in a short time, and would make a change in the Channels. But it may be understood some ways, how it may be heated by a subterraneal fire. 1. As it is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and so the Channels being solid stone cannot derive it. 2. As it is more remote, but sends forth Vapours by pipes, as in Baths, so also not; for Vapours cannot have so great force as to make it boil. 3. That the Water may run amongst the burning fire, as in bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Channels; But here the question may be; why it doth not cast out the <hi>Bitumen,</hi> as in <hi>Samosata</hi> a City of <hi>Comagenes, Pliny</hi> saith, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 104. and 107, that a certain lake cast forth flaming mud, and fire came out at the Waters of <hi>Scantium.</hi> 4. <hi>The fourth way is the truth. Art doth some wayes imitate Nature, but in Stills the water by the force of heat, is resolved into Vapours, and the Vapours fly upwards, to the heads, where they stick, and being removed from the violent heat, they return to Water again, so also in the bowells of the Earth.</hi> XII. <hi>But Fountains that boyl, seem not to be of those Waters that run, but that stand still</hi>: Namely Wells that have formerly been opened by the quakings of the Earth, which it is no wonder that they are joyned to the Sea. In a small Island against the River <hi>Timevu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pliny l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 103. writes that there is a hot spring, that ebs and flows with the Sea. In the Gades it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Pliny, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>2. But if any of these hot springs do run<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, we must observe of them, that their Channels are so scituated, that when the Sea flowes, it comes unto them, or if it were come into them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it powreth forth the more. And so the heat of the fire will be either proportionable, and the exhalation greater, or not, and so lesse. XIII, <hi>But what Agricola writes of bituminous Waters, and that yeeld a smell, must be ascribed to their neernesse, but it vanisheth at a farther distance.</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52474:32"/>
The same is observed in artificiall distilled waters, that in time the burntness of them will vanish away. XIV. <hi>But because this fire by the shaking of the Earth can do much in the superficies, it can then do more in the place it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It can therefore stop up old Channels, open new ones, in divers caves of the Earth, without sending forth of the matter combustible, or propagation of fire, or conflict of Vapours, it can rayse new fires; from whence new Rivers may be produced, yet somtimes also it use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be extinguished, or sunk so deep, that it cannot send its force to the superficies. This is the opinion of Lydiat, which we have set down more amply; that being better known, it might be more exactly weighed.</p>

               <p>THe heat of hot Baths is diversly spoken of by Authours. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> thought it proceeded from Thunder, which is false, for the force of Thunder is pestilentiall, any man may know it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds Wine corrupt by Thunder.

               <p>Farther it may be shewed by an Example: Mingle salt-water with Clay, make of this clay or mud a ball, and hollow it within, then stop the orifice with the clay, and put in a narrow pipe into it, and put this ball to the fire; the pipe being from the fire, when the

                  <hi>Hippocrates l. de natur. human.</hi> saith, That there is in the Earth, sweet, sowr, and bitter; and in the bowels of it there are divers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and many humours, <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>de Morbis.</hi> Every thing drawes its nourishment from the Earth in which it is.

Yet there are in that earth juices, not onely for the vaporous, but also for the moyst and solid substance. Juices condensed are dissolved by waters, the moyst are mingled, Earths are dissolved, and scrapings of mettals are found. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them differs sometimes; because those that in Summer are beray'd with the Suns heat, and attenuated, are the best: In Autumn they are lesse beat upon by its beams, because he is nearer to them: so in the spring. For the Earth is opened, the waters are purified, the healthfull light of the Sun approaches: but in the Winter they are worst: for they are heavier, thicker, and more defiled with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhalations. That they suffer changes, we may learn by divers examples.</p>

For the Sea-waters by the mixture of the ground and the shores is thicker, and the Sun by its heat calls forth thinner parts, and resolves them into vapours; which being burnt with heat, and mingled with the water, cause its saltnesse. Mans body will help us in this, wherein the native heat dissolves the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test meats into the saltest humours; which being collected in the Reins; is cast forth by urine.

And true it is that <hi>Marriners</hi> in the straights of <hi>Magellan,</hi> where the South Sea is seperated from the North by a notable difference, marking diligently the Tydes of both Seas, have observed what they could not do in the vast Ocean, namely that both Seas do not begin to flow at the same time. And that it is not moved by any outward cause, not from the Heavens, nor is it brought in from the East or West, but comes from the bottom of it, and boyles out from thence; the superfluity running toward the Land variously, as the swelling is great or small, the shores high or low, and the cause that moves it from the bottom upwards, weaker or stronger. This is confirmed by the nature of the water, which casts up from the bottom whatsoever it sucks in, if it be not too heavy. Hence it comes to passe that all Seas purge themselves in the full of the Moon. Not that the attraction of the Moon is the cause of it, but because the wind that was in the interim collected in the hollow places under ground, strives to fly upwards, or being heaped up about the putrefactions of the Sea, breaks forth. <hi>Lydia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when more <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> allured by the happinesse of the place, came and dwelt amongst the Inhabitants, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, by the Commanders; he adds, by those that sayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither. Let us also hear <hi>Seneca, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>quaest. c.</hi> 31. <hi>The people that shall come after us, shall know many things we know not; many things are reserved for after ages, when we are dead and forgotten. The World is but a very small matter, unlesse every age may have something to search for.</hi> And again, <hi>quaest.</hi> 5. <hi>c. ult: Whence do I know, whether there may not be some Commander of a great Nation, now not known, that may swell with Fortun's favours, and not contain his forces within his own bounds? Whether he may not provide ships to attempt places unknown? How do I know whether this or that wind may bring Warr?</hi> Some suppose <hi>Augustus</hi> extended his Empire so far. <hi>Marianus Siculus</hi> is the Authour, that there was found in the new World, old Golden Money with the Image of <hi>Augustus</hi>; and that it was sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pope in token of fidelity, by <hi>Johannes Ruffus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Consentia.</hi> That is more wonderfull, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> write; that there is a Town in the Province of <hi>Chili,</hi> in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley called <hi>Cauten,</hi> which they name <hi>Imperiola,</hi> for this cause, because in many Houses, and Gates, they found the Spread-Eagle, as we see now a dayes in the Arms of the <hi>Roman Empire. Animlanus, l.</hi> 17. observes somthing not unlike it, that in the obeliscks of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> there were ingraven many Pictures of Birds and Beasts, also of the other World. What shall we say to these things? We say they knew them, but scarse ever travelled thither. But if those relations are true that <hi>Plato</hi> reports, of which <hi>Tertullian</hi> also speaks, <hi>Apolg. c.</hi> 39. and <hi>Marcellinus, l.</hi> 17. we add farther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the praediction of <hi>Seneca</hi> sounds rather of the British Islands in favour of <hi>Claudius.</hi> That is false which is said of <hi>Augustus,</hi> We have all the Acts of this Noble Prince; if there be any thing buried in silence, it is some mean matter; But Novelty easily gains the name of Antiquity, if there be fraud in him that forgeth it.</p>

                     <hi>AETna</hi> is a Mountain in <hi>Sicilie,</hi> hanging over the City <hi>Catana,</hi> and all the shore there; <hi>Pliny, Mela, Ptolomey, Strabo, Solinus</hi> mention it.

The other is in circumference 24 furlongs, it goes not to the bottom of the same largenesse, but the belly of it is something narrower inwardly, so long, till in the middle of it, it is hollowed with a sit mouth to cast out what the Mountain affords.

That noyse hath been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so great, that they could hear it as far as to the Hills <hi>Gemelli</hi>; the sparks were so great, that they slew burning so far as <hi>Catana,</hi> and wasted the Town with fire: somewhiles there was such plenty of Ashes driven with the winds, that they fill'd all places 100 miles;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52474:41"/>
the smoke was so thick, that it so hindred the light, that no man could see in two dayes. At sundry times the burning of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hath been after a diverse manner. <hi>Anno,</hi> 1329, <hi>on the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But after that this Torrent of fire had passed through many passages of the Mountain, it divided it self at last into three Channells, two of them ran Eastward for many days, the third ran toward <hi>Catana,</hi> which before it entred the borders of it, the vail of St. <hi>Agatha <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the North wind then blowing, plenty of them with a brimstony smell were brought as far as the Island of <hi>Malta,</hi> which is a 160 miles distant from the Hole. <hi>Amongst the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Torrents, that is reckoned, which hapned a little before our days,</hi> (they are the words of <hi>Bembus</hi> in his dialogue of <hi>Aetna</hi>) that ran as far as <hi>Catana,</hi> and wasted great part of the City by fire, and that Haven, of which Virgil writes,

                  <p>The torrents of <hi>Aetna</hi> have so filled up the Haven now, that you would say VIRGIL committed an errour to speak of a great Harbour where is none to be seen almost. <hi>Anno,</hi> 1537. on the Calends of <hi>May,</hi> all <hi>Sicily</hi> for 12 dayes together began to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, like <hi>Canon</hi> shott off frequently.

When these hideous sounds increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the third of the Ides of <hi>May,</hi> unusuall Caves were opened in <hi>Aetna,</hi> out of which so great a quantity of fiery matter was cast forth, that in four dayes it went 15, miles, and burnt down all things it met with, and run as farr as the Monastery of St. <hi>Nicolas, de. Arenis</hi> where, (leaving the Monastery untouched) it invaded <hi>Nivola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> and <hi>Monpelavium</hi> two Towns, and allmost destroy'd them. The upper hole of the Mountain, shortly after for three dayes cast out so much black ashes, that as far as <hi>Consentia</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> the Towns were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52474:42"/>
filled with ashes, and they were so scattered by the winds upon the Seas, that for 300 miles distant from <hi>Sicily,</hi> the ships were fowled by the ashes: afterwards <hi>Aetna</hi> began to rore mightily, and as it did rore the upper top of it was broken off, and swallowed in the Cave.

For the stone being melted in the Holes or Caves, and cast forth, the humour that swims on the top, is black mire running down from the Mountain, and when it growes together, it becomes as hard as a Milstone, holding the same colour, it had when it ran, and ashes are made of the burnt stones, as of burnt Wood, now as Rue is nourished with Wood-ashes, so it is credible that the Vines flourish by the ashes of <hi>Aetna.</hi> And thus far for <hi>Aetna.

               <head>CHAP. I. Of Subterraneous Exhalations.</head>
               <p>MEteors are made of Exhalations, the Sun and the rest of the Stars draw them forth; and the subterraneall fire is the worker of very many of them. We shall speak nothing of them. These are some hurtfull, some safe, as may be proved by many Examples. At the foot of the Mountain <hi>Tritulum Halveatum,</hi> there are waters you must ascend by 43 degrees; to a place of sweating, It is in length three miles, the more you are lifted up above them, the hotter you are; the more you descend into them, the cooler. Those draw flegme from the parts, and cure distillations from the head. There is a hot Bath near the hot waters that run forth of the Lake <hi>Agnanum</hi>; The ditches are covered with Turves of grasse, and stones being removed, a hot vapour is sent out, that makes them sweat that receive it. Out of <hi>Avernus</hi> a Lake of <hi>Campania,</hi> before <hi>Agrippa</hi> had cut down the Woods that covered it, and laid it open, the Exhalations were so thick that came forth, that the birds were killed that flew over it. At the Lake of <hi>Agnanum</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> there is a Mountain, in which there is a narrow Cave, it declines moderately downwards, being 8 foot long; if you touch the earth of it with your foot or hand, it feels hotter than

the rest, it choaks any living creature that is cast in by the venomous blast, deprives them of sense and motion, though you pull it out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; but cast the same presently into the next Lake, it is a wonder how it restores their life again, <hi>Camer. Cent.</hi> 7. <hi>Mirab mem.</hi> 50. In the Island <hi>Ebusus,</hi> Exhalations do so infect the ground, that if they fall upon places where Serpents are, the pestilent Creatures cannot endure them. In the great places of refreshment at <hi>Baianum</hi> there is a ditch, the water whereof sends forth such hot vapours, that wax Candles will melt, &amp; be put on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>Babylon</hi> there is a Cave also, out of which riseth such a pestilent vapour, that it kills all that draw it in. Also <hi>Pluto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> in a little hill of a Mountainous Country hath so moderate a mouth, that it can receive but one Man, but it is wonderfull deep: It is compassed about with square pales, and that so many as would compasse in half an Ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Ayr hurts not those who come to the outside of the pales, as being clear from that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when the winds blow not; If a living Creature goes in, he dies immediately. Bulls brought in fall down, and are drawn forth dead. Lastly, at <hi>Hierapolis</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> as <hi>Dio in the Life of Trajan</hi> writes, there is a den of a filthy and deadly smell; what living creature sucks it in, is destroyed by it; Only Eunuchs are free from the venom and hurt of it, <hi>Scaliger, Exerc.</hi> 277. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>

For if that sound do rarify the Ayre, (which yet spoken absolutely is false, for it neither dissipates the Clouds, that are neerer to us, nor doth it fly right upwards, but in many places it comes forth obliquely by the Windows, nor doth it come to the Cloud) it were better that only the great Guns should be shot off, and only the greatest Bells Rung. Constant observation shews that Dogs, Cats, and Goats are most obnoxious to be Thunder struck. Hence it is that if a Dog be by a man in an open field, he will be frighted and lye between his feet, <hi>Cl.

And Cats send out such Plenty of Vapours by their pores that some men have fainted at their being present, and the more noble Horses, if they be hid in the Coach, will sweat extreamly, as experience teacheth.

For the Earth drinks in no more rain than may quench its thirst, and which it may change into a dry nature, from whence comes no Exhalation of the same allowance, much goes to rain, which is no small part of it. What then shall be left for the vast winds? wherefore, inward heat is pleaded for. And truly, in Winter the Earth sends forth a smoky exhalation. In the Southern parts, Winds arise from Snow; A breath riseth from Lakes and standing Pools; and storms from the Sea, though it be calm: whence is this, but that the Earth breathes out vapours, which break forth through the depth of waters. The Chymical Instrument will shew this, which they use for bellowes, <hi>Sennert. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Epitom. c.</hi> 3. A Globe is made of Copper, that it may be fill'd with water, and then shut, a pipe with a small hole is made of one side, the Glob fill'd with water is set to the fire, and the pipe for bellowes is set to another. As the Globe growes hot, and the water rarifies, the Ayr continually breathes forth, and serves for bellows till all the water be consumed. Winds are then bred, when heat burns the moyst Earth. The Sun by drying openeth the pores, and the Ayr helps by its motion. If it rise from the Sea, the Sea at firs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THere are many kinds of Winds, which were chiefly found out by Navigation, and the operations of them according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their blasts and properties. The North-East wind drawes clowds to it. <hi>Circeius</hi> a Southern wind, hinders, that the North wind be not mingled with the smell of plants; and the force of it is so great, that it will overthrow an armed man, and lift ships up from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Ayr, and carry away Windmills with the stones, house and men, to some other place, <hi>Pliny l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 47. <hi>Gel. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 22. <hi>Olaus l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. and 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. There is a whirlwind that causeth such Tempests to those that sail out of the Country of <hi>China</hi> to <hi>Jupan,</hi> that it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to escape shipwrack. In the Country of St. <hi>Vincent</hi> it roots up Woods; in <hi>Hispaniola</hi> it will take up men and carry them a furlong. If they arise in the Island of <hi>Ormuth,</hi> they kill those they meet, with heat; and they part the flesh of those that are killed from the bones, as boyling water doth. To avoid the danger, they hide themselves in the water up to the head, <hi>Ovetan l.</hi> 6. <hi>Polus l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. Women are wonderfully prone to lust when their privities are obvious to the South wind; but the North wind is said to be fit for generation; whence it is that some believe it will raise men dying with its blast, <hi>Rhodigin l.</hi> 54. <hi>c.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>l.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Lesbos</hi> at <hi>Mytilene,</hi> when the South wind blowes, men are sick; they cough when the North-west wind blowes; the North wind makes them well again. In <hi>Tercera</hi> it eats Iron and stones, <hi>Bertius in Geograph.</hi> Amongst the rest are the <hi>Etesia,</hi> that are very moderate winds, every year two dayes after the rising of the dog-star they are wont to blow 40 dayes. They temper the heat with their blast, and cool the Summer, and defend us from the burthen of the hot moneths. They rise at 3. of the clock of the day, (thence they are called sleepy winds,) and they cease at night. It is likely they are bred by great heat, melting the Snow that yet remains in the Northern parts. It is credible, that the Earth being freed from Snow, and uncovered, they will blow the freer.</p>

For they make mighty bellowes to draw the ayr, lest they should be choked for want of it. The contest of winds doth nothing, for that rather tends to the sides, or flyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by its leightnesse; and at the first hindrance, they fly from the Earth like a whirlwind. It is uncertain whether the Sea can stop the passages, there are seldom any such great Caves by the Sea; nor can that go in at once, but it will be thrust back again: The Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not more easily exercise its force upon the Earth, and beget an Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, than he can bring it forth being begotten; for the Sun beams operate no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whilest they heat and dry, they open the same, because exhalations ascend more strongly to that place which is neer; One, in respect of continuity, followes another; but howsoever they enter in, they easily come out of the Earth, and more easily than they can shake it; for in Mines where the powder finds but a chink, when it is fired, it is lost labour.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Exhalation bred from fire under the Earth, and shut up in the bowels of the Earth, causeth an Earthquake. And that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by this.

At length a horrible Thunder bolt was seen to be cast out of it, with a wonderfull noise. <hi>Anno,</hi> 1534, the 3d day of <hi>July,</hi> in the Town <hi>Schleswich,</hi> at noon in a clear Sky, Lyons were seen in the Ayre, coming apace from divers parts to fight. An Armed Knight toke their parts, shaking his spear. There lay not far from the Knight a Mans head without a body, wearing an Emperiall Crown, a little while after a Bores bristly head was seen, and two Dragons spitting fire. Lastly there appeared the Image of one most spacious City scituate by a Lake, and it was beseiged with a Navy and Land-forces. On the top of this was a bloody Crosse, by little, and little turn'd into black. There came forth an other Knight on Horsback, burning with a fiery colour, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown on his head, a horse followed him that had no Rider. Then in a large plain there appeared two burning Forts, neer to a high Mountain, where there was a great Eagle, that hid half his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the side of the Mountain: there appeared some young Eagls, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry compleat of a white colour. Also the head of a sleeping Lyon crownd with a Crown, and a dunghill Cock with his bill beaking and digging his head, till it fell loose from his body, and vanished; the body remaining lay visible. There were other Lyons present, and by the Bores head, a Unicorn by degrees turning him self against the Dragon; and many other Creatures of extraordinary figures,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52474:51"/>
and greatnesse. The Fort upon a high rock compassed in with two Armies, burned; and the whole Country seemed full of many Towns, Forts, and Villages. But presently the whole Country where they stood was consumed with fire, and a most large Lake overwhelmed the ruines of this vast Country, nothing but the Towers appearing in that place, where that great City stood before. At the bank of this great Lake stood a Camel as if he drank.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Anno</hi> 1545, the next day after Whitsontide, these Images were seen in <hi>Silesia</hi>; A Bear led an Army well appointed from the East; an armed Lion met him with his Forces; between both Armies a most clear Star appeared, presently they met and fought stoutly, that blood seemed to drop from their wounds, and their bodies to fall down dead. As they fought, an Eagle flew from a high rock, and waved herself over the Forces of the Lion with her wings. The fight being ended, the Lion shined amongst his Armies; but there was no sign of the Bear; but they were all dead carcases, where the other Army stood, and very venerable old men with their grey heads stood by them. The battel ended, the Lion retreated with his Army to the West; and when he was gone a little forward, a certain Souldier riding on a white horse very well adorn'd, return'd from the Forces to the place of the fight; and upon that horse he set a young Souldier that stood there in Armour; and accompanying him riding toward the East, he vanished with the rest of the Apparitions. But what speak I of old things? our Age hath seen wonderful things, euen this year. For in 1627. two Armies were seen to fight in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> the Northern Apparition became Victor. A fiery beam followed this, <hi>Mercurius Gallobelgicus.</hi> But <hi>Anno</hi> 1629, in March, in <hi>Misnia</hi> two Armies met in the lower Region of the Ayr, they were so framed out of the Clowd, that their faces and countenances might be seen. The lesser Army got the victory, and put the greater to flight.

               <p>
                  <hi>PIssaphaltum</hi> is Bitumen that Pitch is boyled with. <hi>Bauhinus</hi> thinks, it is <hi>Mummy</hi> of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> But this is of two sorts, naturall, and artificiall, that they embalmed with, consisting of Myrrhe and Aloes. But of the materials, and the manner how to embalm, we shall speak of them here, as we come to fall upon them: <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi> and <hi>Herodotus l.</hi> 3. are large concerning it. Three men perform this work. The first is called a Grammarian, who as the body lyes on the ground, appoints how great the incision shall be about the small guts on the left side. The other is the Cutter, and he opens the side with an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> stone, and then suddenly runs away; for those that stand by detesting the fact, pursue him with stones. Then follow the Embalmers. One of these drawes his incision through the inside of the body, besides the Heart and Kidneys; Another washeth it with <hi>Phoenician</hi> wine mingled with spices. Lastly, they anoint the body washed with Unguents of Cedar, and other pretious things for 30. dayes. Then it is delivered to the kindred that mourn for him; the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52474:55"/>
hairs of his eye-lids and eye-brows being preserved, that he may seem to be asleep. <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks of three kinds of embalming; The first was by pulling the brains through the Nostrills with a hook, and the bowels taken forth with an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> stone, they cleanse it with <hi>Phoenician</hi> wine, and stuffe it with spices, then they fill the fat pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle with Myrrhe, Cassia and sweet odours beaten, without Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense, and sew them in, then they salt it for 70 dayes; then they wash the Corps, and wrap it in a linnen cloth, and smeer it with Gum, and lay it into the fashion of a Man made of wood. The other is, by salting it 70 dayes, which drawes forth the inward filth. The third way is, the poor cleanse the belly with washing, then for 70 dayes they dry it with salt, and then they lay it up. And not onely men have been so honoured, but beasts also. For some beasts were sacred to the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; and when they were dead, they covered them with a linnen cloth, and spread them with salt, striking their breasts, and howling. And to preserve the body the longer, they anointed it with oyl of Ceder, and kept it in hallowed places. Also they put divers Idols into the brest of it. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> found in the breast of one of them 20 leaves of ancient Paper, written with <hi>Arabian</hi> letters, <hi>Bauhin. ad l.</hi> 1. <hi>Dioscor. c.</hi> 85. Moreover, the <hi>French</hi> commend Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my so much, that the Nobility will never be without it. They say, that <hi>Francis</hi> the 1. alwayes carried it in his purse, fearing no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if he had but a little of that by him.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Moors</hi> write, that Camphir is a Gum of a Tree, that spreads out its boughes so far, that 100 men may stand under the shadow of it. They adde, that the wood is white, reedy, and hath the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir in its spungy pith. That's uncertain, but it is more certain, that it is made of a kind of Bitumen; thus, The <hi>Indian</hi> Bitumen, which springs from the native Camphir, is boyled in a vessel with fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, the thinner parts turn into a white colour, and are carried to the cover, which gives them the form we see, when they are collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Merchants say, there is native Camphir in the <hi>Indies.</hi> It is so near to fire, that once fired, it will burn all out. The flame that comes from it, is bright and smells sweet.

It is more certain, that it is a thick juice of the Earth. The most part is found in <hi>Borussia,</hi> also in <hi>Curlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> on the part of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> but not so plentiful. It is taken in nets like fish. When the North-west or West wind blowes hard at Sea, they all run to the shore, with casting nets of yarn in their hands, <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col. in l. de Fossil.</hi> The winds being allayed, but the Sea flowing, when the waves return back, they draw the Amber from the bottom; and an herb like pennyroyall, that growes in it. When they have taken it, they carry it to the Magistrates, who give them the weight of it in salt. Every Moneth it is said to be sold for ten thousand <hi>German</hi> Crowns.

If you make a fine powder of chaff, and iron, the Amber draws forth the chaff, the Loadstone the iron. In the shore at <hi>Puceca,</hi> of former times, they digged up some of ash colour; which when it was broken with iron, it drew unto it leaves that were upon the ground, and two foot from it, when they were blown up into the Ayr: The white smells the best; Because of the Plague, Chambers are perfumed with the scrapings of it, the sent lasts for 3. dayes; every thin piece of it burnt in fire, flames away.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. Of the Loadstone.</head>
               <p>THe Loadstone is well known: The effects of it are admirable, two are special, its turning to the poles of the World, and its dawing of another Loadstone and Iron. As for the first, in many places it doth nor exactly respect the poles, the Declination is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more or lesse. This age observeth, that for 10 degrees beyond the fortunate Islands, where <hi>Cosmographers</hi> have set the beginning of Longitude, it concurs with the poles of the World; toward the East it varies more: About <hi>Norimberg,</hi> they count 10 degrees, in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> 16, in <hi>Zembla</hi> 17, as the Dutch observed; but one <hi>Gilbertus</hi> hath found out 23 degrees variation. Whence we collect the greatest varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be 23 degrees. If we ask the cause, the learned are of divers opinions, some say there are certain Mountains of Loadstones under the poles, and they say the Loadstone moves by sympathy. Others write that it turns to certain Starrs. Others say there are in it two opposite points, whereof the one turns to the North, the other to the South. Others think, that it moves toward the South, because the operation of all the Planets is Southward. They all seem to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. How great and what kind of Mountains these are, is yet unknown, and there are many Mines of it in Aegypt. It doth not directly point at the Pole, unlesse it stand in the Meridian. The point that is toward the South, is held the stronger. The work-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters gives us a notable Maxime, when in the finger of the Marriners Chart, they rub that part of the neidle with the Loadstone, wherewith it turns to the South. Lastly there are opposite places, wherein the Eccliptick declines from the Aequator toward the North, and the Planets from the East make their motions by the North. It seems
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52474:58"/>
most probable, <hi>Sennert, l.</hi> 5. <hi>scient. natural. c.</hi> 4. that the Loadstone moves toward the South pole, either only, or if it hath two motions, the greatest is Southward. Let it suffice what <hi>Scaliger</hi> writes <hi>Exerc.</hi> 131. <hi>Nature,</hi> saith he, is at concord, and agrees with her self, she unites by an admirable order, all things above and below, that it may be one by a perpetual necessity. So that there are in things seperated not only steps, entrances, and retreats, but also minglings of those things which seem to be wholly parted. <hi>Bodinus</hi> pronounceth that all the 4, parts of the world are equally respected by the Loadstone <hi>Theatr. natur. l.</hi> 2. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>the steel needle easily rubbed upon the Loadstone, from that part of the Loadstone that pointed North before it was cut out of the rock, if the needle be equally ballanced, the end rubbed with the Loadstone will turn to the North. The same force there is to the South part, if he needle be rubbed on the South part of the Loadstone. Nor is the force lesse for the East or West part of the Loadstone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though the stone cannot turn it self to the Poles of the world, but only the steel needle that is touched with it. But this I have said cannot be understood, but by experience: for if you put a peice of Loadstone upon a peice of Wood swimming in the water, and you apply that side of the Loadstone that looked Southward before it was cut out of the Rock to the side of another Lodstone that looked Southward also, before it was hewen forth, the stone that swims will fly unto the opposite part of the Vessel with water; but if you turn the Northern part of the Loadstone, to the Southern part of another Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone swimming in the water, the Loadstone that swims presently comes and joyns with it, so that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> both unite by an admirable harmony of nature; though the Wood or the Vessell of water be between. The same will be done, if you put only an iron Needle, thrust through a quil into a Vessell of water, and hold in your hand a peice of a Loadstone, one side of the Loadstone will drive off the needle, the other will draw it.</hi> So saith <hi>Bodin.</hi> What concerns drawing: that the Loadstone doth draw, is maintained of the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Loadstone; <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 36. <hi>c.</hi> 16. experience hath proved it; <hi>Libavius.</hi> I, saith he, <hi>when I proved this, wiped off all dust from the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and then I scraped away some powder of its own substance, this was laid upon a paper or plank of wood, and the powder scraped from it was laid under it, the Loadstone moved and attracted.</hi> The Loadstone draws the Loadstone, by a certain line, because there is a spirit in it like to the other, and nature enclines and is carried to its like, as much as may be. It is as certain, that it draws Iron also. <hi>The hardnesse of Iron gives way, and obeys; and that matter which tames all things, runs to I know not what empty thing, and as it comes nearer it stands still, and is held and sticks in imbraceings, Plin. l.</hi> 36. <hi>c.</hi> 26. The vertue of it was found out, when the nails of his shoos and top of his crook stuck fast, for the first inventor was a Heyward. Nor doth it draw Iron on each part with the same force. The rule seems to be a right line. Therefore where the vertue comes not, the ends are turned, and whilst one of them inclines to the needle, the other accidentally turns from it, and seems to reject it. The same reason serves for divers Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones. In the <hi>Midland</hi> Seas of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> at the foot of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that part, they bend Eastward; they say there is a Loadstone that draws Iron, but on the opposite part, one that drives it off, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52474:58"/>
therefore it is called <hi>Theamedes, Plin. l.</hi> 2. Wherefore do we go to Mountaines? We may see it in every laboratory, if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive <hi>Libavius, Syntagm, Art. Chymic. Tract.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 19. There are opposite parts in one and the same stone contrary to the rest: and it hath an example of sympathy and antipathy in it self; as Vipers, Scorpions and venemous Creatures have in themselves both their friends and their enemies. I shall set down some examples of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. <hi>Severus Milevitanus</hi> saw, when <hi>Bathanarius,</hi> heretofore governour of <hi>Africa,</hi> put Silver under between the Stone and the Iron; the Iron on the top moved, and the Silver was in the middle, and suffered nothing but with a most swift retrait, the Man drew the stone downward, and the stone drew the Iron upward. <hi>August de civitat. Dei lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> In <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> at the roof of the Temple of <hi>Serapus,</hi> there was a Loadstone fastned in, which held an Idol that had an Iron in the head so fast, that it hung between the roof and the ground; <hi>Euseb</hi> in <hi>Histor. Eccles. Agricola</hi> said, he saw a round look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glasse, that was three hands breadth broad, and two high; in the concave part whereof there was a Loadstone, included above, (<hi>Agricola de subter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n</hi>) that drew an Iron boul placed at the bottom of the glasse unto it self, so that the thick body of the glasse could not hinder the force of it; the Iron Globe that useth to fall down, was carried up. Let us come to the cause, and inquire whence comes this force in the Loadstone. Each man speaks diversly, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men allmost so many opinions. <hi>Libav. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Bitum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c.</hi> 12, saith that there is a bituminous nature in the Loadstone, reduced to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Iron, by a similitude of sympathy and mixture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the same principles grow in Iron. And he adds, that there is an Iron bituminous spirit common to them both, but it flows not out continually, and as strong from Iron as from the Loadstone, by reason of the diversity of coagulation or commis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion; Others attribute that to the hidden forme: Others alleage a mutual harmony of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things. There are in the great world, saith <hi>Langius, l.</hi> 2. <hi>Epist.</hi> 55, under the concave of the Moon, some things that by a secret consent agree wonderfully together. The truth is, the Loadstone is some kind of vein of Iron, and Iron may be generated of it: <hi>Sennert. l.</hi> 8. <hi>Epit. c.</hi> 4. But the Loadstone loseth its attractive force, if you work it in the fire: For whilest it burns, the brimstony spirit of it flyes forth, as <hi>Libav. l.</hi> 2. <hi>singul.</hi> thinks. We saw, saith <hi>Porta (Mag. natur. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 7.) with great delight, the Loadstone buried in burning Coles, to cast forth a blew brimstony Iron kind of flame, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dispersed, the quality of its life departed, and it lost its power to attract. It yields to the injuries of the weather, and dies with old age. The expiring of it, is hindred by oyntments rub'd upon it, and the tenacious juice of Leeks; others add, oyle of Bricks. <hi>Lem. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>de occult.

There is also a stone found like a new Moon, cloathed with Armour of a golden colour. <hi>Haephestites,</hi> represents the nature of a glasse, and in the Sun it will fire dry matter. At <hi>Salfelda</hi> in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> there is a stone dug forth of a pit 20 fathom deep; it is like a firm breast, a foot and half long, three hands breadth; on the former part where the ribs end, it is six fingers thick, on the hinder part where the whirlbones are pierced through the middle, but three; the back-bone was empty, where it should represent the marrow.

               <p>THe Eagle stone is found in divers Countries; In the Country of <hi>Misenus,</hi> then especially, when great rains fall. It smells like a Violet, by the Mosse sticking upon it. It hath in it little stones, that being loose and shaken, make a noise: They commonly stick to <hi>Misenus</hi>; some have earth with them, as at <hi>Hildesham,</hi> and some gold, as those of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> That which hath a little stone in its belly, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> say, if it be bound to the left arm of a woman great with Child, through which an Artery runs from the Heart, toward the ring-finger, next to the little finger, it will hold the Child in the womb that is ready to miscarry; bound to the left thigh of one in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it will so help her, that she shall be delivered without pain: but so soon as she is delivered, it must be taken off, that the Matrix follow not. As it fell out with the Wife of a Citizen of <hi>Valencia, Francis. valeriola l.</hi> 1. <hi>observ.</hi> 10.

                  <hi>Enhydros</hi> hath water within it; It is perfectly round, it is white and smooth, but it flotes when it is shaken. There is liquour in it like as in an Egg. Also liquid Bitumen, sometimes that smells sweet, is found in stones shut up as in vessels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Touch-stone</hi> is that stone they prove gold by: In <hi>Theophrastus</hi>'s dayes they were onely found in <hi>Tmolus</hi>; but at this day in the Rivers of <hi>Hildesham,</hi> and <hi>Gosselar.</hi> The parts of them that are found looking toward the Sun, are the best for tryall; the worst look toward the Earth, those are the dryest: but these are hindred by their moysture that they cannot take the colour of gold or silver.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pumex stone</hi> is found in places that have been burnt, baked out of the earth, or stone: because it hath holes, in which the light ayr flotes; and because it is without moysture, it burns not. They that have charge of Wines put it into a vessel of boyling new Wine, and it presently gives off boyling. Drunkards that strive for mastery in drinking, arm themselves with the powder of it; but unlesse they drink abundantly, they are in danger, saith <hi>Theophrastus.</hi>

               <p>WEe have done with Minerals thus far. Now follow Metals. First, Gold: This is found in its proper vein, and in stones that are of shining white; also in the true Pyrite, and sometimes in stones of iron. In <hi>Spain</hi> some pieces have been found weighing above ten pound weight. It is plough'd up in <hi>Galitia, Justin. l.</hi> 44. <hi>Dubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> writes, that in the Mountains of the <hi>Gelovienses,</hi> a masse of ten pounds was taken out of a Rock; and he saith, it was presented to King <hi>Wenceslaus.</hi> In <hi>India</hi> the Pismires (which in <hi>Aegypt</hi> are as great as Wolves) do carry it and keep it. In the Islands of the Sea of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> the plenty of it is so great, that the Inhabitants have bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd a Talent for horses, <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 36.

drawn about it, the Hen swallowed this pearl with the ear-jewel; when</hi> 4. <hi>or</hi> 5. <hi>hours were past, the Pearl and Jewel were mist. A certain Maid thought the Hen had swallowed it; because some dayes before the said Hen had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed one, the</hi> Italians <hi>call</hi> Gazetta. <hi>Wherefore, the hen was killed, and presently her Gisard being parted and cut, we found the pearel with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet passed into the cavity of the stomach, but contained in the orifice thereof; extream hot, and yielding to the touch like wax, and the ornaments of it almost consumed by the heat thereof, which Jewel in a short space, when it grew cold, and the heat was gon, became hard, as it was before; the forme was spoiled, and when it was weighed with another caring like it, it wanted a third part in weight.</hi> But to return to Gold. No Mettal is drawn out further, or can be more divided: for one ounce of it will be hammer'd into 750 and more leaves, of 4. fingers broad and long, <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 33. <hi>c.</hi> 3. That it may be wire-drawn, and spun without silk, I need not approve of; The Luxury of the Age is well known. <hi>Pliny</hi> lived, when <hi>Agrippina,</hi> as <hi>Claudius,</hi> made a shew of a Sea-sight, sate by him, clothed in a robe of woven gold, without any other addition. Now though it consumes not in the fire, yet it is resolved Chymically, and becomes so aërial, that if it be but stirred with an iron Spatula, or grow hot any other way, it will presently take fire and make a great noise; and one scruple of it shall work more forcibly than half a pound of Gun-powder, <hi>Crollius cited by Sennert. c.</hi> 18. <hi>de Consens. et dissens. Chymicor.</hi> A few grains of it if they flye down perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, can strike through a Table of wood, <hi>Quercetan.</hi> The cause is, the contrariety of the spirit of Nitre, and the brimstone of gold: for when as oyl or salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> is poured into the solution of gold, the salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> unites it self with common salt, and also with Allum, and Ammoniac; and hence it is, that gold left to it self sinks to the bottom; and if any of these salts is left with the gold, it is washed off with hot water, <hi>Sennertus de consens. et dissens. Chymic, et Galen. c.</hi> 19. onely the spirit of Nitre is left, which perfectly unites with the Gold. If that therefore grow hot, so soon as it perceives that the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of gold is there present, it opposeth it self against its Enemy, and breaks forth with a mighty noise, in flame. It hath been long disputed, whether it can be made potable; experience shews that it may. For that famous man Dr. <hi>Francis Antony,</hi> Physitian of <hi>London,</hi> brought it into a consistence like honey, and sent certain portions of it to the Physitians of <hi>Germany</hi> to try it, <hi>Johan.

               <p>
                  <hi>ANdreas Libavius,</hi> a Man exceedingly deserving in Philosophy and Physick, saith, that it was reported on the credit of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venses Schroterori,</hi> that at the rampire of <hi>Erfurd,</hi> by the port of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> upon occasion of raising the Bulwark higher, that great pieces of raw flesh were dug out of ground, and that it was brawny; much like to Oxe-flesh, (only it had no bones): <hi>Hubnerus</hi> affirms this in <hi>Epistol. ad Libavium.</hi> But because those that dug it up prated that they could find it only upon Thursdays, wise men began to suspect the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and having discovered the fraud, the deceivers were cast into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Though fraud here may be objected; yet it is not against reason to say with <hi>Libavius,</hi> that there may be fossil flesh. Most true it is that the Earth, (I add the water also) is the Mother of some living Creatures, and of those imperfect ones that came by aequivocall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and by the mixture of both these, Clay may be made fit for the breeding of an animall principle, which somtimes becomes a perfect Creature, and somtimes is deficient. As in the kinds of perfect Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, somtimes rude lumps are bred, somtimes provided with that supplies their defect. If that be first, and yet, helps being present, it is not frustrated of its motion, it is likely that a Mole of clotted blood or somthing like flesh should be made: no otherwise than as matter disposed with it for a bone, becomes a bone, which is called Fossil Horn. So Histories relate, that shell fish have been found in the tops of the highest Mountaines of sand, from Marle and Marble putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: which though some think they are the reliques of the General flood, yet is it not probable, that they could last so long, by reason of the injury of time. For Marble it self will at last dissolve. And if you think it absurd that a Creature with blood should proceed from matter that is without blood; I could by examples shew your absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. When <hi>Nilus</hi> sinks down, living Creatures are bred of the mud by heat of the Sun, some perfect, some half perfect, sticking to the Clods, <hi>Diodor. Sicul.</hi> A Venemous frog is bred deep within the Earth, where you can see no holes, when as the futures of stones are broken with wedges, <hi>Agricola.</hi> Of the rayning of blood and flesh there are many Histories, and that came not by the Sun, drawing blood from Carkeises, but by changing the humour so disposed. In

a ditch of the Town <hi>Beichelstein</hi> beneath out of a Willow, stinking blood ran. At <hi>Spira</hi> they say it came forth of bread. At <hi>Suidnicium,</hi> a bloody Fleece of Snow fell down like hail. What shall I say more? The Chymists say that of <hi>Satyrium,</hi> great Comfrey, Tutsan, Bread and Wine, a juyce may be made that is perfectly blood, which by due digestions may be made into substantial flesh. Of Brimstone boyled in Linseed Oyle, they make a Masse like a Liver. Lastly the fowls in the Orcades are said to be fruits of Trees. You shall see it proved in the appendix of the sixth Classis. Wherefore we conclude with <hi>Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> that there may be Fossil Flesh; and with this discourse we will shut up this Classis. Setting aside those things that may be said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Devill in Mettalls, which we shall speak of in our <hi>Thaumato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphia Pneumatica,</hi> which if God pleaseth, we intend to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</p>
               <p>I add one thing that I had forgot. When <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. King of <hi>France</hi> was at <hi>Bononia,</hi> there was brought to him from the <hi>East Indies</hi> by an unknown person, but, as it appeared by his gesture, a <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fellow,</hi> a stone of a wonderfull shape and nature, for it shone with light and clearnesse exceedingly, and it seemed as if it were all on fire, and turn it which way you would, the lustre of it so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned the ayre with its beams, that they could hardly endure to look upon it: And this was strange in it, that it could endure no earth upon it, but if it were covered with it, it would break forth with violence of its own accord: no art of man could hold it in a narrow place, for it delighted in the spacious Ayre, it was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pure and bright, no filth was upon it, it had no certain figure, but was inconstant, and changed in a moment; and being so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to behold, yet it was not safe to touch it, and those that dealt roughly with it to hold it, felt the inconvenience, as many that stod by can testify. If any part were broken off from it, by contending with it, for it was not very hard, yet the vertue of it was very usefull for many things, and the Stranger said it was needfull chiefly for Kings. He boasted much of the miracle, but refused to discover it, unlesse he might first receive a mighty reward. <hi>Thuan</hi> saith, that he delivered these things as they were in Leters of <hi>John Pipin</hi> an eye witnesse of it: who in the Family of <hi>A. Mamorantius, M. E.</hi> professed Physick, and sent his Leters to <hi>Antony Mizaldus</hi> a famous Physitian; also, to <hi>Bononia,</hi> on the day before Ascension day, and saith, he leaves the matter to Philosophers to discusse farther. For <hi>Pipinus</hi> in his Letters, neither said that the Antient knew any such stone, nor do I affirm it. <hi>Thuan, l.</hi> 5. <hi>Histor.</hi>

               <p>WEe have seen the Wonders of things without life; Now let us see the Wonders of living Creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Plants</hi> are first in order; not that they are the chief, but because they have that degree in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all living Creatures. They have a vegetative soul, producing the nutritive, augmenting, and generative faculties, with all things subordinate to them. And besides, each hath a specificall form of its own being, works by it, and is distinguished from others. Nature hath made up their bodies of certain parts, which Philosophers call the kernel, the pith, the bark of the root, the stock, the boughes, the branches, the flowers, the fruit. As these vary, so is there very great difference in Plants. The Earth is their Mother, their faculty was given by creation; and because qualities are different, it is found ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry various in Plants also. <hi>Moses</hi> speaks expresly, <hi>Let the Earth bring forth grasse, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in it self upon the Earth.</hi> But <hi>Porta (l.</hi> 2. <hi>Phytogn. c.</hi> 1.) when he had heaped up much ground together, which was cast forth from the foundations of houses, and laid it open to the Ayr; a few dayes after, from the divers qualities of the Earth, divers sorts of herbs sprang forth. He saw these things familiarly in <hi>Naples</hi> climat

and grounds, some of them must needs marry. The principles of Male and Female are mingled in them. But that which <hi>Pliny</hi> writes is false, that they are begot by the West wind. They wither that fructifie most, for their nourishment is consumed; and beyond St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Island, the South wind onely is said to blow, elsewhere onely two winds by courses: And it is certain, that all kinds of Plants do not grow in all places. For near <hi>Rome</hi> Chestnuts will hardly grow: and about <hi>Cimmerian Bosphorus,</hi> in the City <hi>Particapaeum.</hi> King <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> and the rest of the Inhabitants wanted the Bay and Myrtill Tree in their solemnities. Some new Plants are found in new-found pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as Tobacco lately in <hi>America,</hi> wild Tobacco was found in the Woods of <hi>Thuringia, Libavius l.</hi> 4. <hi>de orig. rerum. Anaxagoras</hi> ascribes it to the ayr that hath in it the seeds of all things, and sends them down in showrs, and they become Plants. <hi>Diogenes,</hi> to the waters putrifying and mingled with the earth. Others to the winds, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. We ascribe them, to Divine providence, which did not produce each individual plant, but disposed of the best in Paradise, and left the rest without, endowing some with virtues to come forth into the light at their set times. As for their Life, they live by heat in the earth, and dye with cold. <hi>Theophrastus l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Plant. c.</hi> 4. testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that some of them will spring again; if an Olive Tree be burned to the root, it will grow again: Some will live without the ground, as Onions and Garlick, which being many moneths from the Earth, grow without any nutriment from thence, being fortified by much grosse humour of their own, <hi>Marcel. l.</hi> 4. <hi>histor. medic. mir. c.</hi> 12. The forces of Plants are wonderful. It hath been observed, that if men with wands travel where ill Plants grow, the Ulcers will be inflamed, and cured where the Plants are healthful, <hi>Mathiol. in Dioscor. Praefat.</hi> By touching of Spleenwort, Splenetick people have been helped; and Jaundy-sick, by putting Celandine to their naked feet in their shooes. No man shall be troubled with blear-eyes, so long as he keeps very clean by him the root of the wild sowr Dock. He shall not be troubled with the Strangury any more, who quencheth in his urine the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing root of Tamarisk. Physitians do diversly dispose them; the Chymists teach us to know them by their signatures; and <hi>Porta</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> thinks, that it is certain, that what part of Man they resemble that they are good for, <hi>Sennert. de cons. Chym. c.</hi> 18. But of these, more hereafter if God please. Now let us see Nature prodigall in Plants, and opening her Treasures, let us admire with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>

               <p>WOrmwood is in many things a wonderful Plant, it is very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet the distilled water of it is sweet. Hence the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators on <hi>Mesues</hi> think, that the intrinsecal parts are sweet: but the matter must be ascribed to the thinnesse of the outward parts; for these being soluble into a vapour, being more attenuated by heat of the fire, are easily resolved, and abate of their bitternesse, <hi>Mathiolus in Dioscor. c.</hi> 24. The Lye out of which the salt of it is prepared, will so benum the hands, that they almost lose their feeling, <hi>Mathiol. de febrib. pest.</hi> It is credible, that if Infants before they be 12 weeks old, be anointed with the juice of Wormwood on their hands and feet, that neither heat nor cold will ever trouble them during their life: and if the whole body be anointed, they shall never be scabby, <hi>Guerth. in Append. ad memorab. Mizaldi. Wolfsbane</hi> is the quickest of all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous things; for if it touch but the secrets of a woman, it kills her the same day. This was the poyson, that <hi>Mar: Coecilius</hi> objected, that <hi>Calphurnius Bestia</hi> killed his Wives with, when they were asleep: hence it is that he so sharply declamed against him, that they dyed by his hand. Yet experience teacheth, that this may be made use of for mans good, and against the bitings of Scorpions, given in hot wine, the nature of it is to kill Man, unlesse it find some venome in him to be destroyed. Scorpions are stun'd by the touch of it; and being asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, shew by their palenesse that they are subdued. White Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore helps them by its resolving touch, and <hi>Wolfsbane</hi> yields to two evils, to that which is evil to it self, and to all others, <hi>Pliny.</hi> But <hi>Snapdragon</hi> is so contrary to them, that the sight of it stuns them: but whilest some by this Amulet hope to procure Princes favours, they are deceived, <hi>Mathiol: in l.</hi> 4. <hi>Dioscor. c.</hi> 128.</p>

               <p>THey say that the female <hi>Palm-Trees</hi> will bring forth nothing without the Males, which is confirmed when a wood growes up of its own accord; so about the Males, many females will grow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining toward them, and wagging their boughes. But the male with branches standing up as it were hairy, doth marry them, by the blowing on them, and by standing near them on the same ground, <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 4. When the Male is cut up, the females are in widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and are barren. Hence in <hi>Egypt</hi> they so plant them, that the wind may carry the dust from the Male to the Female, but if they be far off, they bind them together with a cord <hi>Pontanus</hi> reports, that two Palm-Trees, one set at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> the other at <hi>Hydruntum</hi> were barren, till they were grown up to look one upon the other, and though it were so great a distance, yet they both did bear fruit. <hi>Dalechamp. ad lib. cit.</hi> Poets write thus of them:

They cut it 2. foot above the ground to draw forth the juice. They let it run into Earthen vessels for their daily drink; and to make it keep, they cast in a little salt.

               <p>THere are many kinds of <hi>Nightshade</hi>: amongst these are Winter Cherries, the sleepy Nightshade, the greater and the spungy Nightshade; they seem to have some strange things in them. <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacabum</hi> is such an enemy to Vipers, that if the root be near them they die with deep sleep. <hi>Vesicarium</hi> hath long leafs, white flowers, out of which come forth green round bladders, with six divisions long waies, the seed within is murry colour, as great as <hi>Orobus</hi>; in the side of it is the figure as it were of a mans heart, with a white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Nature framed it so, that we might know it was good for the diseases of it. Sleepy Nightshade, tasted causeth sleep: the <hi>Danes</hi> found that, by their example. For when by <hi>Sueno</hi> King of <hi>Norway</hi> besieged <hi>Duncanus</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the Town of <hi>Perth</hi>; He calling forth <hi>Maccabaeus</hi> his Cousin-german, began to treat of surrendring up the place, and provision, <hi>Hector.

Ten of them suspecting the gifts of Enemies were safe. These carried King <hi>Sueno</hi> like one that was dead, in a Fishers Boat to the mouth of <hi>Thais,</hi> and so home. The root of the greater Nightshade dryed, if half a dram of it be steeped in wine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes, it will so infect it, that if any one shall drink it strain'd, he can eat nothing; let him drink vinegar and it is presently gone, but if you take it too largely, it will strangle you. <hi>Franciscus Calce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For when they cut the Tree, where the liquor runs forth, or when they gather it, they neither come at Funerals nor their Wives.

                  <hi>XAqua</hi> is a Tree in <hi>Hispaniola</hi>; The fruit is like to Poppie, and a clear white water runs forth of it, and whatsoever is sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it, grows like black, so that no washing will make it clean. In 20 dayes it parts from the rind, of it self. <hi>Ovetan Summ. c.</hi> 77. There are two kinds of <hi>Zuccarum,</hi> one from Canes, another from an hearb; There is another kind from an Indian Tree, called <hi>Haeoscer, Scalig. Exerc.</hi> 164. But this is scarce <hi>Sugar,</hi> but the thinner part of milk compacted by heat, which falling forth of the buds and roots of the leaves, thickneth into a gum. They say the fruit is like to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels Testicles; Out of any part of the Tree cut, Milk runs forth so hot, that it is held for the best meanes to take off haire. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants make their skins smooth with this. There are two kinds of the true one is got out of Canes two ways, for either it is pressed out and boyl'd to the whitenesse of Sugar; or it comes forth of it self from the reeds, like teares. From the <hi>Indies</hi> formerly they sent it, so gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their other Merchandise. That which is called Sugar-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was carried about, in reeds. Histories testify, it was made natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. For at <hi>Dathecala</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> it is sold for Merchandise. In St. <hi>Thomas Island,</hi> the reeds yeeld it every Month. In the fifth Month they are ripe, and are cut down, and are grund and pressed for the juyce: what remaines is given to Fowle and Hogs, and it will fat them wonderfully, and it will make them so tender and delicate, that no hens flesh can be better, for those that are sick, to feed on. Another kind of Sugar, sweats-out wonderfull strangely. The <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Aegyptians</hi> call it <hi>Tigala.</hi> They say a little Worm doth eate the hearb; whence Sugar swells forth, and grows together in little peices. It quencheth thirst, is good for the Chest, and takes away a Cough.</p>

Truly besides what we have said, there are many wonderfull things. In the Island <hi>Tylos,</hi> there are Trees that beare Wool, and their fruit is guords, as big as Quinces: these breaking when they are ripe, shew balls of Down or Cotton, of which they make pretious linnen garments, <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 10 In great <hi>Java</hi> they say there is a rare Tree, whose pith is Iron: it is very small, yet runs from the top to the bottom of the Plant.

They have on both sides like two little feet; pressed, they yeeld no liquor. If you touch them, they flye from you. One of them kept 8, dayes in a dish lived, and moved so oft as one touched it; <hi>Scalig.

The same Authour says that there is a certain Tree that is full of faire sweet flowers all night, but so soon as the Sun riseth, it withers: yet whatsoever this is, it may be ascribed to the tenuity of the Spirits of it. But <hi>Linschot</hi> saith, there is one that is contrary to this. In <hi>Virginia</hi> there is an hearb that the leaves are good Silk, and they take it off like a thin shining Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane.

Not far from <hi>Malacca</hi> there is another, that hath many roots, and as they divide severally into parts, so are they of different vertues.

When the young ones are hatcht, she holds them in her Talons against the Sun; and having proved them to be legitimate, she takes them on her wings and carries them; the

strongest of them, when she hath them aloft, she lets them fall, and then she flies and meets them, and takes them up again. When they are old enough, she drives them forth of her nest and quarter. The female is so falacious, that being trod 30 times in a day, if the male come to her again, she will run to him. It is so quick-sighted, that flying over the Sea, out of mans view, it will discern the smallest fish: And as for its smell, it will flie to carcases 500 miles distant. It roars like a Bull; but the young ones are mute, because their tongue is hindred by moisture. It is an enemy to the Cranes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they fly over Mount <hi>Taurus</hi> from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> they take stones in their mouthes, and stop their clarying, and flye over it in the night. When the sight, bill, and wings fail her, she flyes above the Clowds, and there by the Suns heat she recovers her sight. She when she is become extream hot, plunges into the water, then she flies to her nest, grows feavorish, casts her feathers, is fed by her young ones, and renews her self; but sooner, if she can find Serpents to feed on.</p>

               <p>THere is a bird in <hi>Britanny</hi> that the English call, <hi>Barnacles,</hi> and <hi>Brant Geese,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> call them <hi>Clakguse</hi>; It is lesse than a wild Goose, the breast is somwhat black, the rest As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For some say it breeds from rotten wood, some from Apples, some of fruit that is like to heaps of leaves; which when, at the time appointed, it falls into the water that is under it, it revives and becomes a living Creature. It grows in the Isle <hi>Pomonia</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> toward the North. And of this opinion is <hi>Isidore, Alexander ab Alexandro, Olaus Magnus, Gesner, Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and others; contrarily <hi>Albertus,</hi> and those that are of his mind, hold that they breed by copulation. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> from their own experience in <hi>Greenland,</hi> affirm they found some <hi>Barnacles</hi> sitting on egs, and had young ones. But these things may agree together, for things bred of corruption may have eggs, and that seems also most clear that <hi>Boetius</hi> hath written concerning them. That every man may perceive they are not fabulous, I shall set it down. <hi>Now it remains that we speak of those Geese which they call Clak-Geese; and which commonly they think amisse, to be bred upon Trees in these Islands, of which we were for a long time very inquisitive, and have found by experience. For I think the Sea between, is the greater cause of their generation than any thing else. For things are bred in the Sea variously; as we have observed. For if you throw wood into the Sea, in time Worms breed in it, that by degrees have a head, feet, wings; and lastly, feathers. Lastly they are as great as Geese, when they are full grown, they flye upward as other birds do, using their wings to carry them through the ayre, which is as clear as day, and was seen in the yeare from the Virgins conception,</hi> 1490, <hi>Many looking on.

tell him this strange news. The Governour came, and bid them Saw the Log in sunder; then they saw an infinite sort of living Creatures that were partly Worms, some not formed, others were, and were partly birds; and some of them were callow, some had feathers. Wondring at the miracle, at the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours command, they carried that Log into the Church of St.</hi> Andrew <hi>at Tira where it yet remaines full of Worm holes as it was. The like to this two yeares after, was brought into</hi> Tham <hi>by the tide, to</hi> Bruthe Castle; <hi>many ran to see it, which again, two yeares after at</hi> Leith <hi>in the Harbour, all</hi> Edenburgh <hi>came to see.

But it may be some man will cavill at it, and say, that there is such a vertue in the boughs and stocks of Trees that grow in those Islands; and that the</hi> Christopher <hi>it self was made of the wood, growing in those</hi> Hebrides: <hi>wherefore I shall willingly declare what I saw</hi> 7, <hi>yeares since.

In <hi>Moravia</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Scotland</hi> there is a Lake called <hi>Spina,</hi> it is noted for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Swans. For therein there growes a certain herb whose seed they feed greedily on; and therefore it is called Swans meat. The nature of that herb is, that cast into water it will never putrifie. Hence it is, that though the Lake be extended about five miles, and was wont, as men remember, to abound with Fish and Salmons; since that began to spring up, it hath increased by degrees, and hath made that Lake fordable, and that men cannot swim in it; nor is there any more any great Fish therein, <hi>Boetius in descript. Scotiae.</hi> The internal constitution of Swans is wonderfull, <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> dissected them. The Intestines were 14. spans and a hand breadth long; and many of them were covered with fat inwardly, as thick as ones thumb, which served instead of a caul; which being not intricate with many windings and turnings, but onely by a single revolution are turned back into themselves inwardly, with a middle rundle, perchance some of the nutriment might passe by nor distributed; but nature, to help this inconvenience, hath fastened two blind guts; a hands breadth between the <hi>anus</hi> and their beginning: the right intestine passing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, which should make amends for the windings of the guts that are deficient. The gullet is of a wonderfull structure. For the sharp artery that accompanies the wesand under it, descending to the throat, when it comes there, doth not tend directly to the Lungs as in other Creatures, but is elevated above the chanel bones, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted into a rib of the breast-bone, or Sternon. And this rib is not made of one single bone, but of two side ones, and a third from above, made for a covering to lye upon these; and it is like a scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd or sheath, and serves for the same use. When the Artery comes to the end of it, it is bent backwards beneath like a Serpent in fashion of the letter S; and by and by it goes forth again beneath the foresaid part of this covering that was placed above it, and ascending to the middle of the channel bones, it leans upon their coupling as on a prop; and being so upheld, it is again bent backwards like a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and going under the hollow of the Thorax, before it comes to the lungs, it makes as it were another Larynx, cut athwart, and with a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52474:96"/>
little bone as long as this is broad, and which is covered with a thin membrane; it represents a hollow pipe, or an Organ pipe, in figure and composition, which are open in the neather part of them with the like fissure. Under this Larynx the artery is parted into two channels, each of which in the middle are stretched out wider, and stick forth, and are distributed, going directly to the very small Lungs, that are wholly fastned to the sides behind. This is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull composition, and it serves for the breathing and voyce. For when in the bottom of Lakes she seeks for her food, she needed a long neck, lest by long continuance she should be in danger to be suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by such an Artery. And indeed whilest for half an hour almost she thrusts down her head into the water, she takes breath by that part of the Artery which is open in the sheath we spake of in the breast. As for its singing, some say she sings before her death, and some deny it. <hi>Oppianus</hi> saith, she sings early before Sun rising; but as she is very near her death, she sings on the Sea-shores, but not so loud in her old age. The West wind, he adds, is observed by them when they sing, when they are feeble and their strength is spent. The fashion of their sharp artery seems to make good this opinion.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Storks</hi> of old time about <hi>Fidena,</hi> neither made any nests, nor fed their young ones. Also at the Lake <hi>Larius</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> beyond <hi>Poe,</hi> a pleasant place with small Trees, they are hardly seen, <hi>Pliny,</hi> The Author of the book of Nature writes, that they neither come into, nor will inhabit a City in <hi>Germany</hi> where no tythes are paid. They are travelling birds; but it is a question whether all or not. Many as if they were dead, were drawn forth in Fishers nets, and these were joyned together, and had their bills thrust into their <hi>anus,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and being hot in Minerall waters they lived again.

They are very chaste and gratefull. One of them in upper <hi>Vesalia</hi> bade his Host farewel when he departed, and when he return'd, he saluted him again. And not content with a vocall gratitude, he brought him a root of green Ginger. Another pickt out the Eyes of one that lay with his Hostesse when his Host was abroad.

birds eggs, are first conceived above, where the partition is, where first it is seen to be faint and white, as <hi>Aristot.</hi> writes; than red and bloody; and as it increaseth, it becomes all yellow; but as it more increaseth, it is distinguished, so that the yellow part is inward, and the white goes outwardly about it; when it is perfect, it is finished and comes forth of the shell, soft at first hatching, but presently it growes hard. The place of its perfection is the Matrix it self into which they fall, <hi>Aldrovand. l.</hi> 14. <hi>Ornithol.</hi> Some report also, that a <hi>Cock</hi> layes an egge when he is 9. or 14. years old; and they suppose it proceeds from seed putrified, or ill humours concurring together.

                  <hi>SWallowes</hi> are found almost in all Countries.

                     <l>As when cold Snow and Frost, like feathers, fall</l>
                     <l>On Trees, the Winter-Swallowes die withall.</l>
                  </q>
Where they live in Winter, is diversly described. It is certain, that in hollow Trees lying many close together, they preserve themselves by mutual heat. But <hi>Olaus Mag. Episcop. Upsalensis,</hi> saith, That in the Northern parts where men dye of cold in winter, the Swallowes live in the water. Though, saith he, many Writers of Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories affirm, that <hi>Swallowes</hi> change their stations, that is, do go to hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Countries in Winter; yet in the Northern parts, <hi>Swallowes</hi> are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten drawn forth by Fishermen by accident, like a congealed Mass, and they have united themselves together, bill to bill, foot to foot, wing to wing; after the beginning of Autumn, to go amongst the reeds, &amp;c. When that masse is drawn forth and put into a hot-house, the <hi>Swallowes</hi> are thawed by heat coming to them, and so begin to fly; but they last but a very short time, because they are not made free, but captives, by being taken too soon. In <hi>Egypt</hi> their wonderfull Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is seen: For in the mouth of <hi>Heraclia</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> they make such an impregnable Mount with their nests continued together against the overflowing of wandring <hi>Nilus,</hi> for a furlong in length, that it is thought no man could do as much, <hi>Pliny.</hi> In the same <hi>Egypt</hi> near the Town <hi>Coptus,</hi> they say there is an Island consecrated to <hi>Isis</hi>; which that the same River may not demolish, they fence by labour, in Spring-time, making firm the mouth of it with straw and stubble, for 3. nights together, labouring so hard, that many dye of it. Their young ones are bred blind, if we believe the Philosopher, and <hi>Pliny</hi>: when they receive their sight but slowly, they hasten it by putting Celandine upon it. Their copulation is wonderful: For when the rest of Birds are trod by the old ones, <hi>Swallowes</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> couple a contrary way, <hi>Gesner.

               <p>WHen one shall read; that there is a place in the World, where Geese grow on Trees like Apples; perchance he will be doubtfull concerning the truth of it, and question the Authour. And if any man shall say, that living Creatures are bred, not onely of one, but of divers kinds, from Trees and vegetables, that part will fly; and part will not fly; h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> will have enough to do to make good what he sayes, if he would not be accounted a Lyar. Yet I think, it may be easily proved by what we have said already, where we have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, from experience, that Gnats are bred in Okes, and mosse of Okes; and Worms are bred in other Trees and Vegetables; which, though they be small creatures, yet are they reckoned in the number of living creatures, because they feel and move: Yet I should not affirm the first as the words sound. For Birds make their nests some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Trees, hedges, bryars and other vegetables; but that they grow there like pears, is incredible. There is one of the <hi>Canary</hi> Islands called <hi>Ferro,</hi> where is a Fountain of sweet water concealed (and there is none besides in the whole Island) in some Trees by a wonderfull Indulgence of Nature; the leaves do draw abundantly water out of the Earth or Ayr: which they drop down for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to drink. For should they want this boon, no men nor Cattell could live there; for there are no Fountains; but the Ocean or salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water runs round about it. The great bounty of God hath afforded water to those, to whom it is denyed in other considerations. As in <hi>Egypt</hi> where there never falls any rain, <hi>Nilus</hi> overflowes to supply that defect; and other Countries have other gifts given them. So also is this bird afforded to the Isles of the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places, which is found no where else. Yet should any man look to find him growing on the Trees, he might wander all the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52474:106"/>
Woods over and find none, nor yet do Pyrats amongst the <hi>Ferrenses</hi> find water, but are forced to leave the Country for want of it, nor can they find it in the Trees Concerning this bird that is no Fable, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned Authors have written, making mention of it also in their other works, as <hi>Hieron. Card. de varietat. rer. c.</hi> 36. <hi>Du Bartas, in his Weeks, the</hi> 6<hi>th day, and</hi> 1 <hi>day of his</hi> 2 <hi>week.</hi> But they all do not agree of the places and manner of its generation. <hi>Munster</hi> saith, the <hi>Orcades</hi> are full of these birds, <hi>Gyraldus</hi> speaks of <hi>Ireland, Dubartus</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> which he calls <hi>Luturnen,</hi> as also <hi>Mela</hi> writes. <hi>Hector Boetius, relates the same things of the Hebrides. A French man understands it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part of the Hesperian Sea. He saith, a certaine bird i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> bred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cock or Hen, but only from some vegetable, namely in</hi> Scotland <hi>from the Trees of that Country. Also ships made of the same Trees, when they are in the middle of the Sea, produce the same fowls. The</hi> French <hi>call them Marquerol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le; it is good to eat.</hi> Plutarch <hi>makes mention of the same bird, in a Treatise that begins, Whether an Egge were first or a Hen? The</hi> Scotch <hi>call them Klek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues.</hi> Others write of them thus. In the <hi>Orcades Island,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> there is a Tree by the Sea side, and on the banks of Rivers, that beares fruit not unlike to Ducks, and when it is ripe it falls down into the water, and swims away alive, and becomes a bird; if it fall on the the ground it corrupts. Others call them <hi>Barnacles.</hi> As also in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Theatre of the World, they are ascribed to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and are thus deciphered. There are also here Birds called <hi>Barnacles</hi> growing by nature contrary to Natures order, not unlike to Ducks, but only they are lesse. For from wood of Masts for Ships, first comes forth some kind of Gum, then with weed (or Sea grass calld'd Wier) some shell-fish sticks to those kinds of wood together with the pitch, which in time get wings and become Birds, and fly or fall into the waters, and swim. I have often seen (saith <hi>Silvester</hi>) abundance of these Tree-Ducks hanging on the Wood, inclosed in shells till they could fly. They lay no eggs as other Birds do, nor are they bred of eggs. In some places they eate these Birds for Fish, and not for Flesh. <hi>Hector Boetius</hi> tells the same History of a Bird, he calls <hi>Cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is.</hi> For, saith he, if you cast Wood into the Sea, about the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> in time Worms will breed in it, that eate that Woodhollow, and afterwards become Birds, and are like to Geese, flying. Hee ascribes the generation of them to the Sea, called by <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> the Father of all things. But these different descriptions of Authors do neither agree amongst themselves, nor in all things with the truth it selfe. For the place, some say it is the <hi>Orchades</hi>; others <hi>Ireland</hi>; others the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> others <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all this may be true, since in the Ocean between <hi>Scotland</hi> and the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrides,</hi> they are said to breed in both places. For it is no small extent of place where they are, but all that compasse of the Sea in the outmost bounds of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> For the name, there is no difference; for divers Nations use di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers names. But whether that faculty be to be ascribed to the Woods or Trees of those Countries, or to Worms that breed from those Trees, and are changed into Shell-Fish, is worth Enquiry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52474:106"/>
forementioned Authours were of so various opinions. But we shall consent with none of them. For were this vertue in the Wood, why should not the same kind of Wood, used for Masts, have the same fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in all places; yet that is not so, nor do Ships made of that Woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they be cut down and turn'd to other uses, and cast into the Sea, to corrupt and grow rotten, that is, that they may dye as it were, as to their first being, and be turned into the common matter of Wood; then begins this new generation of living Creatures by the influence of the Heavens, and the Suns heat co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They that think that Worms may become fowls, do not in my Judgment, speak what is probable. For how should a shell-fish come of a Worm, yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand me so, that what I deny of each by themselves, I would grant of all together. But because I know this not by heare-say, but I have seen above 50, (almost hundreds) of these shell-fish, and when they were opened, I have seen little young Birds coming forth as out of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> egge, with all their parts necessary for flight, and I have had them in my hands, I must not omit here to set down an exact description of them, and this it is. If perhaps some pieces of Masts of Ships smeer'd with pitch fall into those Seas in the outmost parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor far from the <hi>Orcades</hi> or <hi>Hebrides,</hi> and lye there a long time; they not only grow rotten and full of Worms, but are covered all over with Sea weeds, for of such grass there is abundance there, which cleaves to any Wood easily, especially if it send forth a pitchy fatnesse as Masts that are fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re or pitch Trees, and are full of pitchy Rosin; and then for Ships occasions are again besmeerd with the same, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the sayls may suddenly be noised up and pulled down, and stay no where. Now the Sea breeds those weeds at the bottom neere the shore, that are longer or shorter, and these at certain times swim on the top of the water, being moved or pull'd up, as it were, by the waves. This, bred in the water, doth not easily corrupt, having much of a salt nature in it: wherefore in North <hi>Holland,</hi> and many other places they make of those weeds a strong fence against the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Sea, so that they fetch a remedy from the disease, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these weeds hanging round about the said pieces of Masts insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themselves into the rotten places; and in time on the other side
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52474:107"/>
of each grass will grow small shell-fish, which are whitish or of the colour of a Mans nayls, and in forme, hollownesse, and long fashion, like to the nayle of a mans little finger; whereof if two be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that they may stick well, the upper parts being the sharpest, they take hold of the ends of the weeds, and are fast shut in the broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parts, which afterwards open, that the fruit may come out to flye. Thus a thousand at least of these shell fish are fastned to the weeds at the ends, which as I said are fastned to the pitcht Wood, with the other end, in such plenty, that the Wood can hardly be seen: yet those weeds do hardly exceed 12 fingers breadth in length, and are so strong as thongs of leather: somtimes they are longer, and are some-feet-long. This is the whole external description; For you can see nothing but a piece of a Mast full of rotten holes, and Sea Weeds thrust into them, having at the other end shell-fish, like to the nayle of a Mans little finger. But if these shells be opened, those small Birds appeare, like chickens in eggs, with a beck, eys, feet, wings, down of their feathers beginning, and all the other parts of callow Birds. As the young Birds grow, so do the shells or covers of them, as they do in all other Oysters, Muscles, shell-fish, snails, and the like carriers of their houses. It may be asked how they get their food? I answer as other <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ophyta</hi> do; partly from the sweeter part of the water, or else as shell fish that breed pearls, and Oysters do, from the dew, and rayn; partly, from the pitchy fat of the rotten Wood, or the resinous substance of Pitch or Rosin. For these by the intermediant grass, as by umbilical Veins, do yeeld nutriment to these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so long as that Wood is carried by the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, hither and thither. For were it on the dry land, it would never bring forth the said shell fish. An example of this, we have in places neere the Sea, where those shell fish are taken alwaies with black shells, sticking to Wood put into the water, as also to the woodden foundations of bridges, and to Ships that have been sunk. And they stick either to the wood, by some threds like to hayrs, or Mosse, or else by Sea Weeds; whence it is evident that some clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my moysture is afforded to shell-fish sticking to any Wood whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though it be Oke, but much more to firre Wood, full of Rosin, whereof Masts of Ships are made: For this Wood is hotter than Oke, and hath much aeriall clamminesse, and therefore takes fire suddenly and when it is wounded, while it is green, it sends forth an oily Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, but when it is dry, it will easily corrupt under water; but the Oke will not, because it is of a cold and dry nature. It longer resists corruption, and under water grows almost as hard as a stone.</p>

Hence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the great fruitfulnesse of the Sea, which doth exceed the Land in breeding of living Creatures, and vegetable animals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Antients observing, they ascribed to Neptune, who was god of the Sea, great multitudes of Children begotten from divers Concubines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> call'd Sea-Nymphs; amongst these, were <hi>Tryton</hi> and <hi>Protheus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he, sounding a shell-fish, is his Father Neptunes Trumpeter; but this, is changed into various forms, as into fire, a Serpent, and such like; clearly teaching, that the Sea breeds divers forms.</p>
               <p>These causes seemed to move them who ascrib'd the generation of these Birds in the <hi>Orcades</hi> to the Sea alone, as being the Authour of fruitfulnesse, and of diversity of Creatures. But how rightly they did that, shall be seen. We deny not, but that many pretty shell-fishes are bred of the Sea, onely from the influence of omnipotent nature; so that the Ocean affords the place and matter of them, but not the form and the cause efficient. All the fish, except a few, are bred of the seed of other fish, naturally; and here can be no question of these. Yet we may doubt whether so many kinds of shell-fish do breed from the seed of other shell-fish. It is manifest of the foresaid Bird, that it breeds neither from an egge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as other birds do, nor yet from seed. Whence then? From the Ocean? or must the cause be imputed to the Ocean? Not at all. For though the place be said to generate the thing placed, yet that is understood of the matrices that are the cause of generation, <hi>sine quâ non</hi>: but not the efficient cause, much lesse the formal material and final, and not concerning every generall thing containing. But to search out more exactly the nature of this wonderfull Bird, we will run over those four kinds of causes, not doubting, but having searched out these as we ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what, why, and from whence it is, will easily be resolved. The Efficient cause therefore of this generation, is external heat, such as the Sun sends forth into sublunary bodies; as also in the internal hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

For without heat nature produceth no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but useth heat as her chief Instrument, whereby homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous things are congregated, and heterogeneous are parted; the parts and bowels are formed in living Creatures, and are disposed in their orders and figures. In Artificiall things that men make, they use divers Instruments, as their Hands, which may be call'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Instruments, Hammers, Anvils, Files, Sawes, Wimbles, and the like. In natural things, there is onely Heat as the efficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52474:108"/>
heat brings the internal into Action: Without which, this would be uneffectual, and shut up in the matter as dead; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in some living creatures, which when Winter comes, and the outward heat fails, they are as it were asleep, and lye as dead, as Swallows, Frogs, Flies, and such like: But so soon as the Sun beams heat the water and the earth, presently these little Creatures revive; as owing their lives to the Suns heat. And as the heat is greater, so is the efficacy thereof, and their flying about and crying; as we see in Flies and Frogs. As for heat, the Sun, the great light of the World, is the Father of it; which it sends upon all earthly creatures, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning and enlivening them. Hence men say, that the Sun and Man beget a man; namely, by the intermediate seed. Otherwise it proceeds of another fashion, when without those mediums, in things are bred of putrefaction, as we said before. For when the solar or elemental heat incloseth any mixt body, wherein natural heat is included; this is raised up by that, is moved and stirred to perform its operations; as appears in the hatching of eggs by artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall heat of Furnaces, or natural heat of the hens. For in the yolks there is a hidden naturall heat, that is stirred by the external heat; so that, by circulation of the Elements, Water is turn'd to Ayr; Ayr into Fire; Fire into Earth; Earth into Water, and the Chickens limbs and entrals are formed and made by natural heat, which is the principal internal Agent. The Material cause in the generation of this Tree-Goose, is that clammy matter of the wood of Firre, or the Rosin and Pitchy substance of it, upon which the outward Suns heat doth work; and the internal heat increased in the corrupt matter. This matter though it be small, yet may well afford the first rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to this <hi>Embryo,</hi> which is afterwards nourished by the clammy substance of the Ocean, as Oysters and other shell-fish grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; for neither the hard substance of the wood, nor yet the weeds affords any matter for it; for the one is observed to be the container, and the other the conveyer of the true matter. For as in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man, neither the Matrix, nor the umbilical vein do afford any matter, but are required as necessary instruments; so must we judge here, of the wood, and the Sea-weeds. Some will have it, that from the worm bred in the rotten wood, there should be made some transmutation, and that the worm doth afford the first matter for this generation; yet that opinion is false, for that Worm cannot come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orth to the end of the weeds, nor can it make shell-fish, but that must breed at the end of the weeds; nor doth it come thither from any other place, that it can go from place to place by an animall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before it receive its essential form. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that the Fish <hi>Pinnothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> is so cunning, that he will hide himself in the Oyster; and as he growes, he will go into such as are greater; but to imagine any such thing of that Worm that eats into the wood, is against the nature of it. But it is no doubt, but that the rosinous and pitchy matter may communicate something to the end of the weeds, which yet nature must do by a way we cannot perceive; as nature useth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52474:108"/>
in all other generations such wayes and means that we can better think and judge of by reason, than see with our eyes. For who can see how the heart in the generation of living Creatures is first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? What fibres and veins nature useth there for her Instruments; how and by what means this is done; and when it is done, how she disposeth of the other bowels, and makes them of a seminall and menstruall matter: There was never man yet found so quick-sighted, that he could see these things whilest they were doing; but when they are done, reason can discern them. So no man could yet say, how this matter, that was first radical moysture in the wood, could passe to the ends of those Sea weeds, and should be formed there; yet it is plain afterwards, that so it was made. Nor will that be so hard, for the matter to passe through the grasse to the end of them, as to passe without any medium.</p>
               <p>But the greater difficulty is, and most worthy to know, the Formal or seminall cause of this wonderfull birth; which since it is nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in seeds; for here are none to be found; it must needs enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, otherwise than in other kinds of generations. For the seeds of both Sexes in living Creatures which are mixt together in copulation, are as it were the sheaths and cases of the forming sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall faculty; which forms the prae-existent matter of the seed or blood into an essentiall form fit for that kind, that the seeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto, howsoever they are mingled or drawn forth into act. That force of nature is a blessing given to her in the creation, in the word <hi>increase</hi>; which word was never idle, nor shall be whilest the world endures: God spake, and all that God said were made very good, containing in themselves principles to multiply their own kinds by; because individualls must perish. The Heaven with its Stars shall last from the beginning to the end, and the entire Elements, Ayr, Water, and Earth. But things compounded of them, as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, so they are restored again by multiplication of seed, not the same in number, but in kind; not by external form, but by that form which is internall and essential. But since that God gave this Commission for propagation to the sublunary World, and this alwaies proceeds by mediums; though in the production of these <hi>Barnacles</hi> there are no visible seeds, whereby the matter may receive its form; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is consonant to Reason and to Nature, that the form must come from some other place into the matter, lest any thing should seem since the Creation to be made of nothing, contrary to Gods will. For nothing is the cause of it selfe, or forms it self, but only the eternal and infinite God. All other things indeed were made by him of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but not by themselves, nor are they propagated of nothing, nor from themselves, but from means appointed by Nature. <hi>Plato</hi> sets universal <hi>Ideas</hi> of every species of things subject to generation, fixed in a certain place from whence a formative force descends, to beget and make all individualls to be made. This opinion is pleasant but not true. For there can be no universal substances (save in the conceptions of Mens minds) but only individuals, that cannot give
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52474:109"/>
what they have not, and what they do give, they cannot alwaies hold themselves. Nature is in all things as in individuals, dispersed all over, which yet operates in each individual according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that every one of them requires, which is true in all things that have seeds, for those are the very subjects and vessells that nature works upon. But the question now is, how that faculty is imprinted on the seeds, and from whence? whether from nature? If this be true, then of every matter she makes what she will, when as she can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print what forme she please on any matter. And then, how can na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this <hi>Barnacle,</hi> that hath no seed visible presupposed, proceed to generation; and in other such like things bred of meer putrefaction. As in man there is an imagination and cogitative force, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a subtile Artifice of Images conceived in the brai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arising first from the outward senses, and so proceeding to the inward parts of the brain, by a locall motion; yet without any changing of the place, only by calling to remembrance things at the greatest distance, which were seen long before, or were done, or thought of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So in the Sun, the Heavens, the fixed Starrs, there is a kind of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginative vertue; not passive as in animals, but purely active, which by locall motion comes thence into sublutary bodies, and is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to certaine subjects, as to seeds of individualls. And this is the form that first begins and increaseth all generation, communicating the essence to every thing, that it shall be such a thing, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This force is the first moveable, frameing its subject, as an Architect, and one that frames her self a house, where to dwell, that she governs to that end that Nature the artificer assigns it. That is the spermatick faculty, that resides in the body of the seed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which this is barren and vain, nor doth promote any generation. If this by time vanish, or by breaking the Container of it; there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no fructification, as appeares in Corn, which if it grow old, or be ground to meale, it can propagate no more. Or why doth this power reside in that body rather than in another, and perisheth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently afterwards? I answer, there is no other reason to be given, than that Nature rejoyceth in such means, and hath included that vertue that it cannot flye away, if it be obedient unto nature, vvhich if she would, she could have put into other subjects. It is admirable, that the animal spirits in men are contained in the nerves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>aseth on the foot or arme, which is by and by removed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits succeeding into the nerves. After the same manner, that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native vertue of the heavenly bodies, especially of the Sun, if it passe into the individual subjects or seeds of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in them at the will and pleasure of nature. But where there are no seeds, there the same vertue of the Heavens is communicated to some certaine matter immediately: as, in this generation, to this fat and clammy subject, of which we spake before, as to the material cause. For there are two things in all seeds, the Elementary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52474:109"/>
and the celestiall forme, the latter whereof may perish, the matter and externall forme remaining entire, but nothing of that was generated out of the matter, when the celestial forme is lost. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this generation is in time before the forme, and receives it by influence, though it be not deprived of any forme it had. I speak of the first matter, but the subsequent forme, if it do not take away the first forme, yet it perfects it. But it is a question, Wherefore this formal force (as for example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in making a bird) is not sent into every matter, or into any whatsomever, when as it is received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out certaine vessells, or bodies of seeds? I answer; that matter, so prepared in such wood and not in another, and in such a place and not in another, supplies the place of a seminal body; whose qualities not being in another, therefore noe other subject is capable of that formal and determinate vertue. There are examples every where of this Imagination, or celestiall Influence, namely in some places of the County of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> where Mines of Brasse in a stone that may be cut, do shew forth all kinds of Fishes; and the forms of such as are in the next Lake, as we may see Teeth; Horns; and Lyons to perfection, formed by nature under ground in hollow Caves and other places. In Amber also, which by the Sea Waves is cast on the shores of the Island, now call'd <hi>Sudovia</hi> in <hi>Borussa</hi>; divers forms of flyes gnats, spiders, butterflies, frogs, lizards, and other Creatures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; not really, but only from the imaginative faculty of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens imprinted in it. For if you should cut the Amber or break it to find them, the places would be empty, which nature hath so sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her selfe upon; yet are all their parts and particles so shadowed to the life, that a man would sweare, that such Creatures are really included in that matter, perchance wrapt in when the gum was moyst. But it is no such matter: for there is no earthly matter, and which is not transparent, that is contain'd in those concave figures, which yet ought to be otherwise, since a corporal substance cannot vanish away, and only the forme of it remaine. Moreover if any such living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had fallen into the gummy substance of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as into Rosin or Turpentine, their wings or feet that are besmeer'd would be seen so, and not extended entire, and direct, which is not so here; but all seem entire as through a Crystall glasse. Farther, if that should fall from Trees into the water, those Trees would be known. <hi>Pliny l.</hi> 37. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3, <hi>writes of Amber thus,</hi> Pitheus (saith he) <hi>discovered to the Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones, borderers on Germany, an arme of the Sea called</hi> Mentonomon, <hi>for the space of</hi> 6000 <hi>furlongs; from this the Island</hi> Abulus <hi>is a days sailing; from thence Amber is carried by the Waves of the Sea, and it is the purging of the Sea congealed. The inhabitants use it for wood to burn, and sell it to the</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes <hi>their neighbours.</hi> Timoeus <hi>beleived this, but he called the Island</hi> Baltia. <hi>Mithridates saith, there is an Island in the shores of</hi> Germany, <hi>and it is called</hi> Osericta <hi>that is full of a kind of Cedar Trees, from thence it runs to the Rocks. But certaine it is, that it breeds in some Islands of the North Sea, and the Germans call it Glessum; and therefore our Country men call one of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52474:110"/>
those Islands,</hi> Glessaria; <hi>When</hi> Germanicus Caesar <hi>was there with his Navy, the</hi> Barbarians <hi>called it</hi> Austravia. <hi>It is brought by the Germans, especially into the Country of</hi> Pannonia: <hi>Thence the</hi> Venetians <hi>first, whom the</hi> Geeeks <hi>call</hi> Heneti, <hi>spread the fame of it, they receiving that from</hi> Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <hi>about the</hi> Adriatick <hi>Sea. That shore of Germany is about</hi> 600 <hi>miles from</hi> Carnuntum <hi>of</hi> Panonia, <hi>from whence it is brought, being but lately discovered. A</hi> Roman <hi>Knight, sent by</hi> Julian <hi>to trafique for this, who took care of the fencing sports of</hi> Nero Caesar, <hi>passed over all those shores, where these Merchandises were, and saw such abundance brought in, that the nets that were set to keep off wild beasts from the Galleries, were full of knots of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but the weapons, and biers, and the whole provision for one day was made of Amber. He brought a great weight or clot of it, that weighed</hi> 13, <hi>pounds. Pliny.</hi> In Amber, as it is transparent, that incorporeal figure doth easily appeare; but not so in other dark bodies. Nor yet in the matter of the wood we speak of; In which not only the figure of a bird, but also a spermatick natural force to forme it, nourish, and augment it, and to preserve it in its vital functions, is implanted, as in other birds. But since it is not propagated, <hi>ex traduce,</hi> from an egg or seed, it neither leaves egg nor seed, nor gives more to another than nature gave to it. For if it lay'd eggs, that chickens might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from, the Barnacle had been so bred her self; but neither of these is so. For as a Mule is not bred of a Mule, but from the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Asse and Mare together, so it doth not generate a Mule, but continues alwaies Barren, as this bird doth. Bees are bred of Worms, the Worms in the honey combs from honey, by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full operation of nature, though without any sensible body of seed, yet not without virtuall seed imprinted on the Honey-Combs by the Bees, which they first had from Heaven.</p>
               <p>Nor is it possible, that these effectual and spiritual qualities should proceed from the pure Elements, or onely by propagation; since the matter of the seed, which is made of nutriment and blood, could be extended in <hi>infinitum</hi> without diminution of it self. For we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that the Elements are but like dead and materiall receptacles of the formal vertues, and that the matter of the seed is dayly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and heaped up by the Elements. And therefore it is necessary that the formative force, should daily flow into the formed seeds; or, where they are wanting, into a matter prepared by Nature from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or other operations. <hi>From whence the form of this wonderfull Creature is easily drawn, namely, that it is an imaginative vertue of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, or of the Sun, actively infused into a viscous matter of that wood in those places, so disposed by corruption, that it may enliven it, and promote it to be a new kind of living plant, or bird included in a shell; which so soon as it falls into the waters may swim, and when the wings are grown, fly about.</hi> The final cause is the common ornament of the World, the variety and wonderfull works of Nature, the profit of those that dwell near, and especially the providence, omnipotence, and clemency of our good and great God, all whose attributes do appear to mankind as
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52474:110"/>
well from this creature, as from the rest, whilest he crowns the year with his free gifts, and the whole earth with variety of Creatures. So that he is far more mighty in creating and making different kinds of living Creatures, than we are able to expresse them, to nominate or to know them. Let it suffice us, that we have seen some part of the wonderfull works of God, and taken a view of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is not possible for a mortall Man to be capable to apprehend them all; yet to consider of none of them, were brutish; and we should, so, be more like unto Beasts than Men.</p>

They will cause Hens eggs to grow addle, and Cattel to miscarry. A man had a wound in his Arme: that, after 12 yeares that he was bitten, became sore again, and he died in two days. <hi>Albert.</hi> Fear of water first troubles such as are bitten, and, which is the greater wonder, after 7, years it may shew it self; One thought, that he was cured, being washed with Sea water, yet after some months by touching of the Dogg-Tree-Wood he fell into a relapse. <hi>Gesner.</hi> Also in their Urine, Doggs heads are said to appeare.

               </p>
               <p>A certain Mountebank in the time of <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour had a Dogg that would take up many Rings, cast down, and restore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his own; he would tell you by pulling them by the cloaths which was a Wife, a Widow, or a Maid. Lastly, in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> there was one that would represent a Man that was poysoned. We read of the wonderfull fidelity of Dogg in <hi>Scaliger his Exercitations,</hi> I will set it down in his own words, and upon his own reputation: A Courtier envying the credit of a certain friend of his, or carried away with some other malice, came suddenly upon him, and killed him, and after buried him in a place besides the way. The party slain had at the same time a Hound with him, who lay a long while upon his Masters grave. Hunger for that time overcoming love, he returns home, and being seen without his Master by some other friends, who thought the dog had been strayed from him, they bade that some meat should be given him. Having let down a few morsels, he returns to the grave: Which course he continued so often, that the friends of the dead began to suspect; and at last believed that the Dog sought for his Master: They follow him, and coming to the place where the earth was cast up, dig into it, find the body, take it away, and cause it to be buried in another place. The solemnities ended, the dog keeps with them whom he had led to this discovery. A good while after, the Murtherer comes again to the Court; the Dog knows him, and begins to run at him with great cryes, and so earnestly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth his point upon him, that suspition begins to enter into the minds of a great many, that there was some evill in the man. The dog con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing still to vex him, the King was at last advertised of the case, who commanded that the man should be straitly examined touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fact. He affirmeth himself innocent: The dog, when the Murtherer denyed that he knew what was become of the Dogs Master, never left barking and bawling; insomuch, as all that were present took the same as a disproof, that the dog made against him. Well, the matter proceeded so far, that the King ordered it should be decided by a Combat between the man and the dog. To make short, the dog had the day: and the Combat is painted and finely set forth in the Hall of a certain Castle in <hi>France</hi>; and the work wearing out with age hath sometimes been renewed by Commandement from the King. It deserveth (saith the Lord <hi>de la Scale</hi>) to be set forth in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of brasse, that it may never perish.</p>
               <p>But to close up this Discourse, we will adde hereunto that which <hi>James Micyllus</hi> a learned Poet hath written in praise of a Dog, in good Latin Verses, expressed thus in our Tongue:

When they eat up the ears of Corn, one of them lies perdue in the field, and makes an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry when he spies a Country man, the rest fly. They so hate a Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, that they cannot endure to see his skin at a great distance. <hi>Gyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> made tryal of it, and he observed, that they being tyed in chains, yet trembled and scowred, and would have run away through fire and water to escape. In the borders of <hi>Cariai,</hi> there is a kind of them that will leap from bough to bough, as if they flew, they are enemies to Boars; for it will leap furiously upon him, and twine about him with the tail. <hi>Aelian l.</hi> 3. saith, That the <hi>Catoblepas</hi> is like the Bull, and is very terrible to behold, and fierce, and with blood-shot eyes it looks downwards. It feeds on venomous herbs, and so soon as it looks on them with a countenance like a Bull; it fears, and lifts up the Mane; having lifted up this, with open lips it roars terribly, sending such a steam out of the Throat, that the Ayr over the head will be infected, and will make others dumb that draw it in, and causeth mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal convulsions.

he hath. <hi>Christophorus Acosta,</hi> who searched diligently the <hi>East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> writes things that are incredible of them. <hi>It is most certain, saith he, that in the Kingdom of</hi> Malabar <hi>they talk together, and speak with mans voice. There was, saith he, in the City</hi> Cochin <hi>an Elephant, who carried things to the Haven, and laboured in Seafaring matters: When he was weary the governour of the place did force him to draw a Galley from the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which he had begun to draw, into the Sea: the</hi> Elephant <hi>refused it, the Governour gave him good words, and at last intreated him to do it for the King of</hi> Portugal. <hi>Hereupon, (it is hardly credible) the</hi> Elephant <hi>was moved, and reported these two words clearly, Hoo, Hoo, which in the language of</hi> Malabar <hi>is, I will, I will, and he presently drew the ship into the Sea. There was another example at</hi> Rome; <hi>when</hi> Tiberius <hi>was Emperour,</hi> 12, Elephants <hi>were brought into the</hi> Amphitheatre, <hi>in Cloaths that Players use, and first thir Commander divided them into several places of the Circuit, as they went they went easily as if they danced, and again when he spoak, they came together and danced in a round, and they scattered their flowers and Garlands, and according to the musick, they gently and in order moved their feet, and performed all things as well as the best sword Players. Then they (which is a mad wonder) as they were taught, sat down at Table, did eat and drink very modestly as if they had been men. The beds to sit on were low, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Purple, and embroidered work, the Tables were furnished with divers kinds of provision in abundance, cups of Gold and Silver, great and small; were set upon them, in great dishes were meat, bread, flesh, and fruit. Then came in the</hi> Elephants, 6, <hi>males, and</hi> 6, <hi>females, they in Mens Gowns these in Womens Cloaths. They lay themselves very decently and reverently on the beds, and so sat at Table. Then, when the Mr. gave the sign, they put forth their snowts to the Table instead of hands, and take the meat very modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and tast of it, no greedinesse or ravening was observed in them, none seemd to covet the greater or the better part, nor did they catch one before the other when boys that waited on them gave them the cup, and then by meanes of their trunk drank it jovially off, and they did sprinkle the remainder of the Wine upon the standers by, and so made a noise as pot companions do. Lipsius</hi> writes this in his own words, and it is the direct opinion of <hi>Aelian.</hi> And they learn all these things so eagerly, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> say, that an <hi>Elephant</hi> that was somthing dull, and was often beat for not learning well, was found acting his part by Moon light, and some say that <hi>Elephants</hi> will learn to write and read.

When the Moon comes to the East, it looks upon it and cryes; and men say, that for hate thereof, it will digge up the ground with its forefeet, and will set the very balls of the eyes to the ground, and cast it up. Some think it doth the same when the Sun riseth; what place soever in the desart it finds water in, it will trouble it by drinking at it, and stirs the mud, and throwes dust into it, that it may not be fit to drink. The <hi>Panther</hi> smells so sweet, that it will allure all the wild beasts; but the frowning countenance it hath, frights them; wherefore he hides his head, and so they come and are caught. In the right shoulder they have a mark, like to the Moon; and as that increaseth, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, and decreaseth, <hi>Albert.</hi> It breeds but once in the life-time, if we credit the <hi>Author of the Book of naturall things.</hi> When the young ones are grown in the Mothers belly they will not tarry, but tear out their passage: she with pain is delivered of them, and so can never after conceive again, the parts being corrupted where the seed should stay. <hi>Demetrius Physicus</hi> writes of it, that one of them lay in the way waiting for a man, and suddenly appeared to him: he was frighted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and began to run away, but the wild beast came and tumbled before him that was frighted, and was grieved at it.

First therefore he had cause to pity her, and not to be afraid; and next to take care: and he was secure, as he understood the cause of her grief, and followed her, she gently laying her claws and drawing him by the garments; and he had his life for a reward for taking out her whelps; and she having got her young ones again, went along with him, and guarded him out of the desart, and she was jocant and merry, that it might easily appear how gratefull she was, and not to wrong him for his good deeds; which is a rare thing in a Man.

               <p>THere are in some Countries <hi>Apes</hi> in abundance. <hi>Posidonius</hi> saw a wood full of them in the borders of <hi>Lybia.</hi> In a word, <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> saw Mountains full of them in the Indies. He thought when he espyed them by chance, standing upright, that an Army was ready to besiege him, <hi>Aelian.</hi> Amongst the <hi>Troglodites</hi> they have Manes like Lions, and the greatest are as tall as weathers, <hi>Scalig. in Exercit.</hi> In the <hi>Indies Mediterranean,</hi> they are huge bodies, and they follow civill Merchandise without any offence. <hi>Galen</hi> thought them the likest to Mankind, amongst all creatures, for their Bowels, Muscles, Arteries, and Nerves. But <hi>Vesalius</hi> saith, they are the most unlike in the Muscles of the Thorax, that move the arm, cubit and thigh; and those that move the shoulders and toes; and lastly, for the inward structure of the hand. A Male was seen, whose heart had two points, <hi>Albert. Scaliger</hi> saw many without tails, as great as a boy of eight years old, and a male and female with their young. If the young desire any thing, the shee is admonished by the hee clinching his fist, and he will correct her with a fierce look, as being guilty of ill-using her young ones. <hi>Mutianus</hi> saith, that those which have such tails, are sad when the Moon is decaying, and they rejoyce and adore the new Moon. He addes, That some were seen to play at Chesse, for they will imitate a man unluckily; for an Ape saw a Midwife wash the Child, and bind him up in swathebands, and lay him in the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52474:125"/>
Cradle, when he spide that the Child was alone, he went in at the window that was open, and took up the Child and unswathed it, and washed it with scalding water till he kill'd it, <hi>Aelian.</hi> He is very much afraid of a snail. <hi>Erasmus</hi> saith, <hi>At</hi> Rome <hi>we had an example of this. A man put a snail on his Childs head, and covered it with a Cap. Then he brought him to the</hi> Ape, <hi>who was glad and leaped on the boys shoulder to look lice, taking off his Cap he saw the Snail: it was strange to see how he was frighted and leapt back, and how fearfully he looked backward to see if the snail followed him.</hi> Another example. <hi>We tied a snail to one end of the cord that the</hi> Ape <hi>was tied with, that he could not get away, but he must look upon it; tis wonderfull how he was frighted, only he did not dye for feare; somtimes he strove to drive away the beast that stuck fast with his hinder feet, at last he pissed and shit all he had in his belly; and of this fright he fell into a feaver, that we were forced to let him loose, and to give him Wine mingled with Water to refresh him.</hi>

The Horns of this creatures are shew'd in many places; At the Monastery of St. <hi>Denys</hi> there is a whole one in a dark vault of the Sanctuary, and the end of it stands in water. The water is given to drink to those that go under that hollow arch; so soon as they have drank that, they suddenly fall into a great sweat.

                  </gap>s, with one black Horn, sticking out of the middle of the forehead two cubits length; what ever it be, here is cause enough to doubt of it. For first there are many kinds of <hi>Unicorns</hi> described, and we know not whether they be of the same kind. In <hi>India</hi> there be Oxen that have their hoofs undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and they have but one Horn if we credit <hi>Pliny,</hi> There are Bulls in <hi>Aonia</hi> if we beleive <hi>Aelian</hi> and <hi>Oppianus.</hi> There were some in the Wood <hi>Hercynia,</hi> if <hi>Caesar</hi> be to be believed. <hi>Ludovicut Barthema</hi> saith, that he saw in <hi>Zeilam</hi> a City of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> a kind of Cows that had but one Horn in their forehead, that was but a hand breadth long, and turned backwards. As for the Horns, there is much sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stication in them. There was one found upon the shore of the River <hi>Arula,</hi> in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> nere to <hi>Bruga</hi>: who shall certainly make choice of these for the <hi>Unicorns</hi> Horn. That which <hi>Albertus</hi> saw was a hand breadth and a half thick, ten foot long, without any spirall lines, and like to a Stags Horn? And a Horn so thick and long, seems to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a living creature as great as a great Ship. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> thinks that the cup which <hi>Alvarez Mendosa</hi> gave to the great Duke of <hi>Hetru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> which he had from the King of <hi>Narsinga,</hi> was rather made of one of those creatures Horns which are seen in <hi>Basma</hi> and <hi>Macinum,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Tartary,</hi> that are as big as Elephants. The Diameter of that cup was as much as both hands could hardly compasse. He that would read more of the <hi>Unicorn,</hi> let him read <hi>Andreas Marinus, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas Baccius,</hi> and <hi>Casparus Bartholinus.</hi> I for a conclusion will add somthing, omitted concerning the Mule. The common opinion is that the Mule is barren, and if they do bring forth, it is held for a monstrous thing. Yet in some Countries of <hi>Africa</hi> they are ordinarily with young and do bring them forth, <hi>Varro.</hi> It appears by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the <hi>Athenians</hi> that one lived 80, yeares. And they took pleasure in it, when they built a Temple in the Fort, that this old Mule would encourage their Cattel that fell down, with accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paning them, and labouring with them, wherefore they made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that no men that cleansed Corne should drive the Mule from their sieves, <hi>Plin.</hi> Some write they will not kick if they drink Wine. They have an excellent smell. Hence those Mules that are out of the way will return into the way when they smell it, and they easily are infected with the contagious force of the Ayre, and fall sick of the

her eyes? where her smelling? Where hath she made that horrid and great Voyce, considering its proportion of body? how hath she cunningly fastned the wings? lengthned the legs? hath disposed a hollow place instead of a belly? and made it thirsty after blood, especially mans blood? but by what art hath she whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ed the snowt of it to make it penetrate into the skin?</hi> And since the smallnesse of it cannot be discerned, in comparison with that is very great, nature hath helped it by a twofold art, that it might be sharp to peirce, and hollow to drink with all. <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Aristotle</hi> reckons 4, kinds of bloodlesse creatures; The soft, the hard crusty, the shell-wearing, and the insect. The soft kinds want scales, and their skin is not rough, nor with a shell, but soft as it is in Men. They have no bones, no bowels. If there be any, they are like to fishes prickles, except only the Polypus. <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 28. Their heads are between their legs, and their bellies, they have no tongues, nature only hath given them somthing that is fleshy, to discern the pleasure of that they eate. But they have a Brain, and they have that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to that part which is designed by nature for the principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of feeling. Also they are of both sexes. The parts of the males are all more rough, and distinguished with various lines running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, the tayl is sharper, the passage under the throat, comes from the brain to the bottom of the pipe; and the place it is carried to, is like to the teats. It is double that is set above in the females, and reddish little bodies are joyned to it in both sexes. They refuse salt water, they can hardly endure cold, for they are naked, and fearfull because they want blood. Their eggs when they are lay'd increase as Worms do, but they must needs have their vital force from the seed of the male, as fishes have. <hi>Aristot. de generat. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. Of those that are crusty there are two kinds, for they are all either with tails or round. Their taile is evident and stretched forth: the cover of this, as it were, covers the end of their belly, and is so joyned to the lower part of their belly that it shews not at all like a taile; <hi>Scalig. exercit.</hi> 245. Their parts are as the other parts of bloodlesse creatures. Their teeth in their mouths are long and round, covered with a double co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, <hi>Aristot. de part</hi> 4, <hi>c.</hi> 3. between which such things are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as are knit between the teeth of Locusts. They want eylids, but their eyes are placed above their mouth, they are hard, and apt to move inward and outward, and obliquely. They breathe not, but casting water through a hollow pipe they are refreshed. The males have small passages for their genital parts, the females have membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous matrices cut as farr as their intestins, and in them an egge is bred. They copulate after the manner of those creatures that pisse backwards. The female brings forth a red egge covered over with a thin shelly membrane: they are otherwise called <hi>Conchylia,</hi> purple shell fish, that were of old held for great dainties, that they grew into a proverb, to be the widows delights. Nature hath so sported in the variety of them, in so many figures and colours, that it is hard to number them. <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 33. to explain the variety of them saith thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>They are of so many figures, plain, hollow, long, like the half
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52474:129"/>
Moon, round cut in half circles, rising in the back, smooth, rugged, dented, streaked, the top wreathed like the Murex, the borders pointed, outward, or folded inward, somtimes distinguished with little lines, hairy, curled, like doggs waved like a comb, a tyle, lattice wise, or like net work, stretched out obliquely or right forth, close thickned together, open as when men clap their hands, bended backwards like to a Horn.</hi> Moreover, in the red Sea they are of a wonderfull greatnesse, also they are found on the tops of the highest Mountains, and they somtimes lye hid in the inward parts of the earth or in stones, <hi>Goropius. Becanus in Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus</hi> saith, he <hi>hath seen some in a flint, that we use to pave the streets with, brought from</hi> Bethum: <hi>there were so many shell-fish all of stone, and shut up entire in their coverings, that you would judge that flint to have been framed with great care and art of them, joyned with some cement. In the fields about the suburbs of</hi> Paris, <hi>that are fruitfull with Corn above, there is underneath a Cave that is under great part of it, where Chariots may passe. I found there a great many shells, like Sea perwinkles, in a delicate order, both twisted and adorned with little knots, and so exact, that there was nothing wanting to their perfection but the living fish. I saw in England a stone cut out of the highest Mountains, that was like a living perch, not the least line was wanting to make it perfect. Insects have incisions either above or beneath, or else on both sides, and though it be bony or fleshy, yet they have somthing that is between both.</hi> The differences of them are many, if you note their place the quality of their body, their quantity, their food, their generation, their motion of their going. As for the place, (we must speak somthing) reddish hairy Worms are bred in Snow; in the fire, Worms called <hi>Pyrausta</hi>; in the Sea water, the insect call'd <hi>Micro-rinchotoros,</hi> or little nose, the Sea-<hi>Scotopendra,</hi> and the gnat. In fresh water there ariseth, <hi>Leeches, Scrophulae, Strumae, Cherodes</hi>; in the earth, Worms, and <hi>Juli</hi>; in minerals, not a few. In the stumps of Trees, <hi>Cossi,</hi> and <hi>Teredines.</hi> The Fig-Tree breeds the Worm <hi>Cerastes</hi>: if an Olive Tree be planted where an Oke is digged up, there breed Frogs, and little Worms, in the Service-Tree there are breed red hairy ones; in the bladders of Elms, <hi>Psennes</hi>; in Vines, those that <hi>Tully</hi> calls <hi>Butyri</hi>; in the Spindle-Tree, or as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> calls it, <hi>Tetragonia,</hi> there is yearly bred some Catterpillers that dye so soon as the leaves are wasted. In the apple of a certain shrub call'd <hi>Coccios</hi> there breaks forth a little living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so soon as the fruit is ripe. There are Worms found in the gnats, that tied to the neck will retain the birth, they must be taken off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore delivery can be. In the leaves of Night-shade there is a Worm that is of a green and yellow colour, that hath a Horn in the forehead, as long as ones finger. In the Asphodil Worms breed, that become flies, in the fashion of flowers, for when the stalk fades and withers, they eat the cover they are in and fly out: you shall find no fewer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects observable in living creatures. Mans excrements are known sufficiently, especially when the Sun shines on the excrements of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly people. We know that in <hi>Aegypt</hi> Worms are presently bred in Mens legs. In a Carp the first year a black Worm is bred neer his gills. River perches breed as it were 12 pearls, so great as tares,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52474:130"/>
and each of them hath in it a slender long round worm. Lastly, it is said, that in Bee-hives a worm is bred. As for the parts, Flies have open wings, Beetles have sheath wings; some have their belly joyn'd to their mouth, and the right Intestin revolved from that. Those that leap, have either their hinder legs longer, or else they lean upon their tails bended backwards. As for their generation, some are bred from animals of the same kind; some do generate, but not of their own kind, but only Worms, and those not from living creatures, but from putrefaction of moysture and drynesse. Amongst those that couple, the females are commonly the biggest, the males have no fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal passages; nor do they thrust in their member into the females, but the females into them by the lower part.</p>
               <p>This I have spoken more largely of bloodlesse creatures, because I know that their external habit hath made them contemptible. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mind of man ought to be rouzed up contemplate their worth, by the majesty of the internal nature of them, and to verse it self therein.</p>

The fruitfulnesse of the fields causeth the plenty of them, the sweet smells, the abundance of flowers, the pleasant taste of them.</p>
               <p>Adde to this the mighty Woods of Pine-Trees, which are alwaies green, and keep the place warm, with high tops, and large boughs; in Summer they shade the Bees, and in Winter they hide themselves in the coverings of the Pines, <hi>Leo. Nolan. in Problem. Solinus</hi> saith, That <hi>Scotland</hi> breeds none; but I know that is false: for I saw some in my Host's Garden at St. <hi>Andrews</hi>; and sometimes I have been much delighted with them. In <hi>Africa</hi> they are rare. If you ask the cause, you shall find it is the want of those things that I spake of in <hi>Sarmatia.</hi> In some parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if you bury a Bull to his horns, <hi>Bees</hi> in time will breed from it, from its putrefaction. If therefore you would breed <hi>Bees</hi> so, read <hi>Florentinus.</hi> He bids you, as <hi>Caesar Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> relates, make you a house ten cubits high, and ten cubits broad, and the other sides equal thereunto; let there be but one place of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, and four windows, on each side one; drive an Ox that is fleshy and 30 moneths old into this place, he must be very fat; cause many young men to stand round about him, and beat him sorely, and kill him with Clubs, breaking his very horns and bones; yet they must take great heed that no blood follow. For the Bees are not bred of blood: and when they strike him first, let not them run violently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52474:130"/>
him; Then presently stop all passages in the Ox, with clean pure napkins, dipt in pitch, as the mouth, the nostrills, the eyes, and all parts Nature hath made for Evacuation. Then laying a great deal of Thyme under, and the Ox upon it, let them come forth of the house, and presently shut the door and the windows, and daub them with Lime, that neither Ayr nor wind may enter or come forth; but the third week you must set the house wide open, and let in the light and the cold Ayr, unlesse it be on that side where the wind blowes very strong. For if it fall so out, you must stop that side the wind blowes strongly on, and daub it with clay. The eleventh day after, when you open it, you shall find Bees hanging abundantly in clusters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and of the Ox that is left you shall find nothing but his horns, his bones, and his hair. They say the Kings are bred of his brain, the common Bees of his flesh; Also the King is bred of the spinall marrow; but it is said, that those which breed of the brain, are the best, for strength beauty and magnitude. From hence you shall know the first change and transformation of flesh into living Creatures, and as it were a conception, and generation, thus: For, opening the place, small white creatures, like to one another, and not yet perfect, nor yet living, will appear in great numbers about the Ox, all immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but augmenting by degrees. You shall see also the excrescence of their wings, yet unjoynted; and you shall see Bees in their proper colour, gathering together and flying about the King, but with small short wings, trembling for want of using to fly, and the weaknesse of their limbs. They will come continually, flying violently against the windows, for the desire of light. But it is best to open and shut the windows every other day, as we said. For it is to be feared, that they will change the nature of Bees, or else be stifled for want of Ayr. If a wing of them, or the sting be pull'd off it can never grow again; for because this is fastned to the Intestine, it pulls that out also, and so they die. They have a King, who is so much honoured by them, that he never goes forth, but they all attend him; if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There were some found also in the Tomb of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly avouched, that the honey of them anointed on little blisters of Childrens mouths by the Sepulchre, did miraculously cure them.

               <p>IN the new world, as <hi>Oviedus, l.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 3, relates, there are green Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the Web is of a Golden colour, as good as silk. In <hi>Cuma</hi> they weave it so strong that it will not break, but holds like silk. In <hi>Hispaniola</hi> they are as big as hand-balls, and as hard as nuts. In <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> there is a very great kind of them, like to a Crab, yet a fly takes him and draws him into his hold, contrary to what is used in <hi>Europe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cardan. l.</hi> 9. <hi>subtil.</hi> saith, that in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> they are as big as Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Some write they couple backwards, and do scatter eggs in their Webs, for they leap and so lay them. They are perfected in 28, days. <hi>Scaliger, l.</hi> 1. <hi>de. causis plant.</hi> saith, that they breed of filth. <hi>When I somtime observed Spiders egs, I found them to be, many small ones, black and blew with little spots, divided and parted one from the other: they are soft, and clammy, and if by chance any be lost, the Spider diligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and she carries them back by fastning them on some thing from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and with her beck also. I have seen also innumerable young ones come forth of one egg, so small that they could hardly be discerned; yet so soon as they were come forth of the egg, they spun such fine Webs that nothing can be more wonderfull. Also I have observed under the belly of a Spider that was taken, a mighty heap of eggs, so small as Atoms; they were white, and crushed with the finger, they gave a crack.</hi> They have a great faculty of feeling; for sitting in the middle of their Web, they feel a fly that toucheth it in the most remote part. Hence <hi>Antonius Ludovicus. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Problem. s.</hi> 5. <hi>Problem</hi> 13. saith, that for that cause they lye in the middle of their Nets. And being that the lines are equall from the Centre, she sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the middle, and holding with her feet the beginnings of the threds she spun, she can easily know from all parts. They make ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine nets, and in them gnats and other little weak creatures are insnared. This is made from somthing they have without them, or from their hard skin, which being by degrees kembed and drawn like to a thred, they diminish, and they eat up their threds; or else naturally they have a fruitfullnesse of drawing threds; or else at a set time, the nature of their belly is corrupted, like an excrement. The woof is fastned within, and from that those fine lengths are drawn forth: we see the first to happen in Silk Worms, for they draw silken threds out of their own excrements, and they change their lives for a silken case, their proper substance being turn'd into a Fleece, <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Ludovicus, l.</hi> 1. <hi>s.</hi> 5. <hi>problem.</hi> 52. <hi>And Franciscus Bonzella Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14. <hi>de Venenis</hi> writes, that such as are bitten by a house Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, fall ill of a Priapisme. And <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 24. <hi>c.</hi> 9. saith that the same things happen when one is bitt by the Spider <hi>Phalangium.</hi> The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the poyson is said to be the cause of it. For though it penetrate easily; yet the terrestiall part of it causeth flatulent humours, which being driven to the lower parts, cause erection. When they hurt the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52474:131"/>
young Lizzards, first they wrap them in their Webs, then they bite their lips, which is a sight fit for a Theatre, when it happens, <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 24. Also the same Authour, <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 74, saith, that the Spider doth ballance himself, to come down upon the head of a Serpent that lyeth under the shade of a Tree, and he so fiercely bites the Serpents brain; that he makes him to hisse, yet he can neither break the thred that hangs from aloft, nor yet run away; and there is no end of it, till he kill him. When houses are like to fall, the Spiders first fall down with their Webs. <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 28. When the Rivers are like to rise, they rayse their nets higher, and because they weave not in fair weather, but in foule, many Spiders foreshew rayn, <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 24. The <hi>Thebans,</hi> as <hi>Pausanias</hi> witnesseth, in <hi>Baeoticus,</hi> were ignorant of that; For when the Spiders had woven white Webs about the dores of the Temple of the Goddesse <hi>Ceres,</hi> about that time that the battle was fought at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> when the <hi>Macedonians</hi> assaulted them, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders spun all black Webs, which was a sign that signified somthing far different from the former.</p>

                  <hi>ZOnoras</hi> saith, that the <hi>Italians</hi> knew not the <hi>Silk-Worm</hi> before the time of <hi>Justinian</hi>: in his dayes it was wittily found out and brought thither, <hi>Procopius.</hi> He adds, that two Monks brought <hi>Silk-Worm</hi> eggs from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and putting them into dung transformed them into Worms. Now <hi>Sera</hi> whence they came, is a City in the farthest parts of <hi>Persia,</hi> wherein there is made so much Silk work, that ten thousand pounds of Silk are daily given out to work-folks. Also in <hi>Taprobana</hi> Silk is gathered from Trees without any labour, as many Navigations have discovered. Nature hath shew'd so much art in this Insect, that it is impossible to comprehend it all. Much is written, and much more may be. First, it is a Worm; shut up in a bladder, it dies without any forme; at length a winged butterfly comes forth of the case: wherfore a creeping Insect is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a flye by a medium that is vegetable void of sense and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by a strange metamorphosis. The little Worm first shut out, seeks abundance of nourishment, and eating greedily what she is able, by often lifting up her head, striving as it were with a Lethargy, she sleeps at length 3, or 2, days, and in the mean while casting her skin, she falls to her wonted diet again, when she hath fed 4, times, slept 4, times, and 4, times changed her Coat; she will eat no more, but climbs up on high upon the branches, and twigs, having discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her belly as it should, she begins to spin some rudiments of her Silken work upon the boughs, but in disordered turnings, then she shuts her self into a transparent case, and thrusts forth the fruit of her indefatigable labour, from the centre to the circumference, white
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52474:132"/>
Wooll, yellow, and green, of an ovall figure, striving as it were with her fellows, in 9 dayes she ends her task, and dyes within it. From this case laid under ground, a horned Butterfly comes forth after ten dayes, but being neither mindfull of its wings nor food, being about to repair the losse of its short life by its fruitfulnesse of young ones, put into a soft fleece for 3. dayes together, but seldom for 4. dayes, is the male coupled to the female, and dies; and shortly after the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male widow, leaving behind her about a hundred seeds like Millet seeds, she dyeth also. But because <hi>Andreas Libavius,</hi> a most deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Physitian, hath most accurately described this from his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, I thought fit to joyn his historicall observation, as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to the end of this <hi>Classis,</hi> for the benefit of those that search the Secrets of Nature.</p>

Then is she most conspicuous, when her belly is pressed, and that transparent humour goes to the end of her belly, and her brest against the light shines like to fire, <hi>Aldrovand. de Insect. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8. There is something spoken of this, in the Second <hi>Classis. Adrianus Junius,</hi> when he was in the Country of <hi>Bononia,</hi> drew the liquor of them upon Papers that shined like Stars: what is writ with that in the day, may be read in the night. Many have shewed the way to compound it. <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> doth it thus: <hi>We did cut their tails from their bodies, taking care that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should mingle with the shining parts; we ground it on a</hi> Porphyr <hi>stone, and</hi> 15 <hi>dayes or longer we buried it in dung, in a glasse vessel, and it is best that these parts should not touch the sides, but hang in it: for these dayes being over, the glasse being put into a hot oven, or a bath of hot water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albertus de sensu et sensato</hi> shews, why their light cannot be extinguished by water: <hi>For their light cannot be said to be of a coelestiall body, because a coelestiall nature comes not into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of bodies generative and corruptible: But the determination of this
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52474:132"/>
question and the like, is fetched from what we determined in our second</hi> de Anima; <hi>where we shew, That the nature of perspicuity is not proper to any Element, but it is common to many, and is participated by them</hi> per prius et posterius, <hi>which is the more pure, the farther it is from darknesse; and this is so, by how much it is more like to the nature of superiour bodies; and the proper act of this is light, which hath to do in that nature. Now this falls out in it, as often as the parts of it are very noble and clear: and therefore all such things do shine. Now this composition sometime is in the whole body; sometimes not in the whole, but in some externall parts: the cause whereof is, that when such a nature is from the Elements that are light; it proceeds more from the internall parts to the external, because such things will swim. And so it is found in the heads, and sins, and bones of some Fish, and in the shells of some eggs, because such parts are lesse rosted, and heat hath wrought in them much nature of perspicuous bodies condensed: Sometimes this heat acts in the externall parts of some things, when it exhales from them, and that which is subtile brings with it much perspicuity; so the parts of Okes corrupted do shine. But all those things that have but a weak light, are hid when a clearer light appears.</hi>

                  <hi>ISidore</hi> writes, that <hi>Grashoppers</hi> breed of Cuccow-spit. <hi>Plutarch in Sympos.</hi> saith, Out of the Earth. <hi>Baldangelus</hi> saith, they breed out of the earth not tilled, that looks Eastward toward the Sun-rising; and that white ones were dug up under Okes, but their form was, as the rest were. <hi>Aristotle l.</hi> 5. <hi>hist. c.</hi> 30. saith, they breed by copulation. <hi>Pliny</hi> sets down the manner: <hi>First, there is a Worm bred, then of that</hi> Tettigometra, <hi>or Mother of the</hi> Grashopper, <hi>the shell of it being broken, about the Solstices they fly forth alwaies in the night, being first black and hard; but when he strives to come forth of his</hi> Tettigometra; [You may observe, that <hi>Grashoppers</hi> and <hi>Butterflies</hi> breed alike; for what is in these, at first, a Caterpillar, is in them, first a little worm; and that case, call'd <hi>Chrysalis</hi> or <hi>Aurelia,</hi> for the <hi>Catterpillar</hi>; is call'd <hi>Tettigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metra,</hi> for the <hi>Grashopper,</hi> Yet you shall know that they differ: For a rude <hi>Chrysalis</hi> is a lump wherein no parts of the body are distinguished, as we can discern; but in the <hi>Tettigometra</hi> you may see the head, eys, feet, breast, and all the parts, except the wings; it is whitish in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and sprinkled with small lines;] <hi>First he gets up a Tree, and sticks to some branch of the Tree; then at the upper end where a cleft is first seen, he comes forth; his whole body is then almost green; shortly, his upper part enclines to Chestnut colour, and that in one day becomes of a black colour; and because his legs and wings are weak at first, he sits upon his cast skin till be can fly.</hi> In <hi>Cephalenia</hi> there is a River where Grashoppers are on one side, but none on the other, <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 27.

If you ask the reason, <hi>Strabo</hi> thinks, that at <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium</hi> the Country is dark and shady; at <hi>Locris</hi> the heat is great; and therefore he thinks, that the dewy skins of their wings are not there extended; but here he thinks they have dry, and, as it were, horny skins. But because they do that when they fly, and when they stand, which the others are thought not to do, the heat is the cause of it: For being hotter by nature, they need more cooling, and move the Ayr the stronger: The others do not need so much, either because they are but of a weak heat, they are not heard to do it, therefore it may be thought they are said not to do it, <hi>Nicolaus Leonicus.</hi>

                  <hi>PEarls</hi> are in some Shell-fish like the upper crust; in others like to the Off-spring; in some like hail. There are many in them, and of great weight.

The King of the Island <hi>Eubagna,</hi> had one so big as a Wallnut, it weighed 31. caracts, and it was sold for 1200 pieces of Castile. <hi>Gonzalvus Oviedus</hi> saith, that one was sold at <hi>Panama,</hi> that weighed 26 caracts, it was round, and as big as the knob of a Pillar.</p>
               <p>It is said that neere the Island <hi>Borneo,</hi> there was one as great a Goose egge; and so round, that lay'd on a Table, it will hardly stay in one place. <hi>Peter Martyr, Decad</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 8. saith, <hi>That in his presence, when he was invited to dine with the famous Duke of</hi> Medina Sidonia, <hi>at</hi>

Baetica, <hi>they brought one to sell unto him, that weighed above a hundred ounces</hi> Heaps are cast up of shells in Summer, some of them have Pearls in them that are ready, others not yet perfect, out of a River that runs by the Village of <hi>Hussin</hi> in <hi>Bohemia</hi>; These they give their bucks to devoure, then they gather up purer, being clensed in their Bellies, <hi>Gesner.</hi> Five or six are sound in one. <hi>Vesputius</hi> saith he found 130, in some <hi>Indian</hi> Oysters. Somtimes some small ones are found behind, like to small kernells. But the question is how these are bred. Some think they are bred of the dewy ayre; but this opinion seems to be false. For some lye in the bottom of the deepest waters, and some are black, some yellow, some green, some blew. <hi>Oviedus, hist. Ind. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 8. But they say that the white ones are bred of pure dew, the pale ones of that which is troubled. <hi>Androstenes</hi> in <hi>Athenaeus</hi> saith that as kernells are bred in hogs, so Pearls breed in shell-fish. <hi>Juba,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, subscribes to this. The <hi>Indians,</hi> that inhabit the Island <hi>Cabagna,</hi> say, they breed as eggs do in them. For the greater of them are next the orifice, and are first thrust forth, but in the more inward parts of the Matrix, the lesser Pearls lye hid. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> and <hi>Alexander Benedictus</hi> compare their originall to that of stones in some greater living creatures; <hi>We saw,</hi> saith he, <hi>stones voided forth of ones bladder as big as a hens egge, over which a clammy matter grew by degrees covering them, like to a crust of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers colours somtimes, and they were hardned by a fiery heat, and so they are said to increase by little and little. Pearls in shell-fish are reported to grow the same way, and the Jewellers can discover by a turning instrument divers coats in them, as we see in Onions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And</hi> Rondeletius saith, <hi>he thinks that Pearls grow the same manner in shell-fish, as kernells do in hogs, and the stone in the Reins and the Bladder. The yeare wee writ this, there was one died that had a Stone in his Reins, that had so many partitions as there were branches of small Veins in his Reins. The little stone with these partitions, was like the outmost knob of a round white marble, or like a great Pearl for its figure and brightnesse, I think it was compacted of a vitreous flegme. Therefore it is no wonder if in Oysters and shell-fish, when they grow old, Pearls are to be found. They may also be dissolved, the Chymists shew how.</hi> Cardanus saith, <hi>you must first wash them being entire, and strain the juyce of Lemmons twice or thrice; then put them in, and set them in the Sun; in five or six days they will dissolve.</hi>

The <hi>Hebrews,</hi> saith <hi>Tostatus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent old wives tales concerning them, for they say that <hi>David</hi> inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God why he made Fools, Spiders, Flyes, with other things that seeme not only to be superfluous, but dangerous; and God promised to make it appeare to <hi>David</hi> that these three things were profitable for some things. For foolishnesse, it was manifest; for unlesse he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had counterfeited the fool's part before King <hi>Achis,</hi> he had been taken captive, and perhaps perished. And the <hi>Flye</hi> was usefull, when he descended from the hill <hi>Hacbilla</hi> into <hi>Sauls</hi> camp, when all were a sleep, and took away <hi>Sauls</hi> spear; for then he set his feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Abner</hi> his feet who lay about <hi>Saul,</hi> and when he feared least he should be taken, if he should violently draw out his foot, God sent a <hi>Flye</hi> who bit <hi>Abners</hi> legs, and so <hi>Abner</hi> gave way, and yet did not wake <hi>Abner,</hi> so <hi>David</hi> escaped.

               <p>BEllonius <hi>gives an exact description of the</hi> Boat-fish; The shell of it seems to consist of <hi>3.</hi> pieces, (namely the Keel and the sides, and yet it is but one entire piece) the side-pieces whereof seem to be joyn'd on both sides as to the Keel.

by which the Boat-fish is nourished, is very great at the place he comes forth of his shell; This is very brittle, milk white, shining, polished, altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the form of a round ship; for it swims on the top of the Sea, arising from the bottom, and the shell comes the bottom upwards, that it may ascend the better, and sail with an empty Boat; and when she is come above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then she turns her shell. Moreover, there is a membrane that lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fore-legs of the Boat-fish, as there is between the toes of water-fowl; but this is more thin, like a cobweb, but strong; and by that she sails, when the wind blowes; the many tufts she hath on both sides, she useth for rudders; and when she is afraid, then she presently sinks her shell, full of Sea water. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, she hath a Parrots bill, and she goes with her tufts as the <hi>Polypus</hi> doth, and after the same manner she conceives in hollow partitions.</p>

For when in places where the wind blows not, he sees them taking pleasure in the Sun, and to open their shells against the Suns beams, he privately casts in a stone, that they cannot shut again, and so he conquers them.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Butterflies</hi> couple after <hi>August,</hi> &amp; the male dying after copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the female lays egs, and dieth also. How they are preserved in winter, is hardly discovered by any man, except by <hi>Aldrovandus de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sectis.</hi> But he enquired of Country people, and they hold him, that the leaves were great with the <hi>Butterflies</hi> seed; at what time they plowed the ground, they were hid in the bowells of it, and fostered by its heat, yet he thinks that they only are preserved, that lye hid in the hollow barks of Trees, but what lyes on leaves is quickned the same yeare. And <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> adds, <hi>I saw eggs layd under the leaves of</hi> Chamaeficus <hi>out of which about the end of August, little Catterpillars naturally came forth. They were wrapped in a thin down, that the ayre might not hurt them, and these little Catterpillars falling did not fall to the ground, but hung by a small thred like Spiders in the Ayre. When they lay under leaves, they fold them so that the rain cannot hurt them, and lay them up as under a pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house. I twice observed one Catterpillar, that I took amongst the Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts, first to lay yellow eggs, wrapt up also in fine down, and when they were laid she turned into a</hi> Chrysalis, <hi>of the same colours that she was, that is, yellow, green, and black: and that which seemed strange to me, out of those eggs, little flying creatures came forth, that I could hardly see them, such as are wont to be found in the bladders of Elms:</hi> when they are in great abundance they shew contagion of the Ayre. <hi>Anno</hi> 1562, they flew at <hi>Bannais</hi> neere the waters, in such multitudes, that they dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the course of the River, especially after Sun set; then coming hither about night, they wandred through the Villages as in Battel aray, little differing from Moths. <hi>Cornelius Gemma</hi> testifieth that that was a tempestuous yeare. The <hi>Polypus</hi> in time grows so great, that it is taken for a kind of Whale. In the bowells of them, there is a strange thing like a Turbane, that you would say it had the nature of the Heart, or of the Liver, but it suddenly dissolves and runs away. They exceedingly love the Olive-Tree. For if a bough on which Olives hang, be let down into the Sea and held there, you may catch abundance of them, hanging about the bough. Somtimes they are taken sticking to Figg-Trees growing by the Seaside, and they eat the fruit of them. They also delight wonderfully in Locusts, of which you shall find a cleare Testimony in <hi>Petrus Berchorius.

               <p>SOme think, that <hi>Lice</hi> are bred of flesh; others, of blood; but both opinions are false: For first they breed in the skin of the head, and we know they abound in the second and third kind of hectick feavers; when as, there, is little flesh; and, here, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most consumed. Again in putrid Feavers they breed not; and things bred do confirm their principles. Their colour shews they proceed not from blood. Wherefore some think they breed from putrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is cold and moyst, which abounds in the skin, in places where they cannot be blown away. Experience teacheth, that they will leave those that are dead, either because the blood is cold in the body when the heat is gone; or because the dead body is cold, and they fly from the cold, <hi>Nolanus Problem.</hi> 225. They that eat figs often are thought to be troubled with them. <hi>Nolanus</hi> makes the juice of them to be the cause. For, this increasing in the veins heats the blood, and makes it moyst and frothy; which because it naturally tends to the skin, and retain'd under that it putrefies, it turns to lice. Truly they, that feed on figs, have little knots and warts on their skins.

He gives his reason, because they both proceed from the same Northern Fountain; for they are both in <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>March</hi> bred. But <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> thinks it comes to passe, because lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen is more near to the body than woollen.

Therefore because in <hi>Guiney</hi> there are great putrefactions, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual distemper of the Ayr, there are found abundance of worms. Hence it appears, that a hot and moyst distemper is fit to breed them; that in Summer Moneths, and when the blasts are warm, Gardens commonly abound with Snails, and flesh with Worms: They are found in Cattel, Plants, and in men. <hi>Anno</hi> 1562, There was a cruel

The Mullet fish breeds but onely thrice in its life-time, and is barren all the rest of the time. For in the matrix of it little Worms breed, that devour the seed. In others, some small ones breed, that hinder procreation.</p>

                     <hi>WOrms</hi> are found in Men. For sometimes the active cause is sufficient, and there is matter enough in their bodies; and many examples are found every where in Authors, that confirm this. <hi>Anno</hi> 1549, There were many men about the River <hi>Thaysa,</hi> in whose bodies there were found Creatures call'd <hi>Lutrae,</hi> and Lizzards. <hi>Wierus</hi> saw a Country man that voided a Worm 8 foot long, it had a mouth and head like to a Duck, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>de praestig. Daemon.</hi> A Maid at <hi>Lovain</hi> (saith <hi>Cornelius Gemma</hi>) voided many prodigious creatures, amongst the rest a living creature a foot and half long, thicker than a mans thumb, like to an Eagle, but that the tail of it was hairy. A Maid (saith <hi>Dodonaeus</hi>) cast forth some like to Caterpillars, with many feet, and they were alive. <hi>Hollerius l.</hi> 1. saith, he saw a Worm that bred in a mans brain. <hi>Beniventus c.</hi> 100, <hi>exemp. medic.</hi> writes, That he had a friend that was troubled with great pain in his head, raving, darknesse of sight, and other ill symptomes; at last he cast forth a Worm out of his right nostrill, longer than his hand; when that was gone, all the pain presently ceased. <hi>Theophrast. hist. Plant. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c. ult.</hi> writes thus of <hi>Worms</hi> in the belly; <hi>Some people have belly worms naturally; for the</hi> Egyptians, Arabians, Armenians, Syrians, Cilicians, <hi>are in part troubled with them, but the</hi> Thracians <hi>and</hi> Phrygians <hi>have none.</hi> Amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we know that the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that use to live in Schools, and also the <hi>Baeotians</hi> have a worm bred in them; but the <hi>Athenians</hi> have none. A woman in <hi>Sclavonia</hi> cast out a very strange worm, described by <hi>Amat. Lusitan. curat. medic. Cent.</hi> 6.74. <hi>It was four cubits long, but not broad, half so broad as ones nail, of a white colour, of the substance of the guts, having something like an Adders skin: The Head was warty, and white, out of which the body grew broad, and grew still narrower toward the tail. This Worm was but one body with many divisions; the parts of this broad Worm were like to Gourd seeds, that had nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in them by reason of the compression of its broad body.</hi>

                  <p>ALl Plants, herbs, shrubs and Trees have their worms: a worm in the root is deadly. For let the Tree be what it will, and flourish, yet this will make it wither, saith <hi>Aldrovandus l.</hi> 6. <hi>de Insect. c.</hi> 4. And there are sure witnesses, that in the roots of Okes such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Worms will breed, that if you should but tread on them
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52474:140"/>
with the sole of your foot, it would fetch off the skin. There are small white ones found in the sponge of the sweet bryer, which is outwardly soft and hairy, but inwardly so hard and so solid a substance, that a sharp instrument will hardly peirce it. In the white Daffodill, some are bred, which are changed into another flying and beautifull creature, which when the herb begins to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, presently eats through the cover, and flyes away. <hi>Pliny, l.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 6. writes, that some think that <hi>Basil</hi> chewed and laid in the Sun will breed Worms. If you bruise the green shells of Wallnuts, and put them into the water, and then sprinkle them with earth, Worms will breed in abundance, that are good for Fishers, <hi>Carol. Stephan, Agricultur, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 34. But <hi>Theophrastus</hi> 5, <hi>de caus. Plant.</hi> saith, that a Worm beed in one Tree, and put into another, will not live. <hi>Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimus Fortius</hi> reports that he saw some who affirmed that from a hazel nut that had a Worm in it, there grew a Serpent for magnitude and forme. For the nut being opened so farr as the Worm, and the Worm not being hurt, they put the nut into milk, and set the vessel of milk in the Sun, yet so that the Worm was not beaten upon by the Sun; wherefore, on that side the Sun shined, they covered the Vessel, and so nourished the Worm many days. Afterward adding more Milk, they set it to the Sun again. The milk must be sheeps milk. Also they report, that a Worm is found in the leaves of Rue, nourished the same way, that lived 20, days. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> writes of the cause of them, plainly and fully. His words are these. <hi>Ill diseases happen to all seeds, from nutriment and distemper of the Ayre, namely when too much or too little nourishment is afforded, or the Ayre is immoderately moyst or dry, or else when it doth not rayne seasonably. For so Worms breed in chiches, vetches, and pease; and in rocket-seeds, when as hot weather falls upon them before they be dried; but in Chiches, when the salt is taken from them, and they become sweet. For nature doth every where breed a living creature, if there be heat and moysture in due proportion. For matter comes from moysture for the heat to work on, and concoct; as we see it happens in Wheat. Worms will breed in the root of it, when, after seed time, Southern winds blow often. Then the root growing moyst, and the Ayre being hot, the heat corrupting the root, ingendreth Worms. And the Worms bred, eat the roots, continually. For nature hath appointed that everything shall feed where it is bred. Another kind of Worm is bred within, when the moysture cannot come forth, shut in by the drinesse of the Ayre about it, then the heat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts it, when the corruption is made. Then also food is administred to it, from the same thing. The same thing seems to happen to Apples and Trees that are Worm-eaten from drought. For the little moysture that remains in the Tree, causeth corruption, whence the Worm proceeds; but when there is plenty of nutriment it is otherwise, for then the juyce is sent forth to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts, for it conquers by its quantity, and cannot corrupt. Next to this is that which happens to Vines, for in these especially when the South wind blows, Worms breed, that are called</hi> Ipes, <hi>that is when they are very moyst, and the Ayre causeth fruitfullnesse, then do they presently gnaw the matter that is of the same nature with them. Also</hi> Carpae <hi>breed in Olive Trees the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52474:141"/>

                  <p>IN <hi>Ganges</hi> it is miraculous, they report there are blew Worms with two legs, that are 60 cubits long, and they say they are so strong, that when Elephants come to drink they will catch hold of them, by their trunk and carry them away. <hi>Aelian</hi> speaks of an <hi>Indian</hi> Worm of seven cubits long, and so thick that a Child of ten yeares old can hardly fathom it. It hath one tooth in the upper part of the mouth, and one below; both are four square, and almost a cubit long, and so strong, that what living creature it lays hold of with them, it will easily crush them. Somtimes it lyes hid in the bottom of a River; in the mud it delights in. At night it comes on land, and catcheth whatsoever comes in the way. The skin of it is 2, fingers thick. The way to catch it is this, they fasten a strong hook to an iron chain, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also to it a rope of white broad flax, and they wrap both the hook and rope in wool, that the Worm may not bite them off. Then they put a Lamb or a Kid for a bait upon the hook, and so let it down into the River. Thirty men stand ready with Darts, Leashes, and drawn Swords, and strong pikes well pointed at the ends, if they should have cause to strike. When he is caught with the hook, they draw him forth and kill him. They hang him up against the Sun 30 dayes, and thick oyl distills from it into earthen pots; every worm will yield 5. <hi>Sextarii</hi> of oyl, the rest of the body is good for nothing. The vertue of this oyl is such, that without any fire, a measure of this poured on, will fire any stack of wood, <hi>Aelian.</hi> It is said, that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> took Cities from his Enemies with this oyl; It cannot be put out but with abundance of thick clay. The moneth of <hi>March</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> is wonderfull, that breeds young creatures in stinking fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy waters, that are like to guts, and feed only on sand.

                  <hi>WAsps</hi> then breed most, when Wolves kill Horses or Oxen. Sometimes they are found in a Stags head, sometimes in his nostrills. One brought one of these formed Wasps houses that was
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52474:141"/>
wonderfully made, to <hi>Pierius Valerianus,</hi> at <hi>Bellunum,</hi> from some Wood in a desart: Which he describes thus: <hi>There were</hi> 7. <hi>Concamerations or rounds, one above another, set at two fingers distance, distinguished by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pillars between, that every one might have space enough to go and come to his house. The diameter of the rounds unto the fifth, was about</hi> 12 <hi>digits; the others from the fifth, were made narrower, by little and little, so that the last was</hi> 5. <hi>or</hi> 6. <hi>digits. The first round, that is, the first Chamber, was hanged to a bough of an old Tree, fenced and guarded with a crust against all injuries of wind and weather; Beneath there were six angled Cells very close together, so that the other Chambers were all overcast with the same crust, and made with the like Cells; and all were held up with their pillars. All these Creatures flew out of the upper stations, and an innumerable multitude filled the middle Concamerations, a thin skin being drawn for a cover upon the hole of every one of them; when I had taken some of them away, I saw the</hi> Wasps <hi>with their heads downwards, that filled all those houses. But those that were in the lowest rooms seemed like to Embryo's of like imperfect Worms; they were also fenced with the same covering, but very thin, as snails in Winter, kept for a milder time in the Spring. But these all died there, by the extream cold Winter, yet none corrupted; and after so many years they keep the same form and posture.</hi> They are most lively; for, part their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their breast, and they will live long, and will sometimes
prick one that toucheth their sting, an hour after. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That if you take a <hi>Wasp</hi> by the legs, and make him to hum, (not those that have a sting, but those that want one) the rest will fly to help them. If they appear before the end of <hi>October,</hi> they foreshew a hard VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If they go in heaps under ground before the 7. Stars rise in the Evening, they signifie the same. A swarm of <hi>Wasps</hi> is naturally an ill omen. So <hi>Livy</hi> thought, when at <hi>Capua,</hi> a great swarm of them flew into the Market place, and settled in <hi>Mars</hi> his Temple. They were collected carefully, and burnt in the fire. The <hi>Decemviri</hi> were commanded to their books, and the Nine-daies sacrifice was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, supplications were made, and the City was purged. If any one touch the skin of a man with the distilled water of the decoction of Hornets or VVasps, the place will so swell, that it will cause men to suspect poyson, or a Dropsie, or some great sicknesse; The remedy is <hi>Theriac</hi> drank or smeered on it, <hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>SInce it is hard to explain the opinions and experiments of all Authors exactly, and what they observed in divers places and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imes, to make a history thereof, and to condemn or allow, for this or that mans relation, what every man hath found to be true by his own use and observation: Perhaps it may so fall out, that neither <hi>Pliny,</hi> nor <hi>Pausanias,</hi> nor others, who seem to comment otherwise than we have found it, ought to be condemned; I will adde a special History of <hi>Silk-worms</hi> bred up at hand, which in the year of Mans Redemption, 1599, at <hi>Rotenburg</hi> at <hi>Tubaris,</hi> I, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care and attention looking into their works and natures, set it down into a Calender. If any thing differing from this, hath been observed in <hi>Greece, India, Italy,</hi> or elsewhere in other Times, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Education, Custom, and the like: though Nature be said to act alwayes the same way, and to vary onely by accidents; yet what they observed will help, that by many mens observation, the history of Nature may be augmented and perfected.</p>
               <p>The Silk-worms eggs that were laid in a clean paper the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which in Winter I kept in a warm Chamber, I exposed them to the Sun, shining through the windows, on the 25 day of <hi>April.</hi> Those which were lead-coloured or black, they did not all in one day become Caterpillars, yet they all were changed before the end of that moneth, the worms creeping forth especially in the morning, as every one was grown to perfection, leaving an empty shell, or covering of a white colour, the egge being eaten on the side, in which place the ends were blackish, by reason of the biting. The purple or Citron coloured, or clear, or distinguished with a black point, brought forth nothing; either because they were not touched
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52474:142"/>
with male seed, or the principle was suffocated in them. These small Catterpillars within the egge obtain their form, and lye wrapt into a Circle; whence the shell being eaten, they first put forth a black shining head; then by degrees, they creep forth, with their little mouthes, and little feet, by their striving. Then I observed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle threds hanging from their mouths, and they were so small, that they could not be seen, unlesse it were against the light: by these they ballance themselves, and hang from the leaves; or wheresoever they fell from higher places, they creep up by them again; or whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were hanged, to try what they would do, they involve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with manifold turnings, and so mount upward, like ordinary Catterpillars that eat leaves and boughes.</p>
               <p>There is a black little worm and hairy, with a white circle near the breast and head, and with another where the belly joyns to the little breast, and yet by reason of the hairinesse, it is not very plain to be seen at the first. At the end of the back, where the belly ends, a little grisle comes forth; and as for the rest of its form, it is the same with the Silk-worms, but that the hairinesse and blacknesse, by some changes in the skin, passe into smoothnesse that shines, and is white; and of a small creature, a worm is made as long as the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle finger of an ordinary man, with the 3. joynts, as thick almost as the little finger; yet they are not all of one bignesse. You shall find some Caterpillars with a three-fold spur in their tails, or a double one; so that the greater of them riseth from the last circle of the back, the lesser ones rise presently from the coat of the tail that is under it. I saw one great one that was on both sides fenced with two lesser ones, in the place whereof there are sometimes onely two points that stick forth. Catterpillars go as Silk-worms do: For they stick the props of their tails into the ground, and then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they go on by circular motion. First drawing up those parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their tails and their hinderfeet: then fastning these upon the distance between their breast and their feet, untill they come unto their breast and former feet; which being fastned, they lift up their tails again, and underprop their steps. For animal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, when some part stands and underprops the rest. So soon as they were bred, I gave them the tender leaves of Mulberries, I put them upon the leaves with a thin knife; or I let them creep upon them of themselves, and I put them together into a woodden box; They set upon the sides and smooth parts of the leaves, above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. For the appendixes of their noses do not hinder them. So I fed them from the end of <hi>April,</hi> or thereabouts, untill the eighth day of <hi>May,</hi> whereon I found they cast their first skin, which was a little black shining mouth, with a slender black skin. They are wont a little before, to pause on it, and to sleep; it is a renewing sleep, if it be a sleep properly. So soon as their old skin is cast, they appear greater presently, smoother, and of a more shining black, for the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny covering of the head that growes under the old, is greater in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. When the skin is off, the rest of the body swells, as if the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52474:143"/>
narrownesse of the skin hindred it to grow so great before. The same covering or skull of the head, when it is new, is white; but when it is confirmed, it grows black again, untill there be many changes. But as, before they put off their skin, they abstain from food, so a little after they seem to grow sluggish. For their mouthes are too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to feed on leaves. Whilest they run over the leaves, oft-times one goes over another, and they willingly endure it, if they be not hurt too much. For then lifting up their little breast, they will shake their heads, moving them here and there, and the Silk-worms do the same. Food is given them once and again, and the multitude of them remains in a narrow place. When they have eat enough, they grow sleepy. Then you shall see them like Statues, or such as are taken with a <hi>Catoche,</hi> lifting up their mouths and breasts growing stiff upon the leaves. But if you cast in new food, they wake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently and feed again. They seem to perceive the new leaves by smelling them. For before they touch them, they will raise their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies toward them. Yet you may suppose that is done by some altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the feeling quality. The excrement of their belly is then small and black like to Gun-powder.</p>
               <p>The 16 day of <hi>May</hi> some of them cast their skins the second time, some slept, and the dayes following cast off their skins. They break near the head, and they stick to the leaves, the Caterpillars coming forth by circles moved in order. The little mouth also doth not fall away presently, but hangs for a time about the new mouth. Then the black colour changeth into grey, and the Caterpillars grow grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but the breast is white, and so full of juice, that it is almost transparent. But because they do not all change their skins in one day, if you please you may part the one that doth, from the other that doth not. But I left them together, and onely gave the new ones new food, the rest yet sleeping in their old clothes, and waiting for their change. For you cannot then cleanse their stall, but you must defer it till they awake, and can be invited to new leaves. The third change began the 22 of <hi>May,</hi> when many of them slept, some of them put off their coats. It was no longer so black, but it was white, with the little mouth; and the worms came forth whiter, leaving their old skin: they were more rugged that did not stick to the leaves by threds; and those lesse, that did. For these skins were long and triangular hanging so high. Downward they rise sharp in the middle, which, I conceive, happeneth, by the top of the tail drawn thither, and lifting up the skin. The last extremity of this cast skin is like to a fishes forked tail. The Caterpillars once more freed, fed till the 25 day, and then I observed them to sleep a renewing sleep, and some new ones of them the same day. More slept on the 26 day, some on the 27; very few on the 28 and 29th dayes, that now the difference was greater. But those that slept on the 27th day, were changed the next day, and fed again after a little pause.</p>
               <p>With this fourth change of Catterpillars were made Silk Worms, smooth and white, yet with lead colour'd spots, and a mouth like a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52474:143"/>
white horn. This is the first moneth of their life, and their first age. But since in the third and fourth change of their skin, all things are more easily observed, and known, I shall somthing more accurately describe them. Catterpillars neer their third and fourth change, have their skins somthing more ill favoured, and stiffer than for the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Worm. Wherefore a soft skin comes up underneath, and the other falls off by degrees: and because they stick with some nervous bands on both sides, wherein there are some prints of spots, and these are not easily broken, they strive more to cast them off, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sleep two days almost, when therefore they come forth, their old horny mouth is parted from the new that comes up under it. The Worm it self, when the cast skin sticks to the leaves, pulls up his feet and little legs, somtimes pulling them up, somtimes slackning them again, untill she hath pull'd them out of their old covers. In the mean time the skin on their sides is wrinkled, the skaly divided body being contracted into it self, and extended again. So the old skin is loosned from the whole body. By and by the Worm goes foward, and draws the bands on the sides by degrees, the skales being thrust forward orderly, and then drawn in again, that at first you would doubt whether the Worm would come forth before or behind. But this way are the bands broken. First you shall observe it to move forward neere the brest, for there the points depart, and you shall see two in the cast skin, two in the worm. Moreover whilst the skales are drawn, a violet colour'd line as it were is in both sides of the cast skin, both by reason of the points and of the bands applied to both sides. In the mean while the tayle is wrinkled, the feet are freed, and a new worm creeps forth in half a quarter of an hour, that hath an old mouth joyn'd to its mouth, as a Mule with a headstal, you shall see also a white string that it draws at the end of the tail, wherby the skin stuck to the back of it: when they are fast they strive but easily, but when they are loose, they turn themselvs strangely on their backs, sides, bellies, till they can get loose. Some of their skins cast, are round; some long. If you take it by both ends, you may draw it out to its full length, with the points of all the feet and skales, for nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the little mouth. The fourth skin in this change is far whiter then the third, as also the covering of the head. These Worms are now Silk-worms, if you take good care to feed them, and govern them rightly; They are fat and white, but some more than others, for some seem yellowish, some almost lead-coloured. The feet and mouth at first are soft, wherefore they stay a while from touching or feeding on leavs. They stick fast to them, and by help of their tails, they can draw themselvs in and out. The hinder feet are thicker and blunter, as it were with 3, joynts, and in the middle a black spot, which I think to be the instrument they hold by, because she can at pleasure pull it in and out, as Cats do their claws. The forefeet do not only serve to go with, but to lay hold on leavs to help their body in passing, to draw the threds, and for other uses. The parts from head to tail in length, on the back are the head, the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52474:144"/>
bunch or wrinkled swelling of the brest, eight semicircular scales, and a three forked taile. The swelling of the brest neere the head is white in some, in some it is distinguished with two black and blew spots, which are divided with a yellow line, and in severall ones it is seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made. For in some the colour is more remisse and watry, and not so visible, in others it is more deep. But where that bunch ris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, there are seen 4, knots, and the skin that is by them is wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The half Circles follow. They are joyn'd with a very thin mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, as it were by a green line from blew. But the skales are white though in some of them there is somthing of a lead colour that shines under, and when the Silk-worms are ready for their Silkwork, they become of a spiceous colour, and all of them are marked with one spot on each side, with a little circle about it. I said there were bands, which appeare also in the <hi>Aurelia.</hi> Lastly the eighth scale is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distinguished by two black and blew spots, or moonlike semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circles, which two half Moons one respecting the other with their horns are there inscribed. But they are not equall in all, for somtimes they are more conspicuous, somtimes more fading, fine, thin, lead co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd, white. Hence there are two small Circles, and that which follows these, hath two knots, untill that which is next the rump, and raiseth the tip or point; In the great ones there are observed bunchings forth in all the skales, but they are more eminent in the third skale. The skull is horny, but it is divided as it were into 3. parts, the right and left, which you would take to be marks of the eyes, and then the setting together of the mouth, which are again distinguished into the appendices and the jaws, wherein stand the saw-like teeth, The throat runs through all the length of the back, as farr as the props of the taile, upon which in the last skale is the end of the Belly. Also there are to be seen in the back, as far as the Plectrum of the tayle, some nervs moveable with a continuall pulsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the heart and arteries use to move, and these nervs are yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from white, and when they are drawn asunder, they discover a green throat or intestine. They stick to the plectrum, as if there were some passage for breathing, though they do not breathe. But it is no doubt but there is the Seat of life, though I discovered in the young ones a kind of red part, as I shall shew underneath, beating by it self alone like the heart, when that plectrum is cut, a moyst yellowish liquour comes forth, and the Worms themselves do not dye, but they stirr the more violently, and roule and turn themselves that you will judge that they are in great pain, the nervous principle being hurt. The dung of them represents their meat, for it is dry with six corners long, as it were set with eyes, whence one may collect the disposition of the gut or belly. They are green from their food, but because they are hard, and without moysture, they seem black, as those that are more moyst seem more green. Here if you mark you may distinguish the males from the females. For the females here, as the Philosopher writes of other females are greater, fatter, moyster, softer, whiter than the males, which are more rude, more spotted
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52474:144"/>
with wan spots, and more slender. If you handle them you shall find them all to be cold. They use oft to rayse themselves on their hinder feet, and to stand so like statues. When they will feed they fasten on the sides and swelling veins of leaves, contrary to Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars. I believe the appendixes of their mouths hinder them, yet they afford some help for their former feet to hold their meat with. They eat the leaves round, that they leave a round pit. When they are full they go aside, and they rest many together on a heap; I think they are delighted with mutuall heat; you may discern those that sleep, from those that cast their skin, by observing the pulsation in their back. For the motion in those that sleep is equall to those that wake; but when they cast their skins, it is slower and lesse, that you would then think they were sick. Also those that sleep have but one mouth; but such as cast their skins, shew a little mouth besides. But this is not in Silk-worms, but whilst they are yet Catterpillars. Some of them being four times renewed, have a filthy dark head, and yet they feed on. Some do not increase much, but continue small.</p>
               <p>We said before, that from <hi>May</hi> 25, to <hi>May</hi> 29, the fourth change is made in divers of them. From this time to <hi>June,</hi> the 7th, and 8th, 9, 10, 11th, they feed greedily, and grow fat and great; and I was forced three times a day, and about the last days, four times a day to give them meat, or oftner. For when they are almost ripe for Silk work, they eat more greedily, going with great courage to the leaves and biting off the nervs. You shall note that about 13 days passe between their fourth change, and their abstinence from meat, and provision to make their Silk. For the times answer one the other, from the 25, of <hi>May</hi> to the 7, of <hi>June,</hi> from 26, to 8, from 27, to 9, from 28, to 10, from 29, to 11, wherein I included the last, except one small male, that fed longer. About the last days, many begin to grow of a spiceous colour, which begins to appeare more evidently on the hinder part, and from thence to enlarge and go forward to the bunch of the breast, though others are more, and almost all yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; some remaine white with blew mingled with it. When they must dye, they go to the sides of the chest, nor will they bite the leaves, though they creep over them. Some fasten their threds at the corners, as if they were beginning the entry; others creep by the outsides, and seek here and there for a fit place to lye hid in. I shut many of them in, with paper-Coffins, which I disposed of and fastned commodiously in some place, in which by gnawing and rending the sides, they do make a noise for a while, but afterwards by voiding a dry and moyst excrement of their belly, (for they void out both) by their hinder parts, they fasten them so fast to the paper, that you would think they were glewed. Afterwards for 3, days continually they make a little bladder, which being absolved they lay aside their fifth skin, with their head and tayle and are transformed into a nympha again. Some I did not shut up in papers, but disposed them in a wodden chest with boughs, and let them choose a nest for themselves; you shall observe thence, that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52474:145"/>
they seek chiefly for corners and hiding places, and oft times many of them make their Silk in the same place, if it may be; some order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, right forward, others obliquely, others broad ways. If the place be too narrow, the wrong end of the skin is pressed together on the side, nor doth it containe perfectly Oval. One of these cases is longer, thicker, larger than another for the greatnesse and strength of the Silk-worm. They differ also in colour; some are Gold, Silver, Citron colours, and they are double. For some are greenish, some more yellow, though others call all these green. The first of them all, as I observed, was white, except some few that send a yellowish tow before. Some of Gold colour have their inward coat white, nor is the yellow colour certain. For when the cases are unfolded in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the silk growes white; and in dye, yellow, &amp;c. But it is worth your labour to contemplate the matter of the silk; and what that is, that yields a thred so long.</p>
               <p>When therefore I saw a great worm to wander, I put a line about his neck, and dissected him. He lived stoutly when his throat was tied, and felt acutely. For at every incision of his back, the knife scarce touching him, he would tosse himself violently, as if he would help himself with his mouth and forefeet. His skin being divided, I saw his long gut, as in a pike, the forepart was swoln and wide, the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part narrower. On that gut did the nerves or beating arteries lye, with a continuall <hi>systole</hi> and <hi>diastole,</hi> and they ended on the <hi>plectrum</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> tayl. When I cut off this, not onely a yellow clear hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour did break forth, but the heads of the nerves, put themselves forth in the motion, and their stirring grew weaker. The Intestine hath a double coat, one thick outward coat, and another thin one within. The thick coat feels accurately, and it is near the throat co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with much glutinous matter, which afterwards becomes matter for their wings, and of the hairinesse of the Silk-worm, as the external excrementitious moysture becomes the <hi>Aurelia,</hi> or outward shell. When the thick coat is pricked, the intestine comes forth, yet wrapt with a thin coat, and it contains much of the meat they eat the day before of green leaves. Also you may see, when the skin is cut, and the thick coat of the Intestine, that moysture will run forth in abundance, that is transparent, which I think is their blood, and by concoction is changed into silk, and the parts of the Creature. The head cut off, the beginning of the throat swells forth, and doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the blunt head of the <hi>Nympha.</hi> The gut being taken out with the <hi>foeces</hi> contain'd in the <hi>abdomen,</hi> there are seen, like worms, some glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous clammy concretions, some yellow, some white, two very great, the rest small, so like worms, that nothing wants but a skin and life. They are sharp at both ends. They are so placed in the belly, that both their points are turned toward their tail, and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of them is doubled; you would say it were their yarn folded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If they begin to spin from the points, it is necessary that they be drawn from the tail to the mouth. I think that the small whitish pieces make weaker silk and towe; but the greater, the stronger. I
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52474:145"/>
took out these worms, and I found that they dryed presently on the paper, and became hard and brittle, as Ox glew useth to do, and as the Tendons and Intestines of living creatures. The body of it, is all of one kind and transparent, that no man can draw it into so fine and small thred; but this labour must be left to the Silk-worm, as webs to the Spiders. The outward skin was white, mingled with lead colour; but within, it was drawn with a little skin black and blew in part; and partly with a shining gold colour as in a Herring. About the belly where the matter of the silk lay, the substance was pretty thick, consisting of nervous deductions, and a texture containing a white fat, infolded with nervous coats; the like is found afterwards in the young Nymphs of Silk-worms; and they have a matrix and a genital member. Under that substance there are lead-colour'd bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches let down into their feet like to tendons or chords. This skin, the matrix and genital member remaining, is put oft in weaving their silk, with all the parts that stick forth: so that the Nymph, and Butterfly that riseth from thence, borrow nothing from the Silk-worm but the belly and gut, and the nervous parts that are in them. There remains in the gut and genitals a great deal of moysture. From whence afterwards growes the matter of the seed, and excrements of the belly. But the humour that is in the Intestine is yet raw, and is partly green, partly yellow, something thick, and elsewhere thin. If one part the fat from the nervous coats of the genitals, and smeer it on paper, when it is dry it will be like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ewer, and brittle. You may compare it with milk in fishes. Therefore it is apparent, that in the Silk-worm these members are outward; Its threefold feet, the skaly joynting of the belly, the breast, head, mouth, the <hi>anus,</hi> skin, tail, <hi>plectrum</hi>: but within is the Intestine, the vital arteries, or the nerves, the white flesh of the breast, the genitals, betwixt which and the Intestine, is contain'd the matter for Silk; and besides those, the pannicles and nervous membranes, in which the parts are contain'd. Whether they have any heart, let others seek out: yet there must be some such Principle; and that not in the head, nor any where but near the breast, whence the vital force is sent through the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: And this is manifest chiefly by motion of the nerves or arteries (as I may call them) in the back of the belly, not of the breast, so far as the hollow of the tail. I will speak afterwards of the nymphs and young silk-worms: Now I will add what I observed in their making of silk.</p>
               <p>When they abstain from meat, and, as I said, they seek for a place to make their case; they have commonly about the end of their belly a green wan mark, the other part of their body is white with green, or wan, and of a spiceous colour. Then I saw them often make it as they went up and down, and to gape at the mouth, as it were Cows chewing the cud, when as out of their gorge they pull back their meat to chew on. Then it is likely, that the Silk-worms strive to turn the matter of the silk toward their mouths, and to draw it out. If you put them into a paper Coffin, you shall hear them gnawing
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52474:146"/>
a whole day, and then into the bottom of this Coffin like a Fryars cowl, they put down their excrement, first dry, like a black green pill or yellow. The last pill but one is commonly green, the last is yellow, and sanious. The number of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is dung is, as their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments abound. For I found in one paper, sometimes two little knobs, sometimes more, to 12, of divers colours, as black, green, yellow, and those not with bright spots, but round. When the last yellow pill comes forth, watry matter comes forth of divers colours, and a different consistence. For some part is thicker, some thinner, having some red colour with yellow and green; yet some of the <hi>sanies</hi> is bloody and blackish; such it appears on a clean paper, where you may sometimes see green polluted with yellow; sometime some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like chalk. In a glasse, it is like to Lye. But that you may not doubt whether she voids it by her mouth or her belly; know, that she makes her silk onely out of her mouth, and her excrements by her belly. Yet they send forth moysture also out of their mouth, when they are sick, or strangled, or pressed. I found a Silk-worm that was at liberty, that put forth both these excrements behind. Some of them void forth much moysture, others but a little. They that void much seem to be the weaker, and to have gathered lesse silk. For many of them make small silk cases, but not all. It is doubtful what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the silk will be. For I was often deceived by observing their heads, backs, bellies and feet. All of them do not make silk of the same colour; and oft-times the towe and utmost coat is white, but the middle silk is gold-coloured. I thought the Silk-worms that were of a spiceous colour would make yellow; and the white ones, white silk; but that was false. For both drew white. Once and again I judged right, that a Citron coloured female would make such a thred: yet such was also drawn by that silk-worm, whose belly was Lead-colour with white, and the spot in the fore-head yellow. I saw a female also all white, that made white silk. In small and narrow papers, yet according to the Worms proportion, lesser cases are made, but thicker, with lesse towe; yet I observed little cases in the larger. They that are not shut up, but choose a place freely, they consume much thred in towe at random: whence the silk is much lost. For their cases are lesse, and not wrought so thick. If you will observe, you may know exactly the reason of their spinning in these things.</p>
               <p>For when they have wandred a time, and have begun here and there to make their entrance of their work, (which they do by diligent bending of their bodies, whilest sticking by their hinder feet, they do variously move their head and their whole breast upwards, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, backwards, forwards, and on all sides, if there be a fit place to fasten their silk threds, which they do not by sight, but by touching; for they have dull eyes) then they draw forth their threds, and the foundations of their house, and that simple or manifold, as they find need of a strong foundation. If it be near the pavement, they stick to it with their hinder part; and if it be aloft, they hang by the same,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52474:146"/>
or from boughs, or any other place. For they turn their breast and head freely; and if there be need, they change the situation of their hinder parts. Thus the entrance of their first work is made. Now the dry excrements are voided from their belly; the Entrance being finished, so that now the Silk-worm is secure and free from outward injuries: she voids the last dung with moisture, of which I spake before. The towe is oft polluted with this, yet it runs off to the bottom. When her belly is emptied, the spinner ceaseth for a while, and puts forth her <hi>anus,</hi> as if she had a <hi>Tenasmus.</hi> Then she calls back the matter of the true silk, and continues that to her last breath, and till her silk work is ended. Then by degrees she thickens her threds from a large to a narrower compasse, so that it becomes an ovall figure, in the hollow whereof she may turn her self. Her mouth, breast, and forefeet are in a continued motion. The hinder parts stick, yet are they translated to another place, when she makes the bottom or the top. They that make their cases in the ground or pavement, they seem to sit on the naked pavement; but by degrees they weave threds under them, and in all parts they thicken the whole case alike, except in the point, to which in straight places they cannot reach. Therefore the frame of this is made more at first, but the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis more in the end: Though this be not neglected at the beginning. Wherefore when the threds are unfolded, by untwisting them, the point is first made plain, and the inward coat is left, like a finger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. So they weave to the third day; and you may see them working the second day, if you hold the case to the Sun. In paper hoods the base is made upwards, the top downwards: and in two dayes it appears but thin. The third day it is thickned: and then the worm puts off her old skin, and becomes a nymph, which may easily be observed: for when they weave, yet they stick fast; neither is their dull falling down yet perceived. But when it becomes a Nymph, as if it were a stone shut in, shake the case and the Nymph falls down. And this dull falling down endures untill it be changed into a young Worm. For then the empty place is fill'd again, and the Worm sticks to the case, seeking to come forth. There was one Worm I had, that made a case, whose entrance, amongst those were shut in a Paper, was a solid coat: in those that are at liberty, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of threds disposed and drawn divers ways to and fro. Some have observed in one case two or three shut in; but when the place would be too narrow, that case cut was common to them three, and the Silk-worms found within were become close together, so that they seemed like to 3, fingers joyned, when they were all set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they worked a little, but it was but a little. It is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that some Silk-worms in paper made no Silk, but presently turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Nymphs; I think this befell them, because they fed on lettice, (yet not to them all) or to such as had too little meat given them, or that were sick and could not gather matter of Silk, which I suppose is made of abundant blood like fat, and laid apart. Other strange things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; whereof in their proper place. All their cases are long and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52474:147"/>
ovall. Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> I saw a white one almost exactly round, that it had a basis sphaericall on both sides without any point. It was small with its fore-house, but yet thick as it should be. But the silk-worm in that did not go to be a Nymph, nor a perfect young worm, as I shall shew by and by. It seems a question whether they draw forth the silk out of the end of their belly, or out of their mouth, though they alwaies distribute it with their mouth and their forefeet. It is no small argument, because that near the props of their tail at the bottom of their belly, a chink is seen, and both ends of the silk-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the belly lie to that place: Also the voiding of the Excrements at the beginning of their working, confirms this. For as when a woman is to be delivered of a child, what faeces there are in the bladder and the right intestine, that is voided and pressed forth; so we may think the silk matter striving to come forth in the Silk-worm doth the like. When she begins to labour, her belly swells more; from the belly begins the maturity, known by the yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; That comes first out, as being first ready. Also Caterpillars and Silk-worms, stick to the pavement, with a hairy down about their feet. Some are observed to weave on their backs, that the silk may be drawn out of their belly, and may the more easily be ordered by their mouths and feet. This may be alledged for the first opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But stronger arguments prove this to be false. For you may see with your eyes, that when the belly rests, threds are drawn out of their mouths, and they sticking by their clamminesse, are drawn out by degrees, by turning back their necks. And therefore Silk-worms do not onely so draw their threds lying on their backs, but lying also on their bellies where yet the whole Worm turns her self freely. Then it cannot come forth by the tail, nor by the chap under the tail. For from the place of the silk to the Intestine, there is no passage: and the chap of the tail, that notes out the genitals of the young worm that shall be, is covered with a skin, Moreover, before the silk comes forth, oft-times the silk-worms do cry and mutter, as if they were r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y to vomit, drawing the matter to their throats. Nor do they swell about their tails, but about the middle of their bellies; Also in a Coffin of paper, when no thred appeared on their feet, I saw them draw it forth with their mouth onely, and to fasten it; and the 2d. of <hi>June,</hi> when I earnestly observed one making its case, I drew the beginning of the thred out of the worms mouth, when it was wet, to its full length, the belly and the feet having no silk upon them. So Caterpillars hang by the mouth, their thred coming out there. Nor do Spiders and Palmer-worms on trees make their webs otherwise. And so much for this question.</p>
               <p>When the Case is made, the Silk-worm is changed into a Nymph, and the fleeces are taken, first choosing what males and females you please, for preservation of their kind. Some say you may know their sex by the colour of their case; some by the bignesse: And this is some argument. For, because females are commonly the greater, they make also the greater houses. Yet sometimes we are deceived;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52474:147"/>
for a strong male may make a greater case than a weak female. I have seen them both of a bignesse, and I have seen females, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in other places, to make far lesse houses than my males. Wherefore the signs must also concur, observed in the silk-worms themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which before. The other cases are cast into scalding water, that the worms may dy, or they are choaked with the heat of an oven, after the bread is taken forth, taking care they burn not. Then taking away the Towe, maid-servants or such as can labour, are ready, who may loosen the beginnings of the threds; which being found out, many of them are cast into a bason of cold or warm water, and the servant Maid sitting ready with a drawing instrument, doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually roll down 30 or 40, or more threds joyned together. If the thred break any where, the fellow-labourer must seek for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and give it again to him that unwinds it. That is continued untill they come to the inward coat, which being very difficult to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twist, it is dryed and pull'd into towe and kembed. When the threds are thus untwisted, they send much dust into the Ayr, and you may see in the bottom of the vessel some filth that fell from the silk. I tryed carefully, whether I could with one work unwind a whole case not breaking it, taking away the Towe, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its various foldings together, weaknesse, and divers principles, cannot be untwisted at once drawing. I obtain'd my desire onely in the middle of the silk; for that which is before the house is wont to break easily, but the middle holds best. The last coat, by the weight added to it, (for then the Nymph falls down) was unfolded by me with great care to the thin skin, which was scarce equall to the thumbs nail. Those cases are best untwisted, whose basis and top answer diametrically; but those are harder, whose top is bound, and they that are crooked or bunched. For here the thred sticks and is tangled, that it will hardly yield without breaking. First, the point is made bare, and untwisted all to the middle of the case.— The thred of one silk case was as long as this line here drawn, when it was drawn forth 7000 times, and in one it was above 8000 times longer: yet they are not all of one thicknesse and greatnesse; which may be seen, by drawing them asunder into little skins. For some fleeces I drew into 12, some into 8, more or lesse coats.</p>
               <p>The wild Silk-worm hath an entrance, a single coat, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a thicker case: wherefore the thinner cases easily yeeld to the fingers pressing them, but the thicker will resist. When the top hath a hole almost to the middle, that the Nympha may easily fall forth; she falls with her cast skin, wherein there is both her head and all her feet. Somtimes commonly the head of this old skin is over against the top of the case, that we may understand that it was cast off, whilst the Worm when the case was perfected, doth bend and turn her self upwards through narrow streets. The Crown of the Nympha is toward the basis, the tail toward the top; and being that the Silk-worm is above twice as long, the Nympha is contracted to a small bignesse, that it is scarse so long as the middle joynt of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

finger of a man. She is alive, and gives tokens that she is so, by the moving of her top or tail when she is touched. If you regard her outward forme, you would say she is a scaly Worm, and her head is covered with a bag. The scales are dark coloured, as if they were staind with smoke, and they are eight in number, as farr as the confines of the Crown: On the sides of each of them there are two round points, out of which the tendons or bands appertain to the young Silk-worm. On the Crown there is a white spot, as if the mouth of the young Silk-worm shined through it, with three little black spots. After this on the foremost part there are prints of feet and horns, and on the hinder part toward the sides, are prints of wings, If you will observe the inward parts, the fourth day before it is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a young Silk-worm, after it hath lain hid, you may open it, you shall see nothing else but a common empty place, and in this only three distinct humours. One of a watry thin substance, of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour; This is equally diffused through the whole space. The other is red, like blood; This sticks in the upper part, where the head and brest will be; you would judge it to be the rudiment of the heart, because I saw the like afterwards in the young Silkworm, a certain Masse that moved of it self, if a heart may be attributed to this creature. The third humour is white and yellow; and it is like to a hen egge, cast into a hot water and run about; or like cheese-curds, if you add some yellow to them. Where you see the prints of wings and feet outwardly, there lies hid a phlegmatique clammy matter, fit to make the membranes of, you shall see no distinction of parts; I think the life is in the nervous coat, that is next under the outward shell. For the Silk-worm in that part was exceeding sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and had a motion of the heart and arteries; you would call this a little bladder fill'd with humours, which yet compared to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia,</hi> after the young Silk-worm is crept forth, is far thicker, and you would say it were a shell cloathed on the inside with coats and a tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious glow. After this, is the down of the young Silk-worm, the wings, feet, skin, and the other outward parts. So the Silk-worm passeth into throat and belly, for whose sake only it was detain'd there. Yet here appeareth no green colour which was much in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine of the Silk-worm now ready to spin. Part therefore was void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the case was made, and part was changed into some other juyce. In the tip of the tayle there was also some clammy matter like to the raw white of an egge. I thought it to be the rudiment of the genitall parts. For with that the matrix &amp; spermatical Vessels were cast off, the beginning whereof is seen also in the belly of the Silk-worm. The humours taken on a clean paper and dried, were stain'd with black, as if you had mingled ink with them, yet the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowy substance remain'd white, and in some places a red and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish spot appeared with a white spot like chalk: whence we may collect that that blacknesse was only from a watery yellow humour, which only shined on the paper where it stuck thick, like to shining ink. The rest of the Nymphs, partly deprived of all Silk, and naked
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52474:148"/>
partly shut up yet in a single coat, partly safe in the whole Silken case, I handled with no other care, but I only putt them up in a box, and set them in my window, yet I distinguished them into divers Cells, such as I thought to be females, and such as I thought to be males, and I was not deceived in more than one only. So from the first shutting them in, untill they came forth, there passed 26, or 27, days, setting them in my study to the afternoon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sun in the heat of <hi>June,</hi> as it was very hot in 99. For the female that was buried on the 11, of <hi>June,</hi> came forth a young Silk-worm on the 8, of <hi>July.</hi> A male that began to spin on the 9, of <hi>June,</hi> on the fifth of <hi>July</hi> became a butterfly. The same day two females came forth out of two greater white cases, and one male from a lesse yellow case. On the sixth of <hi>July</hi> in the morning (for they all come forth in the morning) a male came out of a white case, he was dusky colour'd and rough; and a white female very tender, with a great belly, and with great wings, came out of a case that was yellow and greenish. Also before on the second of <hi>July,</hi> a male crept forth of a Gold colour'd case, and a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male out of a white one.</p>
               <p>These began their Silken case the tenth of <hi>June.</hi> When young Silk-worms are ready to come forth of whole cases, when you shake it, you shall find no more a dull weight; and then the aurelia opens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the back of the thorax; after that a great deal of cleare humour that is white is powred out of the mouth, and the place grows wet, where they will make their passage. This way they came forth with labouring and striving. I saw a female coming forth on the 8th, of <hi>July</hi>; she sent so much moysture before her, that a great drop fell into the box. Then her head appeared, she striving with her feet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. By degrees, after her head, she put forth these; and presently she stood upon the pavement with them, and by striving by little and little, she drew forth the Circles of her belly; that when the first was drawn forth, and she would draw out the second, she drew up all her foreparts, that so she mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ht pull forth the next roundle; yet it is very like, that by that contracting of her self, the hole was made wider that her belly at last might come forth with lesse paine. Her divers turning side ways, helps for this also. In the meane while the thicker young Silk-worms and such as have more moysture in their bellies, presse somthing forth when they strive, and they do besmeer the case where the hole is, both inside and outside with a plaister-like clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynesse. They that labour lesse and are slenderer, leave but little. Then you shall see the whole hoary case, somthing wet by the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture comes forth of their mouths, and made easy to passe through. Somtimes they are wont to be quiet, and oft times to inflate their bellies, to draw it forth and draw it in againe, as if they did set their disioynted limbs, and put them in their true places. And they do so draw forth and loosen the circles, that the joynts stick up fill'd with a yellow humour, as if they were inflated. You shall see the naked Nymphs, when the butterflye is perfect within, two or three dayes before to move themselves, as if they would break the bands by
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52474:149"/>
which the young Silk-worm is tied to the <hi>Aurelia.</hi> I then opened one of them with my knife and nailes, that I might see the congruity of the outward with the inward parts. That I did, the fourth of <hi>July,</hi> when as then about 20, days were passed from the time of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Silk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The first skale being removed, about the beginning of the little breast on the backside I saw the tender upper circle of the belly; it was skinny covered with a moyst down, yet so short and made plain that the down could scarce be seen. Under the place of the side wings, which in the <hi>Aurelia</hi> you may compare to the Shoulder blades, two true wings of the young Silk-worm did lye hid, joynd together, and one laid upon the other. They were all short and tender, as not being yet perfect in quantity. Between the wings of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he thorax, the latter knob appeared, fenced on both sides with long hairynesse, but not yet covered over. The wings and this red part being dispatched, I came to the upper lines bending downwards; under these were their horns. But under those that followed, the feet on the brest did lye; being bent obliquely and directed to their belly. Under the white spot on the Crown of the Nympha, the hairy Crown of the young Silk-worm, and the hinder part of the head are placed; next to which lyes the print of the eyes, like to two black spots, which are divided with a cleft like a Lyons lip, the whole belly is like to white paint. The hairs of it are very wet, and appeare smooth. They have roundells, as well as the Silk-worm and the Nymph. But I did not open the whole young Silk-worm, but he by his striving pull'd himself forth of the rest of the <hi>Aurelia.</hi> I saw with what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour he unloosed the bands of his belly, which like white cords do hang from the points of the circles, and are left in the empty <hi>Aurelia.</hi> The fundament sticks also fast, wherefore the tip of the <hi>Aurelia</hi> is contracted toward the brest inwardly. The male was with hairs and wings imperfect. I left him in the box. He lay still, till the next day. Then he grew white by degrees, and the downynesse was seen more exactly. The wings also grew, and then he grew more jocund, and being admitted, the third day he copulated stoutly. What these young Silk-worms are, appeares by what we now say, and did say before: we must add this; that the belly in the <hi>Aurelia</hi> is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and when it comes forth it becomes greater and longer by a third part, by distending and inflating it. In the <hi>Aurelia,</hi> there is a threefold rupture from the Crown through the back of the thorax, and there the young Silk-worm comes forth. The other parts are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
               <p>All the rest of the young Silk-worms being come forth before the 14th of July, two cases remained whole, as if they would yield no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, though they were very thick. One was a small round male; the other a female twice as long, and pretty large, a little about the back the worm was raised with a little bunch. The colour of the Towe of both was white; but in the Citron-colour'd, the silk was greenish, though it were a more watry colour in that. When I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the round Coffin with the edge of my knife, a carcasse appeared
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52474:149"/>
outwardly, half a Silk-worm, half a Nymph. The forepart was a plain Silk-worm, the latter a Nymph; for it had not put off the whole skin, but onely the latter part, which was next it in the case<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The carcasse lay crooked, so that the forefeet in the breast touched almost the first pair of the hinder feet. For here between the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation of the hinder feet, and the second, the skin was broken; So that the Nymph was covered with her former skin, wherein was her head and breast with 6. feet, and part of her belly with the two first. The skin and the <hi>Aurelia</hi> being removed, within there lay a perfect male young silk-worm, and it had been living, as appeared; for that striving to come forth two dayes before I made Infection, he had wet the case with his moysture; and the 19 of <hi>July,</hi> when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly freed him, he shew'd clear signs of motion in his belly and feet: The cause why he could not clear himself and come forth was found, in the close sticking of the Silk-worm's skull, and of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet, the coat being fastned to it by nature. Therefore though in the back of the Thorax he had made a gap both in the <hi>Aurelia</hi> and the cast skin, yet could he not pull forth his head and feet; so he fainted by degrees.</p>
               <p>Here I observed the policy of Nature: For when in putting off the cast skin the forefeet are plucked off, and the hinder feet depart also; yet there are prints left, under which afterwards others grow up. And the sins of the wings were inserted into the holes of the old silk-worm, and the whole head of the new silk-worm, with the horns of the head were shut in a covering. This was the male. The Female quite dead, seemed yet more monstrous. The Silk-work being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished (which was a great silk case, and as long as two joynts of ones little finger, but the males was thinner a great deal;) The silk-worm strove to cast off the skin, that was white, light, and shining within side, but outwardly hairy and yellowish, and he had drawn forth his whole back, that bunched forth extreamly, his foreparts being contracted circularly; but he could not free himself of the little mouth that stuck too fast. Wherefore there you might see the head of the cast skin, the crown of the Nympha, and of the <hi>Necydalus</hi> joyn'd together: which conjunction kept the skin upon the belly, that it could not be totally cast off, and drawn forth. Wherefore it stuck so with the point of the belly, as if it were shut into a sack, and bound about the head; but a hole being made on the backside, it might have drawn forth the back, but it would yet have stuck by the head and fundament, so lying crooked and dead. The cast skin was thus. Out of this also stuck forth the <hi>Aurelia,</hi> as concerning the upper part. Again, out of the <hi>Aurelia</hi> almost the entire young Silk-worm had wrested it self; breaking the shell on the back-side, and in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place, but the head stuck fast not to be pull'd asunder, as also the outmost parts of the belly. In the belly put forth was seen a great number of yellow eggs. For the female presently within the <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> perfects her Eggs in her matrix, but they are unfruitfull till the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52474:150"/>
male besprinkled them. I saw one lay eggs that had coupled with no male. Hence it was clear, how Nature puts off the old skin with the form of it first, and then passeth into a Nymph; the <hi>Aurelia</hi> whereof being again put off, out comes the <hi>Necydalus.</hi> This was a triple formed Monster, worthy to contemplate of. In this also you might observe the <hi>Aurelia,</hi> on that part the wings were marked, to be black and dark, as if it had been in hot smoke: then how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch the female <hi>Necydalus</hi> had striven to come forth, was plain by the eyes that stuck out in the distances of the skaly circles. Sometimes the circles of the belly stick together by contiguitie, a thin skin coming between them. But in this the circles were so disjoynted, that the girdle of the juncture was larger than the circle. The top of the belly of the cast skin, and of the <hi>Aurelia</hi> were transparent against the light, so that you might exactly discover all about it. The end of the <hi>Necyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> came as far as the middle capacity of the <hi>Aurelia</hi>; the <hi>Necydalus</hi> was hairy about the back, though imperfectly, as also the wings were not yet of their full bignesse. And thus much for Monsters.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Necydalus</hi> is lusty, it is full of life, chiefly in the breast. For when the head and tail are cut off, it will move the wings strongly, and run with its feet, and that till the next day or longer. The female being cut in the belly, shews her matrix full of Eggs; that when 400 are laid, there are more behind. It seemed to be wrapped in a very thin coat. There appeared also some nervous pipes, like the passages of the guts. In the middle of the belly a little bladder was seen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an earthy juyce, that was yellow or russet colour. This bladder of it self had a continual <hi>systole</hi> and <hi>diastole.</hi> I thought the principle of life was there as in the heart. About the neck of the matrix there was a double white nervous knot, like to the bladder of animals; it was hard and shining, and that within the belly. I shall speak of the dug-like processions afterwards. There was one little knot that was bigger, and another that was lesse. The neck of the matrix is like to a pipe; to which being full of juice, there are joyn'd without on both sides two yellow knots like to brests. About the neck there is a circle with horny reins, that are broad, and blunter on the top, with which she takes hold of the genital of the male. The breast is fleshy. The head is membranous and horny. The horns triangular, with a white back sticking up, but the wings are let down on both sides, to make the Triangle: If you cut them off whilest they are alive, a kind of transparent juice comes forth of the back, as out of a pin-feather, and there appears a hole within. Thus I found the female, which I opened whilest she was living. When she was dead, there was nothing found in her belly but a notable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of her belly near to her breast; and then that vital humour in the bladder, though it now was no longer living; after that, the reliques of the matrix that was emptied, which were nervous and membranous. The upper parts of the male agree with the female. If you op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n his belly, you shall find much red matter within; and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52474:150"/>
besides that, a tallow matter full of nerves, to which the genital pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is fastned. He hath a peculiar genital, wanting other things that belong to the female.</p>
               <p>The History of it is this; Under the tail environed with a long Down, there is a notable hole under a membranous circle, as hard as horn, that is divided as it were into two teeth. In the middle of this compasse there is the three forked neck of the genital part, with the extremities of it that are horny.</p>
               <p>About this there are set reddish prickles (all the horny processes are red going toward black) the two uppermost are like hooks, of bended back like ankers, or like Goats-horns bent backwards. The single one beneath them is strait. These prickles are next the neck of the member. A little beyond in the middle of the compasse, there are three other small pricks; with so many bands he lays hold of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of the female, and draws it to him, and holds it so fast, that if you would pull them one from the other, you would sooner believe the joyning together of the belly, and the circles should break, than the copulation should unloose, which I often proved.</p>
               <p>Also from hence you may judge of the constancy of their copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for I saw them stick fast together whole Summer days, and at night, I know not at what houre, it is probable about morning, they parted asunder, and in the morning I found many Oval little Worms, and them lying quiet one from the other, yet they will stick together, being cast into cold water. When I sprinkled salt and pickle on the joyning of their tails they held fast; nor were they parted with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of vitriol added.</p>
               <p>I drencht the male into the water, and I let the female stand dry on the brink of it, casting both vitriol and salt into the water, yet he lived and held his copulation. Then I left him so all night in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the morning some hundreds of eggs were in the bottom of the water, and the young Necydali swam alive. I cut off another males head in copulation, yet he parted not. I divided his brest from his belly; he stuck fast till I drew him off by force.</p>
               <p>The head and brest, as of divided flyes, live long, but the brest longest. This male cut asunder in copulation, had in his belly also a yellow reddish matter, with some intestinal substance that is yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish, and skinny. The male was bred the fourth of <hi>July,</hi> and died for weaknesse on the fifth, and being opened he had nothing else in his belly. Otherwise the Necydale will live 7, or 8, or more dayes. For, as I said, he is constant, so that vvhen I broak vvith four strokes the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the vvings and the brest, and then the belly somtimes, yet it lived as not hurt, though the Spirit were dissipated at length; the next day for the most part, if they be so dealt vvithall, they dye. The male hotly desires copulation; after a little stay, vvhen he is come forth of the <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and that vvhen he hath often unburdned his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and somtimes also vvhen he hath sent forth no moysture; and this happens also in the female.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:52474:151"/>The male that is lively after the first dayes copulation, when he hath rested at night, the next day he seeks for the same female, or any that hee can meet with, so that he will couple three or four times.</p>
               <p>The female also admits of the male as often, though she do not alwaies lay eggs. For she begets no eggs, unlesse she have some with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her, though she copulate with the male. So soon as they uncouple, she presently lays her egs in order one after another, you shall see them thrust forth with striving and contraction of her belly, and be shut forth from the neck of the matrix put out, so that it will touch the pavement. I reckoned above 400, from one female, and almost 400, out of others; and these being dissected, had yet many more in their matrixes. What therefore <hi>Vidas</hi> writes of hundreds, that may be understood of lean little Necydalls, such as I see proceed from want of nourishment, others were almost three times as great. Some males do void their dung once before copulation, and again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their second copulation. Somtimes the males, loosed and not yet satisfied, will hinder the female that is about to lay eggs, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple again with her, though the female copulates with him by force, and desires by contracting her belly, and by striving with her hinder legs, to be loose. So one before copulation laid 17, after she had once coupled and was loose again, 194, and then coupling again, after four hours copulation, she laid 245, then the male having an appetite, she cast moysture as out of a spout, and coupling again, and being freed, she laid above 20, eggs.</p>
               <p>Those Egges that were laid on the fourth of <hi>July</hi> of a Citron-colour, on the 7th grew red, and after that, Lead-colour'd. I kept them in a box behind my Window, exposed to the afternoon-Sun. Those that were barren did never change their colour, but onely sank down.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Necydalls</hi> that are loose, you shall sometimes observe a trembling motion, like as if they had an Ague. Yet I say not, that they are aguish. But I think, that shaking comes by the alteration and promotion of the seminall matter, the vapour exhaling from thence, and rending the nervous parts. The last <hi>Necydale</hi> was a small one; and on the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a small case between two Mulberry leafs, he came forth the 13th of July, in which besides that, he had made a very small Silk case; This also was observable, That he came not forth of the basis of the case, but made a hole in the top, contrary to all the rest. Yet he was a male that feared not to copulate with a female that had thrice been coupled with a male before, and was almost dead. When he had twice copulated, he afterwards fainted. His wings were painted otherwise than the others were; for whereas the others are distinguished with lines, long and broad wayes, as with welts; this had four such Lead-colour'd lines broad wayes; but between the second and the third, toward the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52474:151"/>
outward borders of the wings, there was a small circle coming between, not exact, but wan, with a white spot in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
               <p>But indeed Nature is so ingenious in this Insect, that when you have observed and writ many things, you have more to observe still. Therefore I conclude this History; and leave the rest to those that are studious in the Secrets of Nature.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Whale</hi> is the greatest and chief of all Fishes. <hi>Pliny</hi> calls this the greatest creature in the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, which was four Acres in bignesse; <hi>Massarius</hi> interprets this to be 960 foot long. <hi>Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> saith, that there are <hi>Whales</hi> of 23 paces in length, and reports, that in the Island before <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he saw a <hi>Whale</hi> cast forth of the Sea, that was 150 cubits. That Whale which was taken in the <hi>Scald,</hi> ten miles from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> Anno 1577, on the second day of <hi>July,</hi> was of a blackish blew colour: he had a spout on his head wherewith he belched up water with great force: he was 58 foot long, and 16 foot high, his tail was 14 foot broad; from his Eye to the top of his nose the distance was 16 foot. His lower chap was 6 foot, of each

side, armed with 25 Teeth, and there were as many holes in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chap where there were no teeth, yet so many might have stood there. The longest of his Teeth, was not above 6 thumbs long. A <hi>Whale</hi> not long since was taken at <hi>Sceveling,</hi> a Village near the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> was 60 foot long. His head was about 3. cubits long, I saw him there. <hi>Platina</hi> observes, that the <hi>Barbels</hi> eyes are venomous, chiefly in <hi>May. Antonius Gazius</hi> found it so. For when he had eaten but two bits thereof, at Supper time his belly was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated, that he looked as pale as ashes; he was distemper'd all over, at last he fell into the cholerick passion. Nor did these symptomes abate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe <hi>Carp,</hi> saith <hi>Gesner,</hi> hath a little white hard stone in his head, near his tongue, and in the middle of his head a thick substance like to a heart, that is flexible while it is new; but afterwards it grows hard. Sometimes it is found 20 pound weight. <hi>Jovius</hi> saith, That there was one found in the River <hi>Latium</hi> two hundred pound weight. When the Female finds her self great with young, when the time of bringing forth is past, by moving her mouth she rouseth the male, who casts on his milt, and then she bringeth forth. In <hi>Polonia,</hi> broad <hi>Carps</hi> being put into a fish-pond by one, when the waters were frozen, though he sought them diligently, he could not find them; when the Spring came, and the waters were thawed, they all appeared, <hi>Gesner.</hi>

                  <hi>Clupaea</hi> is a great fish. In <hi>Sagona</hi> a River in <hi>France,</hi> when the Moon increaseth, it is white; but black when it decreaseth. When the body is but a little augmented, it is destroy'd by its own prickles. In the head of it there is found a stone like a barley corn, which when the Moon decreaseth; some think it will cure the quartan Ague, if it be bound to the left side, <hi>Calisthenes Sybarita, citante Stobaeo. Congers</hi> contain their off-spring within them, but it is not equally so in all places, nor doth their increase appear in a fat grosse matrix, but it is contain'd in it, in a long rank, as in Serpents; which is manifest by putting it into the fire: For the fat consumes; but the eggs crackle, and they leap forth, <hi>Aristotle</hi> 6. <hi>Hist. c.</hi> 17.</p>

                  </gap>e on the shore at <hi>Xanton,</hi> the mouth and throat were so wide that they would take in a fat man. <hi>Bellonius</hi> saith, that each side of the mouth had 36, teeth, wherefore some think the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> was swallowed by this fish: and that this is that they call the Whale, it being so vast a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The same <hi>Bellonius</hi> writes, that this Fish at divers times brings forth 6, or 8, young ones, and somtimes more, each of a foot long, perfect with all their parts, and oft times the young one coming forth there are eggs yet raw in the matrix, and some hatcht, lying in the upper part toward the midriff; and some of them are contained in the right turning of the matrix some in the left. In her Whelps, this is chiefly wonderfull, that they were covered with no secondine, and they are fed from some part of the Navell that hath Veins. For since saith he, she doth not put forth her eggs, and they are tied by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bands to the matrix, they seem to need no other coat than the <hi>Amnios</hi>; whereby the Whelp being now formed, and by a chink in the sternon, that passeth between the fins that are toward the gills, it receiveth nourishment from the matrix by a band, or the middle of it, that is so slender, as a Lute string; But this nutriment by that slender string is carried into a little bag, which you would say were the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which is alwaies full of it, like to the yolk of an egge: the position of it is in the middle of the belly, and under the two laps of the Liver. And that this is true, if you cut a Whelp taken out of the dams belly, through the belly, you shall find the true stomack of it to be alwaies empty. For it takes and devours nothing by the mouth. But you shall see the right intestine to swell with wan co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd excrements. If you take the young Whelp alive out of the dams belly, and do not hurt him, but cast him into the water, you shall see him to live and swim presently. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> observed the eggs to stick in the middle of the matrix toward the back bone; and when they increase they are translated into both the <hi>Sinus</hi> of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix. The forme of the eggs is like to pillows we sleep upon under our heads; out of the corners there hang long and slender passages which <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls hairy pores, and they are rowled up like Vine tendrels; if you stretch them out at length, they are two cubits long. When the shell breaks, the young ones come forth.</p>

                  <hi>DRacunculus</hi> is a fish with a great head, a compacted nose stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, a little mouth without any teeth, without any opening at the gils; but in the place of this, above the head there is a hole on both sides, wherewith it takes in and puts forth water. It hath great eyes set above the head, the head-bone ends at the prickles that tend to the tayl. The Fins are exceeding long, considering the body partly Silver, part Gold colour'd. Those about the Gills, are Gold-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Silver colour'd in the root<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These that are in the lower part, and next to the mouth, are longer than those that are next to the gils. On the back two stand up; the first is small, Gold colour'd, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished with Siver lines; the latter is very great on the middle of the back, not much unlike to butterflies wings, and is made of five bones like to ears of Barley, and a membrane. The former bones of radii are the longer, the hinder are the shorter, contrary to what it is in the membrane; which being as it were woven between all the distances of those <hi>radii,</hi> increaseth by degrees. The same also, is divers; for it is distinguished with Silver lines set between two black lines. This is hid in the middle hollow of the back, as in a sheath. There is also another Golden colour'd membrane from the tail to the Podex, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the fringes that are black.</p>

Some make their Fins to be the cause of it, others their light body. The famous <hi>Baudarcius</hi> thinks the membrane between their foreyards being extended, serves them for sails. They love one the other so well, that one being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Caria</hi> and wounded, a great multitude of them came to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and departed again when he was set free. When the Marriners whistle, they will stay the longer about the ship but when a tempest ris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the credulous Greeks say, if any man be in the ship that hath killed a <hi>Dolphin,</hi> they will all flock thither to be revenged. When then play on the calme Sea, they foreshew which way the wind will blow, and when they cast up water, the Sea being troubled, they foreshew a calme. <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 35. <hi>Thomas</hi> thinks that exhalations rising from the bottom of the Sea, when a storm is at hand in Winter, is the cause of it; and he thinks that the <hi>Dolphins</hi> feel heat thereby, and

so break forth the oftner. But since more fishes also perceive a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest coming, <hi>Rondeletius</hi> thinks that they are affected in the water with the motion of the ayre, as those that are sick are wont to be, when the South wind begins to blow. <hi>Exocaetus</hi> lives long on the dry land. The cause is, the plenty of ayr; which being he doth not draw it in, too largely, he is not choked by it. Hence it is, that an Eele will live a long time under ground, <hi>Rondelet. Fiatola</hi> is a broad plain fish, with a taile like to a half Moon, a fleshy tongue; contrary to all other fish, he hath no sins under his belly, and he is wholly without them. His Liver hath but one lap, without any Gall, his stomach is made like the Letter V, the lower part of it ends in a point; and there are so many Appendixes of hairs unto it, that they cannot be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>

This had layn hid in the River 16, yeares, neere the Kitchin of a Noble man; at last it was caught with a hook, when it had young ones to look to: when she found her self taken, she leaped forth; the fishers ran after her two miles, at last they wearied and took her, and carried her to a Town called <hi>Nadlac.</hi> There was in her belly a Mans head, with his right hand and three Gold Rings upon it.

               <p>THat the <hi>Herring</hi> lives by water, <hi>the Author of the Book of Nature</hi> witnesseth; taken out of it, it will not live, as experience testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies. In his belly there is nothing found, for it hath onely one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry gut. They swim together in such great sholes, that they cannot
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52474:155"/>
be taken for multitudes. When they see light, they swim in flocks, and so they are caught in the autumnal equinoctiall. They shine in the water turning their bellies upward, and they send forth such a light, that the Sea seems to lighten. It is a miracle that some relate concerning the Inhabitants of the Island <hi>Terra Sancta</hi> of the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, namely, that in the year 1530, after the Virgins delivery, 2000 men lived by <hi>Herring</hi>-fishing there; but when they peevishly whipped one of them, they had taken with rods, these fishes did so diminish, that afterwards scarce 100 could live by that labour. The <hi>Husons</hi> have a grisle instead of a back bone, that hath a great empty hole, from head to tail as bored with a piercer. What <hi>Aelian, l.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 25. saith of the <hi>Autacea,</hi> that in time they grow as big as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Tunie fish in the <hi>Danube,</hi> and their abdomen is so fat, that you would say their paps were as great as a Sowes that gave suck, and are covered with a rough skin that Spears are polished with them, with a membrane so tied from the brain to the tail, that dryed in the Sun, it will serve for a whip, that must be understood of these <hi>Husons</hi>: For <hi>Vadianus, in Epitome trium terrae partium,</hi> writes, that he saw some of 400 weight: They are so fearful, that the least fish will fright them. They follow the sound of Trumpets, that they will come to the bank over against it. Lastly, they are so strong in the water, that if they strike the fisher with their tail, they will strike him out of the Ship; so soon as they put their heads above water, they grow weak. They will drink strong wine, and live many days, being drunk they are carried to strangers, they will drink 4. <hi>Sextarii</hi> of Wine.</p>

There was a very great one seen that had another great one in the belly; and this again had a vvater-mouse. Another was seen that had tvvo young Geese in it; another had a Moor-hen in its stomach. For great hunger it will feed on food at Land. It hath a natural Enmity with a frog. Hence it is that the Frog will oft times dig out his eyes. He cures his wounds by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing against a Tench, which he alwaies keeps company with.

Though the cause may be attributed to friendship; yet it is better to attribute
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52474:156"/>
it to the clammy matter the Tench abounds with, by which he may heal his wound. A <hi>Pike</hi> of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour was said to have lived 267 years in a Lake, that was found out by a brasse ring that he hid under his skin in his gills, when he put him into the lake.

                  <hi>MAnaty</hi> is a great Fish taken in the Rivers of <hi>Hispaniola</hi>; His head is like an Ox head, or bigger: His eyes in respect of his body are small; he hath two thick feet, like wings in the place of gills, with which he swims, they are set about his head; he hath a thick skin, and no scales. He is so great that there needs a yoke of Oxen to carry him. Sometimes he is above 14 or 15 foot long, and eight hands thick; near the tail he is narrower, and as it were girt in, from which straightnesse the tail growes longer and thicker. He hath two stones, or rather bones in his head, so great as little hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls, or the bullet of a Crosse-bowe, and sometimes greater, as the fish is. He wants ears, but in place of them he hath small holes, by which he hears. His skin is like the skin of a shriveled Ox, a finger thick, ash-coloured, and thin set with hairs. The tail from that straight part unto the end of it, is all nervous. From that, cut into pieces, and then set five or six dayes in the Sun and dryed, and then boyled in a Cauldron, or rather fryed, much fat comes forth: for it all resolves into fat. It is good to fry eggs in a frying-pan. For it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grows rank, nor unsavoury. He is made tame, and will be taught like a dog; but <hi>Franciscus Lopetius</hi> saith, he will remember Injuries. <hi>The petty King of</hi> Caramatexum, <hi>in the Island of</hi> Hispaniola, <hi>fed one of them</hi> 26 <hi>years in the Lake</hi> Guaynabo, <hi>and made him so tame, though he were grown great, as great as an old Dolpbin; for he would take meat by hand; and when they call'd him</hi> Mato, <hi>which in their Tongue signifies Magnificent, he would come forth of the Lake, and creep to the house for meat, and then go back to the Lake again. Boyes and Men going with him, and when they sang, he seemed to be delighted with it: and he would let them sometimes ride on his back; he would easily carry ten at a time from one part

But when a certain</hi> Spaniard <hi>would make triall whether his skin were so hard or no, and threw a dart at him, he grew so angry, that if he saw any clothed in Christians habit, though he were called, he would not come forth of the water.

It was round, it had a skin without skales or hairs. The mouth was so straight, that it was miraculous considering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Creature. The eyes were large, stretching out, and greater than Oxe eyes. The gills were uncovered, fleshy, and beat; the fins on the sides were a span long. It had a very hard knot. The Jaws on both sides were fenced with a solid continued bone, the tongue of it stuck fast to the lower mandible, that he seem'd to have no tongue, the tayle was about 4, foot long. There were three fins on the taile, so that the taile with the fins, were 9, foot long. The Fish was 8, foot long, 5, foot high and more; and turn which way it would, it was so high: when it was unbowelled, the heart, liver, milt, were greater than of an Oxe; and it had one gut coming to the passage for excrements placed under the belly. In the bottom of this gut there was a kind of bottom, made as it were of bruised nervs, like fiddle strings bruised. The Flesh of the creature was white as milk, and solid, as in a hog that is 5, or 6, fingers thick with fat, as in Whales. <hi>Clusius</hi> calls the <hi>Monoceros</hi> or <hi>Unicorn,</hi> a Fish; which the Dutch coming from the <hi>East-Indies</hi> brought along with them. Anno, 1601. A Merchant valewed it so high that hardly any mony would buy it. From the outmost part of the mouth, unto the fins of the tail it was not much more than three inches, the middle of the body was little above an inch broad; from the top of the head, where a horn stuck forth between the eyes, unto the lowest part of the belly, which also ended in a sharp point, it was an inch and half broad; the body
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52474:157"/>
was covered with a dark rough skin, moreover it had a little narrow mouth sticking out half an inch long, set with two bony little teeth, which seem'd divided into ten above, but beneath into fewer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they were broken out. The eyes that were put out, seem'd to have been very great, over which on the head, a little slender Horn stuck forth, that was four square, about an inch long, armed with ten pins like hooks tending downward, on both sides, from which to the fin, which from the middle of the back stretched out to the taile, there was an inch in length, pressed down like to a furrow, into which when he swims, he seems to incline his horn, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>THe River-<hi>Powt</hi> is so sweet meat, that in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> the Wife of one of the Earls of <hi>Bichling,</hi> is reported to have spent all her Estate, in feeding on them. They are chiefly commended before Christs-Mas day; but they are not good when they are with young, for then in some waters they are meazly. Some Hucksters, cut out their Livers, and turn them into the waters againe, having sewed up the wound. <hi>Encelius</hi> writes that the stomack of it, with the appurtenances hath a wonderfull vertue. <hi>Let it be,</hi> saith he, <hi>never so old, in</hi> Saxonie, <hi>the Women give it in drink, and it will draw out the secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine staying behind, after Child birth; and is of great concernment for all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the matrix.</hi> They say also that oyle is collected out of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, hanged in a glassy Vessel against the Sun, or in an Oven: this is thought to be so excellent for suffusions of the eyes, and for spots, that <hi>Forestus in observat.</hi> saith, it will miraculously make a dark sight clear. <hi>Nicander</hi> saith that <hi>Lampreys</hi> are wonderfull bold; for often coming forth of fish ponds, they will bite the painfull Fisher-men, and flye to the Sea, and will cast them headlong from the ships into the Sea; yet that they may be made tame, is apparent by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that <hi>Lamprey,</hi> which <hi>Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Aelian,</hi> &amp; others do testifie, that <hi>L. Crassus</hi> who was Censor with <hi>Cn. Domitius,</hi> did adorn with Gold-earings and Jewells, and a brave neck-lace. This knew <hi>Crassus</hi> his voyce when he called her, and being call'd would swim to him; and when he offerd him any thing, she would leap with delight, and lay hold of it. <hi>Crassus</hi> wept for her when she was dead, and buried her honorably. And when <hi>Domitius</hi> taunted him sharply, saying, Fool <hi>Crassus,</hi> thou weptst for a dead <hi>Lamprey.</hi> He answer'd, I wept for the death of my Beast, but thou weepst for none, not when thy three Wives died; thou buriedst them, but lamentedst them not. <hi>Pliny, l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 23. saith, that it will grow mad by tasting Vinegar.

They love the Sea exceedingly: For when their skins are tanned, if there be any hair left, they will turn as the Sea lies, by a naturall instinct. For if the Sea be troubled and tosse, they will stand upright; but if the Sea be quiet, they lye flat down. When <hi>Pliny</hi> would not credit this, he made tryall of it in the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea, and about the Island <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> he found it to be no fable, as <hi>Cardan</hi> saith. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> saith, That by their skin, changes are foreshew'd; for when the South winds blow, their hair sticks up; but when the wind is in the North they fall so flat, that you would think they had none. <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> saw one Calf taught by a Mountebank, who would rejoyce at the name of any Christian Prince, and would seem to mutter some words; but he was silent when the Turk or an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick was named.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Scales</hi> do bring forth two or three young ones at one time; but at many times they bring forth more. Their eggs are first seen without a shell, in the upper part of their matrix.

When he much admired at this, and sought for the cause of it, he boyl'd hen-eggs, in which appeared no white at all, being but newly formed; and he observed the white severed from the yelk by the heat of the fire. Hence he found, that at first they lye confused, but are separated by degrees by heat, and the shell that compasseth them, is made of the grosser part grown hard. <hi>Olaus, in tabula Septentrionali,</hi> pictures forth a <hi>Scale</hi> in the Sea, defending a man from a kennel of Dog-fish, in a place a little beyond the borders of <hi>Denmark.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Indian Reversus like an Eel,</hi> is a Fish of an unusuall figure, like to a great Eel in body, and it hath on the hinder part of the head a capacious skin, like to a great purse.

far as the fish may stick by the keel of the ship, for it cannot any wayes endure the ayr; and when it sees any fish or Tortoise, which are there greater than a great Target, they let loose the fish; he so soon as he is loose, flies swifter than an arrow on the other fish or Tortoise, and casting that skin purse upon them, layes hold of his prey so fast, that no force can unloose it, unlesse they draw up the cord a little, and pull him to the brink of the water. For so soon as he sees the light of the ayr he forsakes his prey, <hi>Martyr.

               <p>THe Antients believed, that the <hi>Remora</hi> would stay Ships; and it hath been found true by examples of late. <hi>Petrus Melaras</hi> of <hi>Bononia</hi> reports, that the ship of <hi>Francis</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Troas,</hi> when he went by Sea out of <hi>France,</hi> was held fast in the swiftnesse of its course. Many have sought for the cause, but no man hath certainly found it. Some things are alwayes immoveable to do their office, as the Poles; some things in respect of their place, as the Center of the Earth, which naturally never moves. Contrarily some things are to move alwaies to do their office, as the Heavens; some things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their place, as Rivers. So some things have a faculty of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as the Loadstone; some to stop motion, as the <hi>Remora.</hi> But since no reason can be given, why cold is an enemy to heat, so not for these things, why such things that have efficient principles in them of motion, do cause motion; and those that have principles of resting, should cause rest. <hi>Keckermannus</hi> seems to ascribe this to a cold humour that the <hi>Remora</hi> sends forth, that he freezeth the water about the rudder, <hi>In Disput.

               </head>
               <p>IT is most certain, that there are <hi>Serpents</hi> in the Sea; and Histories shew, that they are of divers magnitudes. <hi>Aristotle</hi> reports, that in <hi>Africa</hi> they will overthrow their Galleys, and kill Men. <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> writes, that about <hi>Norwey,</hi> when the Sea is calm, <hi>Serpents</hi> will shew themselves that are 100 or 200 foot long, and sometimes they will catch men from the Ships. <hi>Schiltbergerus</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> hath described the Combat between the Sea and Land-Serpents. His words are; <hi>In the Kingdom of</hi> Genyck, <hi>there is a City call'd</hi> Sampson: <hi>at what time I resided with</hi> Ureiasita <hi>King of the</hi> Turks, <hi>Water-Snakes, and Land-Serpents innumerable did surround that City for a mile on all sides. These came forth of the Woods that are many in the Countries adjoyning, and those forth of the Sea. Whilest these met, for</hi> 9. <hi>dayes no man for fear durst stirre forth; yet they hurt neither man, nor any other living Creature. On the tenth day, these two kinds of Serpents began to fight early in the morning, and continued till Sun-set, and the Water-Serpents yielded to the Land-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; and the next day</hi> 8000 <hi>of them were found dead.</hi>

               <p>Many suppose that the <hi>Sturgion</hi> will pine away in the <hi>Albis.

He is so strong with his tail, that he will cut wood in sunder, strike down a strong man, and strike fire out of hard stones; and the same is done by the rubbing of those little bones that are prickly all his body over.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A <hi>Salmon</hi> about <hi>Colen</hi> is two cubits long, and they are greater amongst the <hi>Miseni</hi>; and at <hi>Dessavia,</hi> neere the River <hi>Albis,</hi> from 24, to 36, pounds weight. In <hi>Helvetia</hi> neere <hi>Tigurus</hi> they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken somtimes above 36, pound weight. <hi>Albertus</hi> saith, the intestine of it, is divided into many parts like to fingers. <hi>Gesner</hi> writes, that he observed two passages from the very throat of one that he dissected: they stretched downward, one to the Maw by the Wezand, and the other was namelesse. In the River <hi>Mulda</hi> neere to <hi>Dessavia,</hi> if the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> striving to overcome the precipice of the water, be frustrated at the second or third leap, he swims to the foard, and there he will lye hid under stones and gravel, and pine away: he is full of brasse co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd spots, and his beck is bent like a great hook. In <hi>Scotland</hi> in <hi>Autumn</hi> they meet in little Rivers or places fordable, where they joyne bellies, and lay eggs, and cover them in the gravel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at which time

the male is so spent, spending his milt and seed, and the female with her spawn, that they are nothing but bones and prickels and skin. That leannesse is infectious, for they will infect all the <hi>Salmons</hi> they come neere. It is an argument thereof, that oft times they are taken, and one side is consumed, the other not so. From their eyes covered in the sand, little fishes breed the next spring that are so soft, that untill they be no bigger than a mans finger, if you presse them with your fingers, they will run as from congeled moysture. Then first, as Nature leads them, they hasten to the Sea, and in 20, days, or a little more, it is incredible how great they will grow, when they come from the Sea, against a River that runs thither, they shew a wonder. For the Rivers that are straightned with Rocks, and Banks, on every side, and therefore run down swiftly, when they fall with a great fall, the <hi>Salmons</hi> do not presently swim forth by the Channel, but they fling themselves up crooked by force of the water, and so are carried in the Ayre, before they fall. That they are live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is seen by their heart taken forth. <hi>Robertus Constantinus</hi> testifies that he saw the heart of a <hi>Salmon</hi> that was unbowelled, that was wet with a moyst <hi>sanies,</hi> and it lived after it was taken forth above a day. There are some different kinds of <hi>Turdi.</hi> Some have as it were some skiny yellowish Apophyses hanging down from their lower chop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> somtimes they vary, and are all for the most part Gold colour, or colour of the Amethyst or blew. Their eyes are extreme great, and a black circle goes about a Golden Apple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Golden circle about the black, and lastly a black circle goes about them all. The fins by the gills are wholly Gold colour, but of the brest they are all blew, except their nervs that are Gold colour'd. The fin that is from the <hi>anus,</hi> and that which is on the back, and taile, where they are joyn'd to the rump, are Gold colour'd, but sprinkled with little red blood spots, the rest are blew.</p>

And he doth this, so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, that before he is taken, he will do it by the net, or the rod.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52474:160"/>
by force of Nature, it is no wonder, that they fall into snares. They are also ingendred in the Lakes of <hi>Maeotis</hi>; and when they are a little grown, they break forth of the mouth of the Lake in sholes, and run by the <hi>Asiatick</hi> shore so far as <hi>Trapezunda</hi>; but because they cannot endure tempests and cold weather, whereby their eyes grow dim; they stay in a very deep place of the <hi>Thracian</hi> Sea, that harbours them, it is called <hi>Melas,</hi> and it hath hollow and muddy places fit to cherish fish in, and they grow till the Spring. They seem to understand the blowings of the winds. For <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, they stay for the North wind, that they may get out of the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea, with the flowing of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to help them. They enter into <hi>Pontus</hi> one way, and go forth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

The old Oracle of the Prophet <hi>Amphyllus</hi> in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> proves that they go forth in the night. And this is again confirmed by ancient medalls, such as <hi>Bellonius</hi> writes that he saw at <hi>Paris,</hi> on one side was an Ear of Corn; and on the other side the <hi>Tunie</hi>; and above this, the Moon with an Inscription of <hi>Phillips.</hi> They sleep so soundly, that they may be taken napping.</p>

                  <hi>URanoscopus</hi> is a fish that swims alone, and eats flesh; so lively, saith <hi>Bellonius,</hi> that if you take out all his Entrals, yet he will move still: It is the greediest eater of all fish, he hath an apophysis hanging forth of his mouth, and with that he ensnares the fish. This shews he is an insatiable paunch, that if you cast meat to him, he will feed so long, till the meat come up to his throat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sword-fish</hi> hath a beck on both chaps, but the lower of them is short and triangular; the upper is more bony and harder, and far longer, sometimes two cubits long.

               </head>
               <p>IN Minerals and Quarreys also fishes are found, especially if the places be moyst, though there be no water. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> observed this in many places of <hi>Pontus; Eudoxus</hi> in <hi>Paphlagonia; Agricola</hi> at <hi>Orterantum,</hi> beyond the <hi>Albis.</hi> There is a plain by the River <hi>Narbon,</hi> by this run the Rivers, <hi>Iliberis</hi> and <hi>Roschinus</hi>; there are fossil fish found therein. The earth is tender there, and brings much grasse; about two or three cubits under this, runs the water of the Rivers that hath dilated it self. If at any time they overflow, they fill the plain with fish from underground, <hi>Polyb. in Histor.</hi> There are two sorts of them, some round like to Eels, but they want a tuff skin; they are scaly as Gudgeons, their flesh is hard, and not well savoured. The great ones are two fingers thick, the smaller but one. Those are four hands breadth long; these but three: they make a sharp noise. Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries shut them up in glasses, and hang them down from a beam, and feed them with bread for a long time. Sometimes they come forth of Rivers that run in Fenny grounds, and come far into the Land by the veins of the banks, and sometimes into Cellars. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> writes, That in Caves they feel nothing, because their senses are stupified; but when they are boyl'd in a pot, and when they are dug up they will stirre.</p>
               <p>In a certain River of the <hi>East-Indies</hi> there are fishes call'd <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berones</hi>; they are so greedy, that one of them catcht at a man stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the side of the Ship, and first bit off his foot, and next his hand, <hi>Linschotten. in Navigat.</hi> It is almost incredible, that the same man writes, namely, That a Ship coming from <hi>Mozambique,</hi> went back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward 14 dayes, though the wind were good for it, and nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and that was found by every dayes observation of the Suns heighth. And when the doubtful Marriners enquired for the cause of it, and thought they had been bewitched, at last a fish was found under the Ship, and they collected, that this fish carried the Ship on his back the contrary way against the force of the wind. For so soon as with much ado, they had driven this fish away, they sailed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward very well. The History is painted in the Palace of the Deputy-King of <hi>Goanum,</hi> with the Name of the Pilote, the Year and the Month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blefhenius</hi> writes, in his description of <hi>Islandia,</hi> That in the Island Sea there is a Monster, the name he knowes not, but they take it to be a kind of Whale; when he puts his head above the Sea, he doth so fright men, that they will fall down almost dead. He hath a head is four square, flaming eyes, and it is fenced about with black horns; His body is black, and set about with black feathers.

If he be seen at Night at any time, his eyes seem fiery, that all his head that is thrust above the Sea may be seen by it. <hi>Olaus, l.</hi> 12. makes mention of it, and saith, it is 12 cubits long. So much for <hi>Fish.</hi>

               <p>HItherto I have described irrational living Creatures; Man followes next, of whom we shall speak in order, according to his actions, natural, vital, animal, and rational. And first of his proportion. This is so excellent and admirable, that it cannot be more. The body of <hi>Adam</hi> was made out of the Earth, and ours of 3. small drops of seed, and as much blood, poured forth like milk, and framed like to cruddled cheefe; of the same matter, are so many and so divers parts made. The whole structure
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52474:162"/>
consists of above 200 bones to support it, and as many cartilages; all the joynts are smeered with, all are joyn'd together with many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, and cloathed with innumerable membranes: the vast mass of the members, are watered with above 30, paire of nervs, as with little cords, and all the parts are sprinkled with as many arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as with water pipes, filld with foming blood and vital Spirits; the empty places are filled up, and the entralls covered, with almost 400, Muscles, and flesh of divers sorts, as with flocks: and lastly all is covered about with skin. The Image of God is in it (his mind represents the same) and it hath included in it, the forces and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of all the creatures. You shall find many men that have an <hi>Ostrich stomack, many that have the Lyons Heart, not a few have the heart of a Dogg, many of a Sow; and infinite there are, that are like the Asse by nature. Alexander the Great,</hi> had such a symmetry of humours, that his spirits, and humours, and also his dead body, smelt as sweet as natural balsom; because in man as in the Centre, as in a knot, or little bundle, the original and seminary cause of all creatures lye bound up. Vegetables are nourished and increased by the balsom-like Spirits of Mineralls, animals of vegetables, and by them of mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls; but man, for whom all things were created, is nourished and augmented by the balsamick spirits of animals, vegetables, and mineralls; wherefore there is reason that he should consist of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hese. Wherefore in man there do flowrish, and produce fruit, that are messengers of health or sicknesse, both the balme, violets, Germander, namely the Spirits of the Heart, Brain, and Liver: the Nettle, Wake-Robin, Crowfoot, as Pushes, Scabs, Creeping sores; Also there are wrought in man mineral separations, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in paroxysms, of Vitriol, Alum, Salt, of Gemma, of the Colcothat, Tartar; as the Leprosy, Elephantiasis, Morphew, Cancer, discovering themselves in several Tinctures and Signatures. Nor are aqueal generations wanting, as Gold, Silver, Tin, Copper, Iron, Lead; the Heart, Brain, Liver, Reins, Stomach. There are found in our bodies Mines, out of which stones are dug, the stones of the Bladder and Kidneys, not to build but to destroy the house. The head is the Fort of mans mind, the seat of reason, the habitation of Wisdom, and the shop of memory, judgment, and cogitations; possessing the highest place doth it not represent the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost and angelicall part of the World? You have the middle and the Caelestial part in the Thorax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the middle belly, exactly set forth. For as when the Sun riseth, the upper parts are enlightned, and all the lower parts are enlivened; but contrarily, when the Sun departs, they grow cold, and tend to ruine: so by the perpetuall motion of the heart, and by the vital heat thereof, all things flourish, and there is a plentifull harvest of rejoycing, to be perceived; but when that is darkned by cares, sorrows, fears, and other Clowds, all the parts are debilitated, and at last dye. Who sees not the subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the World, expressed in the lower belly? In it, are containd the parts that serve for nutrition, concoction, and procreation. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

you will want the Dukedome of the Planets in this little world. Behold, the flowing marrow of the brain represents the moystning power of the Moon, the genital parts serve for <hi>Venus,</hi> the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of eloquence and comelinesse do the office of witty <hi>Mercury</hi>; the Sun and the Heart hold the greatest proportion. Man's Liver, the fountain of good vapours, is compared to beneficiall <hi>Jupiter</hi>; the bladder of the Gall, contains the fiery fury of <hi>Mars</hi>; and the loose spungy flesh of the Milt, which is the receptacle of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique humours, doth perfectly represent the cold Planet of <hi>Saturn.</hi> And if you please to proceed farther, I can say boldly, that the Elements, Seas, Winds are here shadowed forth. The spirits of Mans body do set forth Heaven, the quintessence of all things. The four hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours expresse the four Elements; Hot dry choler represents the Fire; blood-hot and moyst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ayr; flegme, cold and moyst, the Water: melancholy cold and dry, the Earth. So the belly of Man is the Earth, fruitful of all fruits: The hollow vein, is the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean Sea; the Bladder the Western Sea, into which all the Rivers discharge themselves, and the superfluous salt which is resolved, is collected. He hath the East in his Mouth, the West in his Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the South in his Navel; the North in his Back. <hi>Europe, Asia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America</hi> may summarily be described in Man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abdalas</hi> the <hi>Barbarian</hi> said well, that the body of Man is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thing; and <hi>Protagoras</hi> call'd Man, <hi>The measure of all things.</hi> Theophrastus, <hi>The pattern of the Universe, and Epitome of the World.</hi> Synesius, <hi>The horizon of corporeall and incorporeall things.</hi> And lastly, we may truly cry out with <hi>Zoroastres, O Man! the Workmanship of most powerfull Nature</hi>; for it is <hi>the most artificiall Master-piece of Gods hands.</hi>

                     <hi>Article 1.</hi> Of the harmlesse feeding on venomous things.</head>
                  <p>IF we regard Histories, we can hardly doubt, but that venomous things may by custome become nutrimental: For many learned men having written thus, they ought to be of credit. <hi>Avicenna, Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Gentilis</hi> speak of a young Maid, who was fed with poysonous creatures from her tender age; and her breath was venom to those that stood by her. <hi>Albertus</hi> writes, That at <hi>Colonia Agrippina,</hi> there was a man that held Spiders for his daintiest meat. One <hi>Porus</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a King of the <hi>Indies,</hi> used poyson every day, that he might kill other men. There was one who killed venomous creatures that bit him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Avicenna l.</hi> 8. <hi>de anim. c.</hi> 2. It is a known History of a young Maid fed with poyson, with which the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings kill'd other men. In <hi>Hellespont</hi> the <hi>Ophyogenes</hi> feed on Serpents: One that was delighted
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:52474:163"/>
with the same food, when he was cast into a vessell fill'd with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, received no harm. <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Athenagoras</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> could never be hurt by Scorpions; and the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> that are Inhabitants by the River <hi>Hyaspis,</hi> made brave cheer of Serpents and Vipers. <hi>Galen</hi> saith, That an old Woman of <hi>Athens</hi> eat a great quantity of Hemlock, which did her no hurt. <hi>Hypoth. the Empirick</hi> writes, that another took 30 drams of it, and received no harm; and he saith further, That one <hi>Lysis</hi> eat 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drams of <hi>Opium.</hi> The <hi>Thracian</hi> Dame made gallant victualls of handfulls of <hi>Hellebor.</hi> Lastly,
<q>
                        <l>King <hi>Mithridates</hi> could not poyson'd bee,</l>
                        <l>He drinking poyson oft, grew poyson-free.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you search the cause of it, you shall find divers. First is, every mans natural property, by reason of which, Stares feed on Hemlock; Sows on Henbane, with delight. Then there is a certain proportion of poyson; for this changeth the power of the poyson, and the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the subject. Again, the strength or weaknesse of the body. <hi>Conciliator</hi> saith, he saw four men feeding on venomous meats, one dyed suddenly, two were dangerously sick, and the fourth escaped. To this adde the force of the composition, and the quantity; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the time and place wherein they are collected. So <hi>Trassius Mantinensis</hi> gathered his Hemlock in the coldest places, that he might sooner kill men. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> shews, <hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>hist. Plant.</hi> that at <hi>Chios</hi> there was a certain way to compound it, to make it effectuall. One stung by a Scorpion, may live many dayes; and one stung by Ammodites may live 7 dayes. Chersydrus kills in 3. days; a Viper in 3. hours; a Basilisk suddenly. Lastly, the history of a woman that sought to poyson her husband, proves, that poyson growes more effectuall by being mingled with poysons of the same kind; and lesse, by being mingled with poysons of a contrary kind. Also it is certain, that hot poysons cannot be conquer'd; for Sublimate by its extream corroding cannot be concocted by nature; and <hi>Napellus</hi> kills by its extremity of heat.</p>

bred in the same by ill diet, or coming thither from the matrix. Hence for the three first months especially, it happens to women great with Child, when they vomit, and the Child consumes not much. It troubles maids, when their courses are stopt. But it is hard to say, how such an appetite should proceed from this cause, and it is better to ascribe it to a hidden quality than to commit an absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in what is manifest. But what is reported of one <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he would eat glasse, stones, Wood, Living creatures, and Live-fish; and we were told by the famous <hi>Winsemius in praelection. anatomic.</hi> that a Country man in <hi>Frisland</hi> would do the same for money, that seems to proceed from the fault of the nerves. For in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he was dissected, the fourth conjugation of nervs, that is produced in other men for the benefit of their tast, neither came to his tongue nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but was turned back to the hinder part of his head, as <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> observed, <hi>Anatom. l.</hi> 15. Some also think a man may be nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by smells, and some Histories say, it hath been done. <hi>Rondeletius de piscib.</hi> saith, that one at <hi>Rome</hi> lived 40, yeares only by the Ayre, and <hi>Laertius</hi> reports that <hi>Democritus</hi> the <hi>Abderite,</hi> a Philosopher lived four days by smelling of bread steeped in Wine, that he might not profane the feasts of <hi>Ceres. Cardanus l.</hi> 8. <hi>de varietate rerum. c.</hi> 41, saith, that men may live longer only by contemplation. Lastly, <hi>Megasthenes</hi> writes that at the farthermost part of the <hi>Indies,</hi> from the East about the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> there is a Nation call'd <hi>Astomores,</hi> people that have no mouth, their body is all hairy, and they are clothed with the mosse of boughs: they live only by the Ayre and sents that they take in by their nostrills, they take no meat nor drink, but only the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of smells from roots and flowers, and wild Apples, that they carry with them in long Voyages, that they may not want sweet smells; and if the sents be too strong a little, they easily are killed thereby, <hi>Pliny l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 3. Yet surely sents being but qualities can nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish no man; they may out of all question refresh and cherish the brain.</p>

                  <p>DRunkards differ in their manner of their drunkennesse; for some are drunk before others. And some when they are drunk fall backwards, some forward, some sing, some quarrel. Writers give many reasons for this: They that are soonest drunk, are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to Wine, or they have drank more then their ability, (for naturally one cannot go from one extream to another without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience) or they have narrower veins that are too hot, or have a thicker constitution of body, or they prate too much when they drink. For speaking out, augmenteth natural heat that is inflamed by wine, and fills the head with vapours, and heaps up abundance of them; which being corrupted by continuall motion, are distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through the whole body, distending the eyes, inflating the temples, offending the brain. The same reason serves for such who at Feasts eat hot bread, drink strong wine, and eat abundance of meats that are salt, and talk continually. For all these things increase thirst exceedingly, and makes men drink out of measure. Also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers sorts of men eat bread wherein there is contain'd Nigella seed, Darnell, when they eat brown bread, or mingled with Millet seed. For these cause heavinesse, and a passion like to drunkennesse by grosse vapours, <hi>Canonher. l.</hi> 3. <hi>de admirand. Vini c.</hi> 1. Hitherto appertains refined wine, poured from the Lees. For this, though it be weaker to preserve it self, and having no lees, will sooner grow sowr, (for the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52474:165"/>
Lees are the root to preserve the Wine) yet because it is moyster, and pierceth into all the Veins of those that drink it, it sooner inflames the blood, makes men drunk, and overturns reason. <hi>Jason Pratens. de morb. cerebri.</hi> But women come not into this consideration, nor such as drink sharp Wine after sweet, or such as delight in new Wine.

Hence some say, <hi>Panis, Bread,</hi> comes from <hi>pasco</hi> to feed: some take it to be so call'd from <hi>Pan,</hi> that is, <hi>all,</hi> because it answers all meat. It is made of divers things. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> made it of the seed of <hi>Orindium.</hi> The <hi>Icthyophagi</hi> made it of fish dried in the Sun. <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1.

But I say, that can be no true meal, but it must be miraculous. I think it is some thick juyce that proceeds out of the earth, and in time is congealed by heat of the Sun, and so becomes fine meale. Divers Medicaments are made of bread. Aqua-vitae, the most noble treasure of life is thus made. <hi>Take the best bread cut into thin sippets, what is sufficient; put them into a hot Furnace, that by degrees they may dry, like red Bisquit: then bruise it grosely, and put it into a wide cauldron, and for every pound of this Bread, put in five pound of Fountain Water; flowers of hops one handfull, of anniseeds one ounce: boyle them together till one part be consumed, let them coole a little, and then powre them forth, and pass them through a basket or sieve, then powre on some leaven, first dissolved in warm water; shut this up in a Vessel, and let it ferment and work like new wine: lastly part it as it grows clear, distill it, and rectifie it like Spirit of Wine.</hi> Some distill the crumbs of white bread newly taken forth of the Oven, putting it into glasse Stills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> four ounces of it are given successefully against the Epilepsie.

The humours have wonderfull conveyances in the body, and certain periods. The blood doth grow vigorous, saith <hi>Soranus Ephesinus,</hi> (which like the Evangelists, doth measure the spaces and course of day and night by equall hours) from 9 a clock at night, till 3. a clock in the morning, in which time the blood in Man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted and elaborated: Thence is the mind of Man cheerfull at Sun-rising. Yellow choler is concocted from 3. in the morning, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till 9 a clock; in which time the naturall faculty separates choler from blood, and sends it to the gall bladder: Thence a man is prone to anger. Black choler is elaborated from 9. a clock of the day, till 3. at night. In this time the Liver is purified, and made clean of grosse blood; and this, Nature, as some say, ordains for the Spleen. From hence is the mind of Man darkned. Flegme is concocted from 3. at night till nine: For then Supper being ended, concoction begins to be made in the stomach, and the meat to be liquified. From hence Flegme swimming upon the stomach, and carried to the brain, makes a man sleepy.

                     <hi>PLinie</hi> writeth, that a Serpent is ingendred of the Marrow of the back-bone of a man. The truth of this testimony appeareth by experience, and is made manifest by an example that we read in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</hi> For the King of Aegypt having made the dead body of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to be hanged up, and they that watched it having spied a great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent winding about his head, and covering the face in such sort as no bird that preyes upon carrion durst soare thereabouts; the people of <hi>Alexandria</hi> running thither (saith he) in troupes to see this specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, called <hi>Cleomenes</hi> a demi-god, and the sonne of the Gods: untill such time as the best in knowledg among them had called to mind, that as of the putrified flesh of a dead Oxe, there grow Bees; of a horse, Wasps; and of an Asse, Beetles: so likewise, when the matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie substance which invironneth the Marrow, gathereth together and thickneth, Serpents are ingendred thereof. <hi>Camerarius</hi> saith, he hath oftentimes seen in a well-known place of <hi>Germany</hi> a yong gentlemans tombe, who was buried in a Chappell where his predecessors lay: It is said, that he was the fairest yong man of his time; and being troubled with a grievous sicknesse in the flower of his age, his friends could never get so much of him (no more than <hi>Agesilaus</hi> friends could get of him) as to suffer himself to be represented in sculpture or picture, to serve for posteritie: only this, through their importunitie he agreed unto, that after he should be dead and some daies in the ground, they should open his grave, and cause him to be represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they then found him. They kept promise with him, and found that the Worms had half gnawne his face, and that about the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driffe and the back-bone there were many Serpents. Upon this, they caused the spectacle (such as they found it) to be cut in stone: which is yet at this present to be seen among the armed Statues of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors of this yong gentleman. A notable example of the fragilitie of mans body, how faire and goodly so ever it be; and that all the splendor and magnificall shew that may be seen therein, is nothing else but rottennesse and Wormes-meat: as the Author of <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith; <hi>When a man dieth, he is the heritage of Serpents, Beasts and Worms.</hi> Which is confirmed by a certaine inscription graven upon a tombe at Rome in Saint <hi>Saviours</hi> Church, where are two Latine Verses to this effect.</p>

                  <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> aymed at the same when he said, That man was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but stinking seed, a sack of excrements, and the food of Worms.</p>

To this may be added, the weaknesse of the parts that serve for nutrition, if the retentive faculty hold not, and the expulsive cast forth strongly. Anno 1486, there was a kind of disease call'd <hi>the English Sweat</hi>; It first fell out in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Germany</hi> Anno 1529, it so spread, that it brake off the Treaty of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi> The force was so great, that it killed men in 24 hours, or else they recovered if it did breathe forth by sweat, <hi>Thuan. lib.</hi> 6.

                  <p>
                     <hi>AS in the great World, vapours are drawn forth from moyst places by the heat of the Sun and the Stars: so in Man, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le world, we must grant the same is caused by force of the inward heat. Yet lest they being united in mans body, should cause distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and make Feavers, God made mans body open and full of pores, through which the vapours breathe out, and that so finely, that the senses can scarce perceive them. Yet</hi> Sanctor. Sanctorius, <hi>did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and weigh them as fine as they are. Hence grew, that Physick is called</hi> Statica, <hi>wherein amongst other Aphorismes these are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>I.</hi> Insensible transpiration is far more, than all sensible transpirations put together.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> If the weight of the body begins to increase more than usually, without any greater addition of meat or drink, or retention of sensible excrements, there is a stopping of the pores.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>III.</hi> Perspiration that cures the body of a disease, and of that unprofitable weight, is not that which is made by sweat, but by that invisible breathing forth, which in Winter in one naturall day can send forth above <hi>50</hi> oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>IV.</hi> After sleep, before he voids any sensible Excrements, a man feels himself lighter; for he is so, about <hi>3.</hi> pounds weight more than ordinary.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>V.</hi> In one night commonly a man voids <hi>16</hi> ounces of urine, more or lesse, <hi>4.</hi> ounces of excrements by siege, and above <hi>40</hi> ounces by insensible transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>VI.</hi> Many men void more in one naturall day by insensible transpiration, than they do by their belly in <hi>15.</hi> dayes.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>VII.</hi> If cold fall upon the Ayr in Summer, and a man drink hard that day, it will hinder a third part almost of insensible transpiration; and if sensible transpiration do not help, it will easily dispose a man to corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or Cachexia.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>VIII.</hi> In Summer temperate bodies are lighter than in Winter about three pound weight.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>IX.</hi> In Summer if cold fall upon heat, the same day about one pound of excrements are kept in, and cannot breathe forth.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>X.</hi> From the Autumnall Equinoctiall, to the Summer Solstice, we breathe forth above one pound weight lesse every day; and from thence to the Vernall Aequinox we begin to breathe them forth more freely.</p>

we sleep, the perspiration of that night commonly amounts to <hi>40</hi> ounces; but if it do not end it, it comes to about <hi>18</hi> ounces.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>XII.</hi> Meats that nourish much, except Wether-Mutton, from Supper to Dinner, use not to breathe out above <hi>18.</hi> ounces.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>XIII.</hi> Plenty of meats, that nourish but little, in one night may breathe forth above <hi>40</hi> ounces in most men.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <hi>XIV.</hi> Wether-Mutton is easily concocted, and will breathe forth; for in one night it will come forth by insensible transpiration <hi>3.</hi> ounces more than other ordinary meats.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>XV.</hi> Unquiet rest hinders at least <hi>3.</hi> ounces of ordinary transpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

There were two sorts of them, some very little ones brought up in Princes Courts for sport; born by accident as Monsters are. Some are a people that live some where, or else they did formerly. I need not prove the former. Under <hi>Theodosius</hi> there was one so small in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that he seem'd no bigger than a Partridge; he was very wise, and had a pleasant voyce, and spake clearly, shewing the marks of a generous mind, he lived 20, years. <hi>Nicephor l.</hi> 12. <hi>Eccles. histor. c.</hi> 37. <hi>Johannes Cassinon de Gygant, p.</hi> 66, saw two at Lyons, one of them had a long beard, and was of a very beautiful countenance, some of our Chamberfellows saw at <hi>Falconburg,</hi> a mile from <hi>Leyds</hi> the last yeare, a female a cubit long, <hi>There was a Dwarf at the Marriage of the Duke of</hi> Bavaria, <hi>who was compleatly arm'd, with a short spear, and his sword girt about him, and he was hid in a Pie that one could not see him, and he was set upon the Table, and he brake the crust of the Pie and came forth, and drawing his sword he danced like a Fencer, and made all the people laugh and admire him,</hi> Plater. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Observ.</hi> At <hi>Dresda</hi> in the Castle of the Elector of Saxony there is to be seen the Skeleton of a dwarfe, not a cubit high, with so solid and well proportion'd bones, that one would think they were the bones of an <hi>Embryo.

Their haire hangs as farr &amp; somtime below their knees, &amp; they wear their beards longer than any men. And so soon as their long beard is grown, they use no clothing, but they let their haire fall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards much below their knees, and their beard covers their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts. Then when they have covered their whole bodies with haire, they girt themselves about with them instead of garments. Also their Yard is so thick and so great, that it will come down to their ankles. They are also flat nosed and deformed. Their sheep are no bigger than our Lambs, their Oxen and Asses are like our Rams in greatnesse, their Horses and Mules, and other creatures to carry burdens are no bigger. The King of the <hi>Indies</hi> hath 3000 of these Pigmies in his company. For they are most cunning Archers. They are very just, &amp; use the same Laws the other <hi>Indians</hi> do.

                  <p>WEe all know there are two Sexes: the male the superiour; and the female, inferiour almost in all things. God gave the man the Superiority, and commanded the woman to obey. If we consider her body, she shewes by this, her condition is the lowest; chiefly if we consider her temper and excrements. Hence, because they send forth sad vapours, by reason of their courses, they will make Nutmegs and Corall, look foul and black. But if a male carry the first it will grow fatter, the latter will look more red, <hi>Lemnius l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>de occult.</hi> They are easily angry, and their choler kindled, soon will boyl over; and for want of heat, they are not so ingenious. It is now the common opinion, that this sex is more lustfull than men are. Yet no man will deny, but that there are degrees in this. For in pale lean
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52474:173"/>
people, the genitall parts are filled with a sharp biting humour, and desire to be moystned. <hi>Lemnius l.</hi> 2. <hi>de occult. c.</hi> 37. conjectures, that they are more venereous than red fat people. Rue makes men lesse, women more lustfull. <hi>Secundus Philosophus,</hi> when he was perswaded that all women were naught, and having made triall, found it so in his own Mother, not that he lay with her, but found she would give him leave, being asked by <hi>Adrian</hi> what a woman was, answered, <hi>Mans Confusion; an unsatiable beast; a continuall trouble; a battel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end: the shipwrack of an incontinent Man; the slave of mankind.</hi> Yet be what it will be; This sex is not so much to be despised: but there are some found above this condition.

                  <p>SOme have observed, that Children have cryed in their mothers wombs, and so lowd, that they could be well heard. In <hi>Wein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richius of Monsters,</hi> you shall find Examples. A Poet writes thus:
<q>
                        <l>Wonder it is, a Child did sadly cry,</l>
                        <l>Which was unborn, and in the womb did ly.</l>
                        <l>The cause was this, it griev'd, and with its might</l>
                        <l>Strove to come forth, to see the Worlds great light.</l>
                        <l>Or else perhaps, it shew'd the earnest care</l>
                        <l>To help its Parents that now weary were.</l>

                  <p>Some think, that this portends some hurt to the child, or to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: others think, that this is contrary to reason and experience. To Experience, because there is no certainty that any such thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened amongst the old Philosophers. To Reason, because there can be no cry heard without drawing the ayr by the mouth, and without
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52474:173"/>
the beating at the ayr by the sharp artery when we breathe it forth, and without a certain forming of it by the mouth, and the Palate. For being there is no place for a reciprocall course of the ayr, in the veins and arteries, and the Infants urinary passage, that are filled with other things; nor for so great abundance, that a passage should be made by the heart; it cannot enter by the navel, by reason of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table danger of heat, nor can it be admitted by the matrix: to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that all are full of an excrementitious glutinous matter. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bavius</hi> supposeth all things required for breathing in the Thorax to be made, and he thinks that the internal aereal breath made of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours by the active heat, and shut up within the house where the child is, and also contain'd in the capacity of the Lungs, being pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed forth by the Child, may serve the turn.

Those that are born in the fift month, are very fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as a maid was that <hi>Valescus de Philos. sacra c.</hi> 18. mentions, who was more slender and thin than women-kind use to be.

The poore woman moved with this reproach and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious repulse, and of the other side well assured of her honest carriage, made earnest request to God, that for the proofe of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and of the faith which He knew she had kept inviolably to her husband, it would please him to grant that this Countesse might have so many Children at one burden, as there were daies in the yeare: which within a while after came to passe. And he addeth, that these Children were as big as Chickens new hatcht, all alive, and sound, and died within a little while together with their mother: to whom this Epitaph following was erected in the Monasterie of Lodun, where there were Nunnes of the order of S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and it is hard by the Hague in <hi>Holland.</hi>

She fearing the reproach of adulterie (whereof yet she was not guilty) and the punishment of like-for-like, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that eleven of them should be taken and cast into a River that was not far from the house, and that one should be saved to be brought up. It so fell out that <hi>Isenbard</hi> met the woman that was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the little infants to their death, and asking her, whither she went with her paile? he had this answer, that she was going to drown a few baggage whelps in the River of Schere. The Earle came unto her, and (for all the resistance the woman made) would see what was there, and then discovering the Children, pressed her in such wise, that she told him all the matter. Then he caused them to be nourished and educated secretly, and so soon as they were grown great and brought home to him, he set them in an open hall besides him whom his wife had brought up: and then being all known to be brethren by their faces, and their other fashions, their mother moved in conscience confessed all the fact, and obtained pardon for her fault. In remembrance whereof the honorable race of the <hi>Wolfes</hi> got that name, which ever since it hath kept.</p>

                  <p>NAture in working intends her own businesse; but because divers obstacles may happen in respect of the first agent, the seed, the constitution of the Heavens, the formative vertue, imagination, heat, it is no wonder if she erre sometimes. And though there be Monsters almost in all mixt bodies, yet those Monsters that happen amongst living creatures are chiefly remarkable. And such fall out either in quantity or quality. A woman of <hi>Troas,</hi> Anno 1569, brought forth twins joyn'd by the heads, <hi>Pareus l.</hi> 24. <hi>oper. c.</hi> 2. <hi>Valeriola locor. commun. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. saw at <hi>Avignon</hi> one with two bodies all from the neck. <hi>Munsterus</hi> saw two Maids joyn'd together, with their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads one against the other; and when one went forward, the other went backwards. At <hi>Florence</hi> there were two boyes, one was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body, the other was fastned by his shoulders to the others sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that all his head seemed to be thrust into it; and when the former sucked, he moved as if he sucked also, <hi>Benivent. de reb. abdit.

About the end of the Empire of <hi>Lotharius,</hi> a certain woman bore a child like a man and a dogg; their bodies joyn'd entirely, and they were fastned at the ridge of their backs, <hi>Lycost. lib. prodigior.</hi> In <hi>Scotland</hi> there was one that was a male for the nether parts, but above the navell it had two members, distinct both for use and in shape. This Monster was taught the Musicall Art, and learn'd many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. It held consultation, and when they differ'd, they would chide and quarrel; it lived 28 years. And when one body dyed many dayes before the other, the other that lived pined away, half the body being putrified before, <hi>Buchan. in histor.

                  <p>IT is commonly said, that those that are deficient naturally, are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for some malignant qualities: and this is sometimes found to be true; but it is most false, that it is alwayes so. For to say nothing of the diversity of parts, which <hi>Lemnius</hi> adviseth us to take notice of: such is the force of education, that it made <hi>Socrates</hi> good, that would have been bad. Moreover, Nature is so indulgent, that, as if she were ashamed of her mistake, she largely recompenceth her errour with other endowments. Count <hi>Mansfeld</hi> that fail'd in sight, could by touching, know white from black, <hi>Keckerm. in Physicis. Hamar,</hi> a Captain of a Caravan, would know where he was by onely smelling the same, <hi>Leo African.</hi> A Preacher in <hi>Germany</hi> that was blind from his nativity, chose the fairest of three Sisters, by taking her by the hand, <hi>Camer. Hor. subcis. Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 80. <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, <hi>Homer</hi> was blind; we see not him, but his Poetry. His words are, <hi>Tusculan.</hi> 5. <hi>What Country, what place, what Town of</hi> Greece, <hi>what form, what fight, what Army, what rowing, what motion of men or beasts, is not so represented by him, that what he saw not, he described it so, that we might see it?

                     <hi>Georgius Pictorius Villinganus l.</hi> 4. <hi>Sermon Convival.</hi> testifies, that he saw a <hi>Spaniard</hi> born without arms, so cunning with his feet, that he could spin, or use the neidle curiously, as the cunningst woman could with both her hands. He could so wield his arms, that no Souldier could match him; and shoot in a bowe, that he would never misse the mark; and with one stroke he would break a thick log. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Keckerman</hi> speaks of a Schollar, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Physic.</hi> c. 4. that had but one little finger on each hand, and his feet were triangular without any toes, and he had more force in one finger, than others had with five; he writ curiously and swiftly, and stood so firm, that in slippery places he would seldom slip. Also <hi>Pliny</hi> may cease to complain of nature, that is a bountifull mother to all; and recompenseth a defect with more benefit.</p>

                     <hi>Camerarius</hi> and some others being once at Combourg, in the house of <hi>Erasmus Neusteter,</hi> a wise and vertuous gentleman of Germanie, he entertained us with the greatest kindnesse that could be devised, and sent to a place not very farre from them for one <hi>Thomas Schweiker,</hi> a young man of one and thirtie yeares of age, descended of a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full house, and borne without ever an arme, who did with his feet all that a readie man could do with his hands, so that himself affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was recompenced with one gift in stead of another. Having set himself in a place equall with the heighth of the table whereon the meat was placed, he took a knife with his feet, begins to cut bread, and to cut meat, which he carried with his feet to his mouth, and likewise the cup, as easily as another would have done with his hands. After dinner, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e begins to write examples in Latin and German let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so straight and so faire, as every one of us desired to have some of them to keep as a speciall monument. Being requested, he did with a penknife make penns, very good to write with, which he gave us. While he was thus a doing, I marked diligently the making of his feet, and saw that his toes were long, fit to take hold of things; and to behold them a farr off, one would take them for fingers: for his thighs and legs, he kept them mannerly covered with his Cloake. This sight (which we had never seen before) was no lesse pleasing
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52474:176"/>
than strange to us; as it was also at another time to the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the second, who passing that way, desired to see the man, and having noted in him (not without wonderment) the strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Nature, he dismissed him with a rich gift. Of late there hath been seen a man without armes going about in Germanie, who had learned by custome turned into art, to handle a sword, and to flourish it about his neck; to fling halberds, and to do other strange things so nimbly, and so surely withall, that he would most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hit the marke; and all other duties of the hands, he did them with his feet. But the end of his life shewed that he was a deceiver and a wicked person: for he was broken upon the wheele for his rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries and murders.</p>
                  <p>We have at Nuremberg a young Man and a young Maid, borne of one Father and Mother, of a good House, and well known, that are endued with a singular quick conceit: for although they be deafe and dumb by nature, yet can both of them read very well, write, cypher, and cast account. The young man conceiveth at first by signes that are made him, what he is required to do. If his pen be wanting, by his countenance he sheweth his thoughts, being the quickest and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningest at all games both at Cards and Dice, that one can find among the Germans; although there they use great advisement, and be marveilous readie and quick. His sister passeth all other maids for working with her needle all kinds of Seamstrie, Tapistrie, Embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp;c. But among all the other wonderfull recompences of nature, this is remarkable in them, that most commonly as soon as they see ones lips stirr, they understand his meaning. They are oftentimes at Sermons, and a man would say that they draw and conceive with their eyes the words of the Preacher, as others use to do with their eares: for, they will oftentimes (no body ever teaching them, or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them any Letters or Copies) write the Lords Prayer and other godly prayers, know by heart the texts of the Gospels that are read upon holy-days, and write them readily. When in the Sermons the Preacher maketh mention of the name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> the young man is readie before any of the hearers, to take off his hat, and to bow his knee with all reverence; So carefull is nature, like a good mother, to make amends for a fault, that none should accuse her to be a step-mother: for, what she taketh away in some of the senses, she al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the rest, as appeareth by <hi>Didymus Alexandrinus,</hi> of whom <hi>

                        </gap>ussinus</hi> writeth, that he being blind, after he had humbly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himself to God, spent all his time in hearing, insomuch as by his diligent attention he attained to that which others obtaine by reading; and by the direction of the holy Spirit, became so skillfull in divine and humane learning, that he was excellent among the Divines of his time. Moreover, our Ancestors have seen <hi>Iohn Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> a blind and poor soul, a Spaniards son, who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so happily these two difficulties (very crosse to all, especially to learned men) that he became not only a very learned Poet and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, but also so excellent a Musician, that he played upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:52474:176"/>
kinds of Instruments, to the great pleasure of the hearers; and besides, he made good songs and full of musick, of many parts. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, named <hi>Nicasius</hi> of <hi>Werd,</hi> borne at <hi>Macklin,</hi> excelled him: for fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blind when he was three yeares old, and not being able before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> learne any one letter, he so profited in the knowledg of Philosophy, both humane and divine, that all men were ravished with him. Having proceeded Master of Arts at <hi>Lovain,</hi> and afterwards being made Principall of <hi>Macklin</hi> Colledg, where he discharged his dutie passing well; he ascended a while after to the degree of <hi>Licenciat</hi> in <hi>Theologie,</hi> and though he were blind, he read, and preached open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Furthermore, being made Doctor of the Laws in the University of Colen, he read there, and expounded the Civil and Canon Law, repeating by heart the texts which he had never read, and at last di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Colen</hi> in the yeare 1492.</p>
                  <p>We will conclude this Chapter with an example of one borne blind, in whom nature made supplie of that defect with a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous recompence other ways. The story is mentioned by <hi>Antonius de Palermo,</hi> thus: I learnt (saith he) of King <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> that there was a Sicilian borne blind, living still at that time in the Citie <hi>Gergento,</hi> called in old time <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> who had followed him oftentimes a hunting, shewing to the Hunts-men (who had their sights well ynough) the retraits and repairing places of the wild beasts. He add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further touching the industry of this blind man, that having by his sparing and scraping, gotten together about five hundred Crowns, which put him to a great deale of care, he resolved (at last) to hide them in a field. As he was making a hole in the ground to that end, a gossip of his being his neighbour, espied him, who so soon as the blind man was gon, searched in the earth, found the money, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it cleane away. Two or three dayes after, the blind man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thither to visit his cash, and finding nought there; like one altogether forlorne, he frets and torments himselfe, and after much debating and discoursing concludes, that no man but his gossip could have played him such a trick. Whereupon finding him out, he thus began to say unto him; Gossip, I am come to you to have your opinion: I have a thousand Crowns, and the one half of them I have hid in a safe place; and for the other halfe I know not what to do with them, having not my sight, and being very unfit to keep any such thing, therefore what think you? might I not hide this other halfe with the rest, in the same place of safetie? The gossip approved and commended his resolution, and going speedily to the place, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back againe the five hundred Crowns that he had taken away before, hoping that he should have all the whole thousand together. A while after the blind man goes to his hole, and finding there his Crowns againe, took them up, and comming home, calleth for his gossip, saying unto him with a cheerfull voice; Gossip, the blind man hath seen better than he that hath two eyes.</p>

Anno 1403, a Sea-Woman was taken in the Lake of <hi>Holland,</hi> and brought to <hi>Harlem,</hi> she was ready to learn some things that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do, but she could not speak.

Historians approved do write these things. We will not here add what we think, onely the Devill hath many wiles; and great is the force of Imagination; and sometimes beasts are taken for men, if they be but like them. We read in the <hi>Scotch</hi> History, that the Kings Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were brought by a storm into <hi>Norway,</hi> and saw hairy beasts in the Mountains wandring like to men, they thought they had been men, the Inhabitants told them they were wild beasts.

                     <hi>Article 10.</hi> Of a wonderfull Antipathy betweeen the Father and the Sonne.</head>
                  <p>THere was a Father that hated his child as much as some men do Cats; for if he were present, though he saw him not, he would swoond. <hi>Georgius Mylius,</hi> a Divine of <hi>Jena,</hi> related it. <hi>Libavius</hi> sought the cause diligently. And if the reason of antipathy in naturall things be worth enquiry, that is most worthy to be searched out, that is between children and parents. This is certain, that the cause of this discord cannot be found, nor in the rational nor the sensual part. For he wished his son no harm, nor can sympathy or antipathy be called love or hatred in parents. For they are to be found in things that are not living; and if they be in living creatures, they are not in them as they are living, but as they are natural, things. Yet because he did not abhor his other son, nor hate his off-spring, for which cause he married, it is certain that was no hereditary infirmity. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the son was changed into a disposition the father could not away with; and that might proceed from the seminary body ill disposed from the womb, or by the confluence of impure blood, that had in it some ground for this alteration, or from the blood the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo was nourished with. For this growes divers from the matter of the nourishment, or may degenerate from some other inward cause, or from the place: sometimes the spirits that assist the blood and the whole nature, cause a change. Therefore either the mother had a great longing for some meat the father hated; or else she was frighted at something the father could not endure: To say nothing of the Midwife, or of hidden causes. So a Maid at <hi>Uratislavian,</hi> drank Cats blood, and became of a Cats qualities; and <hi>Faustina</hi> tasting the Fencers blood, had a son that was most cruell. If any think that a habit cannot be got by one act, he must know that is false of naturall powers; for they that of old were once taken into <hi>Trophonius</hi> his den, were wayward ever after; and a woman that fell into a Wolfs hole, grew hoary the same night.</p>

                              <p>IT hath been thought hitherto that a man could not live a moment almost; if his Heart were wounded. Reason and Experience prove it. For since our life depends upon the safety of the spirits, the shop and making whereof is in the Heart; when the heart is wounded, it is necessary that the generation of the spirits cease. Yet I thought good to set down here a very notable History; a history of a Souldier that lived <hi>15</hi> dayes after he was wounded in the heart; none of the old or new Physitians mention any such thing. <hi>Andreas Hasevanger,</hi> who was of the Lifeguard of the most illustrious Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> Governour of <hi>Frisia, Groning,</hi> and <hi>Omland,</hi> &amp;c. received a wound in his brest by his fellow-Souldier, <hi>Anno 1607,</hi> on the <hi>22</hi> of <hi>August</hi> about the Evening, he died <hi>September</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> at one of the clock after Sun-rising, which was the <hi>16</hi> day after he received the wound. The body of the dead Souldier, by command of the Generall of the Army was opened to search for the wound, by me and two Chirurgions, <hi>Caspar</hi> and <hi>Lucas Hultenus;</hi> a noble valiant man, <hi>Bernard Hoornkens</hi> looking on, and some other Souldiers that were of note. When we had opened the cavity of his breast, and a great deal of very stinking matter was run forth; we found, and wondred, that the wound had entred the right cavity of his heart, and all that part of his heart was almost all consumed; the left part being entire, wherein is contain'd the chief shop of the vitall spirits; By the benefit of this, <hi>Andreas</hi> lived to the sixteenth day: and left some should not believe this, the most noble and worthy men signed it with their names subscribed, to confirm it, &amp;c.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Pulse is the motion of the heart and arteries, consisting of a systole and diastole. <hi>Platerus</hi> thinks it is felt on the left side, by reason of the great Artery. Yet <hi>Cardan</hi> saith, some have perceived it onely on the right side. There is great inequality in it, from divers accidents that happen, whence comes the diversity of pulses amongst Physitians. No man can deny, but that sometimes it may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and not felt when the Arteries lye deep, <hi>Balduinus Ronseus.</hi> The Player of <hi>Andreas</hi> Count of <hi>Gorca,</hi> had naturally all kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities of pulse. But <hi>Johannes Brosovius</hi> of the Order of the Crosse of the blessed Virgin had it with intermission all the time he lived. Physitians try the motion of the heart in living creatures. <hi>Coiterus</hi> observed it in a Cat. Then cutting the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> he observed a double and contrary motion in the heart, namely unto the ears of it. For whilest the heart beat, the ears sank down; when the heart sank, the ears were lifted up and fill'd; which in the ears were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for a diastole: they seemed to be inflated like a bladder; and when they were extended, they were red, and continued so a while, before they came to a systole. The same reason was observed in the space of the diastole. Yet in the systole they grew white, and became loose, and sank down, and by the force of the heart, they were drawn a little toward the basis of the heart, &amp;c. In <hi>obs. Anatom.</hi>

                  <p>I Have little to say of Life, but that men were long lived before the Flood: after that time none lived to <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Methusalems</hi> Age. Yet some have lived very long, <hi>Lemnius l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24. <hi>Occult.</hi> writes, that he saw a Pilote at <hi>Stockholm</hi> a 100 years old, who married a Wife of 30, years, and had some Children by her. <hi>Laurentius Hethlandius</hi> in <hi>Buchanan</hi> was 140 years old, and yet in the coldest Winter went a fishing. An <hi>Indian</hi> of the Nation of the <hi>Gandaridae,</hi> they call it now a days, <hi>Bengala,</hi> lived 335 years, his Son was 90 years old, and though he knew no letters, yet he could by memory report as true as the Chronicles. His teeth shed and grew again, and his hoary beard grew black again. <hi>Petrus Maffeius.</hi> That is also rare, that <hi>Thuan. l.</hi> 134 writes. That <hi>Emanuel Demetrius,</hi> bred obscurely, lived 103, yeares, his Wife was 99, and was married to him 75 years, the one supervived the other but three hours, and Anno 1603 they were both buried at <hi>Delph.</hi> The years of Mans age that rise by 7 and 9, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory or climactericall, hence Children are endangered about 4, 7, 9, years, <hi>&amp;c.

For when nature comes to immoderate repletion, and the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52474:179"/>
receptacles cannot receive the plenty of humours, it must come to a disease. <hi>Philo in loc. allegor. l.</hi> 1. writes thus of the 7th year. <hi>Nature delights in the</hi> 7<hi>th number; there are</hi> 7 <hi>Planets, the Bear hath</hi> 7 <hi>Stars; the Moon hath some change every week, and those changes in the ayre proceed from thence.

                  <p>BEcause Venoms are most pernicious by a hidden quality, I shall add a few things concerning the variety of Infections. First I shall speak of the Ayre infected. That is seen in the Plague, and might be proved by all in that Cave neere to <hi>Naples.</hi> And the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is come so far, that the Ayre may be infected by art, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my coming into it may be killed. That was clear in the Sepulcher of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> that was placed above the famous gates of the City. For when <hi>Darius,</hi> hoping to find treasure, opened this, he found a little Coffer, which being opened, such a Venemous blast flew out, that it killed a third part of the men. Some living Creatures kill by sight, and hissing. That was thought true of the Basilisk, that was seen in the treasure of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour. And <hi>Avicenna</hi> writes <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>sen. tract.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 22. that a Souldier wounded a Serpent with his Lance, and by his Lance he and his Horse were poysoned, and died. <hi>Bartholin. Phys. special. part.</hi> 3. <hi>c. ult.</hi> saith, that in <hi>Cimbria</hi> a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard that leand his arme on a Barn dore, had his sense and motion taken suddenly away on that side he leand, and his beard grew grey on that side, and there was a brood of Serpents, found under the dore. <hi>Jambolus</hi> saith, in <hi>Arabia</hi> there is an hearb, and if any man sleep upon it, they die in a sweet sleep. <hi>Diodor. Sicul. l.</hi> 2. I add tasting to sight. So in <hi>India</hi> when those of <hi>Europe</hi> tasted the beautifull Plants, they died suddenly. <hi>Alexanders</hi> Army was almost ruin'd by a new kind of Apple. A Country man in the Valley of <hi>Ana,</hi> was bit una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares by the head of a Serpent cut off, he put his mouth to the wound and sucked it, to help it; but he grew suddenly speechlesse and died, <hi>Mathiol.</hi> What shall we say for touching? The <hi>Turks</hi> have Poysons that will kill in one day by touching. <hi>Cardan. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de venen. c.</hi> 15. <hi>Otho</hi> the 3, Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> was killed by a pair of venom'd gloves sent him from the Wife of <hi>Crescentius</hi> a Roman Consul, who was frustrated of his marriage. <hi>Johan Galeacius</hi> was killed by Venome put into his stirrop when he rid. <hi>Dryinus,</hi> if any man tread upon it, it will excoriat his feet, and the hand of the Chirurgion that dresseth the sore will be excoriated by it. Lastly many dye by venom'd smells. For <hi>Alexander Magnus</hi> his horse-forces in <hi>India,</hi> died all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of the smell of a Pestilent shrub: and <hi>Franciscus Ordelaphus,</hi> a Captain of <hi>Forolivium,</hi> had a kind of Poyson, that, cast upon coles, would kill all came neere it. Think not that to be done by the naked quality: some Venemous thing was joyn'd with the smell; for certain it is, that there are many effluxions of things.</p>

A woman, saith <hi>Trallianus,</hi> tied the middle finger of her hand, as if she carried the whole world upon it; she cryed, saying, she feared that should she bend it, the whole World would fall down. A learned man in <hi>Quercetan. Diaetet. Polyhist. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c. ult.</hi> thought, that two evill spirits were put into him by his friend that brought them out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that they oft-times talked with him. A <hi>Burgundian</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Temple of St. <hi>Julian,</hi> said, he was dead, and desired the Physitians to trouble his soul no longer, that was flying out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory into Heaven.

I say nothing of a Maid, who supposed she was in Heaven, and that she walked with the sacred Trinity, and Angels, and the Devill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded her to think so. Sometimes such people use to speak strange tongues, and foretell future events. So <hi>Erasmus in Encom. Medicinae,</hi> writes, that one of <hi>Spoletum,</hi> when he was sick, spake a strange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; when he recovered, he forgat it. <hi>Guainerius tract.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 4. reports, that he saw a Country man that was sick of melancholy, who alwayes when the Moon was combust, would write Latine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and after a new Moon, about two dayes, till the next new Moon, he could not speak one word in Latine. <hi>Forestus</hi> writes of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly woman that would sing Latine songs that she had never learned. And <hi>Johan. Huartus in scrutin. Ingenior.</hi> makes mention of a Spanish servant, who imagined himself to be a King, and made learned spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches concerning Government when he was sick. But we must needs confesse, that the Devill is the Author of these things, by a just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Nor can this be ascribed to the Stars, as <hi>Guainerius</hi> thinks; nor to the agreement of the Latine tongue with the rationall Soul, as <hi>Huartus</hi> would have it; nor to the pure overshadowing of the spirits, or to a malignant quality, as others suppose. Whether

some modern examples appertain to this matter, I leave it to wise men to judge, and will say no more of it.</p>

                  <p>THe force of Imagination may be known by the former Article; but because melancholique Imaginations are with sicknesse, they do not so well expresse it, as fear and conception do. For when a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Youth who had ravished a Maid, was to dye for it, he considered so deeply of it, that his vital heat and spirits were so extinguished, that all his beauty became despicable, and the roots of his hair grew dry, for want of moysture, and turn'd grey, <hi>Camer. memorab. medic. Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>Mem.</hi> 15. The same happened to <hi>Franciscus Gonzaga,</hi> when he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for a Traytor, <hi>Scalig. Exer.</hi> 312. And to <hi>Lodowick. Bavarus</hi> the Emperour, when he had slain <hi>Helica</hi> a Virgin of <hi>Prenneberg,</hi> cut off his Wifes head, and had cast another Noble woman headlong from a Tower, he fell sick of it by a vision in the night, <hi>Avent. l.</hi> 7. Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Examples prove, that in conception the same may happen. The Wife of Duke <hi>Plumbinus</hi> having layn with a Black-moor, was delivered of a Blackmore. <hi>Persina</hi> an Aethiopian, seeing the Image of a white child when she lay with a man, had a child with a white face, <hi>Heliodor.</hi> When <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth was Emperour, the Wife of <hi>John Baptista,</hi> looking often on a picture, bare a hairy child. A man disguised lying with the Wife of <hi>Bolduck,</hi> as if he had been the Devill, got her with child, and the boy ran about so soon as he was born. You shall find the like Monster in <hi>Lemnius in occult.</hi> And he extends Imagination so far, that he thinks, that in more venereous Virgins, their seed being mingled with their blood by imagination of venereous things, may cause the rudiments of a living creature. How that may be, it is hard to explain, nor doth it belong to this place.</p>

And when he was heavy with sleep he laid his head in that Mans bosome and fell a sleep. This servant there observed a strange thing; For he saw as it were a little Creature creep out of his mouth whilst he slept, and go strait to the River; and when he strove in vain to passe over, the Servant laid his drawn sword over the brook, whereby, when the little beast had easily passed over, he crept into a hole in a Mountain hard by, and coming back an hour after he passed the same way, and crept again into the Kings mouth. The King wak'd and told his Servant, that in a dream he seemed to be brought to the bank of a great River, and to have passed over an iron bridge, and so to come to a Mountain where there was great store of gold hid. When the King had related
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52474:182"/>
this to his Servant, and heard again from him what strange thing hapned when he slept, they both went to that Mountain, and there they found a mighty masse of Gold conceald.

And I saw that the weary Oxe set his feet firmer. And there came another Ram from the Mountain of the Gentils, and those ways, and breaking one leg between his horns, he ran upon his fore parts; yet the Oxe stood fast again and fell not, but the Rams grieved exceedingly, and those that adored the Rams wept; because God preserved him, and sent him food from</hi> India <hi>that strengthned him. And behold on the otherside of the River stood an</hi> Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian <hi>Tyger, with the Moon upon his Head, and he said, I will prey on both the conquerer, and the conquered; and the Ram with three horns was devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Tyger, and conquered him.

                     <hi>Artic. 6.</hi> Of Walkers in the Night.</head>
                  <p>THere are many examples of Night-walkers. A certain young man rising out of his bed, putting on his Cloths, and his Boots and Spurs, got astride above the window, upon a Wall; and spurd the Wall as if it had been a horse. Another went down into a Well and came not up again till he had touched the water. <hi>Horstius</hi> tells of a Noble Man that went to the top of a Tower, and robb'd a birds nest, and came down again by a rope.</p>
                  <p>It is reported, that one at <hi>Paris,</hi> girt with his sword, swam over the <hi>Seyn,</hi> and killed one he was minded to kill before; when he had done this villany, he return'd home, <hi>Aleman. comm. ad. libr. Hippocrat. de Aere,</hi> &amp;c. As for the cause, many men are of divers minds. The best opinion ascribes it to Imagination: for the sensitive soul in sleep, not onely rouzed by an external object, converts her self to be sensible, and first perceives darkly, afterwards more clearly; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected by the inward object represented in a dream, rouzeth the moving faculty. The Imagination is rouzed by the species of things reserved; about which whilest it acts intentively, it stirs up the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faculty. That this is so, appears by daily experience. For who knowes not but we are troubled in our sleep? That we rise not, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our phantasie is not altogether so busie about the Images reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as in some other men. Yet the stronger motion doth not alwaies proceed from the same cause. For some think the same thing may be
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52474:183"/>
caused from diurnal cogitation, especially in younger people, that are more bold, and more lustfull. Others suffer this from an internal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their body, yet they are not all of the same kind. Some have more cheerful, and more phantastick animal spirits; some seem to do this out of simplicity. That they wake not, is caused by the stiffnesse of the vapours. For these not suffering them to be easily awaked; and on the other side, the animal spirits being lively, it falls out that they are half awake, half asleep: yet it is not likely, that all are of the same kind. For that boy <hi>Libavius</hi> speaks of, that went na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to the door, and came home again, observed a Watchman sitting in the streets. Lastly, the cause they do those things in their sleep, they cannot do waking, is their ignorance of the danger; the action of reason is darkned, and they cannot hinder the motions raised by Phantasie, <hi>Libav. in Noctambulis.</hi>

I saw him, once and twice, when I dined with the Prince, when he had cast off the Dwarfe from his back, and barked away the doggs, he leaped over the shoulders of one that sat at table, then over the Table, not touching the cups nor platters that stood upon it, and then into higher places, and that so nimbly, that he seemed to flye like a Squirrel, or <hi>Indian</hi> Cat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> writes.

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the rational Soul; and first, of Memory.</head>
               <p>THe rational Soul is the Form of Man, and gives man his Being, distinguishing him from other creatures. The faculties of it are two, Understanding and Will, the speaking faculty is given to them both, to interpret. There is scarce any thing to be said of them. For though there are infinite almost considerations of them, if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diversity of inventions, virtues, consultations, tongues, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of writings, and the rest, yet, should we adde them here, it would be a great fault in method, for they are more fitly handled in the Ethicks, and therefore I forbeare them here.</p>
               <p>I shall onely adde one thing of Memory: That some have had an excellent Memory; <hi>Esdras</hi> the Priest had all the Jews doctrine by heart. <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> knew every Souldiers name in their Armies. <hi>Carmides</hi> would say any books that any one asked for in their Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as if he read in them, <hi>Plin. Mithridates</hi> had learned the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of 22 Nations, <hi>Gellius. Julius Caesar</hi> would dictate to four at the same time; <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, he was wont to dictate, to read, and to hear. <hi>Themistocles</hi> had such a Memory, that when <hi>Simonides</hi> offered to teach him the Art of Memory, he said, He <hi>had rather learn the Art to forget</hi>; saying, <hi>He remembred what he would not, but could not forget what he would,</hi> Cic. l. 2. de finib. <hi>Seneca</hi> repeated in order 2000 names as they were first spoken. He rehearsed 200 verses, and began at the last. <hi>Portius Latro</hi> never read over again what he was to deliver: For he learned it as he writ it, and he repeated it, and never missed one word. As these had excellent Memories, so others had as bad, either from some disease, or ill constitution by birth. <hi>Messala Corvinus</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat his own name. <hi>Franciscus Barbarus,</hi> a most learned Man at <hi>Athens</hi> in the Greek Tongue, having a blow on his head with a stone, remembred firmly all things else, onely he forgate Learning, that he had spent so much time upon, <hi>Valer. Max. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Clusius Sabinus</hi> had such a barren Memory, that sometimes he forgat the name of <hi>Ulysses,</hi> sometimes of <hi>Achilles,</hi> sometimes of <hi>Priamus,</hi> Seneca in Epistol. <hi>Atticus</hi> the son of <hi>Herod</hi> the Sophister, could never learn the names of the letters. The <hi>Thracians</hi> could never count above four. But the greatest Wonder is that <hi>Thuan. l.</hi> 134 writes of <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed, when his mind was grown feeble, he forgat things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but what was printed in his Memory afore time, when he had his understanding, that he held; and it continued for two years so, when he languished. As for wit, that depends on a certain tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it is wonder, that oft-times those are stupid in many things, that are held wise in other things. <hi>Themistocles</hi> could not so well take as catch counsels. There was one could not learn the Rules of Logick, yet other Arts he could quickly learn, <hi>Huartus.</hi> For the excellency of it; <hi>Janus Drusus,</hi> the famous Student, had a son so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52474:185"/>
that from 15 years old to 20, when he dyed, he writ excellent Commentaries on the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and other Books. <hi>Drus. in praef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralip. in n.</hi> 7. Yet the Wit of Man cannot reach many things. The force of the Loadstone; flowing of the Sea; the wonderful effects of humours in Man's body; the constitution of his naturall heat; and many more. They have busied many, but no man hath rightly found them out. The vulgar opinion is, God cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by reason of his Excellency; nor <hi>materia prima</hi> for its worthles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Hidden Properties are too loose an <hi>Asylum</hi> for our Ignorance. I will here stop, for so I intend. My purpose was to set down things most pleasant, to make young Men delight in Naturall History, and to help those that teach Noblemens children privately. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted many things doubtfull, and I have alledged their causes from other mens opinions, to shew, that Nature requires searching. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is fruitfull, and I could not set down all. Her bounds are so large, that it is beyond my strength to search over all. If what I have writ be accepted, and I shall have so much ability and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, I shall write an <hi>Enchiridion</hi> of Naturall History, wherein Nature shall be set forth at large, and in short also. I shall leave the scrutiny to others; <hi>Whether,</hi> and <hi>Wherefore,</hi> things are. But the Supream over all will provide for these things. To whom be praise and glory to all Ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>
