            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is an ancient and approved Axiom: <hi>Quae conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33005:3"/>
               <hi>in eodem tertio, ea quoque inter ſe conveniunt,</hi> Whatſoever things agree in ſome one third thing, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo agree between themſelves.

And if that good man <hi>(Linaker)</hi> were now alive, and ſhould ſee this implacable diviſion between the Profeſſours of the ſame Goſpel, would he not, and that justly, break out with indignation againſt us, into that his paſsionate Speech: <hi>Surely either theſe men profeſſe not the right Goſpel of Chriſt, or are not right Profeſſours of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel?</hi> This is a Lamentation, and this ſhall be for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. <hi>O God,</hi> who art the Father of Peace, <hi>O Chriſt,</hi> who art the Prince of Peace, <hi>O Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who art the Spirit of Peace, work it in the Hearts and Affections of thy Children, Diſciples and Saints, that they may love and live in peace. But to come to mine intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matter.</p>
            <p>From hence alſo hath ariſen this new forged Sect of M. <hi>Hendens,</hi> of the which theſe following Papers will give thee a ſlight view; and with the which I am at unawares more deeply engaged then at firſt I meant.
<pb facs="tcp:33005:4"/>
The brief Story whereof is this, M. <hi>Henden</hi> hath been a man of good Note theſe many years, for Profeſsion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; no deſpiſer of Learning, but rather a lover of it. By his private Induſtry he hath added to his Grammar-School-learning, ſome Knowledge of the <hi>Original Tongues.</hi> Studious alſo he hath been of the Scriptures; (unto which his retired life, partly upon ſome bodily infirmity, partly (as ſome have thought) upon ſome worldly Diſcontents, gave him an opportunity) and eſpecially of the dark Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> In the which his vein hath been to vary from the ſtream of other Interpreters, and to produce ſome unuſual notion of his own with no ſmall confidence of its truth. This man was heretofore a great <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> of the old <hi>Separatiſts</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and with much zeal did, againſt them, maintain our <hi>Churches in England,</hi> and our <hi>Miniſtery</hi> then, as the true Churches and Miniſtery of Chriſt. But now of late, I know not how, on the ſudden it was noiſed abroad, that he was changed in his Principles, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from our Communion, and had erected a new uncouth way by himſelf, and much purer then any other. And truly hereupon there was much flocking to him of unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſouls: Much like as the Poet deſcribes the flocking of people after <hi>Bacchus</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heard partly by common fame, but more certainly from M. <hi>Williamſon</hi> (who lately had ſome conference with you) that you are devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of late from many of thoſe principles and practices, wherein heretofore you did concurre with us. Indeed there is now adayes great talk of much new light broke forth, and ſhining, to latter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, and thoſe many, but young men, above that which elder Proteſtants and Profeſſours have been or are acquainted with. Which boaſt occaſioneth me to minde a Story which I have met with among ancient Authors, of one <hi>Nauplius</hi> a King, who to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> the death of his ſon <hi>Palamedes,</hi> by them, as he conceived, wrongfully put to death, upon their return from <hi>Troy,</hi> did ſet up in the night a great light on the top of the hill <hi>Caphareus;</hi> which they, in their courſe and ſailing eſpying, and ſuppoſing it to be a friendly light to ſhew them the way to ſome ſafe harbour to anchor in, directed their courſe thither, and ſo fell upon many dangerous <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Whirlpools,</hi> whereof that ſea was full, to the wofull caſting away of many ſhips and men. Pardon me now if I think that Satan the Prince of darkneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who yet can transform himſelf into an Angel of light, hath a great hand in kindling and ſetting up much of this new light out of malice to the ſalvation of mankinde. This is certain and manifeſt enough, that too many, while they ſteer their courſe after and towards theſe lights, ſome make ſhipwrack of the faith upon the Rock of dangerous errors; others of peace and unity upon the Rock of raſh and unjuſtifiable Separation from our publick, though well reformed Aſſemblies; others of Chriſtian meekneſs, and moderation, and charity, upon the Rock of a bitter ſpirit, and baſe virulent railing. The more carefull had you need to be that you give not countenance too haſtily to theſe new lights, nor forſake your old good way to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33005:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
walk after them who are not like to go aſtray alone, but to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many along with you into errors. But notwithſtanding all this which I have ſaid, I do acknowledge Gods rich grace to us in theſe times, in vouchſafing much fuller and clearer light to us in many things then in former dayes. And that opinion have I with many Chriſtians hereabouts, of you and your judicious piety, that you are like as ſoon to diſcern of old errors, and finde out ſome of thoſe truths which have newly appeared, as ſome others, whoſe ſtudy hath been long and much bent to dive into dark and hard Prophecies, and to ſearch out their myſteries, to take notice of the Church-controverſies of our times, and to ſettle your ſelf and others about them. The errand of theſe lines therefore is not to expoſtulate with you about your change; But to requeſt you in writing brieſly to impart to me thoſe new Points you have pitched upon, &amp; what your opinion is about our publick Miniſtery, the Presbytery and our Church-aſſemblies. Let me intreat you to ſet down plainly the Poſitions you hold about theſe, and to annex your reaſons thereunto. I am willing to learn what I know not, &amp; ſhall account myſelf much beholding to you or any other who ſhall fight me from the leaſt errour in Divine matter, or diſcover unto me any truth of Gods Word to me yet unknown, the leaſt whereof I eſteem above all <hi>Indian Pearls</hi> and <hi>Rubies.</hi> It is a ſaying of <hi>Cato,</hi> though out of a young <hi>School-boyes-book</hi> and Author, yet very worthy to be remembred,</p>

               <salute>Moſt worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVHom I highly eſteem for Piety, and reverence for Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and learning: Your Letter I have received, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a friendly admonition to beware of old errors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded under the ſpecious ſhew of new lights. It is true, Satans ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty was deep and deceivable in all ages; but the main ſtrength of his Art and Policy was combined in making up the Man of Sinne. All deceivableneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe, the whole Mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is in him contracted; who, being now by the glorious beams of truth more clearly diſcovered in the Romanist, Epiſcopacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be a falſe Chriſt in the wilderneſſe, hath ſince entered into his ſecret Chambers, where he ſeemingly puts on a more curious dreſſe of Holineſſe and Purity neerly reſembling the wedding garment of the Primitive Church, that by his glittering array he might, if it were poſſible, deceive the very elect. Hereupon the Spirit reckons it for a principal point of wiſdom to know the full number of the Beaſt. Truly Sir, I do with you confeſſe, that I have ſearched the Scripture from my childehood, neglecting no part of the Old and New Teſtaments, and that I have much enquired into thoſe myſteries couched under the Viſions of the Prophets; but especially thoſe ſhewed by Chriſt himſelf to <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as that contracting the reſt belonging to his and after times into a methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Abridgement. My ground for it was this, Becauſe I found a peculiar bleſſing attributed to thoſe who read, hear and keep the words of this Prophecie, as that containing the whole teſtimony of Jeſus, being ſo full as nothing can be added to or detracted from it, without a dreadfull curſe, <hi>Revel. 13. &amp; 19. 10. &amp; 22. 18, 19.</hi> and from hence concluded, That there was a divine Treaſure of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdom encloſed in this precious Cabinet, and being a Prophecie of all Gospel-times, that the ſeveral diſpenſations of God proper to every period with Satans oppoſite works, was here included, which no plain Text of Scripture ſo fully evidences; and that the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33005:7"/>
thereof would be as a pillar of Cloud to direct us in every age to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes thorow his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral adminiſtrations, and a true light to diſcover thoſe Rocks of error, which men running againſt hazard the wracking of their ſouls; and that this being veiled from the ſight of the world under dark Types, that ſo Antichriſt fore-propheſied of, might have cloſer and freer entrance, requires the more industry to draw it out, Neither was the higheſt reach of my capacity able to dive ſo farre into theſe ſecrets, as to diſcover the Beast farther then the Pope and Biſhops, till the Spirit who only knows the deep things of God, removed farther from mine eyes that veil caſt upon the eyes of all Nations, <hi>Iſa. 25. 7.</hi> and revealed unto me, That the foundation of Antichriſt conſiſted in an uſurped power of Church-Diſcipline footed upon man and his will without the Call of God. And that the call of God in our times is onely for ſeparation and rewarding; being during the vials pouring, but in our journey toward <hi>Sion</hi> viſibly ſeparated, and having but in part put off our <hi>Babyloniſh Garments,</hi> Revel. <hi>18 4, 6. and 15. 8.</hi> And that the time for viſible marriage is not till all enemies are down by the vials, and God onely reigns, <hi>Revel. 19. 7, 8, 9. Iſa. 62. 5.</hi> And that all viſible Church-marriage from the Apoſtaſie till this reign is out of Gods time (whoſe Prerogative it is onely to ordain the times and ſeaſons) and ſo being founded only on the Will, Call, Name and Power of man, and not on Gods Call, must be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial. And that the breathing of the Spirit in theſe both Officers and Ordinances in the Primitive Age, the life and ſoul of both, was ſince restrained, being as a carcaſſe without a ſoul, <hi>Ezek. 1. 4. Act. 2. 2. 1 Timoth. 4. 14. Revel. 7. 1.</hi> And then at the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Christs coming the ſame Spirit of pouring and breathing returned, <hi>Iſa. 32. 15. Ezek. 37 9. Matth. 24. 27, 28. Pſalm. 97. 4.</hi> Now leaſt any miſtake me, as though I ſubverted all Gospel. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, we conceive that Ordinances are of two ſorts,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Such as are founded more immediately on our ſpiritual union, and the Covenant of Grace, as Miniſtery, Baptiſm, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Prayer, Profeſſion <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Such as are footed upon Church-ſtating, and appertain to Officials, as Ordination, Confirmation, Excommunication,

Admiſſion, Abſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The firſt of theſe we ſay, <hi>The gates of hell never prevailed againſt them,</hi> but they were born up by the Spirit of Prophecie thorow the whole time of this deep Apoſtaſie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thank you very much for your taking in good part my writing to you, for your pains taken to anſwer me, and your free imparting to me your Principles on which you go in this new way, and embrace all this as no ſmall teſtimony of your good opinion of, and good affections toward me. But having with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation peruſed your Letter, I muſt needs profeſſe that your Principles do not appear ſo clear and ſolid unto me as that I ean cloſe with them.

            <p>Firſt then, for what you glance at out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24, 26. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Man of Sinne, as being diſcovered int he Romaniſt and Epiſcopacy to be a falſe Chriſt in the wilderneſſe, and now retired into his <hi>Secret Chambers,</hi> in a curious dreſſe of holineſſe and purity the more effectually to deceive: it cannot be made

good by you that that place of <hi>Matthew</hi> is particularly meant of the Roman Antichriſt, it is meant of thoſe who ſhould take on them to be Chriſt in their own Perſon, or to ſhew unto men Chriſt in Perſon. Some ſuch of old did ariſe among the Jews, as he in the time of the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> that called himſelf <hi>Ben Cochab,</hi> the ſonne of the Starre, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſtarre propheſied of by <hi>Balaam,</hi> Numb. 24 17. whom afterward the Jews having diſcovered him for an impoſtour, called <hi>Ben<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>coſhan,</hi> the ſonne of a lie: Some ſuch of latter years have been in <hi>England,</hi> viz. <hi>Hacket</hi> with his companions in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies, and ſome not long ago amongſt us in theſe ſo fertile in ſeducers and ſeducements. And if it may be extended unto other ſeducers by way of alluſion, who preach falſe doctrine in the name of Chriſt, with a ſhew and pretence to diſcover Chriſt unto men in a more clear and perfect way then others do, this cannot ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitly be applied, much leſſe be appropriated to the Roman Antichriſt, who hath not acted his part in a wilderneſſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, as it is taken in <hi>Matthew</hi> according to the proper ſenſe of the word, <hi>viz,</hi> for a place not at all, or ſlenderly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome poor cottagers, <hi>But hath ſet as God in the Temple of God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. 4. <hi>And ruled over Kingdoms, Nations and Contries in much pomp and magnificence.</hi> Revel 17. 15. Indeed <hi>John,</hi> Revel. 17. 3. was carried into the wilderneſſe that he might take the better view of the Whore, <hi>i. e.</hi> this great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, but ſhe was preſented to him as riding on a Beaſt of ſeven heads and ten horns, and ſitting on many waters, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 13. as reigning in the great and ſtately City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ruling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver multitudes of people, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 9, 10. 15. ſo farre was ſhe ſhe from flying into the wilderneſſe, or hiding her ſelf therein: Nor did the Beaſt nor the Frogs coming out of his mouth ever heretofore, or now more invite men into Chambers under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and pretence to ſhew them Chriſt, as not to be ſeen in the publick Profeſſion of the times, more then other hereticks may and have done, nay not more then the moſt orthodox Chriſtians may do and have done in ſome ſad times of darkneſſe and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Finally, I wiſh you to conſider, whether this calling men into Chambers in theſe daies from publick Aſſemblies to ſee Chriſt, do not fully reflect upon the practice of <hi>Browniſts,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:33005:9"/>
               <hi>Independents, Anabaptiſts, Seekers,</hi> and the like, who leave our publick Aſſemblies and Ordinances, as if Chriſt were not there to be ſeen and enjoyed, and call men into houſes, parlours and chambers, with a ſpecious pretext of more then ordinary holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and exact ſerving of God, and keeping themſelves and others from the pollution of publick worſhip, and bringing men to nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and fuller Communion with Chriſt then can be enjoyed in publick Ordinances. I may ſay then touching this, as the <hi>Poet</hi> doth of a witty fable he had told, and after doth apply to one who thought himſelf little concerned in it,</p>
            <q>

               <l>Of your own ſelf, the ſtory may be told.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Secondly, The diligent ſearch you do make or have made to underſtand the viſions of the Prophets, and in ſpecial the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> is worthy commendation. But this I muſt adde, that you had need to be converſant in that ſearch with much humility and ſelf-denying, as not having any ſuch conceit of your ſelf that you are endued with a more excellent ſpirit of revelation and underſtanding in thoſe myſteries then other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and godly men that have with much pains and prayer ſtudied that Book, and publiſhed their meditations on it, but rather mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting your own conceptions, in which you go alone, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the ſtream of moſt Writers and Interpreters, <hi>Qui opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nione blandiente gravidi ſunt, nihil ſerium pariunt, tumidi tantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utres,</hi> ſaith one, Whoſoever they be which travel big with childe of ſome pleaſing conceit of their own, or vain opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, never bring forth any ſerious matter, being only big-ſwoln bottles. And if you hold forth any new conceit beyond or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, judicious Chriſtians will adviſe upon it, and not haſtily receive it, unleſſe you can make it appear, that you have <hi>Daniels ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation</hi> for interpretation of dreams and viſions given you, or can prove your interpretation by irrefragable arguments. For in ſuch a caſe may it not be ſaid to you, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> puffed up with ſome ſingular conceit of their knowledge above
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33005:10"/>
other Churches, <hi>Came the word of God out from you? or came it to you onely?</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 26. <hi>Came the Spirit of wiſdom or knowledge unto you only? or came it from you to all others?</hi> Beſides, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know Chriſt in the whole myſtery of our ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> the doctrine of his Perſon, Offices, and the means to apply him to our ſelves, the waies of his Worſhip; the Nature of the Church, and the Ordinances belonging to it, and then what be the moſt dangerous errours in Faith or Worſhip: Such things are better learned out of the doctrinal books of Scripture then out of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> That doth hold forth a prophetical ſtory concerning the enemies of the Church, who they ſhould be, and where; how they ſhould oppreſſe the Church, and at length be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of the Churches eſtate before theſe enemies riſing, under their power, its deliverance and glorious eſtate in the end; but it doth not doctrinally diſcourſe of points of faith, worſhip and good works. Thoſe matters in other Books are purpoſely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, largely and fully diſcourſed; in the <hi>Revelation</hi> are but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by the way, in other parts of Scripture they are plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that common Chriſtians may conceive and come to the knowledge of them; but the <hi>Revelation</hi> is veiled with ſuch myſtical viſions and allegorical phraſes that very learned and moſt able Chriſtians cannot uncover the veil cleerly, and ſee to the end of them; much leſſe are they ſuch as can be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſtians of the lower ſort, and weaker capacity. As the pillar of fire and cloud were ſuch things as were open to the view of all the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> ſo thoſe Books of Scripture (though I exclude none) which are plaineſt and moſt obvious to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all Chriſtians, are ſpecially to be accounted as our pillar of cloud and fire to direct us how and where in all ages we ſhould follow the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is ſtrange to me that you ſhould affirm, That the foundation of the Beaſt doth conſiſt in an uſurped power of Church-Diſcipline footed on mans will without Gods call. It is true, that what Diſcipline is exerciſed only on mans will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods call, is beſtial, as you term it, and Antichriſtian; As</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which for the thing it ſelf was wholly invented by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt not being once mentioned in the Goſpel, ſuch was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others the Popes interdicting of whole Realms for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33005:10"/>
any ſervice of God uſed in them upon their offending againſt his commands and Ordinances.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And if for the matter it ſelf it were Chriſts Diſcipline, yet it was managed not by the hands of Chriſts Officers, but of Antichriſt, and againſt Chriſts faithfull ſervants; ſuch was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication exerciſed by the Pope, papal Biſhops, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and the like. Notwithſtanding Diſcipline, nor the uſurped power of it cannot be the foundation of the Beaſt. There are three things in Chriſtian, and ſo in Antichriſtian Religion, Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline; and theſe ſo anſwer one another, that look what place any one of them hath in the one, the ſame it hath in the other Religion. Now none ever did or can affirm Diſcipline to be the foundation of Chriſtian Religion; it is but as the roof, or at beſt but as the wals of it, and ſerves to beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or to guard and preſerve it; It is ſound Doctrine in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of faith that is the foundation of Chriſtian Religion, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 3. 11. So it is the falſe Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that is the foundation of the Beaſt and Antichriſtian Religion. And this the Apoſtle S. <hi>John</hi> doth teach, 1 <hi>Joh,</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth Christ to be come in the fleſh, is of God; but every one that denieth Chriſt to be come in the fleſh is not of God; this is the spirit of Antichrist.</hi> It is in effect as much as if he had ſaid: Sound Doctrine concerning Chriſt his Nature, Perſon and Offices, is the main ground and mark of Chriſtian Religion; and falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine touching theſe things the principal note and ground of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Religion. Beſides the Popes extravagant exerciſe of Diſcipline in excommunicating, ſuſpending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not onely ſingle perſons, but whole Nations, and diſpoſing all Church-dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was founded on that falſe Doctrine which was firſt laid, That the Pope was an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop,</hi> Vicar of Chriſt, and the viſible Head of the Church. Doctrine then is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Beaſt, and not the uſurped power of Church-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline. Laſtly, None can comply with the Beaſt in the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his eſtate without loſſe of his ſalvation, as who doth lie and relie on ſome other beſides the onely foundation of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is Jeſus Chriſt, and worſhippeth the Beaſt in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him for the Vicar of Chriſt in the Church and ſupreme Head under him, and ſubmits to his Decrees and new Articles
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33005:11"/>
of faith; But many may and have too much complied with the Beaſt in the exerciſe of Diſcipline, <hi>viz.</hi> Excommunication, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion, Ordination, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> managing it in a Popiſh manner, whom yet we have juſt cauſe to acknowledge (and ſhould deal moſt uncharitably not to acknowledge) for the main to have been godly Chriſtians, and out of doubt ſaved, Such as were thoſe Dioceſan Biſhops in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, <hi>Ridley, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Hooper,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Grindal, Jewel</hi> and others in Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> Reign.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is a new conceit not heard of before among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> and which I cannot imbrace, That in theſe our times we are called onely to ſeparating from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and rewarding her, ſo that upon ſeparating from her, if Gods people go further, as to ſet up reformed Churches, and gather themſelves into Church-order, it is in your opinion againſt, or at leaſt without Gods command. But</p>
            <p>Firſt, This is a courſe flat contrary to that which the Lord hath followed and preſcribed to his people in former times, whoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from Idolaters and prophane Nations was ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a preſent ſetting up of a Church-ſociety for Gods ſervice and mutual edification. No ſooner did God call <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> out of his idolatrous Countrey, but he ſet up a viſible Church in his Family, teaching him to call on God and ſet up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs for his Worſhip, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 8, and furniſhing him with ſome power of Diſcipline, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 17. 14. and 18. 19. So when the Lord brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he brought them not out to wander up and down as a confuſed multitude, but within ſhort time formed them into a Church, and within a year or thereabouts gave them the Law, furniſhed them with a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Sacrifices, Miniſtry and Ordinances of all ſorts. This did the Jews alſo upon their return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> take to be their duty in a Church-way to ſet up Gods worſhip, in building the Temple, providing Sacrifices, reſtoring the Miniſtery, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering means for them. And when the Jews ſlacked their hand this way upon a pretence that the due time to build the houſe of God was not yet come (much like as you now ſay, it is not yet time to ſet up viſible Churches or Church-Diſcipline) they were reproved for the ſlackneſſe and vain pretence by the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33005:11"/>
Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> Hag. 1. 3, 5. And did not the Apoſtles the like alſo at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, ſo call men from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm</hi> and <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> as thoſe that did ſeparate from them, and imbrace the Goſpel, were with all convenient ſpeed gathered and formed into Chriſtian Churches to exerciſe Gods Worſhip and Diſcipline among themſelves? And what ſound reaſon can be given, why the ſeparation Gods people are called to, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4. ſhould not be thus preſently followed, with joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in viſible Churches, to ſerve God aright, and enjoy all his Ordinances, but that they muſt remain a ſeparated people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Church-order among themſelves, untill all the vials be poured out, that is none knows how long?</p>
            <p>Secondly, This is againſt a common rule for interpretation of Scripture; Among which rules this is an approved one, <hi>That what Scripture doth command the avoiding any thing as evil, the ſame doth virtually command the purſuing of the contrary good.</hi> Hence commonly thoſe two commands go together, <hi>Flee evil and follow good,</hi> Pſal. 34. 14. Iſa. 16. 17. Rom. 12. 9. and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places. The reaſon whereof is plain, becauſe as the perfection of a good tree is not in wanting bad fruit, but in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good: ſo the true goodneſſe of a Chriſtian is not in forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, but in doing good. This then is certain, that the voice from Heaven which cals Gods people to depart from <hi>Babylon,</hi> as idolatrous, and to keep themſelves from her ſins, doth virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally call upon them to ſeek our <hi>Sion,</hi> and to joyn with her in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for the worſhip of God; which <hi>Sion</hi> if it were not then extant or to be enjoyed, the command were vain, and their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour would be to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This conceit and courſe doth caſt a foul blot of groſs ignorance or raſh preſumption upon all reformed Churches; which upon their breaking off from <hi>Rome</hi> have not contented themſelves with a bare ſeparation, but did alſo ſet up evangelical Churches oppoſite to the <hi>Roman</hi> for Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline, ſome leſſe, and ſome more pure and perfect. So hath all Reformation been practiſed in <hi>Germany, France, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland, Scotland, Old</hi> and <hi>New England</hi> of late. And what man is he, or who be they, unleſſe they can prove themſelves new Apoſtles or Prophets, or have the pregnant word of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33005:12"/>
God for it, and build not only upon their own conjectural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of prophetical myſteries, about which other godly learned are at a ſtand, who will preſume to tax and blemiſh ſo many famous Churches, and ſo many godly and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines which were their guides and leaders? Surely it is not piety to condemn the generation of the righteous, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73. 15. nor humility to ſlight the conſent of ſo many Churches of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is well worth the while to ſcan the time when this call for ſeparation <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4. was given; And if all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances be well weighed, this call was not proclaimed untill God had put it into the heart of ſome Kings and States to joyn to invade and <hi>destroy Rome itſelf,</hi> which preparation is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 16. and was ſurely about the pouring out of the laſt, or ſome of the laſt vials. And now being ready to give the on-ſet on <hi>Rome,</hi> by this voice they are called on to plague her thorowly, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 6. At which time this call is directed to ſuch of Gods people as might then be hidden in that idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous City, or the adjoining Territories by a perſonal flight to forſake her and thoſe places of danger, and provide for their ſafety. Which things conſidered, it is not clear that the time of this call is yet come, ſince we ſee ſmall preparation made as yet or intended by Chriſtian States or Princes againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> the Throne of the Beaſt, or <hi>Italy</hi> his Neſt and Fortreſſe. And how long it will be ere this be effected onely the Lord knows. I am ſure that moſt accounts that learned men have hitherto made of theſe things, have miſſed, and they are in a miſt about the three or four laſt vials, not being able certainly to unfold them. So that if you have no other ground for your ſeparation then that call (as you produce none other) you are in danger to prevent the due time of ſeparation, and to do all you do in it meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own will without Gods call. As for the ſpiritual ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made by <hi>Protestant Princes,</hi> and Churches, from <hi>Rome,</hi> in Doctrine and Worſhip, as they had a warrant for it from this call, the reaſons whereof being ſuch as belong to all times and perſons, not to partake in <hi>Romes</hi> ſins, do ſufficiently enforce it; ſo had they pregnant grounds for it alſo from other general commands to flee Idolatry, and ſet up Gods Worſhip. I may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33005:12"/>
laſt ask, Why you and your company go farther in your practice then bare ſeparation? For if by ſeparation <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 4. you underſtand a ſeparation meerly negative to be meant (as you needs muſt to make it ſerve your turn) by what warrant do you on the Lords-day celebrate holy Aſſemblies, and exerciſe the main parts of Gods Worſhip by your ſelves, and in oppoſition to our publick Aſſemblies, which you account beſtial? For this kinde of ſeparation allows no ſuch practice, but confines it ſelf to an abſtaining from all communion in the publick Worſhip if corrupt, and ſo farre as it is corrupt. But if it be a poſitive ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration that the godly are called to (as your practice doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it) then nothing lets, but others alſo may ſet up Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for the enjoying of all Ordinances as well as you for ſome. And ſurely when the Apoſtle did urge ſuch a call for ſeparation unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 17. out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 11. he did conceive that the Chriſtians of <hi>Corinth</hi> were not onely called barely to ſeparate from Paganiſh Idolatry, but alſo to join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the true worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Here follow ſome things which I apprehend to be ſome reaſons of this your Aſſertion touching this point of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>1. We are yet, you ſay, but in our journey to <hi>Sion,</hi> viſibly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and not arrived thither, and ſo may not take on us to ſet up <hi>Sion-like</hi> Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But why are we but on our journey unto <hi>Sion?</hi> viſibly ſeparated? when as the Apoſtle deſcribeth this to be the eſtate of all imbracing the Goſpel, that they are come to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and the celeſtial <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the ſame not meerly inviſible, but viſibly ſeparated from the impious world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. St <hi>John</hi> ſaw many thouſands <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 1. walking with the Lamb on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and the ſame viſible as ſeen by <hi>John</hi> during the time of the great Apoſtaſie, and before the time of this more publick departure and Reformation. And why may not our late reformed Chriſtians be ranged among thoſe thouſands, and admitted to the ſame Mount <hi>Sion</hi> with them, ſince in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they have endeavoured to conform unto them, 1. In bearing their Fathers name in their forehead by an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion; 2, In reſtoring an orderly performance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33005:13"/>
of Gods Worſhip by the Miniſtery and Church-aſſemblies, as they praiſed God before the four Beaſts and the Elders; 3. In aſcribing their redemption only to God, and praiſing him for it, which is meant by the new Song thoſe hundred fourty four thouſand did ſing; 4. By cleanſing themſelves from Popiſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as thoſe kept themſelves virgins and undefiled; 5. By holding forth the practice of holineſſe, as in the mouths of the other there was no guile.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Admit that we be but in our way to this <hi>Sion,</hi> what lets but that we may ſet up and uſe all Gods Ordinances as well as ſome, in this our journey? The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> whenas they were but in their way to <hi>Canaan</hi> had all Gods Ordinances ſet up amongſt them, and made uſe of them more or leſſe, as their unſetled eſtate, and ſudden occaſions of removing would give leave. What you ſeem elſwhere to conclude to this purpoſe from the Jews bringing along the Temple-veſſels with them from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> but not officiating with them in their way, ſhall in its place be conſidered. About theſe matters you referre me to <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 8. where we read that the Temple was filled with ſmoke from the glory of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that none could enter into it untill the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled. From whence it ſeems you would conclude, that we are not yet come to <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I wiſh you had made the argument your ſelf, opened the place in your ſenſe, and applied it to the purpoſe: For my part I finde a Temple even under the Apoſtaſie meaſured out, and an Altar, and ſome worſhipping in it <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 1. Yea, I finde Angels, <hi>i. e.</hi> Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and other perſons of note, whom the Lord would uſe to execute his judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Antichriſtian world, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 15, 17, 18. converſant in it, and the four Beaſts abiding in it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15. 7. The Temple then which was before the ſeven laſt plagues fulfilled, was not ſo ſhut but ſome did enter into it and ſerved God therein: Yea that <hi>John</hi> during this time ſaw it opened in heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 19. and 15. 6. And if <hi>Sion</hi> and the Temple in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be one and the ſame thing, and both note the ſtate of a true viſible Church (as you ſeem to think) it is plain that before and under the vials there are acknowledged in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> viſible
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33005:13"/>
Churches, and the ſame true and right unto which Chriſtians had acceſſe, and in which they were converſant. You muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me then if herein I do not concurre with you, that none could enter into the Temple, or arrive at <hi>Sion, i. e.</hi> that no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church could be found into which men might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and admiſſion, untill all the vials were poured out. I do rather agree with other godly Interpreters, who do underſtand it of thoſe people, who yet for their whole body are clean out of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the Jews and Pagans, but chiefly the Jews, of which, it ſeems, no full harveſt ſufficient to make up a Church or Churches ſhall or can come in, untill the vials be fully poured out to <hi>Romes</hi> utter deſtruction. It doth not exclude thoſe who were already admitted and entered into the Temple, as were the reformed Churches of the weſtern world.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing which you adde is, That we have not yet wholly put off our <hi>Babyloniſh Garments.</hi> Touching which I ſhall not ſay much, becauſe you expreſſe not what you mean by theſe <hi>Babyloniſh Garments,</hi> nor wherein they are not put off. Only two things I do reply, 1. That the retaining of ſome rags of the <hi>Babyloniſh Garments,</hi> though it be a deformity to a Church, can no more keep a Chriſtian company or perſon out of <hi>Sion,</hi> then ſacrificing unto God in high places, ſomewhat after an Heatheniſh manner, could or did put the Church of the Jews out of <hi>Sion,</hi> or Polygamy not warranted by the Lords firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Marriage, put <hi>Abraham, Jacob</hi> or other holy men out of the Catalogue of the ancient and godly Patriarchs; or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of ſome ſinfull infirmity in a man regenerate, barre him of Communion with Chriſt. 2. Thoſe ſeven Angels which had the laſt ſeven Plagues, as they came out of the Temple; ſo alſo they were cloathed with white and pure linen, and were girded about the breſts with golden girdles, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15 6. Now what are thoſe Angels but types of thoſe inſtruments which the Lord would uſe in executing thoſe ſeven laſt Plagues? And what is the meaning of their coming out of the Temple, but that they were perſons belonging to ſome of the Proteſtant reformed Churches? Now ſurely as the habit of the members was, ſuch was the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Churches to which they did belong: For how could they come ſo purely cloathed out of Churches utterly impure?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33005:14"/>
Theſe Churches therefore which are our reformed Churches of theſe dayes, had caſt off their <hi>Babyloniſh Garments,</hi> and were clad with fine linen, which is the righteouſneſſe of the Saints.</p>
            <p>The third thing, you ſay, is, That the time for viſible marriage is not yet come, untill all enemies be brought down, and God only reign; and that therefore all viſible Church-marriage ſince the Apoſtaſic taken up before the time, being onely founded on the will, name and power of man without Gods call, muſt needs be beſtial.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Concerning this, I ſay firſt, That it is much the Jews excuſe <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2. ſaying, <hi>That the time was not yet come that the houſe of the Lord ſhould be built:</hi> Whenas the time for building it was ſeaſonable enough, and nothing letted but their greater care to build their own houſes then the Lords houſe: So ſay you, The time is not yet come that viſible Churches ſhould be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and married unto Chriſt in viſible manner, whe<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as the time is ſeaſonable enough, but that many have more minde to diſturb the work by venting fancies of their own, then to contribute their endeavours towards the work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This is to make Chriſt to have been a Widower, as it were, or a Bridegroom without a known or viſible Bride, an Head without a viſible Body, a King without a viſible Kingdom for more then theſe thouſand years; and how long he is like ſo to continue none can determine. For what is Chriſts viſible Spouſe, Body, Kingdom, but a viſible Church? and none ſuch hath been, according to your opinion, right and true, all this time of the Apoſtaſie, nor yet is or ſhall be untill all the vials be poured out.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This is to make all the reformed Churches, which ſince their breaking off from <hi>Rome,</hi> have been erected, or are now in <hi>Germany, France, Netherland, Scotland, Old and New England,</hi> to be Antichriſtian and beſtial, which in all moderate and underſtanding mens judgement, will be thought a raſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and audacious Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It may as well be ſaid by you, That there is no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Marriage between Chriſt and particular Chriſtians before the time, as that there is none between Churches and Chriſt.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33005:14"/>
For no particular Chriſtian can be a meet Bride for Chriſt, who is not cloathed with pure fine and ſhining linen, <hi>viz.</hi> The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Saints. And if no Churches ſhall be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time fitly thus arrayed for their Marriage with Chriſt, what ſound reaſon can be yielded, why any ſingle Chriſtians can be ſo cloathed, when as commonly they receive their ſpiritual birth, being, cloathing, and all in viſible Churches where they live? Now <hi>nihil dat quod non hab<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> None can give that which they have not; And if no viſible Churches can be found thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed, it is not eaſie to imagine how ſingle Chriſtians ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. If private Chriſtians may be ſo cloathed before that time, and ſo fitted for viſible marriage with Chriſt; ſo alſo may whole Churches, whenas Churches are made up of particular Chriſtians, and particular Chriſtians are thus cloathed, among other ends, that they may be fitted for members of viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But to make this good, you referre us to <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 7. which, how that is underſtood not of reformed Churches in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but of the Church of the Jews, when that Nation ſhall be converted to the Faith, by the moſt learned Interpreters of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> I know you well know. And for my part, though I will not ſay as he did, <hi>Malo cum Platone errare, quam cum aliis vera ſentire,</hi> yet I cannot but ſay, That it is farre ſafer to follow ſo many godly, learned and judicious Divines, who have bent themſelves to finde out the myſteries of that Book, then any one man, though he would be held as ſingular in this myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divinity, as <hi>Plato</hi> was in Philoſophy. And that which you point unto farther out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 5. if they both concern one thing and time, as you ſeem to intimate, doth much confirm this Interpretation. For it directly and expreſly ſpeaks of <hi>Sion,</hi> and its reſtoring, as appears by the beginning of the Chapter, and what follows; which if it had not its full accompliſhment in the Jews Deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their Church and Commonwealth reſtauration thereupon, it cannot well be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied otherwiſe, then to the laſt converſion of the Jewiſh Nation, and to that excellent Church-condition whereunto they ſhall then be brought.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Touching this allegation, and all other of the ſame kinde much uſed by you, I wiſh that that notable ſaying of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:33005:15"/>
ſo much approved by learned Divines, were known to, or regarded by you, <hi>Omnis Prophetia priuſquam habeat efficaciam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anigmata &amp; ambiguitas ſunt hominibus: Cum autem venerit tempus &amp; evenit quod Prophetatum eſt, <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um Prophetiae habent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidam &amp; certam expoſitionem.</hi> All Prophecie before it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed preſents nothing but Riddles and matters of doubt unto men: but when the time is come, and that is fulfilled which was propheſied, then Prophecies have a clear and certain expoſition. According to which moſt right ſentence, I ſay, that the myſtical Prophecies of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> or other Scripture which are but in part fulfilled, but ſpecially ſuch as yet are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be fulfilled, and ſo ſubject to various Interpretations, are too too weak grounds to build ſuch lofty opinions and aſſertions upon, as befool all learned Divines, over-turn all right and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Miniſtry, and turn all latter Chriſtian Churches into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian: For who is he that can infallibly ſay, What is meant by the vials poured out on <hi>Euphrates</hi> or on the <hi>Air;</hi> by the <hi>Marriage of the Lamb, and of his Bride,</hi> and ſundry other things in the following Chapters, as he ought to be able to doe, that will inferre and make good ſuch high and deſtructive Paradoxes, as are above-mentioned. There are many Prophecies in that Book already in part fulfilled, as many things about the two Witneſſes, the diſtinction of the firſt and ſecond Beaſt, the vial poured out on the Sun, with divers things <hi>Chap.</hi> 14 and 16. about which the learned which have ſearched into thoſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do ſo differ that a man cannot finde from them any ſure ground to reſt upon. It is doubtleſſe lawfull and profitable, as you and others do, to ſearch into the Myſteries of that Book. But for a clear and full Interpretation of ſome things already fulfilled, much more of things to be fulfilled, we muſt wait the Lords time (to which ſomewhat doth accord that proverbial Speech, That <hi>Veritas eſt temporis filia)</hi> and his Revelation of them by clear and indubitable events. But by theſe miſtakes and differences of learned men, as diligent and underſtanding ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as our ſelves, we ſhould learn to be moderate and wary, how we did peremptorily determine matters ſo abſtruſe; and upon ſuch our private determinations lay the weight of ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Paradoxes and ſtrange ſtrains; which to doe is rather
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33005:15"/>
raſh preſumption and ſelf-confidence then true knowledge and wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Now follows your fourth Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the breathing of the Spirit both in Officers and Ordinances which acted in them in the Primitive times, is now reſtrained, and (as ſeems to be your meaning) hath been reſtrained ever ſince the Apoſtaſie, ſo that they were all that while, and now are but as a carcaſe without a ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this be ſo, What means have there been all this while for mens converſion and ſalvation? For which the Lord out of his goodneſſe cannot but ever make due proviſion. From whence hath proceeded the converſion of thouſands, which have been wrought on ſince the Apoſtaſie, if not from the Officers and Ordinances that have ſucceeded the Primitive times, and in ſome meaſure continued under the corrupt ſtate of the Church, and the ſpirits breathing in and working by them? St <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and that under the Apoſtaſie, a hundred fourty four thouſand waiting upon the Lamb in Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> Revel. 14. 1. Whence now had theſe their converſion but from the Spirit in thoſe times breathing in, and by the Officers and O<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dinances that then were? Again, S. <hi>John</hi> ſaw (it ſeems) after this on Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> upon the declining of Antichriſt a great number ſtanding by a glaſſie-ſea mingled with fire which had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, his Image, his Mark, and the number of his Name, ſinging a new Song, and praiſing God for their deliverance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 2, 3. Whence had theſe their converſion? They were not, I ween, <hi>Aborigenes,</hi> a people ſprung out of the earth, or let down out of the Heavens, but ſurely had their ſpiritual birth and being from the Spirit breathing in the Officers and Ordinances of thoſe times. Laſtly, Have not thouſands in theſe latter times in the reformed Churches (and ſo are many, the Lord be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto this day) been converted to the faith by the preaching of the Miniſters in them? And what more ample teſtimony can there be then this, that their miniſtery is not a carcaſe without a ſoul, but that the Spirit doth breathe in the Ordinance of pteaching and Sacraments adminiſtred by them? It may here by you be ſuggeſted perhaps, that in all theſe Ages, and ſo now, they preached but as gifted men, and in that way the Spirit
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33005:16"/>
went along with them <hi>Not as Miniſters by Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is but ſaid, and not proved, and ſo may as eaſily be denied, as it is affirmed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They in all Ages former and latter ſtood and acted as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters by Office, were ſo acknowledged and received by the Churches, yea and alſo Chriſtians converted (untill of late that they have been taught a new ungratefull leſſon) who felt the power of the Spirit working on them by their preaching, did look on their converſion as a fruit of their true official Miniſtry, and a ſeal thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth produce the converſion of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> by his preaching, not ſo much for a proof that he was a man ſufficiently gifted for the work of the Miniſtry, <hi>but as a ſeal of his Apoſtleſhip,</hi> and as a divine teſtimony, that as he act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Apoſtle in his Preaching, ſo indeed he was, and ſo they were to acknowledge him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 1, 2. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the converſion of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were proof ſufficient for <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was an Apoſtle, that is, an official Miniſter, though extraordinary, ſurely the work of converſion formerly and now wrought by them, doth ſuffice to make good, That the Miniſters of the reformed Churches have been, and are right Miniſters of Chriſt, and rightly in office under him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, For that of <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 1. which you point to, of the <hi>four Angels holding the four windes, that they ſhould not blow on the earth, nor on the ſea,</hi> &amp;c. If it be certainly to be underſtood of the withholding of the Spirit from breathing in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (for others carry it fairly enough to another ſenſe.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is nothing ſaid in that place for the continuance, how long the reſtraint ſhould laſt, much leſſe is it ſhewed, that it ſhould laſt during the Apoſtaſie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may well be meant of a more ſparing breathing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Primitive times, not of an utter reſtraint.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be underſtood of an utter reſtraint, take notice, I pray, that the reſtraint is general, and cannot by any circumſtance of the Text be confined only to official preaching and Preachers, as you ſpeak, but as fully reach any Preachers, even your gifted men as well as them, and ſo doth conclude an utter ceaſing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to breathe now or then in or by any means, Ordinances or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33005:16"/>
Preachers whatſoever, which is groſly falſe, and to affirm it were exceeding derogatory to the Lords free grace and mans ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In the next place it follows that we take a view of your diſtinction of Ordinances, and your opinion about them. Touching which, you ſay, ſome are founded more <hi>immediately</hi> on our ſpiritual Union <hi>(with Chriſt I conceive you mean)</hi> and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanant of Grace and Miniſtry, Baptiſm, the Lords Supper, Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Profeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Such as are <hi>footed on Church-ſtating,</hi> ſuch as appertain to officials, yea deemed eſſential to them, as Ordination, Confirmation, Excommunication, Admiſſion, Abſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The firſt of theſe have been kept up, <hi>you ſay,</hi> thorow all the time of the deepeſt Apoſtaſie, and are now uſed rightly, and to be uſed. The ſecond have not been alwaies rightly uſed, but <hi>(it ſeems to you)</hi> have been, and are ſo loſt, that as yet there is no due time or place for their exerciſe. This I take to be your meaning about this point of Ordinances. If I miſtake, it is becauſe the matter is ſet down ſomewhat intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately by you.</p>
            <p>Now touching this point we have many things to reply;</p>
            <p>Firſt, I would know, What <hi>Ministry</hi> you mean hath alwaies been kept up? Whether a Miniſtry exerciſed onely <hi>by virtue of Gifts</hi> enabling men unto it, or ſuch as is exerciſed <hi>by virtue of an Office</hi> alſo, and right calling thereunto. If the firſt be meant, it is a matter in much queſtion, Whether ſuch a ſtanding Miniſtry were ever allowed by Chriſt? and it muſt be proved before we can receive it. Surely if ſuch a Miniſtry be currant and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently authorized for miniſtring Word and Sacraments, there was no need of an <hi>official Ministry;</hi> and Chriſt, it ſeems, therein ordained a ſuperfluous Ordinance, according to that common Axiom, <hi>Frustra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora.</hi> It is a vain thing, and not beſeeming a wiſe man, to uſe many wayes to do that which may be done by a few. If the latter be meant, why are <hi>official Miniſters</hi> by you queſtioned?</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may be asked, Why you put Profeſſion and Prayer in general in the rank of Ordinances. There is a wide difference between <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Duties.</hi> As to believe in Chriſt is a Duty, not an Ordinance; ſo to make Profeſſion of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33005:17"/>
the Chriſtian faith is alſo a Duty which appertains to particular Chriſtians in their own perſon, ſo to whole Churches in their Society. So likewiſe is Prayer as it belongs to particular men, of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks ſpecially, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4. 2. Onely <hi>publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> as it is performed by the Miniſter in publick Aſſemblies for Gods Worſhip, may come under the notion of <hi>an Ordinance.</hi> Ordinances, to ſpeak properly of them, are thoſe ſolemn means which Chriſt hath appointed in his Church according to his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power and good-will to communicate his grace unto us, and to perform our ſolemn Worſhip unto him, as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick preaching of the Word, celebration of the Sacraments, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer, publick thankſgivings, faſtings; or to provide for the right performance of theſe things, as combination of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians into Church-ſocieties, the election and ordination of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and exerciſes of Church-Diſcipline. Now profeſſion and prayer are ſuch duties as flow from that natural relation which is between God the Creator and the creature, and were owing unto God without any ſpecial inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You ſay, That the laſt kinde of Ordinances are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to <hi>Officials,</hi> an improper, yea falſe aſſertion, unleſſe you mean no more then what you ſaid elſwhere, that they appertain to <hi>Officers:</hi> For nothing is <hi>eſſential</hi> to a Church-officer, or any other thing, but the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> thereof, which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute them. The <hi>Matter</hi> of an Officer are <hi>Gifts</hi> enabling him to perform it; the <hi>Form</hi> an <hi>orderly putting him into that Office by ſuch as have Authority, and giving him a right to execute it.</hi> The Exerciſe of ſome thing may properly and onely belong to Officers (as preaching the Word and adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Paſtors and Teachers rightly called) which yet are not eſſential to them. Nothing can ſubſiſt or have a being in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wanting its eſſentials. A Paſtor or Teacher may be ſuch an one in Office, and yet letted by ſickneſſe or ſome other wayes, that for many weeks together he neither preach nor adminiſter the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is not truly ſaid, That ſome Ordinances are more immediately founded in our Union with Chriſt. For no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances can be ſaid to be founded on our Union with Chriſt. Such things onely can rightly be ſaid to be founded on that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33005:17"/>
which as the proper fruit and effects thereof do flow from it to our ſalvation; as Calling, Juſtification, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be granted, that an holy right to theſe Ordinances, and the bleſſed fruit of them comes and proceeds from our Union with Chriſt, but not the Ordinances themſelves, of which many partake which have not, nor ever ſhall have Union with Chriſt. Indeed they tend either to bring men to that bleſſed Union, or to nouriſh and ſtabliſh them in it: To which purpoſe in their place ſerve thoſe latter kinde of Ordinances, yea Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it ſelf, which is ſpecially ordained for the good of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to heal and recover them if they fall ſcandalouſly, by cutting them off, to the end they may repent and be reſtored, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their infection by putting ſcandalous and infectious perſons out of their Society. But for the foundation of theſe and all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, it is in the Inſtitution of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting partly in a command for the uſe of them, and partly in the promiſe of a bleſſing on the right uſe of them, as for Teaching and Baptiſm is to be ſeen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. and for the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It may be granted you, That theſe Ordinances are ſome way founded on the Covenant of Grace, if by founded you onely mean, that they are ſome effects of it. For as God by that Covenant doth oblige himſelf to give grace and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Elect: ſo by conſequence to provide for them all means outward and inward, that ſhould conduce to make them partakers of the Covenant and benefits of it, cauſing them to imbrace it, and ſtabliſhing them in it. But then this is not a thing peculiar to the firſt kinde of Ordinances, but belongs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the latter, which have their uſe both in admitting men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fellowſhip with Chriſt and his Church, and maintaining them in it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, You grant, That theſe firſt Ordinances have never been loſt, but continued all the time of the Apoſtaſie. But what doth this grant avail for any benefit to Gods people all that while, or now; when you did before affirm, that they are but dead Ordinances, and have not the Spirit breathing in, or by them, nor ſhall have, untill the brightneſſe of Chriſts coming?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:33005:18"/>
Seventhly, How doth it appear that thoſe latter Ordinances have been loſt, as you ſeem to imply, during the Apoſtaſie, more then the former?</p>
            <p n="1">1. The uſe of them was held up all that while in the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, where was Ordination, Excommunication, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that as Ordinances of Chriſt, as well as Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Baptiſm, the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſince the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have more or leſſe been taken up, and uſed in the reformed Churches.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To that you ſay, they were not alwayes rightly uſed, nor alway in right hands: I anſwer, That if that aboliſh them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame grounds thoſe former Ordinances may as well be ſaid to have been loſt, as having been in many things corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and uſurped by thoſe who had little right to meddle with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What reaſons ſoever are, or can be alledged for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the firſt ſort, are as ſtrong for the continuance of this latter kinde, 1. There is for theſe <hi>Christs Inſtitution</hi> as well as for thoſe. 2. They were inſtituted not only for a time, but to be <hi>continued</hi> untill the laſt day, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11, 12, 13. In the 11 verſe there is the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Official Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> diſtinct one from another, as ſome to be ſuch, and others to be ſuch, So that they that were <hi>Apoſtles, Evangeliſts,</hi> &amp;c. were not properly Paſtors nor Teachers, Nor they which were properly Paſtors and Teachers, were not Apoſtles nor Prophets, &amp;c. If they were all the ſame in office and power, what ſhould need ſuch an enumeration of ſo many kindes diſtinct one from the other? <hi>verſe</hi> 12. is ſpecified the end for which they were given, namely the perfect <hi>Knitting together of the Saints, the work of the Miniſtry, the edification of the body of Chriſt.</hi> If that then during the Apoſtaſie Chriſt had any Saints among men to be joyned together, any work of the Miniſtry to be done, any myſtical body to be edified (as doubtleſſe he had) all theſe things were to be performed by the officiall Miniſtry which Chriſt gave for that end. But theſe things could not be all that while performed by Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were done by other Officials, Paſtors and Teachers, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33005:18"/>
Chriſt gave for that end, and in ſome ſort continued all thoſe corrupt times. In the 13. <hi>verſe</hi> is ſet down how long this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry was to continue, even <hi>untill we all meet in the unity of the faith, and attain to a perfect man in Chriſt,</hi> which will not be until the laſt day of the reſtoring and conſummation of all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, 10. Now if Chriſt did ordain ſuch a Miniſtry, and for ſuch a time, he hath ſurely for the ſubſtance maintained and continued it hitherto, and ſo will to the end. And if he have not, or ſhall not do ſo, it is either for want of power in him to do it, or of love and care for his Churches good: either of which to charge upon Chriſt were ſinfull. And if this continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance have not been in a ſucceſſive order of Apoſtles, Prophets and Evangeliſts (which long ago have ceaſed) it hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in an <hi>Official Miniſtry</hi> of Paſtors and Teachers, ſuch as Chriſt firſt gave and ordained. 3. There is a ſolemn Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the exerciſe and keeping up of Diſcipline untill the coming of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13, 14. There is a ſtreight charge laid upon <hi>Timethy</hi> to keep that courſe of Diſcipline which he had preſcribed him in that Epiſtle, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the appearing of Chriſt,</hi> Now this command cannot concern <hi>Timothy</hi> onely, who was not to ſurvive ſo long, or to that day: But belongeth to the Miniſters and Church-officers, who in after times were to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in the care and rule of the Church. And if <hi>Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually</hi> which you alledge from 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17. to prove that prayer as a Church-ordinance hath been alway continued, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a command for the continual uſe of it, and that rather of private prayer by Chriſtians in their common courſe of life, then of publick in Church-Aſſemblies, be valid enough to prove your purpoſe: this command of <hi>Paul</hi> unto <hi>Timothy</hi> for the exerciſe of Diſcipline by him, preſcribed to be continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſts coming, doth neceſſarily prove the continuance of it in the Church.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, What you alledge out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. for the perp tuity of teaching and Baptiſm, makes as much for the like continued uſe of Diſcipline. For as the Apoſtles there are bid to teach and Baptize: So likewiſe are they commanded <hi>To teach the Nations, to obſerve all things that he had commanded.</hi> Among which the exerciſe of Diſcipline was certainly one: For the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33005:19"/>
maintenance of which, his promiſe is to be preſent with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to the end of the world, as well as for the continuance of the other Ordinances. Now there are many other Scriptures which you point at for proof of this and your other points, touching which I wiſh that you had ſhewed how the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures pointed at conclude your points. For my Logick doth not ſuffice to conclude the one from the other.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, There enſue ſome reaſons (as I conceive) of them, why this ſecond ſort of Ordinances are loſt: Firſt, This Key of Diſcipline was wholly reſolved into the Pope; I take it that you mean, that it was wholly ſeiſed on by the Pope, and no Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was exerciſed but under and from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> So was it with Teaching, Baptiſm and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and other Ordinances you ſpeak of, they were ſo got into the Popes hands, that they were adminiſtred and managed by none but thoſe that were authorized by the Pope, or by ſuch as under him did conferre authority for the ſame: And if that did not null or aboliſh Teaching, Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why ſhould it null or aboliſh Diſcipline, or any part thereof, though ingroſſed by the Pope, and abuſed by him. It was the policy of Satan and that great Impoſtour under him (the Pope) to ſeiſe into his hands all the Ordinances of Chriſt, that by the ſhew and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of them he might get the credit of Religion, and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Chriſtian faith, and ſo the more cloſely and effectually deceive the Chriſtian world, which he could not have done if he had wholly rejected and aboliſhed them, and ſet up onely his own ſuperſtitions and inventions in the room of them: Chriſts Ordinances may and do ſtill remain Chriſts Ordinances for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſubſtance, though in wrong hands and abuſed: As the great Seale of the Kingdome is ſtill the right and true Seale, though in the hands of an uſurping Lord Keeper, and imployed to wrongfull ends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Pope had another Key given him, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as Locuſts, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let it be ſo, that another Key was given to the Pope, <hi>viz.</hi> when he claimed to be an Univerſal Biſhop, Chriſts Vicar, and the Head of the Church under him, and ſo uſurped an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted power in buſineſſes ſecular and ſpiritual, and that he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33005:19"/>
had with all other Officers called Locuſts, <hi>viz. Monks, Friars, Priests, Abbats, Cardinals,</hi> and the whole Popiſh Clergy; yet with all ſubtilty he did retain the Key of Chriſts Diſcipline in <hi>Ordination, Excommunication, Suspenſion,</hi> &amp;c. and made uſe of it to promote his own Kingdom, yea and had for ſubſtance ſome of the Officers ordained by Chriſt, ſuch as were <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtrers of holy things</hi> in particular <hi>Congregations</hi> though under other names, as <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Vicars,</hi> and not, without ſome corruption in their admiſſion and adminiſtration. Notwithſtanding as amongſt all the corruptions under Popery, Baptiſm for the ſubſtance remained true and right, in as much as ſuch as were baptized, were baptized <hi>In the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne and holy Ghoſt,</hi> according to the form by Chriſt appointed. Neither have any taught or affirmed, That Baptiſm under Popery was or is null, and to be repealed; So for the ſubſtance, a true and right Miniſtry might be, and was there found, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a one, as by which men were called and ſet aſide to preach the Word, and miniſter the holy things of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> There was no other face of Officials among Papiſts, but of theſe Locuſts in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, who himſelf was a Monk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was among Papiſts in and before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, Officials (as you ſtile them) which are not to be reckoned among theſe Locuſts, but ſuch as the holy Ghoſt in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> doth honour and account of, as true and worthy Miniſters of Chriſt, though what outward calling they had, was from Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Presbyters, and themſelves were Monks and Friars, or of ſome ſuch Popiſh order. It cannot be denied, that many of thoſe which during the Apoſtaſie for twelve hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, did ſtand up by Writing and Preaching to witneſſe Truth againſt Popery, were <hi>Biſhops, Priests, Monks</hi> or <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi> as in our <hi>England,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Groſted, John Wickliff</hi> a Prieſt; in other Countreys <hi>Taulerus</hi> a Preacher, <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerom of Prague</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Savaralona</hi> a Monk, and one <hi>Sylveſter</hi> a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, with many other the like. All which notwithſtanding that their Ordination was according to the times from Popiſh Biſhops, and their order ſuperſtitious, yet the holy Ghoſt doth reckon of

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 8, 9. there are three Angels which in courſe follow one another preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and declaiming againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Beaſt: Who are theſe now? Not proper Angels coming from heaven, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the currant of Interpreters, a ſeries and rank of Miniſters, which were raiſed up by the Lord, by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to make way for the ruine of the Pope, and reſtoring the Church, ſuch as by ſome learned men are named in particular, viz. <hi>Ockam, John of Gaunt, Dantes,</hi> our <hi>John Wickliff, John Hus, Jerom of Prague, Luther,</hi> men that lived in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had their external calling from that Church, were of ſome of their Popiſh orders, and yet are acknowledged to be Angels, as well as thoſe of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that is true Miniſters of Chriſt, raiſed, ſent, and authorized by him. It doth not then derogate from the truth of an official Miniſtry, if he be a ſound Preacher of the Goſpel, that a man hath been ordained thereunto by a <hi>Biſhop Popiſh,</hi> not only in regard of the Office, but in Doctrine alſo; But this acknowledgment of ſuch for <hi>Angels</hi> doth <hi>approve ſuch Ordination good for ſubſtance;</hi> though in ſome things it be corrupt and defective, as before I ſaid of baptizing. It is then a frivolous cavil, and which by this ſentence of the holy Ghoſt is put to ſilence, that men make againſt our Engliſh Miniſters as Antichriſtian, becauſe ordained by Biſhops, when ſuch ſo ordained are called <hi>Angels,</hi> and their Ordination is conferted on them by Biſhops which were ſound in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, <hi>Preſbyters and Preachers</hi> of the Goſpel, and in the worke did joyne other Presbyters with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But the viſible Church it ſelf failed, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of theſe Officials and latter Ordinances, and ſo theſe muſt needs fail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is ſomewhat indeed: Nay ſo much as will carry the cauſe if it be made good. It is not true, as is before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the viſible Church is the foundation of theſe Officials or latter Ordinances; but Chriſts Inſtitution and promiſe: but the viſible Church is inveſted with a power and right to uſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33005:20"/>
them, and that onely, and not any other civil or heretical Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for the Churches good and ſervice, they were by Chriſt appointed; So that if there were in thoſe times of the Apoſtaſie, no viſible Church, it may be granted that they failed ſince there was no Church which had power to uſe them, or for whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they were to be uſed: But me thinks for you to ſay, That the viſible Church hath failed, is much one as if you ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That the pillars of the earth were broken down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. For the viſible Church ſtandeth on as firm a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they, that is, Gods Ordinance, Power and Faithfulneſs. Concerning which point, by a viſible Church may be meant a company of Chriſtians with their ſeed joyned together in one place, and ſetled in a right and compleat order for the worſhip of God, and exerciſe of all Gods Ordinances. Now that there hath been ſuch a viſible Church all along the Apoſtaſie in any one place, or in many places ſucceſſively, cannot, I think, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be ſhewed, nor is it needfull for this matter to be proved. Next, by a viſible Church may be meant a company of perſons profeſſing the true Religion, abſtaining from falſe worſhip, and worſhipping God in a pure way, though for the moſt diſperſed in ſundry places and meetings for Gods worſhip, but in ſmall companies: Such a Church of God certainly hath been and ſhall be perpetual; Such a Church of God there was in <hi>Iſrael</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their great Apoſtaſie, <hi>viz. A company that did not bow the knee to Baal,</hi> 1 King. 18. 19. and did in ſolemn times meet for the main parts of Gods worſhip, as hearing of his Word and Prayer, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 23. though not for Sacrifice, which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily was onely to be offered at the Temple. Such a one was there under the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, in which ſtate the Jews could not aſſemble, as in their own Land to the Temple, to perform all Gods ſervice, but as they were ſcattered into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cities and Towns, could onely where they were, make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profeſſion of their Religion, and in ſmaller companies meet together for the Word and prayer, and ſuch main parts of Gods worſhip. And ſuch a one alſo hath continued under the Popiſh defection.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak to which Point ſomewhat more largely, I affirm, Firſt, That there never was, nor ever will be an utter failing of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33005:21"/>
Chriſts viſible Church. It is propheſied of Chriſt, <hi>That he ſhall ſit upon the Throne of David, and his Kingdom, to order and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it with judgement and iustice, from henceforth even for ever, Iſa.</hi> 9. And what is this Throne and Kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> but Chriſts viſible Church, in which Chriſt is to ſit and reign viſibly, as <hi>David</hi> did in his Kingdom, and that for ever? It is written, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44, <hi>That the God of heaven ſhould ſet up a Kingdom which ſhould never be deſtroyed:</hi> And what can this be meant of, but of Gods viſible Church, ſet up in the view of the world, as thoſe earthly Kingdoms were, which it ſhould break and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, but it ſelf ſtand for ever; But if this Church have at any time wholly failed, it hath not ſtood, nor doth ſtand for ever, but hath been deſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt is ſet up by God his Father with power, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given him, <hi>To rule in the midſt of his enemies,</hi> Pſal. 110. 2. which how ſhould he do, if his enemies ſhould ſo farre prevail, as to aboliſh his viſible Church in which he is to reign? Beſides, theſe are Relatives, and depend one upon another, a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> an <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Body, Huſband</hi> and <hi>Spouſe.</hi> And what is Chriſts Kingdom, Body, Spouſe here in the world (as we have afore-ſaid) but his viſible Church? So that it failing, Chriſt ſhould ceaſe to be a King, Head or Husband in the view of men, or be a King without a Kingdome, a Head without a Body, an Husband without a Wife, or as it were a forlorn Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and ſo for ever, Heb.</hi> 13. 8. As therefore of old he hath had a viſible Church, ſo ought he to have in theſe latter times, now and for ever. If at any time he were, or be without it, he is not the ſame, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoeth a notable alteration in reſpect of this eſtate and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It will not ſalve the matter to ſay, <hi>That his inviſible Church never failed;</hi> and ſo that his Kingdom, Headſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did and doth ever continue, for they are viſible things, whereby the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between him and his Church are deciphered, and ſo in all reaſon point out the viſible ſtate of the Church. 2. The Church inviſible as ſo, is unknown and wholly unſeen to men, and Chriſts inviſible Rule and Government over them, cannot by men be diſcerned. And what honour were this then to Chriſt in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33005:21"/>
world to rule only inviſibly, of which men can take no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. 3. Whereſoever Chriſt hath an inviſible Church, there will a viſible Church appear; for where true faith is, it will not be hid, but manifeſt it ſelf to the world by open profeſſion, and ſo thoſe that are members of the inviſible Church will become viſible to the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I affirm, That Chriſts viſible Church never wholly failed under Antichriſts Apoſtacy. It was ſometimes leſſe for the Territories it occupied, then at ſome other time, ſometime more hid and leſſe conſpicuous for its ſhew unto the world, but it was ever extant, and ſo extant that it appeared unto men both in particular members, and in companies belonging thereto, by their profeſſion of the true faith, witneſſing againſt errours, worſhipping God and ſuffering for the Goſpel, though not ſo acknowledged by the Antichriſtian rabble.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There were <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> of Chriſt all the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Reign. <hi>Revel</hi> 11. 3. and what were they but a company of Preachers and Profeſſors, which all that time ſucceſſively witneſſed for Chriſts truth againſt Popery? whoſe profeſſion as it was open and manifeſt; ſo did it declare to the world, that Chriſt had a company which profeſſed his truth, and that they did belong thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There were Saints ſo manifeſting themſelves by life and profeſſion, ſo diſcovered by the Beaſt and Whore by their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which they made to their wayes, againſt which the Beaſt made warre, and overcame them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 7. And with whoſe bloud the Whore was drunken, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 6. Yet ſo that all Chriſts Saints were not deſtroyed, but ſome being ſlain, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aroſe in their rooms, or continued other where ſo ſtill to uphold the profeſſion of the Goſpel. Now where viſible Saints are (as we do ſee here were under Antichriſt) that profeſſe true religion and worſhip; there is a viſible Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There was by S. <hi>John</hi> during the Apoſtaſie ſeen on Mount <hi>Sion</hi> with the Lamb a hundred fourty four thouſand, <hi>Revel,</hi> 14. 1. whoſe deſcription is ſuch, as ſheweth that Chriſt in them, during that time, had a viſible Church. For, 1. They had their fathers, <hi>i. e.</hi> Gods name written in their fore heads, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33005:22"/>
that is, they made open profeſſion of his true Religion. 2. They did exerciſe themſelves in ſinging before the Throne, the Elders and the Beaſts, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. And what is that but that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God together in holy Aſſemblies? 3. They were not deſiled with women, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. but were virgins, that is, they kept themſelves from being polluted with <hi>the ſpirituall whoredom,</hi> I mean, the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the times: And now tell me, Are not ſuch companies as openly profeſſe true Religion, worſhip God in holy meetings, and preſerve themſelves from common Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, viſible Churches? what elſe can you make of them? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are neither Synagogues of Satan, nor confuſions of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> Laſtly, There was a Temple during the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie, in which alſo there was a company that did worſhip, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 1. And what was this but the true Church of Chriſt, and the ſame viſible: <hi>For it was meaſured:</hi> Now meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of things viſible, not inviſible. Again, while the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie laſted, Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw a Temple in which <hi>Angels</hi> were converſant, and with them (no doubt) other worſhippers, <hi>Revel</hi> 14. 15, 17, 18. Yea he ſaw this Temple opened, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 5. in heaven before the ſeven laſt plagues were fulfilled: It ſeems that for the greateſt part of the Apoſtaſie this Temple was ſomewhat ſecret and hidden, yet not ſo, but that it was viſible alſo in ſome that worſhipped in it, and ſome open Profeſſors of the Goſpel. But withall it became more open and manifeſtly viſible upon the Reformation which was made by thoſe worthy and godly Miniſters, whom God raiſed ſome hundred years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and ſo hath been ever ſince more viſible and conſpicuous: ſo far is it from being utterly loſt and extinct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But all this while onely <hi>aſealed elect number remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Rev. 7. 3, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;</hi> 9. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you mean that there were none that made any viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profeſſion of true Religion, but thoſe ſealed ones; you ſay that beſide the book and without proof. For thoſe ſealed ones were (as you truly ſay) elect and ſaved ones. Now in all ages many more have made profeſſion of Religion then the elect of God, <hi>Many are called few are choſen,</hi> Matth. 20. 16. And ſo here it is clear, that during the time eſpecially at the beginning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33005:22"/>
of the defection, as in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 9. Beſides the godly mourners which were marked in the fore-head, there were ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry that made profeſſion of the Jewiſh Religion, and were viſible Members, though not living Members of the Church: So during this Apoſtaſie, beſide theſe ſealed ones there were many that did profeſſe the Chriſtian Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for the ſubſtance, and helpe to make up a viſible Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If there were none elſe, yet that doth not prove, that the viſible Church did utterly fail. For even out of that number viſible Churches in ſundry places, and ſeveral Ages, in which ſucceſſively they lived, might well be, and were conſtituted, as which were a company ſealed in the fore-head, and making open profeſſion of Chriſt and his Goſpel in the Places where, and in the Ages when they lived: Two things are about them to be taken notice of;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they were a ſealed number, which doth import thus much, That in that great defection in which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of men periſhed eternally by wondering after, and worſhipping the Beaſt, Yet there was a choſen number that were ſaved, that is, theſe ſealed ones, and none but they, though there were many beſides them which made viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they were ſealed in the fore-head, which ſhews, that while the whole earth almoſt did worſhip the Beaſt, yet there was a great number in thoſe times that did not defile themſelves with that Idolatry, but did openly maintain and profeſſe the true faith of Chriſt and worſhip of God; among which was found a viſible Church.</p>
            <p>For a Concluſion you adde, <hi>That theſe latter Ordinances have a being in the Scripture, and in the minde and deſire of the faithfull, and that you carry them along with you, as the</hi> Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites <hi>did of old the veſſels of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that you dare not offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with them, as being in the Territories of</hi> Babylon, <hi>untill you be paſt</hi> Euphrates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What Ordinances are inſtituted and commanded in Scripture (as you ſay they are, for how elſe have they a being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33005:23"/>
there but by inſtitution and command?) Gods people are bound to practiſe them in all times and places, unleſſe by ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal violence of perſecution, or ſo, they be letted. They muſt obſerve all things which Chriſt hath commanded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. It will not then ſerve your turn, that you carry them along with you in your minde and deſire, unleſſe you officiate with them, as you phraſe it. Nor will the example of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> help here, who uſed not the veſſels of the Lord for any holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice while they were in the way to <hi>Sion.</hi> Of which the reaſon is very plain; for their uſe was confined to a certain place, <hi>viz.</hi> The Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and might not elſewhere be uſed. But ſo are not any Goſpel-Ordinances, with which God may now be worſhipped in any place, <hi>John</hi> 4. 21, 23. And if you purpoſe to forbear the uſe of them, untill you be paſt <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> I would gladly learn from you, what this <hi>Euphrates</hi> is: How farre from it, or near to it we be. As <hi>Irenaeus</hi> above, ſaid of Prophecies not fulfilled, That they are dark, and ſo doubtfull Riddles unto men: ſo about this, as not accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your own judgement, I finde Interpreters ſo to vary, that I know not where to fix my foot. Preſume not too much of your own inſight into ſuch myſtical Prophecies above other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men, but whatſoever your conceit be of it, count it but as a conjecture, and be content with us in ſobriety and humility to wait untill the Lord ſhall accompliſh it, and by a clear event reveal to us the meaning of it.</p>
            <p>And thus having ſaid ſomewhat to moſt of your new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, I ſhould here have ended, but that there cometh to minde, an argument of ſome weight, with the particulars of it, much making againſt your new way, which I deſire to profer to your conſideration. It is thus, <hi>What Way or opinion is contrary to any of the ten Commandments, any Petition of the Lords-Prayer, any commanded Duty, and to the furtherance of mens ſalvation, cannot be of Christ, but may juſtly be deemed Antichristian.</hi> Such is this of yours, which <hi>denies the ſetting up of viſible Churches in right order, official Miniſtry, and calling thereunto, and the exerciſe of Diſcipline: and therefore it cannot be of God, but a ſpirit of Antichrist is in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:33005:23"/>
To make good the <hi>Minor,</hi> of which onely the doubt can be; It is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Contrary to the ſecond Commandment, As the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of that Commandment doth forbid unto men all falſe and deviſed means of Gods worſhip, ſo the affirmative, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the received rule of interpreting the Commandments, doth command to us the uſe of all means of worſhip appointed by the Lord. Now the Lord hath appointed for that purpoſe two ſorts of means, the one more principall, as directly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exerciſe and nouriſhing of Faith, Hope and Love, <hi>viz.</hi> Preaching the Word, adminiſtration of Sacraments, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayer. The other leſſe principall, as conducing to the right uſe of the former, and tending to Gods worſhip, as their proper end: ſuch are Church-ſocieties, official-Miniſtry, and a due Calling to it, exerciſe of Diſcipline, which that Commandment doth enjoyn as well as the former, and which cannot be wittingly and commonly omitted without breach of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is againſt the fourth Commandment, which, as it commandeth the ſanctifying of the Sabbath, ſo according to the right interpreting of the Commandments doth it withall preſcribe and enjoyn the uſe of all means that are profitable to the better ſanctifying of it. And who can deny, who is not wilfully wedded to his ſelf-conceit, that gathering and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches in diſtinct ſocieties, and an official Miniſtery right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called doth much avail hereunto, and that the Lords-day is much better ſanctified in ſuch Societies, and ſuch a Miniſtry, then in confuſed Aſſemblies that are without order, and without any orderly Miniſtry? Now the ten Commandments are moral, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and binde alwayes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is againſt the two firſt Petitions of the Lords Prayer, wherein we are taught to pray, <hi>That Gods name may be hallowed,</hi> Secondly, <hi>That his Kingdom may come.</hi> Now what we ought to pray for, it is our duty to purſue the promoting of it by all Gods means; for to pray for this or that, and not to apply our ſelves to the uſe of all good means to obtain or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it, is to dally with God and to mock him: Now the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33005:24"/>
up of viſible Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of an orderly Miniſtery and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, doe ſerve very much to the ſanctifying of Gods name, and promoting his Kingdom, for they are Gods Ordinances, in appointing which his ſoveraign Power, Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are ſet forth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Particularly in and by a viſible Church his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is upheld among men, his Religion is profeſſed, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel publiſhed. It is therefore called, <hi>The Pillar of Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. In and by an orderly Miniſtery, the due honour and authority of that calling is maintained, Gods holy things are miniſtred with the more aſſurance of Gods acceptation, and hope of his bleſſing of them. By Diſcipline ſcandals are prevented or healed, and licentious living much reſtrained. To deny therefore theſe things, as unſeaſonable, and ſo now unlawfull, is to hinder the ſanctifying of Gods Name, and advancing of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is againſt the Commandment of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſcandals, which all Chriſtians are bound to doe their endeavour to prevent or take away, and for which Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline by Chriſt is ordained the ſpeciall Remedy, which ſince you oppoſe, what doe you but ſet your ſelfe againſt this command of Chriſt, and open a Gate for ſinnefull Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in erroneous Doctrine, and looſeneſſe of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is prejudicial to mans Salvation, which no ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man can or will deny, muſt needs be better furthered in a ſetled Society of Saints, under a conſtant Miniſtery and due exerciſe of Diſcipline, then where none of theſe are: But either an utter rejection of them, or confuſion in them.</p>
            <p>And thus you have my Notions touching your new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for which I have made you long to wait. If you impute it to my dulneſſe or ſluggiſhneſſe, I will not deny it. I am, I confeſſe, a man but of a dull apprehenſion, and ſlow motion: But I can more truely aſcribe it to my late domeſtick troubles and ſickneſſe, which I did ſlowly recover, and to my want of

            <p>WHat place of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> I have before but touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, I think meet again to propound for further conſideration; It is <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 23. there <hi>John</hi> ſaw a ſea of glaſſe mingled with fire, and multitudes ſtanding by it, which had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, and over his Image, and over his Mark, and over the number of his Name, having Harps of God, and ſinging the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb. Now I deſire to know, who theſe can be but the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Miniſters and people that at the firſt Reformation (for <hi>John</hi> ſaw them before the Vials began to be poured out) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Pope and Popery, and ſet up the pure Worſhip of God, and ſound Doctrine of the Goſpel, meant by the ſea of Glaſſe there mentioned. If this be ſo (as ſurely it is) I ask, 1. How thoſe reformed Churches then, or ours in theſe times which are more reformed, or their Miniſtery can be affirmed to be beſtial and Antichriſtian, when the holy Ghoſt doth teſtifie for them, that they had gotten the victory over the Beaſt, his Image, Mark, and the very number of his Name? 2. Whether it be not a ſlander partly coming from ignorance, partly from malice, to brand the Ordination of our Miniſters, though by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, much more when done by preaching Presbyters, as now is in uſe with faſting and prayer, as a mark of the Beaſt, when it is ſo plainly ſaid, that all they, <hi>i. e.</hi> Miniſters as well as people had got the victory over the mark of the Beaſt in expreſſe terms? 3. Whether the reformed Churches which got ſuch a victory over all theſe, yea even the number of the Beaſt his Name, have

To this requeſt made a moneth ſince, I can have no ſair anſwer, but what uncertain report brings me, that I muſt content my ſelf with that Copy, as being not like to have any other from him: This then is one main cauſe of my publiſhing theſe for<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
