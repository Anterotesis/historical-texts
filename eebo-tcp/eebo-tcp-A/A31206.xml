            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Firſt Reaſon that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
Princes to be valiant,
is their Reputation. There
is no Vertue that makes ſo
great a Figure in the World,
nor leaves ſo great an Impreſſion on
Men's Spirits, as this of Valour: And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56699:7"/>
the Eſteem that People have for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
chiefly in Military Diſcipline:
We do not make ſo narrow an Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
into the Conduct of Men of other
Profeſſions; we do not regard ſo much
whether an <hi>Artiſt</hi> is continually in his
Shop, whether a <hi>Merchant</hi> is every Day
upon the Exchange, whether a <hi>Lawyer</hi>
conſtantly attends the Bar, or a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi>
waits daily on his Patients: But
a <hi>Soldier,</hi> for the leaſt Failure in his
Duty, muſt undergo Severities. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his firſt Liſting himſelf, he is an
Apprentice to War and Danger; and
his whole Life is but a continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Labours and Fatigues. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Profeſſions one may ſometimes
neglect, and not be puniſhed for it;
we may renounce them, and exchange
them for others, or may wholly leave
them off, and no Penalty can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on us: But the leaſt Omiſſion in
War paſſeth for an Offence puniſhable;
and Deſertion, for a Capital Crime.
An Army is a diſtinct People from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and a Realm by it ſelf: Beſides
the general Laws, they have Laws pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to themſelves; according to
which they inflict the ſpeedieſt, exacteſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56699:7"/>
and ſevereſt Juſtice in the World.
This rigorous Exerciſe that is kept
up amongſt Soldiers, ariſeth from a
Conſideration we have for them, and
from a Maxim which comes very near
to that of <hi>Plato,</hi> when in his <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
he puts this remarkable Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Free-men</hi> and <hi>Slaves,</hi> in
that he condemns Free-men to Death
for Crimes, for which Slaves ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a more favourable Chaſtiſement.
Some hold, that an Army ranged in
Battel is the fineſt and moſt noble Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
that can be preſented to our Eyes:
The Pleaſure we take in ſeeing them,
ariſeth from the high <hi>Idaea</hi> we have of
Valour. For, indeed, ſhould we ſee
Troops gliſtering in their Arms, drawn
up in the moſt regular manner, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
furniſhed with all thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
which are requiſite for Siege or
Battel, and we ſhould at the ſame time
be perſuaded that they were Cowards
under the Appearance of Soldiers, we
ſhould diſdain to look upon this vain
and uſeleſs <hi>Mobile;</hi> or if we did caſt
our Eyes upon them, it would be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ridicule than admire them.</p>

                  <p>BUT to carry this Reflection far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we may conſider, that we
beſtow greater Pains and Coſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Men to Valour, than to any of
the other Vertues. Kings keep thoſe
in daily Pay, whom they employ in
their Wars: They do not give Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to Men for their Prudence, nor
for their Liberality; but they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them for being valiant. There
are I know not how many Arts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to the Art Military; and a
Thouſand Sorts of Artificers are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
to equip a Soldier <hi>Cap-a pe:</hi>
One makes him a Sword; another,
his Breaſt-plate; a Third, his Head-piece;
others there be, that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and furbiſhing his Fire-Arms,
(which Antiquity was ignorant of:)
Some are employed in making Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which may excite his Joy, or
raiſe his Fury; as Drums, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
and Wind-Muſick; whoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56699:8"/>
Sounds make the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Harmony. The Manage was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
for the War: And if the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Maſter
train up an Horſe of
Value, he is deſigned for the Day of
Battel. The Pomp and Flouriſh of
Habits is not comely in any, but Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
by Profeſſion: Feathers, Scarves,
Gold or Silver-Embroyderies, look
great, when worn with a Sword;
and a Soldier hath always been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
theſe ſorts of Ornaments, as
Preſages of his Triumph. The Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the nobleſt of all Trees are
wreathed into Coronets for him; as,
the Lawrel, (which Thunder ſeems
to reverence;) and the Palm-Tree,
which never bows down to the Earth,
but advanceth up ambitiouſly towards
the Sky. We cannot number the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Prizes that the Ancients eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
as the Recompence of valiant
Actions: There were not only ſome
for Captains and Generals; as, the
Sur-names of Countries which they
conquered, Trophies, Triumphal

them above precious Treaſures. A

to rule their Subjects, and to

Valour is a Vertue, and Vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
only to Reaſonable Creatures.
Yet Valour is ſo amiable, that we
love its very Image and Appearance
in the Brute: And we ſpeak of the
<hi>Lion</hi> with a kind of awful Eſteem:
We attribute to him Actions of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity;
we ſay, he will not inſult
over a vanquiſhed Enemy, that he
will pardon them whom he hath
brought under the Power of his
Clutches: We ſay, when he ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in danger to be over-power'd by
a Multitude, he will not flee away in
Diſorder, but make ſeaſonable Halts
and Turns; he retreats in State, and,
as it were, facing his Enemies. When
a Man hath diſtinguiſhed himſelf by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56699:13"/>
his Bravery, we beſtow ſome Title
upon him in our uſual Language; but
when Eloquence or Poeſie thinks to
honour an Heroe, it compares him
to a Lion. <hi>France,</hi> which hath bred
up many Perſons who deſerve that
Appellation, doth not bring forth
Lions: But when we know they are
brought over from thoſe ſcorching
Climates where they are bred, into
our Country, we are curious to go
and view them; we conſider them
with Attention, and a kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect;
we take pleaſure to ſee them
extend their Claws, with which they
can tear <hi>Elephants</hi> in pieces; we love
to hear his Roaring, which has been
the Terrour of a whole Country.
The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Eagle:</hi>
We conceive lofty Thoughts of him;
we conſider him as a Sovereign, who
exerciſeth his Dominion in the vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of the Aery Regions, and makes
his uninterrupted Progreſs through
immenſe Spaces. That which gives
us ſo noble an <hi>Idaea</hi> of him, is, That
he excels all the Feathered Creation
in Courage, and his Approaches to
them are terrible. The Word <hi>Prince,</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56699:14"/>
in the Original, ſignifies no more than
<hi>Chief:</hi> And this Title carries a ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and more acceptable Sound to
a newly-conquered People, than all
the other harſh Names, which are as
ſo many Marks of <hi>Arbitrary Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty.</hi>
For this Reaſon <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (as
<hi>Tacitus</hi> hath well obſerved) choſe to
govern the Empire under no other
Title than that of <hi>Prince. Dion,</hi> to
the ſame Sence, reports of another
Emperor, who uſed to ſay, <hi>I am the
Maſter of my Slaves, the General of my
Soldiers, and the Prince of all the reſt
of the</hi> Romans. The moſt graceful
Superiority is that which is founded
in the higheſt Perfection: And we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
this Name to thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
all others in their laudable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.
We therefore call <hi>Virgil</hi> the
Prince of Poets, and <hi>Cicero</hi> the Prince
of Orators. Of all thoſe Royal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that God hath annexed to the
Dignity of a Prince, this Title car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in it an Eternal Advertiſement to
thoſe who are honoured with it, to

War, Loſs of Arms, and (in a Word)
all Cowardly Actions, or but the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances

Stains, and Eternal Infamies. There
were ſome of them who died for Grief,

neither would they admit of
any Conſolation. There were found
ſome Mothers, who killed their own
Sons when they returned from a Battel,
as believing they did not there behave

<hi>Tyrteus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> into their City,

Cowardice; the Sence whereof was

another manner of Reaſoning, which
did not at firſt offer it ſelf to my
Mind, and hath made me to diſcover
one of the prime Sources from whence
ariſeth the Reputation we have of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
Both Publick and Private Men
regard thoſe who are endued with
this Vertue, as Props and Bucklers,
whereof they may ſometimes ſtand in
need. So that by our Suffrages which
we beſtow on them, in Emulation one
of another, we would oblige them to
defend us on all Occaſions; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
their Inclinations to protect us,
as well as their Power. 'Tis true, we
eſteem a valiant Man, though he be
in the fartheſt Part of the <hi>Indies;</hi>
and our Eſtimation of him ſurvives
after he is dead. But when an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is born with us, it doth not
wait always to put it ſelf into Action,
till all neceſſary Circumſtances are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered;
and although Nature hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56699:20"/>
it to a certain End, yet it
follows its Courſe nevertheleſs, though
it miſs of its End. Beſides, Example
re-unites all Times, and all Places.
By the Help of Example, Valour hath
a <hi>Sympathetick</hi> Force; its Operations
influence thoſe who are remote; and
the Powder of an Hero's Aſhes works
at a diſtance: We regard the <hi>Memoirs</hi>
of their Lives, as a perpetual Spur
and Incitement to Vertue; we hope
it will produce other Heroes in our
Days, to whom we may flee, as a
Sanctuary in our Diſtreſſes. And we
ſhould never have been tranſported
with ſo much Zeal in the Praiſes of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> if we did

                  <head type="sub">The Deſire of Superiority in the
Matters of Valour hath been
the Original Cauſe of Wars.</head>
                  <p>IT has been imagined, that the firſt
Cauſe of War was, a Deſire that
Nations have had to tranſplant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into more fruitful Countries,
and more commodious Habitations,
than their own; when, in Truth, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has more Care of her Productions,
than to leave them deſtitute of Things
neceſſary in the Places where they were
brought forth: No Breezes refreſh ſo
ſweetly, as one's native Air; no Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is ſo pleaſant, as that which is
ſituated in a Man's own Country.
Thoſe who are born under the Freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the North, or the Scorchings
of the Line, would not exchange their
Dwellings for the moſt temperate Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
in the World. The Original
Cauſe of War ſeems then to proceed
from the Ambition Men generally have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56699:21"/>
for Superiority in Matters of Valour.
This Deſire is, from Time to Time,
kept awake in the Minds of People;
and hath carried them on to fight one
againſt another, without any other
Conſideration. Hence it oftentimes
comes to paſs, that the Conqueror
doth not care to keep his Conqueſts
entire; but is contented with a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
an Homage, or a bare Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
that the Vanquiſhed make,
that they have been ſurmounted pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Force of his Arms. We do
not believe that the <hi>Goths, Huns</hi> and
<hi>Vandals,</hi> thoſe Hurricanes of Nations,
which made an Inundation into the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, were animated by this
Motive: It may be, they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it themſelves. But this is not the
firſt Time that a Paſſion has been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
purſued, without being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by him that followed it. It
happens oftentimes, that theſe Springs
play and move in the Bottom of our
Hearts, and our Hearts not perceive
them: And it is very probable, that
Nature being, as it were, jealous of
her ſelf, endeavours to ſhew it in ſome
of her Operations, wherein ſhe hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56699:21"/>
better ſucceeded, than in others; and
ſo puſhed on thoſe fierce Nations, to
make them appear more courageous,
than thoſe that were ſubdued by them.
Moreover, when we ſpeak of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laric's,</hi>
and the <hi>Attila's,</hi> there is a
Thought darts in upon us, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
takes us up: We are well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that Hiſtory hath not forgotten
them, as not deſerving to be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Lumber of the Crowd:
Whatever Opinion we may have of
them otherwiſe, yet we never think
of them with ſuch mean and ſlighty
Thoughts as we commonly have for
Things baſe and vile. Thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which have an Horrour for them,
yet can deteſt them, without deſpiſing
them. They are compared to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and Lightnings: They look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them as Serpents, who raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up towards the Sky; and not as
mere crawling Vermin. In ſhort, If
we obſerve in them ſomething <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi>
yet we alſo find ſomething, I
know not what, of <hi>Great.</hi> Theſe
Men have celebrated themſelves by
their Boldneſs; they have forced Fame
to immortalize them; they have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56699:22"/>
an Eſteem from thoſe very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they have ranſacked; and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
of Empires, they have uſurped
to an Admiration. It was for this
Reaſon that the <hi>Romans,</hi> who treated all
other Nations as Barbarians, (except
the <hi>Graecians;)</hi> and the Ancient <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
who looked upon all the World
beſides as barbarians, (not excepting
the <hi>Romans;)</hi> put a great Difference,
both the one, and the other, between
thoſe which they called Barbarians:
They ſpoke with Contempt of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> becauſe they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon them as Cowards; but they
ſpake of the <hi>Gauls</hi> with Eſteem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they accounted them valiant.
This fierce and undaunted Nation
(whoſe Country <hi>France</hi> then was)
ſerves me for an Example, to juſtifie
the Notion which I have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing.
One of the Ancients hath made
this Remark; That the Deſtruction of
<hi>Rome</hi> had been infallible, if the <hi>Gauls</hi>
would have attacked her during the
Time ſhe made War againſt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
or againſt the <hi>Italians:</hi> But
in regard <hi>Rome</hi> had the Weight of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Wars upon her Shoulders, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56699:22"/>
other Enemies to grapple with, the <hi>Gauls</hi>
ſtood by as Neuters, and Spectators
of the Event, without taking either
Side. But afterwards, when they ſaw
her free, and diſ-engaged, either
through Conqueſt, or Treaty, then
they poured themſelves into <hi>Italy,</hi> and
made that terrible Irruption, called,
<hi>Tumultus Gallicus;</hi> which alarm'd the
whole World to take up Arms, and
to defend themſelves againſt ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Enemies. Was not this a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Affectation of Valour? They
would overcome; yet not ſo, but that
their Victory ſhould be wholly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to their Courage. And they had
aſſuredly been victorious, had they but
equalized the <hi>Romans</hi> in Diſcipline, as
they ſurpaſſed them in Valour.</p>

                  <p>HIſtory takes more Care to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiate
the Actions of Valour,
than thoſe of other Vertues. When
ſhe falls upon a Siege, or a ſet Battel,
ſhe makes a Stand, and would have us

in deſcribing one Day's Battel, than in

When ſhe meets with any memorable

of the Place where it happened;
repreſents to us the regular Motions of
the Troops, reports the Harangues of
the Generals, marks out the exact
Time when the Signal was given; ſhe
obſerves the ſeveral Companies, and
their Movements, both in the On-ſet,
and in the Defence; ſhe numbers the
Slain, and gives us an Account of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56699:23"/>
Priſoners. In ſhort, ſhe waits, Step
by Step, on the Conquerors, and the
Conquered; and, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe in the World but thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which were engaged, ſhe forgets
all the reſt of Mankind, only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
this Battel. Now, ſhe doth not
take this Pains out of Oſtentation, but
rather out of Neceſſity. And we ſhall
find ſhe hath Reaſon for this Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
if we call to mind, that Set Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
have cauſed the Revolutions of
Empires, and have put <hi>Changes upon

ſuch a Time the Soldiers carry in their
Hands the Deſtiny of Nations: And it
often comes to paſs, that on the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

the Proſperity or Miſery of

is more exact in theſe Deſcriptions,
ſo we are apt moſt eſpecially to apply
our ſelves to them: We conſider with
Attention the immortal Impreſſions
which they leave upon our Minds.
Painting takes us up more entirely in
Picture and Landskips of this nature,
than in others: It cannot repreſent to
us a more agreeable Object, than an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56699:24"/>
Hero in a Battel. And we take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Pleaſure, either to behold <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>
giving Chaſe to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> or
a <hi>Scipio</hi> fighting under the Walls of
<hi>Carthage:</hi> But we think it does not

while he lived, that any ſhould draw
his Portraicture, or erect his Statue.</p>

honour Valour more than
Juſtice: And the Reaſon of

                  <p>IT is the Opinion of the moſt ſage
Philoſopher, in his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> that
there are more Praiſes attributed to
juſt and valiant Men, than to Perſons
eminent for other Vertues. He might
have added, (as, in effect, he hath

are more highly applauded, than
the Juſt. In purſuing this, I ſhall not

who, in their Declamations, uſually
amplifie the Theme they have eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and never fail to extol their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Subject, above all others. We
muſt not be partial, as not for the
Men, ſo neither for the Vertues. It
muſt be confeſſed, Juſtice is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56699:25"/>
of all: And the Anſwer of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Prince, both valiant and juſt, was
ſolid and fine: When one demanded
of him, whether Valour or Juſtice was
the more reputable; he made this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<hi>If all the World would follow Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Valour would be uſeleſs.</hi> Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
we do here in the beſtowing
our Acclamations, as Princes ſometimes
do in the Diſpenſation of their Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
The Meaſure of their Favours is
not regulated according to the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Merit of the Perſon only;
they have other Regards; as, Services
rendred, or to be rendred; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
of great and neceſſary
Miniſters of State; the Effect that
their Largeſſes may have as to the
Publick; and a Thouſand ſuch like
Conſiderations. Farther; Although
Men generally eſteem Juſtice more than
Valour, yet they honour Valour more
than Juſtice; they have always added
a greater Splendor to the Reputation
of this Vertue, than to that of others;
and they have taken an extream Care in
all Ages, as to Men that live and die
in the Wars, to render their Lives il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious,
and their Deaths honourable.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56699:25"/>
And it is not without good Reaſon
that they do ſo; for the Profeſſion of
War is the moſt penible in its Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and the moſt hazardous in its
Deſigns. Perils are not amiable and
lovely in themſelves; they muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
and imbelliſhed with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And we may well ſay, Juſtice it
ſelf hath adviſed Men to maintain this
Conduct; ſince it is but juſt, that if
Valour hazard all for the Defence
and Preſervation of the People, that
the People, on their ſide, ſhould refuſe
nothing that may contribute to the
Renown of Valour. Now, all theſe
Reaſons are more eminently apparent,
in reference to Princes: We ordain
Triumphs for them, not only for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
eſtabliſhed good Laws, but for
having made great Conqueſts. And
not only the Eſteem, but the thankful
Acknowledgments that People conceive
for them, is greater when they return
from a Campaign full of Fatigues and
Dangers, than when they ſee them
mount the Throne of Juſtice: Becauſe
War is no leſs hazardous than it is
painful; and in the Exerciſes of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
the King expoſeth his own Life;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56699:26"/>
whereas in the Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
he beſtows nothing but his Time
and Labour.</p>

                  <p>THough there were nothing but the
Conſideration of Honour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Princes to Valour, one would think
this were an effectual Motive to Royal
Souls. But this is not the only Thing:
Intereſt and Self-preſervation obligeth
them to be valiant. Though Policy
and Morality are nearly founded upon
the ſame Principles, and are guided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
by the ſame Rules, yet it is leſs
rare to find a juſt and generous Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
amongſt private Perſons, than a
juſt and generous Policy among States.
Thoſe who are managed by juſt and

more commendable; but yet, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim
I have propounded doth not ceaſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56699:26"/>
to be true. For, if we conſider the
World now as it is, and as it always
hath been, we ſhall find, that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
and Republicks are in a continual
Defiance; they are always in a State of
War. It is not ſo much great Rivers,
or a vaſt Range of Mountains, that
bounds their Dominions, as a mutual
and reciprocal Fear they have one of
another. From hence it is that they
are pre-cautioned to fortifie themſelves,
to have Garriſons Manned, and Armies
in Pay, and to retain the <hi>Idaea</hi> of War
in the midſt of a profound Peace. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is neceſſary, where there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Suſpicion of Injuſtice, and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of injuries, to put one in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to repreſs Violence, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Force with Force. When a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Prince is ſet upon, he often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
himſelf with Succeſs, always, with
Honour. Beſides; It is certain, they
think more than once, before they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
any Thing againſt him: So
that he is ſeldom reduced to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of defending himſelf. And, in
Truth, he hath more of thoſe that are
ſecretly jealous of him, than of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Enemies. It frequently happens,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56699:27"/>
that a ſingle Man hath brought Safety
to a Nation, and Victory to an Army.
This great Confidence proceeds from
the Reputation of the General; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be in Politick Government, or
Military Diſcipline. There is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Saying, which is very common;
<hi>That an Army of Harts, conducted by a

<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> came into <hi>Italy,</hi> and had

the Conduct of <hi>Eumenes;</hi> who being to

the former whereof had a
great Reputation, and the other none;
when he underſtood that <hi>Craterus</hi> was
ready to fall on him, he made his
Troops believe that it was <hi>Neoptolemus;</hi>
ſo that they engaged briskly in the
Battel, and never knew they had to

When <hi>Alexander</hi> was gone over into

                     <hi>Aſia,</hi> there was great Reaſon of Fear

Broils and Rebellions. No Perſon was
ſo hardy as to ſet upon him, but rather
ſought his Alliance. And we know,
that at the fatal Time of his Death,
when he had made vaſt Preparations
for War, how he alarmed all other
States, and put <hi>Europe</hi> to a Stand. On

abandoned by his own Subjects. The
ſtrange Misfortune which happened to
<hi>Severus</hi> the Emperor, proceeded from
the mean Opinion the Soldiers had of
his Valour. <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

deſert him, and go over to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
after he had made a ſhameful and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Retreat from the Battel of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctium.</hi>
We will relate one Thing,
which, though it ſeems not very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
as being but the Action of a
private Perſon; yet it ſerves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Truth of this Notion that I am
upon. <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> for the accompliſhing
of what he had begun, quits <hi>Rome</hi> a
Year after this fatal Battel; and being
gone into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he beſiegeth the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56699:28"/>
in <hi>Alexandria:</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Anthony,</hi> ſo highly ſignalized him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in a Sally, that <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him to ſup with him at his own
Table, and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> preſented him
with an Head-piece and Breaſt-plate of
Gold: Yet notwithſtanding, though
this Soldier was ſo magnificently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced,
the Night following he deſerts
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and goes over to <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s
Camp. I alledge not this Example, in
any wiſe to excuſe ſuch baſe Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
but to let you ſee the Danger a
Man expoſeth himſelf to of being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
when he hath given Cauſe but
to queſtion his Want of Reſolution.
But if Valour be neceſſary to a Prince
to keep what he hath gotten, it is yet
much more neceſſary to put him in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of what belongs to him. He
muſt not think, or expect, in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Way, that the State will render
up their Forts, at leaſt, unleſs they are
forced to it, or are in fear of being ſo;
they will not part with them, as long
as they have a Proſpect of Power to
keep them. It is to no purpoſe to ſend
Ambaſſadors to alledge Reaſons; they
will counter-plead them with Reaſons,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56699:29"/>
or contrary Pretences: And when the
Demand he makes is very preſſing, he
will at laſt receive an Anſwer like to
that of the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Captain; the
King of <hi>Perſia</hi> wrote to him, <hi>Send me
your Arms:</hi> He returns him this blunt
Anſwer, <hi>viz. Come, and fetch them.</hi>

for the Preſerving, ſeeing it
is neceſſary to the Raiſing, it ſelf; and
that the greateſt Fortunes in all Ages
have been wrought out by Valour. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, ſome from
the loweſt Rank, have arrived to the
Purple: Many others were private Men,
before they were Princes. The Empire
was a long time expoſed, either as the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56699:29"/>
Reward of Courage, or as a Prey to
Ambition; which, without Courage,
is altogether vain and impotent. In
Truth, the firſt Six <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſucceeded
each other by the Rights of Blood or
Adoption. <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and ſome others,
had their Children for their Succeſſors:
But how came <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> himſelf to the
Throne? How came <hi>Galba, Trajan</hi> and
<hi>Severus</hi> to the Sovereignty? <hi>Severus,</hi>
above all others, is the greateſt Inſtance
of the Effects which are produced by
Courage: He had to conteſt with puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Rivals; and of the Four Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to the Empire, he was looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be the weakeſt; yet by his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
he ſurmounted his Competitors;
he flew to and fro, from one End of the
Empire to another, with an Impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
always victorious: Whether he
were in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts, or in our
Countries Weſtward, he atchieved ſuch
great Things, that it was
the Opinion of a judicious
Hiſtorian,<note place="margin">Herodian.</note> that his Actions
were not inferiour to thoſe of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to come nearer to our own

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56699:30"/>
or (as we ſometimes phraſe it) a Son

                  <p>THE <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Commonwealth
ſubſiſted a long Time, (that is

comes from Valour.</head>
                  <p>BUT the Duration of theſe States
comes not near Monarchy. Next
to the Succours of Divine Providence,
which is the principal cauſe of its
Conſervation, we may not referr it to
Humane Prudence, ſince it muſt be
granted, that this Vertue is not always
found in any one particular Nation:
It muſt be attributed to Valour. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
in the longeſt Succeſſion of Kings,
there is but few of them that Hiſtory
reproacheth for Want of Courage; and
yet the Hiſtorians profeſs an Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
both to the Good, and Bad. If
we trace the Lines of remoteſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
as far as we do ours, or thoſe
moſt near, we ſhall not find one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where Courage hath been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And though ſome Kings have
not been always Victorious, but they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56699:32"/>
have been always Valiant; and if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had been but as conſtant to them
as Nature, they would have left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for their Succeſſours to do now,
but might have made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Univerſe. The Misfortunes
of King <hi>John</hi> obliged <hi>Charles,</hi> his Son,
not to hazard a ſecond Diſgrace; but
that Prince, who, in this, then ſhewed
his Prudence, had before given Proof
of his Courage. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh,
who, towards the Latter End of his
Days, had abandoned his Soul to the
melancholy Terrours and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Death, never gave Teſtimony
of ſuch terrifying Fears in all his Wars:
And one might have ſeen him give
Perſonal Proofs of his Valour at the
Battle of <hi>Montlheri. Henry</hi> the Third
had won three Victories before he was
King; which gives us to obſerve, that
it was his Slothfulneſs, and not his
Cowardice, which was the Cauſe of
his unhappy Reign. He feared not
the Danger of War, but he dreaded
the Labour of it. He had been well
ſatisfied to have fought every Year a
Battle, provided, that after the Fight
was over, he might have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56699:32"/>
to ſpend the reſt of the Year
in Idleneſs. Theſe are they whom
Calumny may take occaſion to aſperſe;
and yet they are free from this Fault
of Cowardice. The reſt claim our
Elogies, rather than need our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies.
Proſperity ſometimes failed
them in the Event, and Prudence was
ſometimes wanting in the Enterprize;
but their Courage never failed, neither
in the Enterprize, nor in the Event.
There were no Adventures happened
to them, wherein their Valour was
not ſhewed forth. Kings are not
made Priſoners of War ſo long as
they remain in their Palaces: But if
any of them, in commanding their
Armies, do fall into the Hands of their
Enemies, who manage the War by
their Lieutenants, it is plain, that,
at the ſame Time they are vanquiſhed,
they have appeared more courageous
than their Conquerours. Such have
been the Princes from whom ſome
are deſcended, who have no reaſon to
bluſh for their Anceſtors, nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
in Reading their Hiſtory: They
are found in their proper Place, when
ſeated on their Throne: And that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56699:33"/>
they were altogether worthy of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
their Succeſſours, who have
ſince had better Fortune: Whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies
may raiſe in us a Compaſſion
for them, but will never cauſe us to
be aſhamed of them.</p>

And the Reaſons thereof.</head>
                  <p>AND as ſome Kings have been
always Valiant, ſo have their
Subjects never baſely degenerated from
the Principle of Courage. So that
we need not wonder, that Monarchy
hath preſerved it ſelf, during the
Courſe of ſo many Ages; and that ſhe
promiſeth her ſelf a Duration equal to
that of the Univerſe. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the Empire of the Ancient <hi>Perſians</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56699:33"/>
did not long ſubſiſt, becauſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> had
thoſe for his Succeſſors, which were
not worthy of him: They had more
of Vanity, than Valour: They moved,
indeed, with innumerable Armies, they
poured forth Soldiers by the Millions;
and, with a ridiculous Arrogance, vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that they would ſhovel Mountains
into the Sea, and lay Fetters upon the
Ocean; and yet, after all theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Cracks, they were beaten, ſunk and
chaſed by the little Republicks of <hi>Greece.</hi>
However, we may ſay that <hi>Darius,</hi> in
whom this Empire expired, was not
defective in Courage; but he had not
ſo much as his Enemy; ſeeing that,
though he was far ſtronger than he,
yet, nevertheleſs, he was ſurmounted
by him. When his famous Conqueror
was dead, without Children, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of his Captains became Kings:
One had <hi>Macedonia</hi> for his Part; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Syria;</hi> a Third, <hi>Egypt:</hi> But all
theſe blazing Sovereignties, not falling
into Hands ſtrong enough to ſuſtain
them, were ſoon extinguiſhed. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi>
the laſt King of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi>
was but the Seventh in Succeſſion from
<hi>Antigonus.</hi> The <hi>Seleucides,</hi> which had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56699:34"/>
                     <hi>Syria,</hi> continued no long Time. And the
<hi>Ptolemey's,</hi> whoſe Kingdom was the laſt
which was reduced to a Province, held
not <hi>Egypt</hi> above two Ages. Their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
came from a Defect of Valour.
<hi>Perſeus,</hi> of whom we have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
inſtead of ſhewing the Courage of
a King after his Defeat, carried himſelf
with ſo much Baſeneſs, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was aſhamed of
him when he came from the Battel;
apprehending that it would not be any
Glory for him to conquer ſuch a Man.
And when he ſaw him proſtrate himſelf
unworthily at his Feet, <hi>Ah!</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>Do not diſhonour my Victory.</hi> And yet,
this Carriage was leſs to be blamed (if
poſſible) than that of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> of the
Race of the <hi>Seleucides;</hi> to whom the
<hi>Romans</hi> ſent <hi>Popilius,</hi> to command him
to depart out of a Country, whereinto
he had entred with his main Army. So
ſoon as he ſaw the Ambaſſador a-far off,
going over his Camp, he humbly ſalutes
him: The Ambaſſador, with a Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
not to be endured, comes up to
him, without returning him any Salute,
and delivers him a Letter from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
<hi>Antiochus,</hi> after he had read it,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56699:34"/>
told him, <hi>He would deliberate upon whas
was to be done. Popilius</hi> preſently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Circle about this Prince, with a
Wand that he then had in his Hand,
ſaid to him; <hi>Deliberate if you will;
but before you go out of this Circle, I
expect your Anſwer.</hi> Here You may
behold a perfect Coward: A King,
who, in the midſt of his Army, had
received ſuch unworthy Carriage from
an <hi>Envoy;</hi> inſtead of being inſpired
with a juſt Indignation, conſulted only
his own Fears; and anſwered, <hi>He would
do what the</hi> Romans <hi>ſhould deſire of him.</hi>
As for <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> can any one be guilty of
a more ſordid and treacherous Action
than his, when he ſacrificed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>Infortunate</hi> to his infamous Politicks?
And the better to make his Court to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> makes him a Preſent of the Head
of <hi>Pompey.</hi> All theſe Princes, ſo little
worthy of their Sovereignty, did but
poſſeſs part of the Conqueſts of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander.</hi>
What became of <hi>Perſia,</hi> after
the Death of this great Monarch?
There were but two Diviſions made of
thoſe great Conqueſts; one by <hi>Perdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
and the other by <hi>Antipater.</hi> It
was in the ſecond Diviſion, that <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:56699:35"/>

the Army of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> Governor of
<hi>Media;</hi> and being alſo aſſured of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
it was the beſt Diviſion, ſeeing
that his Empire extended it ſelf from
the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea, even to the <hi>Indies.</hi> But
at laſt, all theſe Succeſſors of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and their Deſcendants, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to agree amongſt themſelves,
nor how to conquer one another, it
happened that, during their Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
a valiant <hi>Parthian,</hi> named <hi>Arſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
mounts the Throne, and became
the Founder of one of the moſt puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and illuſtrious Families that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
preſents to our Remembrance. This
Noble Family was not eclipſed (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were) with the Rays of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Splendor: She gave Kings to the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations; and inveſting her ſelf,
during ſo many Ages, with Sovereign
Power, was never the Subject, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Rival of that ambitious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.
Theſe were the Princes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Arſacides,</hi> from the Name of
their illuſtrious Founder; who created
ſo much Trouble to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and
abated their Pride, by the mortal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
he put upon them; as, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56699:35"/>
Death of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> the Flight of <hi>Mark
Anthony,</hi> and the Slaughters or Defeats
of many of their great Armies. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there was never any but <hi>Ventidius,</hi>
that triumphed over the <hi>Parthians:</hi> But
the <hi>Parthians</hi> have often triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Romans;</hi> though the Triumph
was a Ceremony altogether <hi>Roman,</hi> and
was not uſed amongſt the <hi>Greeks:</hi> And
it was their Fault they did not triumph
in State, ſince they gained ſo many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Advantages over thoſe haughty E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
And certainly, we may ſay,
the Valour of the <hi>Parthians</hi> gave Check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
to the Ambition of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
They hinder'd them from rendring
themſelves Maſters of the Univerſe, (as

Weakneſs meeting with an happy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
which it neither fore-ſaw, nor

and content our ſelves to ſay,
That Fortune doth that ſometimes,
and but very rarely, which Vertue doth
always, or, at leaſt, generally. It
is ſtoried, That a Painter throwing

hit upon that Stroak which he had been

but once: But it happens an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Number of Times, that we paint
that which we have a Fancy to, if we

So that this one Inſtance is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ſhews, we have no Reaſon to ſay, that
to the Drawing of Pictures, it is no

(though the contrary is generally true)
yet the Maxim doth not fail to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That Princes are obliged to be
valiant, for their Preſervation; and
that they ought to regard this Vertue,
as the Force of their Empire, and the

and the Character of thoſe that have
none, he will conclude, that Things
ought thus to come to paſs as they have
done; and he will divine (as one may
ſay) the Effects which Valour hath
produced in ſeveral Nations. Indeed,
he might thus argue; Either valiant
People have been overcome by thoſe
which have ſurpaſſed them in Prudence,
or by thoſe which were inferior to them
in Prudence, as well as in Courage. It
is plain, that they have not been van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
by the laſt; and it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that neither have they been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by the others; becauſe the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Prudence without Courage is
not to quarrel againſt Valour, but to
ſeek her own Repoſe and Security by
Submiſſion; and to preferr an humble
and quiet Obedience, before a reſtleſs
Liberty. Accordingly, he will find
this Maxim juſtified by Hiſtory; and
ſee a remarkable Example in the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
after they had degenerated from
the Courage of their Anceſtors; and
that the Poſterity of thoſe who had
conquered <hi>Perſia,</hi> made little or no
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56699:38"/>
Oppoſition againſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> They
had always the ſame Inclination to the
Arts, wherein they are ſtill excellent;
but they have none of that Valour left,
which had been their Buckler, and
their Rampart: And, inſtead of ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to break or ſhake off the Yoak,
they thought of nothing but to accuſtom
themſelves tamely to it: They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
their Wits in nothing ſo much,
as to flatter their Maſters, whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
they had drawn upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
They ſubmitted more than was
deſired of them; and from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleateſt
Liberty, which they once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
ſlipped into the moſt abject Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
They relate to us an Adventure
upon this Subject, which is fine enough:
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> ſometimes took pleaſure,
in his Marches, to appear under the
Name, and in the Equipage of that
Fabulous God, whom the <hi>Pagans</hi> made
to preſide over Wine and Good Cheer;
and who beſides, (ſay they) was a
great Conqueror, and that he pierced
even as far as the <hi>Indies.</hi> From whence
it came, that <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo affected to
imitate him. This <hi>Triumvir,</hi> who had
divided the Empire with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56699:38"/>
(for they had excluded <hi>Lepidus)</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
paſſed into <hi>Greece</hi> with an Army,
and appearing in this Dreſs that we
told you, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſent their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to him, ſignifying, that they
would acknowledge him to be the God,
whoſe Name he had taken upon him,
and whoſe Triumph he repreſented;
and that they came to offer him <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
the Patroneſs of their City, in
Marriage. <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> anſwered
them, That <hi>he accepted her for his
Bride: But, at the ſame Time, he added,
That ſince they would marry their Goddeſs
to him, he doubted not but that they would
be well pleaſed to pay him down Three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
for her Dowry.</hi> Certainly, they
were aſtoniſhed at the Succeſs of their
Flattery: But how great ſoever their
Surprize was, the Money muſt be found;
and the <hi>Athenians</hi> were forced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt
their Exchequer, to pay down
<hi>Minerva</hi>'s Marriage-Portion. There
are a Thouſand Examples of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
which were the Effects of that
ſordid Baſeneſs which the <hi>Graecians</hi> fell
into, by loſing the Courage of their
Anceſtors; and which, informing us of
the Character of Men when they have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56699:39"/>
Wit without Courage, confirm the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
we have been purſuing, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
the infallible Succeſs of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
I did not think it needful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
in this Diſcourſe, that we are to
ſuppoſe ſome Proportion between the
Forces: In Moral Diſcourſes, theſe ſort
of Suppoſitions muſt always be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and though they are not expreſly
contained, yet they are to be ſupplied
by an equitable Conſtruction. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
We know very well that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi>
were cut in pieces by the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> at the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Thermopylae:</hi>
But what could Three Hundred Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
do againſt an Army of more than
Ten Hundred Thouſand? They did all
that Men could do; they ſold their
Lives at a dear Rate, ſlew a vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Perſians,</hi> and put their Main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
into Diſorder; inſomuch that the
King of <hi>Sparta</hi> puſhed on to the very
Tent of <hi>Xerxes:</hi> But they fore-ſaw well
enough, that they ſhould be over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a Multitude: And they might
have ſaid then, what ſome have made
them ſay ſince, <hi>Diutius poſſunt perire,
quam nos vincere.</hi> We ſuppoſe then,
that there ſhould be amongſt the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56699:39"/>
either if not an entire Equality,
yet, at leaſt, ſome Proportion. If we
reſt upon this Foundation, the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that we have made, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be true; and we ſhall
find, that it is humanely impoſſible that
courageous People ſhould be ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by others; and that Valour ſhould
not render her ſelf Miſtreſs of the
World.</p>

                  <p>BUT we muſt dwell a little longer
upon theſe Conſiderations; which
ought to be the more agreeable to a

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56699:40"/>
pleaſed to apply Inclination to
Duty; and to do that by the free and

of <hi>Enemies,</hi> and of <hi>thoſe which are

into all others Eſteem and Reſpect.
The <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator never fought, but
with the Infantry; to let them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that Danger was equal to him,
with his Troops; and renouncing all
Poſſibility of a Retreat, he did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
his Thoughts between Conquering
and Fleeing, but between Victory or
Death. A <hi>Graecian</hi> Captain,
leading his Soldiers through
a very difficult Paſs,<note place="margin">Zenophon.</note> where
they were to climb a ſteep Hill, which
he had already gained, marching at the
Head of them, he exhorts them not to
be diſ-heartned at the Difficulties, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56699:40"/>
to do their beſt Endeavours to follow
him. He that was the foremoſt of
them, anſwered him: <hi>You ſpeak freely,
Sir; and to your own Sence: You are on
horſe-back, I am on foot; and beſides, I
carry a very heavy Buckler.</hi> The Captain
hearing this, a lights immediately from
his Horſe, gives the Soldier his Hand,
and carries his Buckler for him. This
ſoon wrought a wonderful Emulation
amongſt the reſt; who, when they
were got to the Top of the Hill, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
the Soldier for his Inſolence,
and conjured their Officer to give him
back his Buckler, and to mount his
Horſe. This Captain was not a Prince:
I leave You to conſider how paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Soldiers had been affected, if a
Sovereign had done ſuch an Action.
When a Soldier ſees that his Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
his Royal Perſon, this Sight
cannot but ſtrangely animate him, and
force from him ſuch Reflections as
theſe: <hi>Behold a Prince who hath a Crown
to loſe, and yet hazards his Life: Why
ſhould I then, who am but a Soldier of
Fortune, and who have no Eſtate but my
Sword; why, I ſay, ſhould I ſtudy to ſave
my inconſiderable ſelf, after ſo great an
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56699:41"/>
Example?</hi> As for his other Subjects,
who are not engaged in Military Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
they have alſo ſenſible Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which extreamly touch them:
They conſider they are at Eaſe and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
in their own Houſes, during the
Time that their Prince, to maintain
them in their Tranquility, undergoes
a Thouſand Fatigues, and is confronted
by a Thouſand Dangers: They think
with themſelves, that he is not obliged,
but that he may ſtay at home in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and enjoy his Royal Repoſe; but
yet he will command his Armies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and will not be diverted from this
Deſign, neither for the Hazards he
muſt run, nor for the Pains he muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.
It is impoſſible but that ſuch
Conſiderations, which are inſpired e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by common Sence, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to their Minds, and enter into
the Bottom of their Souls, and fill them
full with Love, Zeal and Gratitude for
the Perſon of their Sovereign. Who
does not preſently ſee the Effects which
the Valour of a Prince will produce in
the Spirits of his Allies, by their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in him? And in thoſe of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
by their Fears? The Principle
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56699:41"/>
we have ſetled upon the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Policy and Morality obligeth us
to believe, that Alliances between States
are rather founded upon Intereſts, than
any private Friendſhip: They never
ſeek for Alliances, but with thoſe who
are capable to ſerve, or to hurt them.
The Ancient <hi>Perſians</hi> knew well how to
make uſe of this Diſtinction: When an
Ambaſſador was ſent to them, from the
<hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> they entertained him
with another manner of Reception,
than the Envoys which came from the
other Republicks of <hi>Greece.</hi> What
ſhall we ſay of thoſe wonderful Effects
which the Reputation of valiant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
hath produced, and whereof Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
hath furniſhed us with ſuch a
Multitude of Examples? It has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a Thouſand Times, that their
very Names only have cauſed Forts to
be ſpeedily ſurrendred, which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have maintained a long Siege,
and have put to flight thoſe Armies
which had Forces ſufficient to have
overcome the Purſuers.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe who are neither Soldiers
nor Subjects, neither Allies nor Enemies
to a valiant Prince, they entertain the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56699:42"/>
Noiſe of his Renown, and the News of
his Exploits, with Admiration; they
have no Thoughts to engage in any
War againſt him, but rather to ſeek the
Aids of his Protection: They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of becoming his Enemies, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
nothing more, than to be his Allies.
Nay, they even wiſh ſometimes to be
his Soldiers, or his Subjects, that they
might participate of his Glory. They
offer up a Thouſand Vows to Heaven,
for ſuch a Prince of their own; and
when they cannot obtain one like him,
they are ſo far tranſported, as to wiſh
that he were their Maſter.</p>

in a War, be bound to
do it in Perſon.</head>
                  <p>IT is little to the purpoſe to ſay,
that the King may wage War by his
Lieutenants: For, beſides that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56699:42"/>
can ever be ſo well aſſured of the
Fidelity that others have for him, as
he is aſſured of the Fidelity that he has
for himſelf; the Prince is the Soul of
the Army; his Preſence is that <hi>Plaſtick</hi>
Power, which inſpires Life, Activity
and Vigour into them; ſo that nothing
in the World is able to compenſate ſo
great a Benefit. Farther, I know not
whether Sovereigns can be diſpenſed
with from this important Function;
and if they are not obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
their Armies in Perſon, when
they have not other weighty Reaſons to
the contrary. This Queſtion hath never
been ſtirred, but upon the Score of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy:
It concerns us here to treat of it
in the Moral Conſideration; either for
that if there lies an Obligation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
upon them, the Difficulty is
ſoon at an End, and there remains no
more Place for Politick Deliberations;
or be it, that this Reflection is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for the Proſecution of
our Subject. Indeed, If we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that a Prince is never obliged to
make War in Perſon, we may draw this
Conſequence then, That he is never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to be valiant. Our Religion gives
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56699:43"/>
us Light in this, which the <hi>Pagans</hi> had
not; it clearly diſcovers thoſe Truths
to us, which were unknown to them,
or which they knew but by ſome glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
Interviews, and of which they
never ſpake, but with Heſitancy. Two
Principles muſt be granted: Firſt, That
it is God who hath eſtabliſhed Kings.
The other is, That he hath eſtabliſhed
them to govern and defend the People.
We muſt alſo grant a Third Principle,
which is, That in all Profeſſions in the
World, from the loweſt to the higheſt,
when a Thing to be done is the End of
the Profeſſion, thoſe who are called to
thoſe Profeſſions are obliged to do it
themſelves; otherwiſe, Men will ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
off their Duties one to another, and
no one would mind his proper Buſineſs,
or (to uſe a more Chriſtian Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
<hi>follow his Vocation.</hi> Now, If it
be certain that God hath not raiſed up
Kings, but to govern and defend their
People; and if it is as certain, that
they are obliged to govern and defend
them by themſelves; then we muſt
grant, that in all important Occaſions
wherein they are to acquit themſelves
of this their Duty, they are obliged to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56699:43"/>
do it in Perſon. Let us add, to put an
End to this Argument, That there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be offered more important Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
than thoſe of War. Theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims
are of ſo great Truth, that if a
Sovereign, by his Preſence only, could
put a Stop to a Contagious Peſtilence,
which is ſometimes compared to War;
and by the Communications of its poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
Effluviums, hath frequently
made ſweeping Deſolations in the
World; he ought to expoſe himſelf
thereunto, and thereby to relieve the
publick Calamity of his Subjects; and
he is obliged to it, even by the Office
of his Sovereignty. But Kings are not
bred up Doctors; they cannot admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Medicines againſt the Plague:
There is need of Phyſicians to cure
their Bodies, and Spiritual Paſtors to
take care of the Salvation of their
Souls. Whereupon, we may ſay in
ſome manner, That as in a Time of
this Epidemical Diſtemper, although
the Biſhops ſubſtitute Church-men to
hold their Places, and to do their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
yet they are not left at liberty,
but at ſuch a Time they ought to viſit
in Perſon: And Non-reſidency is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56699:44"/>
So Princes, though they
may have able Captains in their Realms,
yet they are not therefore diſpenſed
with from making their Wars in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
But, to give a greater Light to
this Reflection, let us diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
three Sorts of Things, in reſpect
of the Actions of Kings: Thoſe which
he cannot do, but by himſelf: Thoſe
Things which he cannot do, but by
another: And thoſe Things which he
may do, either by himſelf, or others.
There is no Queſtion of thoſe Things
which he cannot do, but by himſelf,
that he is plainly obliged: Neither can
there be any Diſpute about ſuch Things
which he cannot do, but by another;
it is as plain, that therein he is diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with. So that the Difficulty reſts
only on thoſe Things which he may do,
either by himſelf, or by another. If
he will not do them himſelf, I demand,
Wherein conſiſts the Merit of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which he ought to render to
God, and of anſwering the End of his
Vocation? It is not in thoſe Things
which he cannot do, but by himſelf;
for he is conſtrained to do them, and
Neceſſity leaves him no Room for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56699:44"/>
Choice. On the other Side, I demand,
what are the Things a King cannot do,
but by himſelf? If we ſearch into the
Particulars, it will be hard to find any:
And we ſhall ſee, that it is almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to imagine any Thing in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a State, which the King (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſpeaking) may not devolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others. If it were then permitted
him to make uſe of this Liberty in its
utmoſt Extent, the Conſequence will
be, that he need never to take notice
of the Complaints of his Subjects, or
redreſs their Grievances; he need ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
adminiſter Juſtice, or paſs any Acts
of Grace himſelf; and, in a Word, he
may then reign always, and in all
Things, by another. What would
Kings ſay, if after they have nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one of their Subjects General of the
Army, and this Man ſhould only be <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Sit-ſtill</hi> at home, and chuſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to command the Troops in his
ſtead? Now, a Monarch is nominated
and appointed a General by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
of the World, <hi>the Lord of Hoſts:</hi>
He, in like manner, commits the ſame
Offence againſt God, when he will not
himſelf command in Perſon in his Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

Undertakings, but aſſigns to other
Hands all the Care and Conduct of the
War. This Opinion may, perhaps,
be thought ſingular, but it appears to
me to be rationally grounded, and I
am fully perſuaded of the Truth of it.
It is true, there may be ſome Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions;
as, If the Inteſtine Affairs of
the State require the Preſence of the
Prince at home; and that it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for him to be abſent, without
hazarding the Safety of his Kingdom.
But the greateſt of theſe Exceptions, is,
that of <hi>Offenſive Wars;</hi> there the Prince
is not obliged to command in Perſon,
becauſe he doth not then act in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his People: But ſince the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of his Subjects ought to be the
Aim of his Actions, the ſame Reaſon
which obligeth him to make War, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
him to do it in Perſon. But ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aſide that Exception, and ſome few
others, whereof a diſ-intereſted Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ought to be Judge, I believe, that
the actual Command of the Army is not
only the Glory, but the Duty of Kings;
and that they are thereunto obliged, by
an indiſpenſible Conſequence upon the
Sovereign Dignity.</p>

                  <p>VAlour is yet farther neceſſary for a

pleaſant. We ſhall eaſily underſtand
this Maxim, as a Conſequence of thoſe
we have already eſtabliſhed, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
it is very difficult for a Prince to
live happily, if he be not in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to live honourably, and to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
his own Security. The Principles
of Honour, which are impreſſed on the
Souls of Men, and above all, on thoſe
of Kings, are an inexhauſtible Source
of Joy to thoſe who comply with them,
and a continual Torment to thoſe who
are not conformable to them. A So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
is jealous of his Authority, and
hath Reaſon ſo to be, ſince it is God
who hath beſtowed it on him. But
when he is not able to ſupport his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
himſelf, this Jealouſie ſerves but to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56699:47"/>
torment him the more: He bemoans
his Deſtiny, either in publick, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate:
He finds, Fortune hath betrayed
him, in lifting him up; and he loves
not that Theatre, where he is obliged
to repreſent a Perſonage greater than
himſelf: His Crown is too heavy for
him, and his Throne is all ſtuck with
Thorns. Hence it is, that the Hearts
of Kings are crowded with Diſtruſts,
Terrours, Irreſolutions, and Angers,
which ſometimes burſt out into Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and their Griefs turn into Fury.
As they fear all Men, ſo they would
that all Men ſhould fear them; and
ſeeing they cannot render themſelves
venerable by their Vertue, they think
to appear terrible by their Vices. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
oftentimes hath much a-do to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel
theſe ſorts of Motives; thoſe
which are led by them, do not boaſt of
them; they palliate their Injuſtice and
Violences, under other Pretences; yet
however, their Artifices are not able to
prevent their Diſcovery. We know by
what Motives the <hi>Nero's</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitians</hi>
were acted, when they did rid
themſelves of the greateſt Perſonages
of their Time. We know, I ſay, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56699:47"/>
under Cowardly Princes, Impunity is
not always the Effect of Innocence;
and that oftentimes great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Merit paſſeth with them for a
Capital Crime. They are ſure to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a Conduct like that of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
the <hi>Oſtraciſm;</hi> and by a long
Exile, diſgraced the Glory of their
moſt famous Citizens, even at the ſame
Time that their Fidelity and Love for
their Country had rendred them illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious.
What Pleaſure or Repoſe can
a Prince enjoy, whoſe Soul is ruffled
with ſuch irregular Diſorders; hating
the loyaleſt of his Subjects, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the leaſt formidable of his Enemies?
It is then, his Imagination grows big,
and multiplies Dangers. The leaſt ill
News puts him into a Conſternation,
and is as mortal Alarms to him. A

a continual Series of Uneaſineſs. He is

                  <p>WE ſhall better underſtand how
this Vertue is neceſſary to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56699:48"/>
Repoſe of Princes, if we take the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it in the whole Extent, as the
Ancients did: They conſidered it, in
general, as the Force of the Soul, and
gave it really the Name of <hi>Force:</hi> By
which they underſtood, that this forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a Man with Aſſurance, not only in
reſpect of the Dangers of War, but of
all other Things which may be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Fear. When one of them tells
us, that the <hi>Cymbrians</hi> were hardy in
their Combats, and fearful in their
Sickneſs; and that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> on the
contrary, looked upon Death with
Horrour in a Field of Battel, but wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it with Reſolution in their Beds;
this Philoſopher ſpeaking after this
manner, lets us know, that the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of both theſe Nations was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
We cannot make a better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Sentiments they had of
Valour, than by the Definitions they
have given of it. What is Valour? <hi>It
is</hi> (ſaith an Ancient) <hi>a voluntary and
conſiderate Reſolution to expoſe ones ſelf to
Dangers, and to undergo Hardſhip. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo
eſt conſiderata periculorum ſuſceptio,
&amp; laborum perpeſſio. Valour</hi> (ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>is the Purſuit we make after a ſolid
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56699:49"/>
Advantage, through Dangers and Labours
which we muſt ſurmount in the Acqueſt of
it. Fortitudo eſt contemptio laboris &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculi,
cum ratione utilitatis, &amp; compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
commodorum.</hi> One Sect of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
alſo defined this Vertue after
this manner: <hi>Fortitudo eſt ratio negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae
mortis, perpetiendique doloris. Valour
is that which enables us to ſuffer Pain, and
deſpiſe Death.</hi> In fine, all others have
ſpoke to the ſame Sence: And I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
You, without fear of abuſing You
in this Point, that there is not one of
them which hath limited Valour to the
Dangers of War only. We have two
Reflections here to make: The Firſt is,
That the Word which generally enters
into their Definitions, and which they
joyn with that of Danger, doth equally
ſignifie Labour and Pain, becauſe they
follow the Ideom of the <hi>Greek</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
which, although it be very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
uſeth one and the
ſame Word to expreſs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Labour.<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Conſideration, which we muſt not
forget, is, to take notice that the <hi>Idaea's</hi>
which they formed of Valour, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:56699:49"/>
who, in truth, had received them from
the Principles of the <hi>Academy;</hi> who
having diſtinguiſhed divers Faculties
in the Soul of Man, he there placed
(or gave Leave to his excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators
to do it) the four Vertues:
Prudence in the Underſtanding, Juſtice
in the Will, Valour in that which they
call Iraſcible, and Temperance in the
other. Now, it is certain, that <hi>Ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcible</hi>
doth not only reſpect Military
Dangers, but it has for its Object all
the Rancounters of this Life, either ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
painful, or difficult. According to
theſe Principles, the Ancients attribute
the very ſame Epithets of Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the two <hi>Scipio's,</hi> to <hi>Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and <hi>Aemylius,</hi> for having ſupported
great Afflictions, as well as for winning
of Battels. And they give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that if <hi>Marius</hi> did exerciſe his
Courage in the midſt of Arms, he alſo
exerciſed the ſame Courage, when he
endured a violent Operation of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery,
without complaining; and in
the midſt of exquiſite Pains, remained
firm and unmoveable. I ſee we have
much a-do to bend our Language to
this Sence: We do not ſay, a Man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56699:50"/>
Affliction valiantly; but we ſay,
he ſuffers it with Conſtancy. It mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not for Words, provided we agree
upon Things. In this Notion of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
comprizing an Undauntedneſs in
Battels, and a ſteady Reſolution in all
the other Accidents of Life, Princes may
be informed of a Character which is
very becoming of, and expedient for
them. If they do not keep up this
Force and Aſſurance of Mind, they will
be injurious to themſelves on many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions:
They will not be able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Glory of their Exploits in their
other Actions; but, in many Things,
will diſcover, that they are tainted with
the low Opinions and Errours of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Souls: It will appear, that they
were raiſed, not by their Vertue, but
their Fortune: In ſhort, There will
many Occaſions happen, where their
Weakneſs will betray their Dignity.
It is Admiration, and not Pity, that
the Grandeur of Kings calls for. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more undecent, than to ſhed
Tears upon a Throne; nothing is ſo
contemptible, as a puling Sovereign.
Monarchs ought not to appear intimida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Creſt-fallen, or ſurprized: They
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56699:50"/>
ſhould ſettle their Minds in ſuch a fixed
State, as not to ſtand in need of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation;
or if they do need it, they
ought to ſeek for it (as one once ſaid)
<hi>in the Boſom of the Commonwealth.</hi> When
a Prince is of this Diſpoſition, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
his Life truly eaſie; and finds not
only Repoſe, but Joy, in the midſt of
Labours: It ſweetens the Bitterneſs of
Adventures, though never ſo vexatious;
it turns all the Thorns of the Crown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fragrant Flowers. I thought it my
Duty, not to forget theſe Reflections in
this Diſcourſe, although it was deſigned
particularly to conſider Valour in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Profeſſion of War; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
if I conformed my ſelf to our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Way, yet I am not very far wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
from the Maxims of the Ancient
Moraliſts. In ſhort, Thoſe who have
handled Valour in the largeſt Extent,
yet will be ſure to inform us, that Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Courage is the principal Part of
it; and that it ſhines brighteſt, above
all, in the Occaſions of War, where
the moſt apparent Dangers reign ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,
and which are big with Things
moſt capable to inſpire Fear. So that
Valour, above all, relates to War, as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56699:51"/>
War does to Fighting, which is the
End of the Functions of that Diſcipline.
The <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers were never idle,
they underwent more Pains than the
moſt laborious Mechanicks; and by
this Means they arrived at thoſe great
Performances, the Memory and Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
whereof aſtoniſh us at this Day:
But they laboured as Soldiers, not as
Mechanicks; and never quitted the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Character. Hence it was, that
<hi>Corbulon</hi> was ſo ſevere, that he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Soldier with Death, becauſe he
was carrying Earth without having his
Sword on. Hence it was, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of Fighting never ceaſed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Military Oath was altogether
broken; whereas before they might
have been diſcharged from other Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.
To underſtand this well, we
muſt remember, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had
two ſorts of <hi>Conge's</hi> or <hi>Diſmiſſion</hi> from
the Wars: One which they called <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio;</hi>
and that permitted the Soldiers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
to quit the Wars, and to return
to their own Homes: The other they
called <hi>Exauctoratio;</hi> which diſpenſed
with the Soldiers from their Military
Employments, but ſtill they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56699:51"/>
not to be far diſtant from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
Thoſe who had this ſort of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
lived out of the Precincts of the
Camp; they lived after what manner
they pleaſed, ſo long as they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
actually to do againſt the Enemy;
but when Occaſion preſented it ſelf,
they joyned with the other <hi>Roman</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
who lodged in the Camp, and all
engaged together in the Battel.</p>

                  <p>'TIS from this Relation that Valour
hath to War, and War to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
that the nobleſt Games have, in all
Times, been the Repreſentations of
that Profeſſion, and of this Vertue.
There was never any Thing ſo celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the World, as the <hi>Olympian</hi>
Games; there uſed to be a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of all <hi>Greece;</hi> and he who won
the Prize, not only made his Entrance,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56699:52"/>
as it were, in Triumph into the Town
where he was born, but he had this
farther Honour done him, that the
Year of his Victory bore his Name;
for the Annals were directed after this
manner, <hi>The Year wherein ſuch an one
was Victor in the</hi> Olympick <hi>Games, it
happened that</hi>—We cannot doubt but
that the Repreſentations of Valour and
War were very lively in the Solemnities
of theſe Games. 'Twas for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that, after they were ended, there
appeared a War-horſe in the midſt of
the Courſe. One of the Ancients hath
obſerved, that for the ſame Reaſon the
Exerciſe of Wreſtling always went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that of Running; becauſe Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
repreſents the hot Engagement of
the Fight, as the Race repreſents the
Purſuit. The <hi>Romans,</hi> that their <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacula</hi>
might the better reſemble War,
would have them all to be dangerous
and bloody; not only in the private
Combats of the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> but alſo in
thoſe they called the <hi>Naumachies,</hi> which
were the Repreſentations of <hi>Sea-Fights.</hi>
The moſt famous of all was that which
was given them by the Emperor <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius:</hi>
They filled an immenſe Space
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56699:52"/>
with Water, which repreſented the
Sea, and cauſed an Hundred Ships to
be floating thereon, which were Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Twenty Thouſand Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
or (as one may ſay) Slaves of
Torment. This Multitude, thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to kill one another, might
have been capable of acting ſtrange
Things, had they once turned their
Deſpair againſt the Spectators: But to
prevent ſuch an Attempt, this artificial
Lake was hemm'd in with another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and over thoſe Troops, ranged
in Battalia, ſat the Emperor and his
Courtiers, in the higheſt Places of the
Amphitheatre. Then the Signal was
given, and theſe Hundred Ships, being
divided into two Fleets, came to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and entred into a ſtiff and bloody
Engagement. We muſt confeſs, theſe
Sights were very inhumane; the Lives
of Men are too precious to be ſported
away, and to be ſacrificed to a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Princes have wiſely renounced
theſe ſorts of Pleaſures; and thoſe
which they have retained are purely
military. Hunting is a kind of War:
The Carouſels, Tilts and Tournaments
are the Images of Combats: The Shews
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56699:53"/>
in the Theatre have ſomething of this,
and commonly act ſome Hero, who
hath been famous for Valour. Beſides,
in the moſt profound Peace, the Prince
appears in the Equipage of War; he is
ſurrounded with his Troops of Guards;
thoſe with whom he frequently conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
are the Officers which command
them; they exerciſe their Soldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Face; they every Day demand
the Word of him; they daily render
him an Account of their Functions, and
entertain him with nothing ſo much,
as what relates to their own Profeſſion.
When he makes a Journey, it is rather
the March of an Army, than a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs:
The Order they then obſerve
is not much different from the Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Diſcipline. The Entries which he
makes into the Towns, are like to the
<hi>Intradoes</hi> of a Conqueror; they ſalute
him by the Mouths of their Canons,
and whole Vollies complement his Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
they erect Triumphal Arches
for him, and ſtrew his Way with Palms
and Lawrels. Thus the Fortune of a
Prince continually advertiſeth him, that
he ought to be valiant; inſomuch, that
if he fail in this Vertue, he can take no
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56699:53"/>
Pleaſure in any Thing about him; and
ſo, not taking any Pleaſure, he muſt
needs be miſerable.</p>

and Repreſentations of Valour,
without loving Valour it ſelf, he will
be always deprived of the Joy that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
this Vertue. Every Vertue is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a Pleaſure which is
peculiar and proper to it: and if ſhe
meets ſometimes with Thorns, yet ſhe
never fails to crown her ſelf with
Flowers; and her Actions are all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of themſelves, or, to uſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of ſome of the Ancients on
this Argument, voluptuous. All the
Philoſophers have owned this for a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56699:54"/>
Truth; not excepting thoſe, whoſe
Maxims were the moſt cried down.
One cannot do a greater Injury to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
than in eſtabliſhing Pleaſure to be
the End of Man: Yet notwithſtanding,
thoſe Perſons who ſpeak after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
will give us leave to ſearch for
Pleaſure in the Exerciſes of Valour.
According to this Principle, generally
acknowledged, true Liberality in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing
her Gifts, never ſuſtains Loſs;
ſhe pays her ſelf by her own Hands, in
procuring the Pleaſure which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth;
and though ſhe may meet with
ungrateful Wretches, (which are but
too common in the World) yet ſhe
ſees they do themſelves the Wrong,
and is ſorry for them, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of them. One may ſay the
ſame of all the other Vertues: Valour
is that which hath the moſt ſenſible
Pleaſure; and which triumphs not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the greateſt Majeſty, but with
the moſt affable Gentleneſs. Nature,
or rather Providence, will have it ſo,
to ſweeten the Labours of a Vertue the
moſt painful; and to keep us from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſcouraged at the Sight of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
which accompany it, and the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56699:54"/>
Dangers which ſurround it. But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Morality furniſheth us with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Inſtance on this Subject: She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
Martyrdom under the Notion
of Valour; and conſiders them who
have ſuffered, as Champions, or as
Heroes, victorious over Pain and Death.
The Firſt Fruits of the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
never appear ſo viſible, as in the
Martyrs; who went to the Dens,
Stakes and Gibbets with a ſmiling
Countenance, and who felt Tranſports
of Joy in the midſt of their Torments.
Although they frequently received ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Aſſiſtances from Almighty
God, yet let us not doubt, but that the
inward Satisfaction of Soul which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
vertuous Actions, did contribute
much to this their Behaviour. But now,
to ſpeak here only of Military Valour,
I believe I ought not to forget what
one once ſaid of Valour, That it was
the only Vertue which had a kind of
<hi>Fury</hi> with it. And it is remarkable,
that thoſe Things to which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
have attributed Fury, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with greater Pleaſure than
all others. Poeſie is of this Number:
We muſt grant, that this is that Part
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56699:55"/>
of Learning, which is ſweet and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
We may ſay, in a manner, that
Valour is amongſt the Vertues, as Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
is amongſt the Sciences: She has her
Inſpirations, and her Enthuſiaſms too:
She elevates and ſoars above Nature it
ſelf. And, indeed, doth there not
ſeem ſomething more than humane in
the famous <hi>Camillus,</hi> who was called
the Second Founder of <hi>Rome;</hi> who,
when his Thigh was pierced with an
Arrow, he wreſted it out of the Wound
himſelf; and after this, as if he had
been cured on the ſudden, or that he
never minded it, he falls upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and continues the Battel? <hi>Braſidas</hi>
the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> did ſomething more;
he not only drew out the Dart which
had entred his Body, but revenged his
Wound by the Death of his Enemy that
gave it. It is reported, that two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
being engaged, there happened an
Earthquake where the Field of Battel
was, and the Soldiers perceived it not;
as if they all had been under an <hi>Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mind,</hi> and were (as we may ſay)
poſſeſſed with the <hi>Daemon</hi> of War; it
was not poſſible for them to regard any
other Thing than the Action they were
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56699:55"/>
engaged in, and the Means of carrying
the Victory.</p>
                  <p>There are yet other Reaſons of this
extraordinary Pleaſure, which Valour
beſtows upon thoſe who follow her Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes,
and practiſe the Exerciſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Firſt, The Grandeur of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which ſhe produceth; as, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Towns and Provinces, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion

in a Word, the <hi>Cataſtrophe's</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
upon the Theatre of War, where
we not only ſee Men who repreſent
<hi>Kings,</hi> but where <hi>Kings</hi> themſelves are
<hi>Actors.</hi> Beſides, Vertues are agreeable
and pleaſant, in that they make us vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
either over others, or over
our ſelves: Over our ſelves, in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
our Paſſions; over others, in
abhorring the bad Examples, or in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
us above the Good. All the
Victories of the other Vertues are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
in Compariſon to thoſe of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
which ſhews that ſhe muſt be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs

ſince that, maugre their Counſel, ſhe

all Things. She not only keeps at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Examples of Cowards,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56699:56"/>
but her very Preſence puts them to
flight; and forcing the Reſiſtance of
others, ſhe reaps thoſe Advantages,
whereof our Eyes are Witneſſes. In
ſhort, ſhe opens a large Field to all the
other Vertues, and furniſheth us with a
copious Argument to exerciſe Juſtice,
Liberality, Clemency and Moderation
on: Inſomuch that the Pleaſures which
accompany them being joyned together,
the Reſult is a Joy, the greatneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                     <hi>PLutarch</hi> ſaith, there is a great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between valiant Men. If
he makes this Difference to conſiſt in
the Degree, that they are more or leſs
valiant, there is nothing of Difficulty
in it: Or if he underſtands it of the
Manner of making War, we ſhould ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
apprehend his Senſe. But he doth
not mean ſo neither. He placeth this
Difference in the Valour it ſelf; and he
alledgeth the Example of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> and
<hi>Epaminondas,</hi> as of two Men valiant to
the higheſt Pitch: But they were not ſo
after the ſame manner. In the mean
Time, Morality teacheth us, that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is one and the ſame; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
it muſt be ſaid, that between
two valiant Men, conſidered purely as
valiant, there is rather a Reſemblance,
than any Oppoſition. To give a true
Senſe then to the Maxim of <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
it is neceſſary that we ground it upon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56699:57"/>
the Circumſtances which ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
Valour. The Example of
theſe two Men which he propounds,
leads us naturally to this Explication.
<hi>Epaminondas</hi> was a Perſon of a ſincere
Probity; and his Valour was animated
by this Motive. On the other ſide, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi>
ſacrificed all to his Ambition;
and, the better to accompliſh his Ends,
never examined whether the Means
were juſt, or unjuſt. This appears,
not only by the Conduct of his whole
Life, but by an Expreſſion that fell
from him once, at <hi>Pericles</hi>'s Houſe,
whither he went to give him a Viſit:

and Slaughter. Peace is a Thing which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56699:59"/>
is abſolutely good: War is not ſo, but
upon certain Conditions. War (I ſay)
ought to be conſidered as a Remedy
which we ought not to make uſe of,
but in Caſes of the laſt Extremity, and
which tends to the Preſervation or (as
we may ſay) the Health of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

the violent Operations of Chirurgery,
which makes Application of Knives
and Fire to the Body of Man; but
they are not deſigned to torment him,
but to cure him. Farther, Faith ought
to be kept. We know not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the Perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> at
the Battel of <hi>Thraſymene:</hi> After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
won a Victory over the <hi>Romans,</hi>
whoſe General was ſlain upon the Place,
he perceived a Body of the Infantry,
of Six Thouſand Men, who had gained
an advantageous Fort, and that it was
difficult to force them: He ſent to
them to ſurrender; and, indeed, they
did ſurrender upon Terms; but, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of performing what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,
they had no ſooner laid down
their Arms, but he put them all to the
Edge of the Sword. The Stratagem

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56699:59"/>
                     <hi>Cannae</hi> was not altogether ſo unjuſt;
yet I have heard him condemned for it
by ſome Perſons, who, without doubt,
will be thought too nice and ſcrupulous
by Men of the Sword: He ſent Five

Terentius Varro,</hi> as being willing to

                  <p>VAlour is then rather worthy of
Blame than Praiſe, when ſhe is
not accompanied with Juſtice: She
then loſeth her Merit, and her Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
ſhe degenerates from the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of her Original, and ſowres into a

of carrying out the Spirit of a

and commendable Actions, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
or rather bewilders him by the

Fear, Contempt, and Averſion:
And we are ſo far from chuſing ſuch to
be our Guides, that we ſtand upon our
Guard againſt their Advices, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
them as dangerous Shelves and
Snares. Valour is no leſs ſtrangely
changed, when ſhe is allied to Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
ſhe forfeits all her Reputation
by ſuch contagious Company, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of attracting Men's Vows and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
ſhe extorts their Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Imprecations. We may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to Valour the Saying of a Prince,
concerning Conſtancy; who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that ſome Perſons guilty of
the fouleſt Enormities endured the
Rack with incredible Reſolution, <hi>Theſe
Men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>muſt needs be impudent
Sinners, who employ ſo good a Thing as
Conſtancy, to ſhore up their evil Actions.</hi>
We do not therefore call them valiant,
who devote their Courage to Injuſtice;
and inſtead of oppoſing Violence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it; and being obliged to ſerve as
<hi>Aſylums</hi> and Protectors of the Innocent,
become their Enemies and Perſecutors.
If the Out-braving of Perils, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56699:61"/>
of Death, muſt needs merit the
Name of Valiant, then we may allow
it to thoſe unhappy Wretches, who
not only deſpiſe Death, but ſeek for
it; and being ſeized with the Exceſs
of Deſparation, or a Tranſport of
Frenzy, lay violent Hands on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and become their own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.
It appears by this, that the
Actions of Heroes require ſomething
more, than to expoſe a Man's ſelf to
Danger, and the Contempt of Death
it ſelf: Though that ſeems to be the
Heighth of Courage, yet it is not true
Valour; at leaſt, it is no part of the
Motive wherewith it ought to be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated;
that is, the preferring the
Senſe of true Honour before our own
Lives. According to theſe Principles,
though the Saying of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
when to one who demanded of
him how he came to perform ſuch
great Exploits, he anſwered, <hi>It was by
deſpiſing Death:</hi> Yet, not to abuſe this
noble Thought, it is neceſſary that we
add another Saying of <hi>Cato</hi> the Elder;
who tells us, In the Perils of War, he
<hi>makes a great Difference between thoſe that
love Vertue, and thoſe who are weary of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56699:61"/>
their Lives.</hi> Indeed, it muſt be the
Love of Vertue that animates Valour,
and the principal Wheel that puts it
into its due Motions. Zeal for Juſtice
ought not only to be the Pretence, but
the Cauſe of War: And a Prince is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to have the ſame Motive in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
his Enemies by his Arms, as in
arraigning Offenders by his Laws; for
his Enemies are looked upon as convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Criminals, the Declaration of War
is their Sentence of Condemnation;
and becauſe this Sentence cannot be ſo
eaſily executed as the others, he ſends
his Armies to be his Sheriffs and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.
And the ſame Effect which
the Puniſhment of a private Criminal
hath on a Nation, the Puniſhment of a
Nation hath on the Univerſe; or, as

the World.</p>

ſome Men there are in the World,

in the fixed Humour whereinto this

Minds, they are not capable to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſed
by Reaſons, they ought to be

is the moſt famous amongſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
for Vertue purely Humane.
St. <hi>Lewis</hi> is the moſt renowned amongſt
all Kings, for Chriſtian Piety. They
were both very valiant. St. <hi>Lewis</hi> was
the firſt that deſcended from Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the ſight of the
Enemy; he fought with incredible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy
in that Fight, where he loſt his
Liberty: And, during his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56699:62"/>
he diſcovered ſuch a noble Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Mind, that the Prince of the
Barbarians being near Death, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
that they had for the Vertue
of their generous Captive, put them
upon Deliberation whether they ſhould
not chuſe him for their Sovereign. As
for <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> he ended his Days
in an Expedition in <hi>Almaigne:</hi> He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
all the Duties of a Soldier,
and a Captain; and had made great
Advances, if he had not been ſurprized
by Death. The Example of this Prince,
and that of his Son, do well demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
that Juſtice is ſerviceable to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
inſtead of being prejudicial to
it; and that that Courage which is not
founded in the Love of Vertue, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to great Diſorders. <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> had been
carefully educated by his Father, with
all the Exactneſs imaginable: This E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
was in him joyned with an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
Birth; he had a vaſt Genius;
he was ſtrong, dexterous, and of a
good Mind; and nothing was wanting
to make him a great Prince, but his
Will to be ſo. His Father had no
ſooner rendred up his Life, but he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56699:63"/>
thinks of nothing more than returning
to <hi>Rome,</hi> though one might have well
repreſented to him, that <hi>Rome</hi> was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where where the Emperor was. He
abandons an aſſured Victory, and patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Prince, full of Vigour, who, to wind
himſelf out of the Fatigues of War,
eſchews an Enterprize, to which the
Memory of his Father, and his own

the Military Employment, ſince he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

even in the actual Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
he wears a Sword by his Side.
But the Ancients did not determine of
Things after this Rule. Amongſt
them, the Charge of <hi>Conſul,</hi> that of

that there were ſome that, in a

the Camp; and, after having heard
Cauſes pleaded, and been Pleaders
themſelves, were ſent to command,
and to fight, in the Army. <hi>Fabritius</hi>
was a Man of an undaunted Spirit:
Both the <hi>Cato's</hi> were exceeding valiant:
And the ſame Juſtice which reſtrained
them from ſuffering their Judgments to
be corrupted, excited them not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

We find the like Examples in

'Tis true, he never commanded the

                  <p>AS it is an important Thing, (SIR)
for thoſe who are deſtined to
command Armies, to know to what
Point they may extend this Command;
and becauſe You purpoſe Your ſelf to
learn under the Orders of the King,
Your Father, who teacheth the Art of
Conquering, and of being victorious;
we muſt not forget to remark in this
Diſcourſe, what is the Extent of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Obedience. It hath ſometimes
been a Queſtion, Whether Juſtice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
a Soldier to deliver up himſelf to
a certain and inevitable Death, when
his Commander puts him upon it.
Some anſwer to this, Firſt, That it is
very difficult to find any Caſe ſo deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but that there may be ſome poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of eſcaping: For, after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he threw
himſelf into the City of the <hi>Oxydra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:</hi>
And after that, of <hi>Horatius Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:56699:65"/>
who ſingly ſtopped an Army of
Enemies, till the Bridge was broken
down, and then, all wounded as he
was, leaped with his Arms into <hi>Tyber,</hi>
and ſaved himſelf by ſwimming. There
hardly ſeems a Danger ſo viſible, and
ſo preſſing, where a Man may not ſee
ſome Glimmerings of Hope. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we ſhould take this Suppoſition
in the Extent of its Rigour, yet we
ought not to doubt, but that a Soldier,
who hath received his Commands, muſt
follow the Orders given him, though
it were certain, that in the executing
it, or in the endeavouring to do it, it
would coſt him his Life. The ſame
Principle which wills us to hazard Life
for the Preſervation of Honour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to ſacrifice it for the ſame
Reaſon; ſince if Honour were not
more valuable than Life, we ſhould not
only not ſacrifice it for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Honour, but ſhould not think
it needful to hazard it. Beſides, a
private Man is in reſpect of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
as a Member is in reſpect of the
Body: And it happens ſometimes, that
for the Preſervation of the Body, we
not only apply painful Remedies to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56699:66"/>
Part affected, but we wholly cut it off.
This Reaſoning is confirmed by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
As, by that of <hi>Leonidas;</hi> who,
with his Three Hundred <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi>
(as we have mentioned in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)
being at the Streights of <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopylae,</hi>
to oppoſe the greateſt Army
that ever was; when he knew that
this dreadful Army was ready to fall
upon him, ſaith he to his Soldiers,
<hi>Come, my Friends, let us dine now; we
ſhall ſup in the other World.</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Hiſtory relates an Action very
like this, and of an equal Number
of Men, in the War againſt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians.</hi>
But if ſome will inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to accompliſh a Victory? A like Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
to this hath been propounded, in
reference to Friendſhip: They demand,
If a Man being charged by his Friend
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56699:67"/>
to do a Thing, whether he be obliged
preciſely to keep cloſe to that which
was preſcribed him; or whether he
may take another Courſe; when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
knows, that by this Means he
ſhall farther ſerve his Friend, who hath
put his Concerns into his Hands? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have thought, that he may do it:
But, in the mean Time, they give us
theſe two Cautions: Firſt, To ſee if
the Courſe which we ſteer, and which
we preferr before the other, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
ſo much over that which we have
Orders to follow, that this Advantage
be ſo conſiderable, as to make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
for the Liberty we give our
ſelves to forſake the Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of a Friend, in his proper Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts.
They adviſe us alſo to take care
with whom we have to do: For if we
ſhould have to do with a ſtiff and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited
Perſon, wholly abounding in
his own Senſe, he will neither take our
good Intentions, nor our good Succeſs,
for Reaſon; but, on ſuch Occaſions,
interprets all ſorts of Addreſſes, as
Shifts to cover unfaithfulneſs: Then
we muſt ſerve him according to his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and not run the Risk of loſing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56699:67"/>
his Friendſhip. Some have extended
this Queſtion to the Commands which
we receive from our Superiors; in
which we muſt affirm, that the ſecureſt
Way is, not to ſet up ones ſelf as an
Umpire of their Will; and that there
happen very few Occaſions, where he
may be allowed to paſs the Limits of a
blind Obedience. <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> who
ſometimes makes Remarks particular
enough upon Things of Antiquity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
how that <hi>Craſſus</hi> going into <hi>Aſia</hi>
with his Army, and being deſirous to
beſiege a Place, ſtood in want of a
long and ſtrong Beam, to make one of
thoſe Engines which the Ancients called
<hi>Baleares,</hi> Battering-Rams, and with
which they uſed to batter Towns: He
paſſing by <hi>Athens,</hi> took notice of a Beam
which was in the Gate, and which he
believed would exactly fit his purpoſe;
he wrote to the Architect of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
to ſend it to him. The Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
who was an able Artiſt, knowing
for what Deſign he intended it, ſent
him another, which he judged moſt
proper for his purpoſe. <hi>Craſſus</hi> calls
him before him, and demanded of him,
Why he did not exactly follow his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56699:68"/>
Whatever Reaſon the Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to juſtifie himſelf, he cauſed him
to be puniſhed in the ſight of his Army.
Behold one who was rigorous to Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
We may ſay, this <hi>Roman</hi> uſed
him as he would have dealt with a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
who had diſobeyed his Orders;
and that he purſued the Severity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Diſcipline. Indeed, in War we
muſt obey punctually: And when Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are given out, nothing can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
with the Obligation we have to
ſubmit to them. This Maxim is ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
firſt upon this, That we ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to do a poſitive Evil, for any Good
that may happen thereby: And Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in Matters of Diſcipline is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
Crime. On the other ſide, We
muſt keep up this Rigour to the heighth,
otherwiſe, the Conſequence would be
dangerous, if by one ſingle Exception,
we ſhould open a Door to Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and if we ſhould give place to
imagine, that there are Reaſons, after
a General hath given his Orders, which
will leave one at liberty to follow, or
not to follow them. The Notions which
the <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophers had of Valour,
accords very well with this Principle.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56699:68"/>
Through all the Extent of Morality,
they referr the Deſign of Things to
Prudence, the Diſtribution to Juſtice,
and the Execution to Valour. Seeing
then, the proper Office of Valour is to
execute, ſhe muſt be content with her
own Function; and may always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that there have been Conſults
enough preparatory for her; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that ſhe is not anſwerable for the
Miſcarriages of Deliberations. Other
Authors, to ſhew the Connexion of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
have eſtabliſhed this for a Maxim,
That an Action can never be vertuous,
if it be not done with Diſcretion, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Moderation, and Reſolution: And
according to this Proſpect, they have
aſſigned to every Vertue a general Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
as, Diſcretion to Prudence, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Juſtice, Moderation to Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Reſolution to Valour. We
have no need to examine this Principle,
in all its Circumſtances: It is enough
for this Reflection, that ſince Reſolution
is the Character of Valour, a Soldier
muſt give Teſtimony of it, in keeping
himſelf indiſpenſably tied to Diſcipline,
and in never ſtarting aſide from the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Military Obedience.</p>

                  <p>I Thought it needful here to touch
that Scruple ſo weakly grounded,
which makes ſome Men believe, that
the Military Profeſſion ſtands condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

but to be contented with their

no Subject of Doubt, as there may be

conſiſts in this; Whether Anger be
forbidden in Battels, as a Paſſion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
evil: Or whether it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

This laſt Opinion hath prevailed; the

there are commendable Deſires, wiſe
Fears, and innocent Joys and Sorrows,
ſo there are lawful Angers; and in juſt

In what manner we are to behave

                  <head type="sub">Neceſſary Reflections upon
Raſhneſs.</head>
                  <p>WHen Valour is regulated by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
ſhe is far enough from
Raſhneſs. For, if a Prince be prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
of his Life, he is unjuſt to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and he ought ſometimes to regard
Temerity under this Notion: For, if it
be conſidered as a piece of Injuſtice, it
appears more condemnable, than if it
be conſidered but as a piece of Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
That a Prince therefore may
not become guilty of raſh Actions, he
ought to have ſomething elſe in his Eye
beſides Perils; becauſe one muſt not
ſeek out Dangers for Danger's ſake.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56699:70"/>
And if one do expoſe himſelf to the
Hardſhips of War, it is not ſimply to
expoſe himſelf, and no more; but for
the avoiding of ſome eminent Damage,
or the obtaining ſome great Advantage.
The Action of a Prince then ought to
have this End, <hi>viz.</hi> A Reference to the
Succeſs of his Arms, which is poſſible,
important, and conformable to his
Rank. He fails in the firſt Condition,
which is Poſſibility, if he does as <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi>
did, when he threw himſelf
from the Top of the Walls, into an
Enemy's City: For, Could he pretend
to take it alone! He fails to obſerve
the ſecond Condition, which is Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
if he doth as the ſame Prince
did, when, during the Siege of <hi>Tyre,</hi>
he drew out a ſmall Detachment of his
Army, for I know not what Expedition
againſt the <hi>Arabians;</hi> which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſary for him, nor worthy of
him. It is our next Buſineſs to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that an Action may be poſſible and
important, and yet not be proper to
the Quality of him that would execute
it. Nothing is more poſſible, than to
gain Forts by ſpringing of Mines; and
ſometimes nothing is more important,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56699:71"/>
than to uſe thoſe Means; but we muſt
not thence conclude, that the King
ought to go himſelf to lodge the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I ſee it would be impoſſible to
enumerate the particular Things which
are fit to be acted by a Prince, in the
Wars; and which are not ſo: But it
ſeems to me, that we may eſtabliſh this
as a general Maxim, That a Prince
ought not to expoſe himſelf to Danger,
but in ſuch Actions where his Command
is requiſite. If he knows a Fort well,
it is, to ordain in what manner it ſhall
be beſieged: If he viſit the Trenches,
it is there alſo to diſpoſe his Orders:
And if he appear in Battel, it is not
there chiefly to imbrue his Sword in
the Blood of ſome Soldiers; for the
killing of three or four Men is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to turn a Battel; but it is here
he ought to have his Eyes move through
the whole, to ſhoot his Orders and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
every where, and to be as the
Soul to his whole Army. We diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between two ſorts of Temerity;
one a particular, the other a general
Raſhneſs: One conſiſts in the hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our ſelves, upon Occaſion, againſt
the Rules of Military Prudence; the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56699:71"/>
other is, when we engage in a War far
above our Force, or without being well
prepared; as they ſay <hi>Caeſar</hi> did in his
Wars againſt <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Some diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
alſo betwixt the Temerity of the
Enterprize, and the Temerity of the
Execution; which are not altogether
the ſame as thoſe we have mentioned,
although they come very near to them.
Common Senſe gives us ſufficiently to
underſtand theſe Differences.</p>
                  <p>It will be more important for us to
conſider the Cauſes of this Temerity;
and they are, the falſe Admiration of
raſh Enterprizes or Executions, when
they have ſucceeded; and a miſtaken
Contempt of Conducts conformable to
the Maxims of War, when they ſeem
not to have enough of Bravery and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.
We may ſee this manifeſtly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in a Conduct quite contrary, which
<hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> once followed; one
called the Sword, and the other the
Buckler of the <hi>Romans.</hi> I ſhould wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
too far, if I ſhould examine the
Lives of theſe two Men, to make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Remarks of this Diverſity and
Oppoſition. It is ſufficient to ſay, that
<hi>Fabius</hi> was truly the Buckler of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:56699:72"/>
and that he ſaved her from Ruin. On
the other ſide, <hi>Marcellus</hi> is blamed for
having precipitated himſelf into Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and to have (as we may ſay)
ſtole away his Life from the Defence
of his Country, in a Time when ſhe
ſtood moſt in need of it. It was ſaid
by a famous Orator, That many Great
Men, who have been wholly diſpoſed
to ſacrifice their Lives and Fortunes to
the publick Intereſt, yet were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to ſacrifice to it the leaſt Part of
their Glory. He alledgeth upon this
Subject, the Example of <hi>Cleombrotus</hi>
the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> who loſt the Battel
at <hi>Leuctre:</hi> And of another, called
<hi>Callicratides;</hi> who, during the Wars
of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> engaged himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
in a Sea-fight againſt the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi>
and when they endeavoured to
diſſuade him from it, he anſwered,
<hi>The Commonwealth of</hi> Sparta <hi>might ſend
another Fleet to the Sea; but as for him,
he could not make a Retreat, but to his
Diſhonour.</hi> But he deceived himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
in ſpeaking after this rate; for
if a Retreat were neceſſary, then it
could not be ſhameful; and if the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
were raſh, it could not be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56699:72"/>
glorious. Theſe Reſtrictions put You
in Pain, (SIR;) and You look upon
them as Fetters to Your Courage: You
bear them ſo much the more impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in that You know <hi>Alexander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
Conqueror at this Day; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Emulation for his Glory, You
aim to be as valiant as he. Your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
(SIR) are juſt; and You
give us Reaſon to hope, that You will
equal the Fortune, and ſurpaſs the
Vertue of this famous Conqueror.
But I moſt humbly beſeech You to take
notice, that one may be as valiant as
<hi>Alexander,</hi> without being fond of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Examples of his Temerity;
provided one do not forbear imitating
him herein by any Impulſe of Fear,
but out of a Principle of Reaſon.
There are, in the whole, three or four
Actions in the Life of that Prince,
which are inexcuſable Temerities, and
the Succeſs cannot juſtifie them; ſince
wiſe Men judge of Things as they are
in themſelves, and not by the Events.
Theſe ſorts of Exceſs would be more
condemned in our Days, after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Artillery, which hath given
ſo many Advantages to Fortune. If he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56699:73"/>
that formerly ſaw a Warlike Engine,
cried out, <hi>that Valour would be loſt,</hi> had
ſeen theſe other Machines, which not
only repreſent the Noiſe, but the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Lightning, and carry Death
to a prodigious Diſtance, how would
he have improved the Subject of his
Exclamation! He that is undaunted,
is as valiant as <hi>Alexander:</hi> But though,
in this Greatneſs of Courage, he is not
afraid of Death; yet, nevertheleſs, he
is not obliged to expoſe himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
to no purpoſe. We cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
any Thing more important than
this Reflection, becauſe the Valour of
a raſh Prince cannot produce the Effects
which it ought to do: His Enemies
conceive as much of Hope, as Fear at
it; and they deſire no more of him,
than to confront Dangers, without Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity;
and they wait every Moment
for that fatal Stroak, which ſhall put a
Period to the Courſe of his Succeſs,
and that of his Life. If a Prince will
be a Conqueror, he muſt firſt learn to
overcome himſelf: And he muſt hold
this for a certain Rule, That he that
cannot command his own Courage,
can never render himſelf Maſter of his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56699:73"/>
Enemy's. The true Valour of a Prince
doth not conſiſt in avoiding Dangers,
no more than in ſeeking of them; but
to attend, and not to deſert the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of his Command, for any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that ſhall encompaſs him. If, in
a Sea-fight, a Pilot ſhould quit the
Rudder, and run upon the Deck, he
would be accounted fool-hardy: And,
on the other ſide; if, fearing to be
ſlain in the Place where he ought to
ſteer the Ship, he ſhould go and hide
himſelf in the Hole, he would be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for an Errant Coward. Some have
compared an Army to the Body of a
Man. <hi>Iphicrates</hi> ſaid, the Infantry were
the Hands, the Cavalry the Feet, and the
General the Head. Now, if the Head
will either give or put by Blows, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of leaving this Office to the Hands,
it would receive as many Wounds as it
makes Puſhes, and would ſoon be put
out of a Condition of fighting. But if,
on the other Extream, finding it ſelf
afraid of Danger, it would hood-wink
her Eyes, or turn away her Sight, it
will ſo happen, that the Hands not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guided thereby, the whole Body
will be left without Defence, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56699:74"/>
to the Diſcretion of the Enemy.
I allow, that theſe Compariſons are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
(and we cannot frame Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
which will have an entire Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;)
but we may draw ſome Light
from them, and thereupon form a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of Valour, near approaching
to that which the Ancients have left us.
In Truth, this Vertue would not be ill
defined, if we ſay, that <hi>Valour is the
Science of thoſe Dangers, to which a Man
ought to expoſe himſelf; and of thoſe, to
which he ought not to expoſe himſelf.</hi>
They who will be willing to conceive
of it in this Senſe, would purſue the
Notion of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who called all the
Vertues Sciences; and particularly,
gave this Name to Valour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of him, how that being one Day
at a Feaſt, where they brought in one
of thoſe ſort of Women we ſee now-a-days,
who leaped over naked Swords,
with the Points upwards and croſſed;
he made a Reflection, how well this
Woman had overcome the natural Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity
of her Sex, in that ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
a Thing wherein her Death had
been infallible if ſhe had ſtopped by
the Way, and had not throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56699:74"/>
ſo hazardous a Leap. Then,
being come near to one of his Scholars,
<hi>Valour</hi> (ſaith he to him) <hi>is a Thing
which falls under Doctrine, and may be
learned.</hi> If the Maxim of this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
hath any Foundation, and it is true
that Valour may be learned, who ſhall
be the Maſter of this noble Science?
Certainly, the Prince. His Examples
therein are the Models, and his Orders
are the Precepts. But in the Orders that
he ſhall give out to others, or to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he ought not to make Juſtice to
conſiſt in Equality, but (as one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſaid) Equality in Juſtice. And
if it be demanded whether the Danger
ought to be equal in an Army; we
may anſwer in the Affirmative. But
we muſt underſtand it of an Equality
of Juſtice, or Proportion; (that is to
ſay) That the King muſt expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as a King, and the Soldier as a
Soldier.</p>

us to ſerve him; and it conſiſts in
that entire Submiſſion we ought to

what are thoſe Dependencies which the

that is able to foreſee or prevent
theſe ſorts of Adventures. As, when
<hi>Cambyſes</hi> was going to make War in
<hi>Lybia,</hi> Fifty Thouſand of his Army
were buried under a Mountain of

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56699:75"/>
of his Regiments, whereby they were
all drowned in the Sea. <hi>Scipio,</hi> when
very young, was in that Battel which
<hi>Paulus Aemylius</hi> gained over the laſt
King of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> After the Fight
was over, and the Victory carried for
the <hi>Romans,</hi> they knew not what was
become of him; and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army
was returned into their Camp, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſeeing young <hi>Scipio</hi> appear. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylius</hi>
was extreamly troubled thereat;
and in the midſt of the Succeſs of this
great Day, he felt no Joy, but what
was imbittered with Grief, by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
he had of having loſt a Son
of ſo great Hopes. They ſent out into
all Coaſts, to learn Tidings of him, and
called out aloud for him; but all to no
purpoſe: They concluded then, that
he lay mingled amongſt the ſlain Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and they were there ſearching
for him, when, at laſt, they ſaw him
return with Two more, and his Sword
reeking in Blood: That is to ſay, he
was ſo tranſported by the inconſiderate
Fervency of Youth, as, having quitted
the Body of the Army, he purſued the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> ſo far, that he had periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Thouſand Times, if he had had
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56699:76"/>
to do with Men who durſt have rallied:
Nothing had been more eaſie, than to
have incompaſs'd and ſlain him. If
this had happened, there had been no
<hi>Scipio the Great,</hi> the Deſtroyer of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
and <hi>Numantia:</hi> And his Valour
(as one may ſay) having been nipped
in the Bud, he had not performed thoſe
illuſtrious Actions which have rendred
him immortal in Story. On the other
ſide, If Providence had given a longer
Life to the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> he
might have been another <hi>Scipio;</hi> or,
to compare him with the Chief of his
Illuſtrious Race, which ended in him,
he might have been another <hi>Dunois.</hi>
'Tis true, the Death of this young
Prince doth not ſo much reſpect the
firſt Dependance, of which I have been
ſpeaking, as the ſecond, which ought
alſo to be conſidered. The Valour of
a Man depends on Almighty God, in
regard of his Body. This is plainly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in Wounds; ſeeing that Courage
is unprofitable, when the Strength fails.
What profitted it <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to have a
grand Courage, when having taken a
Town by Force of Arms, he received
a Blow with a Stone, thrown down
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56699:76"/>
from the Top of an Houſe, which
ſtunned him; and cauſing him to fall
from his Horſe, left him without
Strength or Senſe, in the Hands of
thoſe that took away his Life? What
did this heroick Reſolution of Mind
profit <hi>Philopoemon,</hi> who was the ſole
Support of his Country; when, being
the laſt in the Retreat, as he was firſt
in the Onſet, his Horſe threw him
down under him; whereupon, he was
ſoon ſurrounded by his Enemies? We
may remark this Difference, not only
in Wounds, but in other Things;
which, though they are leſs ſenſible,
yet are more aſtoniſhing. It happens
ſometimes, that a valiant Perſon, who
hath out-faced great Dangers with an
undaunted Countenance, has yet been
afraid when there has been no Cauſe of
Fear: It muſt be no other than a kind
of Dazling, or an Imagination, which
troubles and confounds him. It is in
the Actions of War, as in thoſe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence:
The moſt compleat Orators
ſometimes have been, as it were, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net-ſtruck,
and have loſt their Speech,
without knowing any Reaſon for it.
Men of the greateſt Courage have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56699:77"/>
been, as one may ſay, dumb-founded,
as well as the greateſt Genius's. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
is full of ſuch Events. And that
which is obſervable here, is, that the
<hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves have acknowledged
this ſort of Dependance; inſomuch
that the Sentiments they have had
thereof have obliged them to conſider
theſe pannick Fears as Envoys from
Heaven. We ſhall find a Proof of this
in that Expreſſion which <hi>Virgil</hi> makes
<hi>Turnus</hi> pronounce:
<q>Dii me terrent.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, theſe Idolaters moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
knew not to what God they
ſhould aſcribe theſe unexpected Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
And we may with Reaſon ſay,
that as Children who know not their
Father, addreſs themſelves ſometimes
to the firſt Man they meet, calling him
their Father: In like manner, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi>
through their Ignorance of the
true Deity, when any Terrour invaded
their Spirits, or ſtruck their Senſes,
they imagined preſently that this was
their God; and ſeeing the great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which Terrour produced in their
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56699:77"/>
Armies, they took Terrour it ſelf for
a God. There was at <hi>Lacedaemonia</hi> (as
we have already obſerved) the <hi>Temple
of Fear:</hi> And there was another at
<hi>Rome,</hi> which was not only dedicated
to <hi>Fear,</hi> but to its Effects; <hi>Pavori, &amp;
Pallori.</hi> All the Auguries, Expiations
and Sacrifices which they made during
the Wars, and before their Battels,
came from the ſame Original; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that, at the laſt, their Religion
became wholly Military. They conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
their Camp as a Temple: They
did not only bring their Gods thither
with their Eagles, but they placed the
Eagles themſelves in the Number of
their Gods; they adored them, and
they ſwore by their Name. When the
Emperors had embraced the <hi>Chriſtian
Faith,</hi> they aboliſhed this ſort of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
as well as others. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Soldiers in their Duty by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Object of Religion, which might
often put them in mind of the need
they had of God's Aſſiſtance, and of
the Dependance they had on his Power,
they repreſented the Croſs upon the
Standard, which they called <hi>Labarum.
Sozomen,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56699:78"/>
relates, That the <hi>Chriſtian Soldiers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
this Enſign as a Thing ſacred,
wherein was the Sign of their Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;
and that they rendred to it a
peculiar Reſpect. As all theſe Fears I
have been obſerving may ariſe from the
Diſpoſition of the Body, or of the
Corporeal Faculties, I have ranked
them under the ſecond Dependance.
But there is another Dependance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind:
The Valour of Men is ſubject
to the Divine Power in regard of the
Soul. Indeed, a Prince who ſaith to
God, <hi>Give me my Arms, preſerve me my
Life and Health, and I know well enough
how to do the reſt:</hi> That is to ſay, I
know well enough how to improve my
Courage my ſelf: This Prince ſpeaks
like a <hi>Pagan.</hi> Our Souls depend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
on him that made them. And
if a valiant Man doth not believe that
it is God which beſtows his Valour on
him, and that he can take it from him
when-ever he pleaſeth; if the moſt
hardy Man in the World imagines that
it doth not belong to God to render
him the moſt fearful Creature, he
knows not God, neither doth he know
himſelf. Our Souls, as we have ſaid
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56699:78"/>
already, are the Operations of his
Hands; they have continual Need of
the Supplies of his Succours, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Qualities they have received.
This Principle muſt be agreed, That
as there are none but Spirits that can
penetrate Bodies, ſo there is none but
God can penetrate Souls. Inſomuch
that God is in our Souls, he acts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
there, and it belongs to him
to do that which he pleaſeth. They
deceive themſelves extreamly who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that in making theſe Reflections
on the Dependence of Men's Valour,
it ſhould be capable to abate their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
rather than to add more Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to it. For, as it is in <hi>Civil</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
the Power of our Friends cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
in us rather Confidence than Fear;
ſo the Divine Omnipotence is ſo far
from abating the Courage of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that acknowledge and adore it,
that it elevates and confirms it. And
certainly I believe, that all the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
that ever have been made, or
ever ſhall be made, to excite Men to
Valour, have not ſo much Force as one
Sentence of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> alledged
by St. <hi>Paul; If God be for us, who can
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56699:79"/>
be againſt us?</hi> And that other in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;
<hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body,
but cannot deſtroy the Soul.</hi>

                  <p>AMongſt the Circumſtances which
attend Actions, the moſt eſſential
of all is the End. What is the End of
the Actions of Valour? The <hi>Pagans</hi>
have propounded Glory for its End.
Chriſtian Morality advanceth higher;
and to conceive aright of the Grandeur
and Solidity of the Sentiments ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires
upon this Subject, it is needful
for us to conſider, it is in Valour as it
is in other Vertues, and that Military
Actions ought to be ranked amongſt
the good Works to which the Reward
of Heaven is promiſed. There is in
them this in particular, that they are
not only more painful and difficult
than the others, but they oftentimes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56699:79"/>
put a Period to the Life of him that
performs them; and ſo he embraceth
Death in the actual Exerciſe of Vertue.
If a Man cloſeth up his Life, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out his Hands to aſſiſt the Poor,
and in the very Act of Alms-deeds and
Charity; or if he render up his Soul at
the Foot of the Altar, whilſt he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
himſelf to the Invocation and
Adoration of God; ſuch a Death will,
with Reaſon, be accounted as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and will give us advantageous
Thoughts of the Salvation of this Man.
We ought to have the ſame Opinion of
a Death which happens in Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions.
And to make the Reflection
more agreeable to this Notion, it is not
neceſſary that it muſt be a War waged
againſt Infidels; it is ſufficient that, in
reſpect of the Prince, the War be juſt;
and in reſpect of the Subjects, that
they are commanded by their Prince:
Then we may ſay, that Death is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
and he that ſuffers it, is a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim.
It will be objected, without
doubt, that this Sacrifice may not be
pleaſing to God, becauſe it may ſuffer
that Death, and yet otherwiſe be in
an ill State. I agree it: But this is not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56699:80"/>
a Caſe peculiar to Valour only, ſeeing
that it may be alſo, that he who dies
in the actual Exerciſe of Alms-giving,
or of Prayer, yet may not die in a
good Diſpoſition of Conſcience. There
is only one Difference to be obſerved,
That Alms-giving and Prayer do not,
in themſelves, expoſe a Man's Life to
Hazard; but Military Actions are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Dangers, and it is
their very Buſineſs to encounter them.
Inſomuch that we may ſoberly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thereupon, that a Soldier is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
obliged to take care of his
Conſcience; and in that he is expoſed
to Death hourly, he ought always to
be well prepared to die daily. It is
not neceſſary to make a farther Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch
what is the End of valiant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
it is the ſame as of other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Actions. Valour propounds no
leſs an Aim, than the nobleſt of all
Conqueſts; that of Heaven. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
an Immortality that is not
feigned, nor metaphorical, as is that
of Fame; but a Life truly eternal, and
truly happy. As to that other Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
ſuch as it is; I mean, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which ſprings from Valour; we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56699:80"/>
muſt ſee of what Diſpoſitions Chriſtian
Princes ought to be in this Reſpect. I
remember I have read a Notion in the
Writings of an Ancient Father, which,
at the firſt, ſurprized me; but it was
very ſolid, and very neceſſary upon
this Occaſion. He preached to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
after this manner: <hi>Have a Care of
my Reputation: It is your Intereſt, rather
than mine, ſo to do: I have no need of it
for my ſelf; but I have need of it for
you.</hi> So a Prince ſtands in no need of
Honour for himſelf: He ſhall not be
judged of God by his Reputation, but
by his Vertue: He hath only need of it
for his People, to maintain his Subjects
in their Duty, to hinder his Enemies
from undertaking any Thing againſt
them; and, in a Word, for a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Things important to the Publick.
We cannot doubt then, but that the
Reputation of Kings is capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
great Effects, be it either in
Peace or War: But all this hath no
farther Regard to a Prince, but during
his Life. Ought he then to neglect a
Reputation which ſhall endure after
Death? No, he ought not to neglect
it; but on the contrary, to deſire it;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56699:81"/>
not for himſelf, but for others: Which
is the Motive we have formerly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, and appears here to be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true. Indeed, St. <hi>Lewis</hi> would not
be e'er the leſs happy in Heaven,
though all the World were ignorant
of the Actions he did on the Earth;
and we never had known he was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
or that he had made War in
<hi>Africa,</hi> or had ſuffered Death as a
Martyr. It is not then a Felicity to
St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> that Hiſtory ſpeaks of him;
but it is an Happineſs for thoſe who
are now living. It is an Happineſs in
particular to You, (SIR) who are
animated by this Example; and find
in a Stem of your Auguſt Family, the
moſt perfect Model that the Church
hath propounded for Princes. As we
may ſee by this, that the Glory of
great Kings produceth great Effects,
which are not confined within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of their Days; ſo we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but that they may propound to
themſelves to do ſuch Actions which
will never be forgotten; and the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires</hi>
of their Vertue will procure a
continued and perpetual Benefit to the
World. We ſhall be yet more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56699:81"/>
of the Truth of this Maxim, if
we conſider that there is a Proportion
altogether equal, between the Times
and Places. And, as when a Chriſtian
Prince deſires to be known out of his
own Kingdom, it is to render himſelf
profitable to Strangers, as well as to
his Subjects: In like manner, when he
deſires to be famed after his Death, it
is to this End, that after having ſerved
his own Generation, he will be yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſerviceable to Poſterity.</p>

                  <p>WHen one is animated from ſo
noble a Principle, and hath
propounded to himſelf ſo excellent an
End, he ſometimes prohibits himſelf
the Uſe of thoſe Things which, in
themſelves, are allowable. It is not
enough to ſatisfie our ſelves, that we
are far from being guided by unjuſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56699:82"/>
Maxims; but we ought farther to
hearken to the Impulſes of Generoſity.
Many confound the Name of <hi>Generous,</hi>
with that of <hi>Valiant;</hi> but in this they
deceive themſelves: All undaunted
Men are not generous. Generoſity is
a Grandeur, or a Beauty of the Soul,
which ſometimes is not found in thoſe
who are remarkable for Courage.
There are many who not being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the leaſt Cowardice amidſt the
Dangers of War, yet have been guilty
of great Weakneſſes in the other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of Life. We have borrowed this
Term of the <hi>Latins,</hi> but we take it in
another Senſe than the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi>
did; and have given it ſuch a copious
Signification, that we muſt conſider
Generoſity in the full Extent, as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Vertue, which is a chief Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
and mingles it ſelf amongſt all
the others, and adds a Flavour to their
Sentiments. Indeed, as I remarked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we call thoſe generous, who have
a comely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beautiful Soul. Now, as
one ſingle Feature well formed does not
render the Face beautiful, ſo one ſingle
Vertue does not make up a lovely Soul.
Generoſity is allied to all the Vertues,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56699:82"/>
but ſhe loves to be eſpouſed to Valour,
which opens to her a vaſt Career,
wherein to exerciſe her ſelf; it gives
her the ſtatelieſt Theatre ſhe could ever
have had, whereon to ſhew forth the
Nobleneſs and Purity of her Intentions.
It is by Valour that an Hero renders
himſelf victorious; it is by Generoſity
that he does not ſully the Glory of his
Victory. It is by this that he remits
the rigorous Juſtice of his Rights, and
gives a Relaxation of hard (and yet
juſt) Severities; that he ſcorns Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
though he hath the full Power
to act it. He is ſorry in his Chair of
Triumph, for the Blood which he was
conſtrained to ſhed in the Field of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
ſtretcheth out his Hands to relieve
the Vanquiſhed, and ſhews them that
he is an Enemy to no People; and that
he never deſigned any more than to
correct their Inſolence, Tyranny, and
Injuſtice. Farther, (SIR;) Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
is properly the Vertue of a Prince.
You ought to eſteem it as one of the
principal Ornaments of your Life:
And You cannot take too much Pains
to cultivate thoſe Seeds which You
have received at Your Royal Birth,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56699:83"/>
and to practiſe thoſe Maxims which
You have continually learned in Your
excellent Education. That which
ſhews, this Vertue appertains peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to thoſe who are placed in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Station, is, that ſhe includes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her ſelf a kind of Superiority: And
we may always affirm in ſome ſort,
that he that does a generous Act, in
that he raiſeth himſelf up above him
that receives it. And certainly, ſhould a
Subject, in making Proteſtations of his
Loyalty, tell the King that he would
ſerve him generouſly; though perhaps
he may have no ill Intention, yet he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
againſt Decency. Nay, to go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
If a <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lan ſhould ſo expreſs himſelf
towards God, he would ſpeak not only
barbarouſly, but impiouſly. No one
may ſay, he acts generouſly towards
God: And, that which is more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing,
we ought not to ſay neither,
that God is generous towards Men:
We ought to ſay, indeed, that he is
good, and compaſſionate. Now, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Generoſity is a Vertue more
ſublime than mere Goodneſs, it may
be demanded, Why, in ſpeaking of
God, we chuſe rather to ſay he is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56699:83"/>
good, than that he is generous? They
do wiſely, that expreſs themſelves ſo:
And this Way of Speaking ſeems to
be founded on Reaſon. As Words are
the Images of the Thoughts, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well give a Name to God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we cannot comprehend him. All
Names, generally, are unworthy of his
Greatneſs and Immenſity, not excepting
even that which was had in ſo great a
Veneration amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> We ſay
of God, that he is good; becauſe, as
this is a Name we ordinarily aſcribe to
Men, ſo we believe, by our attributing
it to God, that, at the ſame Time, he
will not fail to elevate our Thoughts
beyond our Expreſſions. But we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to give him the Name of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
which is one of the ſublimeſt in
Morality, for fear one ſhould imagine
that it would fill up the <hi>Idaea</hi> he ought
to have of the King of Kings, and that
it might be truly worthy of his infinite
Perfections. I am inſenſibly fallen into
this Digreſſion, and will improve it no
farther, but tie my ſelf at preſent to
conſider Generoſity as a Vertue which
ought to accompany Valour.</p>

He ſhuts himſelf up with ſome
of his familiar Friends, to condole the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56699:84"/>
Death of his Rival, and to render
Praiſes to his Merit: He reads to them
certain Letters which he had received
from him, and makes Remarks on the
Neatneſs and Beauties of his Stile: He
ſhews them, that he was not only a
Man of great Courage, but of a great
Soul. Some will ſay, all theſe Regrets
were but diſſembled. May be they
were ſo; but one may judge by this,
how commendable and amiable Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
is, ſince, in theſe Inſtances, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> believed, that they
ought to have had either ſuch real Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,

of them: And as they had the
Taſte and Ambition of true Glory, ſo
they conceived it imported much to
their Honour, to be ſenſible of the
Misfortune of their Enemies; or if
they were not ſo, yet to ſeem to be
ſo. In ſpeaking after this manner, I
know I do not accommodate my ſelf
to the Opinion of thoſe who make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
favourable Conſtructions of the
Tears of the two firſt <hi>Caeſars:</hi> In
which it ſeems to me, they have but
ill practiſed the Vertue whereof we
are ſpeaking, and that they have not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56699:85"/>
uſed them generouſly. For, what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can they alledge, that theſe two
great Men, who, after the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Sovereignty, had made
their Clemency appear ſo conſpicuous,
ſhould not then enter upon Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which might draw Tears from
them? Valour and Generoſity are not
incompatible; and when one hath
vanquiſhed an Enemy, I cannot tell
what ſhould hinder him from deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Misfortune, after the Victory.
We muſt confeſs, Envy is a malignant
Interpreter; it will divine Things it
never ſaw, and will make Comments
on the fineſt Actions of the Heroes, in
the worſt Senſe. But what can it ſay
of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who, after the Battel at <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
the Loſs of which reduced the
<hi>Carthaginians</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Servitude,
ſtudied rather to preſerve <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
than to deſtroy him? He obliged the
Vanquiſhed to burn their Veſſels,
wherein conſiſted the Force of their
Empire: But he did not oblige them
to deliver up this redoubtable Enemy,
who had ravaged <hi>Italy,</hi> and had brought
<hi>Rome</hi> to the very Brink of Ruin; and
who, beſides, in the Uſe of Means
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56699:85"/>
which he employed to gain his Point,
and to ſucceed in his Enterprizes,
ſometimes tranſgreſſed the Boundaries
of Juſtice, and was not always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the Rights of War. <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
ſaved him nevertheleſs; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
going to make War in <hi>Aſia,</hi>
he ſaw him at <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Although <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>

obſerves, that this fierce <hi>African</hi>

he cauſed him to kill himſelf. A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
ſo barbarous was condemned
by the ſolid Part of Mankind, and a
great Number of them <hi>Romans</hi> too.
By this, <hi>Flaminius</hi> blaſted the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had acquired in his <hi>Macedonian</hi>
Conqueſts. We conceive, I ſay, he
ought to have ſpared the Life of a
Man, who, after having eſcaped ſo
many Dangers, was now arrived to an
extream Old Age. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was of
ſuch an Age, that had he wiſhed Ill to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> he was not capable to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it; though, indeed, he ought not
to have done it, nor to have wiſhed it.
This Action of <hi>Titus Flaminius</hi> puts me
in mind of that of <hi>Lucius Flaminius,</hi> his
Brother; which was extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
He was Commander of a
Province; and one Day being at a
Feaſt with a Perſon he loved, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken with an inhumane Curioſity,
told him, ſhe had never ſeen a Man's
Head cut off. <hi>It is eaſie,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to
ſatisfie your Deſire in that.</hi> And there
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56699:86"/>
being in the Priſon ſome Criminals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Condemnation of Death, he ſent
for one into the Hall where the Feaſt
was, and cut off his Head in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
When he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi>
one might have offered ſomething by
way of Excuſe for a Conduct ſo brutal;
that he whom he had cauſed to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
was a guilty Perſon, and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
condemned; and that he had
only changed the Place of his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
One might have alledged the
Glory of his Family, the good <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ervices
of his Brother, and of himſelf too.
But he was noted for Infamy; and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
the Elder, by his Authority, as <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi>
which he then exerciſed, expelled
him out of the <hi>Senatorian</hi> Dignity. By
this Example we may obſerve, that this
brutiſh Action diſpleaſed even a People,
who were accuſtomed to ſee the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
of the <hi>Gladiators.</hi> So true it is,
that valiant Men, when they are cruel,
excite more of Horrour, than Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that all who are Strangers to
Generoſity, offend not only Souls that
are generous, but even thoſe that are
not ſo.</p>

Generoſity without Valour, doth not

employed for the covering a Defect;
and the other, as an Inſtinct whereby

ought therefore to unite both theſe in

we have never given it to any King:
Thoſe, amongſt the Princes, which

however, a great Solidity in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to <hi>Parmenio,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella.</hi>
This old Captain ſent to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
him, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> had fallen
upon the Baggage of the Army; and
that he could not ſave it, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Succours. <hi>Alexander</hi> bid them
tell him, That <hi>he muſt let that alone,
and think of nothing but to overcome; for
if the</hi> Macedonians <hi>carried the Victory,
they ſhould not only recover their own Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
but that of the Enemy's alſo.</hi> This
Anſwer gives me Occaſion to relate the
Saying of <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> the Philoſopher,
and Scholar to <hi>Socrates: We ought,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>to wiſh all ſorts of Goods to our
Enemies, except Valour; for if they are
defective in Valour, they will not be able
to preſerve the Goods that they have, and
we ſhall not fail to render our ſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
thereof.</hi> One ſpoke ingeniouſly,
who called Covetouſneſs an <hi>Aenigma:</hi>
For, in Truth, nothing is ſo odd, and
unconceivable, as to joyn Poverty and
Riches together; and to ſcrape up a
Maſs of Goods, on purpoſe not to
make uſe of them. This <hi>Aenigma</hi> yet
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56699:89"/>
becomes more inexplicable, when Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
meets with Valour in one and the
ſame Perſon. If one ſhould put the
Queſtion, and ask, Who is he that
deſpiſeth Life, and with Greedineſs
heaps up Things which he believes are
neceſſary for Life; and yet, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
makes no Uſe of thoſe very
Things he hath ſo eagerly hoarded up?
Certainly, this would look like a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and a <hi>Chimera;</hi> and one could not
imagine that it were ever poſſible to
make a fit Application thereof. But
ſuch Examples are rare amongſt Kings.
Yet I will not deny, but that there
may be found ſome Princes of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of that <hi>Roman,</hi> who was made
<hi>Conſul</hi> at a Time when they dreaded a
difficult and dangerous War. He was
much cried down upon the Score of
Intereſt. And when it was demanded
of another <hi>Roman,</hi> there at that Time,
why he would be adviſed to give his
Vote for ſuch a Man to be <hi>Conſul? It
is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe I had rather be
plundered, than ſold.</hi> But, as I have
ſaid, theſe Examples are very rare.
Valiant Men do make no other Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of Riches, but to uſe them; and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56699:89"/>
they do not uſe them for any other End,
but thereby to be enabled to do Things
worthy of Glory. This appears, even
from the Common Soldier, to the Prince:
The great Deſire of a Soldier truly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous,
is, to have ſerviceable Arms;
that of a Captain, to have a Company
well diſciplined; and that of a Prince,
to have ſtrong and well-marſhall'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
'Tis for this that he reſerves his
Treaſures. And we cannot but lament,
or, to ſay better, we can ſcarcely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
the Misfortune of thoſe who periſh
by the blind Impulſes of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.<note place="margin">Perſeus.</note>
A certain King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
who was conquered
by the <hi>Romans,</hi> had Troops able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him; but becauſe theſe Troops coſt
him ſo much Money to maintain them,
he disbanded them the Evening before
the Battel which he had againſt ſuch
formidable Enemies. Hiſtory farther
obſerves, that after his Defeat, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
was his predominant Paſſion;
and when he fled away with all that he
had that was of any great value, he
was betrayed by a Captain of a Veſſel,
who imbarked the Treaſures of this
Prince in his own Ship, and left him

whereof we treat will not permit us to
forget thoſe Generoſities which are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

when there aroſe a Diſpute about the

and which they had held in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the <hi>Graecians</hi> in almoſt theſe Terms:
<hi>We are not come here with a Deſign to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

the Poſts wherein you will be pleaſed

conſider alſo the Conduct of <hi>Phocion</hi> as

refuſed to engage in Battel, to which
he was raſhly deſired by thoſe whom he
commanded. He perſiſted in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

We muſt acknowledge by this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

may happen Occaſions, where their
Generoſity ſhall raiſe them above the

no more than in their continual Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of Paſſion: Which made one of

Homericis: <hi>Nothing is more fulſom than</hi>
Homer'<hi>s Heroes.</hi> The moſt celebrated
Men of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have often fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this important Part of Morality:
And we muſt confeſs, that the generous
<hi>Alexander</hi> was not always generous in

which one ought to follow, is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
this Self-applauding, either as
hurtful, or unprofitable; or as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
When it is hurtful, we ſhould
forbear in point of Prudence: When it
is unprofitable, we ſhould forbear in
point of Modeſty: But when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
we muſt then ſtrain a Point,
and applaud our own Actions, as well
out of that Juſtice which we owe to our
ſelves, as others. And therefore, when
Hiſtorians deſcribe Princes to us, who,
to animate their Troops before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
make Harangues, and tell them,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56699:92"/>
that they have a Leader who fears no
Dangers, and puts them in mind of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Occaſions wherein he hath ſignali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
his Courage, they do not conſider
this ſort of Diſcourſe as ſavouring of
Pride, but as generous. A certain Prince
at Sea, finding himſelf within Sight of
the Enemy's Fleet, which was ready to
attack him, heard one of the Soldiers
ſay, <hi>The Enemy's Ships are much more in
Number than ours;</hi> he turns himſelf ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to the Soldier, and asked him,
<hi>For how many doſt thou count me?</hi> This
was not Arrogance, it was a becoming
Confidence. And although, by theſe
Words, the Prince comprehended his
own Praiſes, yet the Expreſſion was not
leſs fine, than that which is related of
<hi>Pelopidas:</hi> He leads his Troops through
a Place where he did not believe he
ſhould be forced to an Engagement:
In the mean time, he perceived the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

I believe I am obliged to tell You, that
it is not ſo eſſential, nor ſo important,
as thoſe two of which I have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing,
Generoſity and Juſtice. We
cannot treat Morality with too much
Freedom and Sincerity. Vertue ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
all other Things in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that when a vertuous Man is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of them, his Merit flows princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
from that which is vertuous in
him; and when he is vertuous, though
he be not poſſeſſed of them, yet we
muſt needs always obſerve in him a
good Foundation for true Glory. We
commonly fanſie Old <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Seat
of the Sciences; and, as a Polite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
we cannot form this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56699:93"/>
of her in her Infancy; for, during
more than Four Hundred Years, this
People remained in a profound Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and an extream Averſion for
Learning. Thoſe Men, though they
were rough and unpoliſhed, yet they
were brave: And, as one hath ſaid of
them, <hi>They knew not how to do any Thing,
but to till the Ground, and kill their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
However, we admire the Heroes
ſhe produced in thoſe firſt Ages; and
we have Reaſon to admire them. We
ſhall not find a leſs Interval of Time
between the Foundation of <hi>Athens,</hi> and
the Honour ſhe had to be the Mother
of the Arts. Since ſhe became ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for Eloquence, ſhe produced a
great Captain; who, though he had
not an ordinary Politeneſs for an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
yet he gained Battels at Land
and Sea for them: And of whom one
ſaid, <hi>Cimon</hi> was as valiant as <hi>Miltia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
as prudent as <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and
more juſt than either <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> or
<hi>Miltiades.</hi> Although he had not ſo
much Agreeableneſs of Spirit, as he
had Grandeur of Soul, yet he acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
immortal Renown. They placed
him in the Rank of the Illuſtrious,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56699:94"/>
and have wrote his Life. And if we
may obſerve therein ſome little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
yet a ſlight Indecency is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to ſully the Glory of his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
On the other ſide, Though
Princes are endued with Politeneſs;
yet, if thoſe other more ſolid Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which we have touched upon in
this Diſcourſe, are not conſpicuous in
them, we muſt ingenuouſly confeſs the
Truth, they cannot acquire a true E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
in the World: And if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be numbred amongſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes
of it, their Ambition meets with
ſo many Obſtacles, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to ſurmount them. But behold
the Judgment one ought to make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sciences, that ſo we may not
aſcribe too much to them, nor dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
too much from them. They are
to be eſteemed for Three Things:
Firſt, They are able to inſpire ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Notions. Beſides, When they
accompany Vertue, they appear more
refined, and are rendred more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

he would put into ſo precious a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:
<hi>I deſigned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to put</hi> Homer'<hi>s
Works into it.</hi> And he uſed it actually
for that purpoſe. Amongſt thoſe they
call the Twelve <hi>Caeſars,</hi> the greateſt in
Eſteem are the Two firſt. We may
add to them <hi>Veſpaſiam.</hi> I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon the Two firſt, for them we
ſhould ſpeak but too much: But <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>
had no leſs a Love for the Arts,
than either of them. It was he, whoſe
Protection and Encouragement brought
forth a Swarm of fine Wits; which,
without doubt, muſt give place to
thoſe who were in the Time of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus;</hi>
and yet, nevertheleſs, they merit
very great Eſteem. <hi>Pompey</hi> lowred the
<hi>Conſulary Faſces</hi> before <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> his
Houſe, when he went to give him a
Viſit. <hi>Trajan</hi> made <hi>Dion Chryſoſtom</hi> ſit
on one Side of him, in his Chair of
Triumph. <hi>Scipio</hi> ordained, that the
Status of <hi>Ennius</hi> ſhould be placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Monument: And another was
erected in the publick Place, to the
Honour of <hi>Claudian,</hi> by the Order
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56699:95"/>
of <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius. Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maign</hi>
and <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt were, in
their Times, the Fathers of Learning.
<hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> was alſo found of it.
There is at this Day extant a kind of
Hiſtory in Verſe, called the <hi>Philippeids.</hi>
He honoured the Author with his Royal
Favours; and though it was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ſo great a Prince, that was his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and not his Crime. <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth followed theſe excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
He eſteemed the Learned, and
the Sciences: And if he did not make
therein ſo great a Progreſs as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
under the Conduct of that ſage
Governor whom <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth had
provided for him; and improved not
ſo much as was hoped he would have
done, under the Care and Pains of a
Tutor who afterwards arrived to the
Supream <hi>Pontificate;</hi> yet he ſignified his
Sorrow for it. Hiſtory obſerves, that
an Harangue in Latin having been made
before him at the City of <hi>Genoua,</hi> when
he underſtood not the meaning of it;
<hi>It happens now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what I have
long Time fore-told; that I ſhould repent
one Day, that I had not applied my ſelf to
Study.</hi> Nay, even <hi>Hannibal</hi> himſelf had
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56699:96"/>
a particular Affection for Learned Men.
And the very <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves, who
paſs for <hi>Barbarians</hi> (and ſo they are in
many Things, yet) would ſeen in this
to give ſome Ground to their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thoſe who are famous, above
others, in their Hiſtory, are, <hi>Mahomet</hi>
the Second, and <hi>Solyman:</hi> The one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Bounds of the Empire, and
the other eſtabliſhed it: They both of
them took care to cultivate their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.
The Education which theſe Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
beſtow on their Princes is not very
far from this Maxim: They teach them
the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language, to enable them
to read their Hiſtory and Poeſie. In
Truth, they are but irregular Works,
in compariſon of thoſe which the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Latins</hi> have left us: Their Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
is fabulous, and their Eloquence
adulterate. But if they delight in this
mean ſort of Learning, becauſe they
underſtand it; it is very probable, that
if they were acquainted with more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Sciences, they would better eſteem
them.</p>

Eſteem of a valiant Man.</head>
                  <p>IT is a common Opinion, ſaith <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi>
that Soldiers, take them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
are ſeldom polite: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the refined Qualities of the Soul
ſerve extreamly to increaſe the Eſteem
of a valiant Man, becauſe they make a
glorious Exception from this General
Rule. And beſides, they make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that his Courage is not a blind
Tranſport of Anger, nor an inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Heat of Youth, nor the Effect of
any other Principles leſs commendable;
but a true Vertue, conducted by the
Light of Reaſon, and animated by the
Emulation of good Examples. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
All Things which have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Arts, contribute ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Glory of a valiant Prince,
that we many times admire that in
him, which we ſcarce take notice of,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56699:97"/>
or perhaps blame, in another Perſon.
Though Agriculture be never ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
a ſort of Life, yet if we ſhould
ſee a Prince delight in it, who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
acquired a Reputation in War,
when Opportunities have courted him
thereunto, we ſhould ſcarce forgive
him this Fondneſs; nor ſhould we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to ſee him dreſs up Palms and
Lawrels, who knows not how to merit
Crowns. But the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> who
ſaw <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Younger in his Gardens,
conceived a quite contrary Opinion:
The Adventure is remarkable; and as
it had reſpect to a great Prince, and an
illuſtrious Private Man, it ſeems to me
not unworthy to be related to You.
<hi>Lyſander,</hi> whom Courage and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
had rendred very famous, was ſent
Ambaſſador from the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi>
to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>The Younger,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
him from <hi>Cyrus</hi> who founded
the Monarchy, and who, according to
the common Opinion, was ſlain in his
Wars againſt the <hi>Scythians;</hi> he was
then in the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
of that Realm, which the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
had made one of the Provinces of
their Empire, and which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56699:97"/>
from the rich and unfortunate
<hi>Croeſus.</hi> There was a Conformity of
Merit between the Prince and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
the Reſult whereof was, a
Complacency in the Society one of
another. <hi>Cyrus</hi> treated him in all
Things worthy his Grandeur: And
one Day taking him into his Gardens,
which were kept by his Order, with
Royal Expences, <hi>Lyſander</hi> could not
forbear to admire the Statelineſs of the
Trees, the Length of the Alleys, the
Compartment of the <hi>Parterres,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Flowers, and of Fruits;
and, above all, the fine Order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every Thing was diſpoſed. When
<hi>Cyrus</hi> perceived him in this Surprize,
<hi>You do not believe</hi> (ſaith he to him) <hi>that
all this was my Invention. I drew the
Platform my ſelf; and, amongſt theſe
Trees, you may ſee ſome that were planted
with my own Hands.</hi> The Ambaſſador
was then more aſtoniſhed, and caſt his
Eyes upon the Magnificence of that
Prince's Habit, which was nothing like
that of a Gardener; and thinking, at
the ſame Time, upon the Glory of his
Actions, <hi>You are happy,</hi> cries he, <hi>O
great Prince, foraſmuch as in you Vertue
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56699:98"/>
is joyned with Fortune.</hi> This was the
Opinion he had of the Merit of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
which cauſed him to make that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.
For, if he had had to do
with a Man whom he had not eſteemed
for his Courage, he had deſpiſed this
Adventure, inſtead of admiring it.
He would not have been ſurprized,
that an effeminate Prince ſhould ſeek
out ſuch Amuſements, to divert his
idle Hours: And it would have been
the Subject of his Indignation, to have
ſeen him take more Care to plant his
Trees, and dreſs his Gardens, than to
govern his People, and command his
Armies.</p>

                  <p>I Know not how it happens; that
Wit which one would think ſhould
help to conceal the Defect of Courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſerves rather to diſcover it. Whether
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56699:98"/>
it be, becauſe a Man of Wit hath more
Eyes upon him than others, and one or
other will ſpy out his weak Side: Or
whether it be, that Envy endeavours to
find ſome Defect in him, which ſeems
to make an Atonement for the Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

he poſſeſſeth: Or whether it be the
Artifices he makes uſe of to avoid Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
diſcover the Fear wherewith he is
agitated. As one may obſerve amongſt
the Animals; thoſe that are fearful,
appear to be ſo much the more, as they
have Cunning joyned with Timorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Wit is then a Light which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
equally the Good, and the Bad:
And Cowardice, inſtead of finding an
<hi>Aſylum,</hi> wherein it may hide it ſelf,
meets with a Flaſh, which betrays it,
and renders it more expoſed. It muſt
alſo be owned, on the other ſide,
that the Valour of a Prince makes a
greater Figure, when he is Maſter of an
happy Genius, and hath taken Pains to
cultivate it. Then we are raviſhed to
ſee that, under what Circumſtances ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he appears, he comes off with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
knows how to act well, and
to ſpeak well, that he can inſpire Fear
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56699:99"/>
into his Enemies, and Love into his
Subjects. Then a Thouſand happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
fall from him, which all the
World collects with Care; and they
being ſpread amongſt the People, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double
the Eſteem they have for their
Sovereign, and confirm them in the
Love of Loyalty: They are transferred
to After-Ages, and are as eternal as the
famous Sayings of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi>
which have been as faithfully preſerved
as conſecrated Relicks; but had never
been derived down to us, had they not
been ſpoken by one of the moſt valiant
Nations in the World. A King who
joyns the Qualities of Addreſs to that of
Courage, and Eloquence to Undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
makes preſent Repartees and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to premeditated Diſcourſes: He
indicts Letters, which bear the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of his Dignity; and may be his own
Hiſtorian, if he will himſelf: He reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and underſtands what is ſweeteſt in
his Triumphs, the <hi>Encomium</hi> of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
And, amongſt all the Praiſes they
beſtow upon him, he diſtinguiſheth
thoſe which Poſterity may be ignorant
of, from thoſe which ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.
All the Arts and Sciences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56699:99"/>
together for his Glory; and are
equally allured to this Devoir by the
Renown of his Actions, and the Equity
of his Judgments. A <hi>Roman,</hi> that had
been <hi>Conſul,</hi> writing to a learned Man
whom he had recommended to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
and upon whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had beſtowed
his Friendſhip, <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in that
you are introduced into a Place, where they

the Reign of an illuſtrious Prince,

all ſpeak the ſame Language.
This Conſideration is that which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
charms their Nocturnal Studies:
And what Pains ſoever they are at, this
is that which ſweetens and renders them
agreeable. They feel a ſenſible Joy, that
their Hero, who knows how to make
Conqueſts, and reap Victories, knows
alſo in what manner they ought to be
celebrated. They are ambitious of his
Approbation, as the moſt noble of all
their Recompences; and ſubmitting
their Works to him, to whom they have
conſecrated them, they eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
happy, that he who is the Object

                  <p>FInally, The Learning of a Prince, to
make it worthy of Valour, ought
not to be affected, as was that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi>
who took a Pride in attempting
thoſe Things wherein he never ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded;
or as that of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who
made uſe of an obſcure Language, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was able to expreſs himſelf
as clearly as any; and by his odd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the Merit of Authors, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thoſe who were little known, and
leſs eſteemed. He tired the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
of his Time with ridiculous Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions;
ſometimes addicted himſelf to
an inſatiable Curioſity in Learning,
which <hi>Seneca</hi> juſtly ſtiles an <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
Kings ought to ſhun this, as a
Rock; and to conſider, God hath not
ſent them into the World to ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up in a dull Solitude, and to pore
all their Life-time upon dead Men's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
but to appear upon the Throne,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56699:100"/>
to enlighten the World by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and to live continually in Action.
There is no Part of Science, but what
is capable to take up a Man's Life-time,
if he will ſearch into the vain Quirks
and Subtilties of it, and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with neceſſary Deductions. Theſe
ſorts of Exceſs will be injurious to a
Prince, although they ariſe from a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to apprehend the Bottom of thoſe
Arts which have a more immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Royalty or Valour. It ſeems,
the Knowledge of the Laws cannot be
too well underſtood by him, ſeeing that
we exerciſe Juſtice in his Name. And
likewiſe, that he cannot be too well
skilled in Fortifications: He hath Forts
himſelf, and ſo have his Enemies; and
therefore he ought to know how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the one, and attack the other.
Yet if he will altogether dive to the
Bottom of theſe Arts, and refine upon
them, ſo well as the profoundeſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer,
or the moſt able Engineer, he
muſt do nothing elſe during his whole
Reign. The Extent of his Employs
oblige him to divide himſelf: The
Character of Sovereignty is, to have a
general Inſpection over all. A King
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56699:101"/>
knows enough of the Arts and Sciences,
provided he can but know when he is
well or ill ſerved, not only in reſpect
of Zeal, but of Capacity: Then he is
a Lawyer, and an Engineer, by thoſe
that are ſo; and he makes their Science
his own. We cannot carry this Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
too far; for, through the Want
of this due Conſideration and Guidance,
many Princes come ſhort of that Glory
which waited for them; and never fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up the Grandeur of their Dignity
ſo much as they were capable of. It
has oft-times been ſaid, it is with a
Realm, as with a Ship; and with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
as with a Pilot. A Thouſand
Work-men contribute to the making of
a Ship, or to its Tackle: One furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her with Anchors; another, with
Maſts or Sail-yards; others, with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
or Sails. If a Pilot propound to
himſelf, fully to underſtand every of
theſe particular Matters, and to make
them himſelf, with his own Hands, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Canvaſs or Cordage, he will run a
great Hazard, never to acquit himſelf
well in his own Profeſſion: For, one
of theſe two Things muſt follow; that
either he will learn this Art out of his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56699:101"/>
Ship, and by conſequence, abandon the
Conduct thereof; or he will apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to it during the Courſe of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
and then we cannot think our
ſelves ſafe with him, but ſhall have
Reaſon to fear, that his continual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
will ſoon occaſion a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck.
There are ſome Arts which a
Prince ought to condemn, and others
which he ought to deſpiſe; ſome which
he muſt leave to others, and forbear
himſelf; and there are others which
he may underſtand without practiſing
them. In ſhort, There are ſome which
he may practiſe too; nevertheleſs,
without entring into Concurrence or
Partnerſhip with thoſe who make a
Profeſſion thereof.</p>

                  <p>WHen a Prince knows how to
make ſo judicious a Difference;
when (I ſay) his Knowledge in that
Part of Learning which is neceſſary,
and his Love generally to all the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56699:102"/>
is joyned to Generoſity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
and that theſe Qualifications

becomes the <hi>Delicacy of the whole Earth.</hi>
It is by this Means, that ſuch may
pretend, not only to equal, but to
ſurpaſs the greateſt Men of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And it ſeems to me, that what
they call, <hi>Field of Glory,</hi> ought to be
conſidered as a Race-Courſe, where
the Prize is not yet adjudged; becauſe
we cannot know whether thoſe who
have already exerciſed there, ſhall not
be ſurpaſſed by ſome of thoſe who are
now exerciſing in this Field, or that
ſhall hereafter enter thereinto. The
<hi>Cyrus</hi>'s, the <hi>Alexanders,</hi> the <hi>Caeſars,</hi>
the <hi>Conſtantines,</hi> and the <hi>Theodofius</hi>'s,
have appeared in this Courſe with
great Splendour: But how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their Reputation hath been, yet
it hath not fore-cloſed our Hopes:
That when our Modern Warriours do
aſpire to out-do them, conſidering the
vaſt Gifts they have received from
Heaven, their Ambition will not be
found Temerarious.</p>

I have ſaid nothing but what the
Heroick have made appear by their
firſt Motions and Active Inclinations:
And if any thing render this piece a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
it will not be that Novelty,
which is, however, one of the greateſt
Charms in the Products of Wit; but
I am aſſured, the Brave will have the
ſame Pleaſure that one has, when he
hears that Praiſed which he loves.
And beſides, as the Rulers of Vertue
are the true Commendations of thoſe
that Practiſe them, I do not doubt,
for that Reaſon, but that this Diſcourſe
will one Day become their <hi>Encomium.</hi>
