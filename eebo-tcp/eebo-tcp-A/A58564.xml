         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſeeing the Acts for Excluding Papiſts from publick Truſt have no ſpecial Penalties adjected thereto, and that there may be a clear Teſt to diſcover Papiſts; Therefore his Majeſty, with Advice and Conſent of his Eſtates of Parliament, ſtatutes and declares, That whoſoever being required by any Miniſter of the Church or Magiſtrate of the Kingdom, do not ſubſcribe the Confeſſion of Faith ſubjoyned to the third Act of the firſt Parliament of King <hi>James 6.</hi> ſhall be holden and reputed Papiſts; or who ſhall refuſe to ſwear the Oath ſubjoyned to the ſaid Confeſſion, and ſigne the ſame in this form: <hi>I—or—we do declare and ſwear by the Eternal God, whom we call to be Judge and Witneſs of our Sincerity herein, That we aſſent to the ſaid Confeſſion of Faith according to the ordinary meaning of the word, without equivocation, mental reſervation, and without accepting any diſpenſation, that we ſhall never endeavour or conſent to any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the foreſaid Confeſſion of Faith.</hi> And his Majeſty, with conſent and advice foreſaid, ſtatutes and ordains, That all who now are in any publick Truſt, ſhall betwixt and the day of next to come, take the ſaid Teſt in ſome of the places wherein they ſerve, and report the ſame to his Majeſties Privy Council, And that all who ſhall hereafter at any time be admitted to any Place, Office, Commiſſion, or Employment, Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, or Military, ſhall at their entry thereto take the ſaid Teſt, and renew the ſame when required, under the paine of Confiſcation of their Lands, which his Majeſty now as then annexes to the Crown; and ſhall confiſcat all ſums of money heretable or movable, and all movable Goods, for the uſe under-written. Like as his Majeſty with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent foreſaid, ordains all the Miniſters who are or ſhall be in this Church, to declare upon Oath to their Ordinary at each Dioceſion meeting, whom they know or ſuſpect within their ſeveral Parichons to be in Orders or Monaſtick Vows of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or other trafiquing Papiſts whom they know or ſuſpect to be the reſſetters or hearers of them ſay Maſs or preach, and where their Reſidence or Haunts are; and whom they know or ſuſpect to be Papiſts in their ſeveral Paroches: And that the Biſhops call before them the perſons ſo delated, and uſe their beſt endeavours to convince them of their Errour, and unite them to this Proteſtant Church, and offer to them the foreſaid Teſt; and in caſe of their abſence and obſtinacy, that they proceed to Excommunication: And that they yearly ſend an Account of their diligence to his Majeſties Privy-Council, in the Moneth of <hi>November;</hi> and that they give a Liſt of the perſons delated to all the Iudges ordinary in Burghs or Landwards within their reſpective Diocies; who are hereby ordained to take all other tryal for the diſcovery of thoſe in Orders or Monaſtick Vows of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other trafiquing Papiſts, or other Papiſts: And that they take the Oaths of all Members of the Kirck-ſeſſion, except the Miniſter, within the ſeveral Iurisdictions, for making of the like Declaration once at leaſt every year; and that they uſe all diligence to put the Laws in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the perſons diſcovered or delated, as afforeſaid: And that they return account of their diligence to his Majeſties Privy-Council once every year in the Moneth of <hi>November,</hi> beginning in <hi>November</hi> next, with Certification that whoſoever ſhall fail in their reſpective diligences above-written, ſhall omit their years Benefice or Stipend, and the ſaid Magiſtrates that years Rent, in which they ſhall happen to fail to diligences, as afforeſaid. Likeas his Majeſty, with Conſent foreſaid, declares, That all Eſcheats, Life-rents, and other Penalties that ſhall befal by the execution of this Statute, or any of the former Statutes againſt Papiſts, except the Lands to which they have redeemable right, ſhall belong and be divided in manner following; <hi>viz.</hi> One third part of the ſums whereon Infeftment have not followed, to the Poor of the Paroch where the party tranſgreſſes and reſides, and the movable Goods to the Poor of the Paroches when they are found; and the ſums whereupon Infeftment or other affectable diligence lies followed, to the Poor of the Paroch where ſuch Lands lie reſpective, except of the Life-rent of ſuch Papiſts who are not amongſt the Trafiquers before innumerat, which may be gifted as his Majeſty ſhall ſee fit: An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And further his Majeſty, with Advice and Conſent foreſaid, ſtatutes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains and declares, That all Kings and Queens who ſhall ſucceed to the Imperial Crown of this Kingdom in time coming, at the entry to their Government, and alſo at their Coronation, ſhall promiſe and ſwear in preſence of the Eternal God, whom they call as Iudge and Witneſs of their ſincere meaning and intention, To obſerve, without diſpenſation from any creature, the Oath contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the eighth Act of the firſt Parliament of King <hi>James 6.</hi> And ſhall alſo ſwear, That they ſhall not endeavour or conſent to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or change of the Proteſtant Religion, nor to the abrogation or derogation of the Laws made for the ſame: That they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and defend this Proteſtant Church in the juſt Rights and Priviledges thereof, as now by Law eſtabliſhed: That they ſhall give no Grant of any Truſt, Office, or Employment within this Church or Kingdom, but whom they believe to be of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion: And that they ſhall always allow &amp; never hinder the ſtanding and executing of the Laws for removing of Prieſts or others in Orders or Monaſtick Vows to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> out of any Office, Place, or Truſt, or Employment Ecleſiaſtick, Civil, or Military, within this Kingdom; and ſhall invincibly preſerve the Liberty and Property of the Subjects of this Kingdom, as the Lord and Father of Mercy ſhall be merciful to them: And ordains, That any Regent, Tutor, or Governor, that ſhall be named to and King or Queen in this Kingdom, ſhall take the foreſaid Oath at their entry to their Government; which Oaths ſhall be written and ſubſcribed at the times of taking thereof above-written, and ſhall be regiſtred and recorded in the Books of Parliament, Privy-Council, and Seſſions.
