            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this <hi>licentious Age,</hi> and especially at this Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Time, when every impertinent <hi>Scribler,</hi>
and seditious <hi>Pamphleter,</hi> hath free access to
the <hi>Press,</hi> it may be thought neither Prudent
nor Honourable, for a Man of Sober and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Thoughts, to come into the <hi>Field</hi> and list
himself among the <hi>Unlearned Multitude</hi> of
<hi>Writers</hi> that are in these days. That Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Applause</hi> which is generally expected from
this <hi>Method,</hi> is a thing which I (more ambitious of being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
useful then publickly known) never designed to purchase at
that rate; and therefore is not the <hi>Motive</hi> that induced me to this
<hi>Undertaking.</hi> I would have been glad, if any other of greater
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> had done the <hi>World</hi> so much <hi>Favour,</hi> as to
have made a <hi>Perfect Disquisition</hi> into this <hi>Matter,</hi> and to have
discussed the <hi>Point</hi> according to the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cause;</hi> for then
I doubt not but the Reasonableness of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons
Dissention</hi> from the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> would have appeared to all
<hi>Impartial</hi> and <hi>Dis-interested Minds.</hi> As for my own part, I confess
that partly through the <hi>Consciousness</hi> of my own <hi>Inability,</hi> and
partly through my <hi>Unwillingness</hi> to be concerned in a Thing of this
<hi>Weight,</hi> I should never have engaged my self in it, if I judged
it not necessary to vindicate those <hi>Persons</hi> that are <hi>abused</hi> with
several <hi>undecent</hi> and <hi>unjust Calumnies,</hi> in a late <hi>Book</hi> intituled.
<hi>The Honours of the Lords Spiritual asserted,</hi> &amp;c. together with
its <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98451:3"/>
This, together with a Desire of <hi>Informing the World</hi> in a Thing
which is much talked of, but little understood, prevailed with me to
omit nothing which might be Serviceable to my Country, and Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive
to the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of this <hi>divided Kingdom</hi>; especially
when it is to be feared, there are too many such as the <hi>Author</hi> of the
above-mentioned <hi>Book,</hi> who under the <hi>specious pretence</hi> of <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Affection</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> do what in them lies to make the
<hi>Gap wider,</hi> and <hi>Distemper</hi> more <hi>Incurable.</hi> That I may not seem to
<hi>injure him,</hi> you may consider the Design of his <hi>Discourse</hi>; The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
against whom he directs his <hi>Preface,</hi> are those who withstood the
<hi>Pretensions of the Bishops to Jurisdiction in Matters of Blood</hi>: those
are no other than that <hi>Honourable Assembly,</hi> those <hi>Champions of
the Protestant Religion, and the Liberties of the People of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>, the House of Commons in the last Parliament.</hi> To Revile
the <hi>Representatives</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and in them <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi>
the <hi>Persons themselves</hi> that are <hi>Represented,</hi> with such Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Aspersions, and Opprobrious Reflections; <hi>Being Favourers
of the Rebellious Commotions in</hi> Scotland<hi>, Ill-natured, Censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
Covetous, Self-seekers</hi>; and which is <hi>worse</hi> than all this, <hi>as
being of the same Principles with those that threw down Epls<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,
took up Arms against their Native Soveraign, Plundred
and Devested His Majesties most faithful Subjects of their Goods,
Estates, and Lands, and embrewed their Violent, Wicked, and
Rebellious Hands in his most Sacred Blood,</hi> &amp;c. I say, such Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilcus
and Satyrical Language thrown upon the very <hi>Face of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
doth ill-become the <hi>Religion of a Christian,</hi> and the <hi>Honesty of
a true English-man.</hi> It is a known <hi>Maxime</hi> among Men of bonest and
sober Principles, and Lovers of the <hi>English Nation, That Nothing
can make us Happy or Miserable, but an Union or Division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our Selves: If there be a good Understanding betwixt
Prince and People, nothing can make</hi> England <hi>miserable; but if
there be Jealousies and Divisions, nothing can make it Happy.</hi>
Therefore, whoever they are, that by <hi>reciprocal Accusations,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>mutual Jealousies</hi> of the <hi>One</hi>'s good Will and Affection, and the
Others Loyalty, especially in things that are false in themselves; deserve
to be lookt upon as inveterate Enemies to the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi>
of this <hi>Kingdom</hi>: And yet you may observe, that whosoever can give
the <hi>Court,</hi> the most <hi>Satyrical Language,</hi> expects to be reckoned the
most <hi>Zealous Patriot,</hi> &amp;c. And those, <hi>forsooth,</hi> who can with the
greatest <hi>Scurrility,</hi> and the most <hi>reproachful</hi> Epithets, asperse the
<hi>House of Commons,</hi> would be thought the <hi>most Loyal Subjects</hi>:
But if <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> it self be not quite banished from the
<hi>Conversation</hi> of <hi>Mortals,</hi> both these sorts of <hi>People</hi> will fail of their
<pb facs="tcp:98451:3"/>
               <hi>Expectation.</hi> I have read of two great Favourites of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great, <hi>Hephestion</hi> and <hi>Craterus</hi>; one of them (saith my
<hi>Author.</hi>) <hi>Alexandrum dilexit,</hi> but the other <hi>dilexit Regem</hi>:
It may be a Question which of these was the better Subject, I
shall not undertake to determine it, but shall leave it with an
Observation of that Noble and truly Loyal <hi>Courtier</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas
Coventry,</hi> Lord Keeper of the <hi>Great Seal</hi> to His late Majesty,
in a Case of the like nature: <hi>Some</hi> (said he to the House of
Lords) <hi>would have the Kings Prerogative rather Tall than
Great, others</hi> e contra<hi>; some do love the King, rather than</hi>
Charles Stuart<hi>;</hi> others <hi>e contra</hi>: (but what his <hi>Sentiment</hi>s were
of <hi>those Matters,</hi> you must gather from what he said a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
<hi>None can be truly Loyal, but he that is a good Patriot;
and none can be a good Patriot, but he that is truly Loyal.</hi>
The Interest of the King and People are so interwoven and linked
together, that none can be truly said to be a Lover of <hi>One,</hi> but
he must be a Lover of <hi>Both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our <hi>Author,</hi> I Protest I have perused the <hi>whole
Volume</hi> with the greatest <hi>Impartiality</hi> that can be; and except
his <hi>Sawciness</hi> and <hi>Ill-nature</hi> against the <hi>House of Commons,</hi>
and <hi>Gentlemen of the Long Robe,</hi> I find nothing in the whole
Book that deserves any <hi>Animadversion:</hi> It is evident from his
<hi>Method of Arguing,</hi> and the <hi>Medium's</hi> he maketh use of to
prove his <hi>Assertion,</hi> that he is altogether a Stranger to the very
State of the <hi>Controversie;</hi> and that notwithstanding his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in Asserting, his Book discovers more <hi>Ignorance,</hi> than his
Preface doth <hi>Petulancy:</hi> And it is no wonder, for <hi>Ignorance</hi> and
<hi>Impudence</hi> are generally Concomitant: And this is all that I
think fit to say in Answer to him. The Reason why I subjoyn the
following <hi>Discourse,</hi> is, because although I cannot perswade my self that
he deserves a <hi>Refutation,</hi> yet that <hi>Truth</hi> which he labours to darken
with an <hi>Impertinent Harangue,</hi> deserves to be <hi>cleared</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated:</hi>
If any shall go about to <hi>Attacque</hi> this <hi>Discourse</hi>
with <hi>Drollery,</hi> or <hi>Satyrical Invectives,</hi> I decleare before-hand, I
do not reckon my self obliged to <hi>Reply;</hi> I do not think it a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi>
for <hi>Men of Sense</hi> to <hi>Combate at these Weapons;</hi>
But if Occasion be, I shall send his <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Dung-Carts,</hi>
or <hi>Oyster-Boats,</hi> from whence I doubt not, but he shall receive due
<hi>Correction</hi> for his <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Impudence;</hi> but if he Assault it
with <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> he shall find a Defence agreeable. I
must confess I am heartily sorry at the Occasion of this <hi>Dispute,</hi>
it hath unhappily fallen out at that Moment of Time, when above
<pb facs="tcp:98451:4"/>
all things it was necessary for the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> to <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
and joyn Hand in Hand, to the <hi>Ruine</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> of the
<hi>Common Enemy,</hi> and the Extirpation of that <hi>Poysonous Plant,</hi>
whose growth will quickly become fatal to both: but however, as it is
hard on the one side, that any should be compelled to lay down that
which they suppose is their <hi>Right;</hi> so on the other side, it is a thing
unreasonable and of dangerous Consequence, to admit of any Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though it were in a Matter of far less Moment than this is:
so that there is great Reason for both sides to insist upon it. If
this <hi>Enterprise</hi> of mine be so successful, as to convince those that
are in the mistake, then I compass my End, and am Satisfied; which
that it may do, I refer you to the Consideration of the following
<hi>Discourse.</hi>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
OF THE
Peerage and Jurisdiction of the Lords Spiritual.</head>
            <p>AS the granting of large Immunities, Priviledges, and Possessions to the
Church, doth well become the Piety and Religion of a Christian Prince,
or any other Supream Power; And as the robbing of the Church of any
of its Just Rights, lawfully granted, is Sacriledge of the Highest Nature:
So it is the Duty of all the Sons of the Church, upon all Occasions, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to acknowledge the Bounty and Munificence of their Pious Benefactors, and to
forbear all unjust Claims and ambitious Pretensions to things which were never grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
A failure in this is almost as great an Immorality (considering the Quality and
Profession of the Offenders) as the former. And it is doubtless not onely lawful, but
commendable, for the persons whose Right and Property is invaded in either case, to
defend themselves with all their power against the Invaders; otherwise we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
our Ancestors, who defended the Kings Prerogative, and the Subjects Right,
when it was encroached upon by Procurers of Citations and Process of Provisions and
Reservations of Benefices, Dispensations for Pluralities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the <hi>Court of Rome;</hi>
and withstood those unreasonable Demands of Absolute Exemption from Secular
Power made by the Clergy; and several other things about Marriages, Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they claimed by vertue of several Decretals of their Popes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils:
I confess if there were either Statute-Law or Common-Law for the <hi>Bishops</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Capital Cases, I would be very far from arguing against it, for that were to
call in question their undoubted Right. But if there be any reason to make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they have no Right at all in that case, I hope it will be excusable in me to make
an Impartial Enquiry into the Thing.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Spiritual Lords</hi> have any right of Judicature in Capital Cases, it must be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or <hi>Jure Humano;</hi> if the former, it must be proved out of the <hi>New
Testament,</hi> for there is no consequence from the Authority and Jurisdiction of the <hi>High
Priest</hi> under the Law to the Authority of <hi>Bishops</hi> under the Gospel, and that is the
most generally received Opinion among the Protestant Divines, those at least who
have lifted themselves under the Banner of the <hi>Protèstant Religion,</hi> in its defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the exorbitant power and usurpation of the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> who makes use of
the same Argument for the Authority of his Holiness <hi>in Cathedra:</hi> Because whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is alledged out of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> is either part of the Mosaical method of
administring Justice, proper onely to the Judaical Oeconomy; or else belonging to
the Temporal Constitution of the Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> which are no more
binding to us, than those Laws of theirs whereby each man recovered his right and
property: or than the Laws of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> or any other Nation were binding to
the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those Instances that are given of so great trust reposed in, and Honours conferred
upon, Spiritual persons by <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> after the first three Centuries, can prove
no more, but that so was the Constitution of the Government of those Kingdoms; and
it doth not follow that therefore it must be so in all other Kingdoms: for which cause
it is evident, that the first Four Chapters of the Gentlemans Book, are altogether
impertinent.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Spiritual Lords</hi> ground not their Claim upon <hi>Divine Right,</hi> then if they
have any at all, it must be by <hi>Humane Institution:</hi> My business is not to examine
whether such an Institution were good and reasonable, or not? That I leave to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98451:5"/>
Consideration of the Parliament, in whose Determination every true Subject ought
heartily to acquiess: but all that I have to do, is to examine whether or no there be
such an Institution, and that is the point Which I intend to insist upon.</p>
            <p>No Humane institution can do their Lordships any kindness in this, except the
Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and those are of two sorts, either Statute-Law, or Common-Law:
The former is not pretended to; the onely question is about the latter: for that
same Law which gives them power to sit in the House of Lords in any case, gives
them power also to sit in Capital Cases, if they have any such power; and that they
have no such power by the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> is the <hi>Probindum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those in whose power Originally it was at the first reduction of this Nation under
Rules of Government to Invest Religious Persons with <hi>Honours, Jurisdictions</hi> and
<hi>Priviledges;</hi> might by the same power have made them greater or lesser than they
did; and consequently might at the first Institution have limited the same <hi>Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
&amp;c. to such and such matters as they themselves thought fit to intrust them
with, and not to others. If those persons that first conferred upon some of our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men
that <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> which they now enjoy of Voting in the <hi>High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iament,</hi>
had given it indefinitely in all Matters, and over all Causes, and they had
exercised their Jurisdiction accordingly from time to time, then their right had been
indubitable; but if this limitation had been made, that their <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to all Causes, except such as are Capital, and they never exercised any <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
in such; then there cannot be any colour or ground of Claim. Now the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law</hi> is a general Custom or Usage in this Realm in all Ages practised and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
beyond the memory of man; and because there is no Record, nor any other
undeniable Evidence of its commencement, it is therefore presumed to have been a
Law ever since there hath been any Government in this Nation: Seeing therefore that
the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> is supposed to be as ancient as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
it self; If it can be proved that by the Common Law (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the continued
practice of all Ages, the Transactions whereof are Recorded, the Clergy never did
exercise <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> in Cases of Blood: then inasmuch as no Record maketh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
what time this Custom did begin, we must of necessity presume that their not Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Capital Cases, is as ancient as their Voting in any Case; and consequently
that those who first conferred upon them their <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> gave it
with this limitation, that it should not extend to Capital Cases.</p>
            <p>This being premised, I shall proceed to prove that by the Common Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(if not by an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi>) the <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi> have no right to Vote
in Capital Cases: That will be done if I demonstrate these two things;<list>
                  <item n="1">1. That their Voting in Capital Cases is contrary to the intent and meaning of
<hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item n="2">2. That it is contrary to the known practice of all Ages until this day.
The first I shall prove from the Reason and Nature of the thing, and from Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>By the 29th of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it is ordained, that, <hi>Nullus liber homo capiatur vel
imprisonetur, &amp;c. aut ut. lagetur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo destruatur, nec super
cum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus nisiper legale judicium parium suorum, &amp;c.</hi> And
accordingly the Precept of the Lord High Steward to a Serjeant at Arms, is to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>Tot &amp; tales Dominos Magnates, &amp; proceres hujus Regni Angliae praedicti R.
Comitis pares, &amp;c. Co.</hi> 3. <hi>Inst.</hi> 28. Whence it is evident that every Judge must be
a <hi>Peer</hi> (<hi>par</hi>) to the Prisoner; and I do think it a very easie matter to prove that no
<hi>Spiritual Lord</hi> as such, is Invested with that <hi>Parity</hi> which is requisite within the
intent of <hi>Magha Charta,</hi> to constitute him a sufficient Judge upon the life and death
of a Temporal Lord: Before I enter upon the proof of this, it will be necessary to say
something of the Nature of their Peerage.</p>
            <p>Their Peerage doth accrue either by the Investitute of their Bishopricks, <hi>ipso facto,</hi>
or by their Summons to Parliament; it is agreed by all Authors of greatest Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that they are Parliamentary Lords immediately by their Investiture and Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into the Temporalities, which are held of the King <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98451:5"/>
Lords of Parliament only <hi>ratione tenurae;</hi> so is <hi>Coke, Stamford, Selden,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
But they are not intituled to any more Honour or Jurisdiction by their Writs,
for these, two Reasons: 1. Because a <hi>Summons</hi> to Parliament cannot of its self create
a Baron, for then all the Kings Judges, Serieants and Councel had been ennobled in
divers Parliaments in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. in all of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and most of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. for
they had then the self-same Writ that Earls and Barons had, yea and the Kings two
Escheators had the same Writ, <hi>Annu</hi> 12. and 14 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. The first Summons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
upon Record is that of 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3. which is one joynt Summons to all the Lords
and Judges, and is the same in substance with the Writ of Summons at this day,
which is given to the Lords, and differs onely in matter of Form. <hi>Anno</hi> 23. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.
<hi>Jan.</hi> 23. The Writs are several, the only difference is in the Style, and the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Super ar duis negotiis quibusdam nos &amp; Regnum nostrum &amp; vos ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terosque
de eodem Regno tangentibus, &amp;c.</hi> To the Bishops and other Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
To the Temporal Lords after the style the Writ runs. <hi>Nos, &amp;c. &amp; vos caeteros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

de consilio nostros, &amp;c. tangentibus.</hi> But in all these, the <hi>Mandamus,</hi> which
is the most essential part of the Writ, is the very same; <hi>viz. Vobis Mandamis ut, &amp;c.
personaliter inter sitis super dictis negotiis cum Rege, &amp; caeteris magnatibus &amp; proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,
&amp;c. trataturi vestrumque consilium impensuri,</hi> &amp;c. The same is the 27 of
<hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and almost in all the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and from the 20th to the 49th year of
<hi>Edw.</hi> 3. That which I infer from this is, that either a Writ of its self without the
performance of other Ceremonies, as <hi>Investiture of Robes,</hi> &amp;c. cannot make a man
Noble; or else the Judges in those Four Kings Reigns having the same <hi>Mandamus</hi> in
their Writs which the Earls and Barons had <hi>verbatim,</hi> and the same in substance with
the <hi>Mandamus</hi> to Peers at this day, were all ennobled.</p>
            <p>And further, There doth frequently occur in ancient Records and Writings a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between <hi>Barones majores,</hi> and <hi>Barones minores;</hi> the first are called some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Barons,</hi> and the other <hi>Barons Peers.</hi> That they both received their Writs and
sate in Parliament, is undeniable: The Nobility of the first was without doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable,
but so was not the last, but were called <hi>Barons Peers,</hi> because of the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of their Reyenue. Thus saith the <hi>Modus tenendi Parliamentum,</hi> (always allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

minores,</hi> because of the Parity of their Revenue, were called or omitted <hi>ad libitum,</hi>
though the <hi>majores</hi> ought to be summoned <hi>de jure;</hi> which proves a Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to Parliament, doth not ennoble the Party, otherwise this Difference must fall
to the ground. The Roll of 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>N.</hi> 35. Is that the Cause of Summons was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the presence of the King and divers Lords there named, <hi>&amp; autres Barones,
&amp; Bannerettes. Chevaliers de Comites, Citizens &amp; Burgeiis, &amp;c.</hi> So 46 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>N</hi> 7.
the Roll is, <hi>Dukes, Earls, Barons and Bannerets:</hi> And in many of the Parliament
Rolls of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. it occurs by the <hi>Prelates, Earls, Barons, and other Grandees;</hi> by
which it is evident, that anciently there sate in the House of Lords sometimes some
that were under the Degree of a Baron, and they could not be Lords by Inheritance,
because a <hi>Barony</hi> is the lowest Degree of Inheritable Nobility; but they could not be
there present without their Writs; It doth therefore follow, that a Writ, together with
an Appearance in obedience to it, doth not Ennoble the Party. <hi>Note,</hi> That anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
the King by his Letters could have discharged any Banneret from serving in
the Lower House; because, if he pleased, he might upon occasions have summoned
him to serve in the House of Lords; and that is apparent from a Record in the 7th of
<hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>R.</hi> 42. <hi>dorso.</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Camoys</hi> was chosen one of the Knights of the Shire for
<hi>Surrey,</hi> and his Father and Grandfather had been summoned to several Parliaments
before: the King discharged this Gentleman from serving in the House of Commons,
because <hi>Ipse</hi> (saith the Record) <hi>&amp; quam plures Antecessores sui</hi> Banneretri <hi>fuerint:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98451:6"/>
Nos animadvertentes quod hujusmodi</hi> Banneretti <hi>ante haec tempora in</hi> Milites Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus
<hi>eligi minime consueverunt, &amp;c.</hi> If this <hi>Camoys</hi> had been reputed a <hi>Baron,</hi> the
Country would never have chose him; and if he had been really a <hi>Baron,</hi> the King
would never have discharged him because he was a <hi>Banneret,</hi> but because he was
a <hi>Baron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Reason for this may be gathered out of the Patent of <hi>John Beauchamp</hi> of
<hi>Holt,</hi> the words of which are these:—<hi>Sciatis quod pro bonis &amp; gratuitis servitiis,
quae dilectus &amp; fidelis Miles noster</hi> Johannes <hi>de</hi> Beauchamp, <hi>de</hi> Holt, <hi>seneschallus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitii
nostri, nobis impendit, ac loco per ipsum tempore corenationis nostrae hucusque
impensis, &amp; quempro Nobis tenere poterit in futurum in nostris consiliis &amp; parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
nec non, &amp;c. ipsum</hi> Johannem <hi>in unum</hi> Parium <hi>&amp;</hi> Baronum <hi>Regni nostri Angliae
praesecimus, volentes quod idem</hi> Johannes <hi>&amp; haeredes masculi de corpore suo exeuntes
statum</hi> Baronis <hi>obtineant, ac Domini de</hi> Beauchamp <hi>&amp;</hi> Barones <hi>de</hi> Kiderminster <hi>nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupentur,
in cujus, &amp;c. T. Rege apud</hi> Wodestock, 10. <hi>Oct.</hi> It is probable that he was
created <hi>Baron</hi> before he received this Patent, because the Patent wants the words of
Creation; <hi>Ipsum Johannem praefecimus:</hi> but it is not said, <hi>per praesentes praeficimus;</hi>
and therefore the Patent running in the <hi>preterperfect tense</hi> could have no other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
but only to Record a thing which was past: but he was not Created by Writ
before the Patent, because it is dated <hi>Oct.</hi> 10. and he received no Writ till the <hi>Decem.</hi>
following: Wherefore seeing that undoubtedly he was a Baron before he received
either Patent or Writ; for the Patent, which is Matter of Record, saith, <hi>Ipsum praefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus;</hi>
it follows, that before this time a Baron hath been created without a Writ,
which could be no otherwise then by the performance of a Ceremony, as <hi>Investiture
of Robes,</hi> &amp;c. and this Patent was only an entring of the Creation, <hi>being a transitory
thing</hi> upon Record.</p>
            <p>2. Admitting that <hi>Barons</hi> have been created by Writs, yet <hi>Prelates</hi> are not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Barons</hi> by their Writs, because there is a difference between a Writ sent to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that hath no right <hi>ex debito justitiae</hi> to demand it; and a Writ sent to one that
was a Lord of Parliament before, and ought <hi>de jure</hi> to have been summoned. The
former, together with the persons obedience, may perhaps make him a Baron: but the
latter <hi>I conceive</hi> doth not make any addition to, or enlargement of, their precedent
Honour, but only summons them to exercise their Jurisdiction, and put that power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which they have in execution, and that is only <hi>reducere potentiam in actum,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
every Lord would be newly created at every Parliament; every one to whom
the Honour is entailed, would have a Fee-simple, for a Writ will make a man a Peer
in Fee without the word (Heirs) and every Lord Bishop, L. Keeper, L. Treasurer,
L. Privy Seal, would be as such Inheritable Peers, or at least for life, which are both
false; for after Regradation their Peerage is ended: Wherefore it being certain that
all the Lords both Spiritual and Temporal ought to be summoned to every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Summons must of necessity have respect to that <hi>Right</hi> which doth entitle
them to demand them.</p>
            <p>The Inference which I draw from all this, is, That the Lords Spiritual having no
Peerage upon the account of their Writs, cannot claim any at all, except it be <hi>Jure
Episcopatus,</hi> (that is) <hi>ratione terrarum quas tenent per Baroniam.</hi> So that now I
come to the next point; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether such whose Peerage is <hi>ratione tenure,</hi> and
dies either with the determination of his Estate in the Land, or the dissolution of the
Tenure, be a competent Judge of one whose blood is ennobled in case of life and
death, within the meaning and intent of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which enacts that every one
shall be tryed <hi>per legale judicium parium suorum.</hi> The <hi>Negative</hi> I hope effectually to
prove from these following Reasons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every ones <hi>Peerage</hi> ought to be measured and proportioned according to the
limits and extent of that <hi>ratione cujus</hi> he is a <hi>Peer;</hi> he that is a <hi>Peer,</hi> not only upon
the account of his Possessions, but also upon the account of the quality and nobility
of his Blood, hath a right of Judicature and Legislation both in those things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
Mens Estates and Properties, and also in those things that concern Life and
Death; buthe that hath no <hi>Peerage</hi> but what is <hi>praedial</hi> or <hi>feudal,</hi> and not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98451:6"/>
a <hi>Peerage</hi> accruing by vertue of his Tenure and Possessions, and not the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his Blood, can have no Jurisdiction but such as is agreeable to the nature of
his Peerage; that is, such as shall extend to matters of Property and Possession, but
not to matters of Blood; for as to this he is no more a Peer (<hi>i. e. Par</hi>) to a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Lord, than any private Gentleman, and therefore hath no more Jurisdiction;
for it is Parity that makes a man capable of Jurisdiction within the Statute: This is
confirmed by the Authority of that Learned Antiquary, Mr. <hi>John Selden,</hi> in the
first Edition, of his <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> a Volume in <hi>Quorto,</hi> 347, (which I the rather
cite, because it was Printed in King <hi>James</hi> his time, and therefore not liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception)
his words are these; <hi>A Bishop shall not be tried by</hi> Peers <hi>in Capital Crimes,
because these are personal, and his being a</hi> Baron, <hi>is</hi> Ratione Tenurae, <hi>and not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Nobility.</hi> So it is in Br. Abr. Tit. Enquest 99. <hi>Although in an Action for Land,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>a Bishop shall have Knights in his Jury, as other Lords, yet when he is tryed
for his life</hi> (it's said) <hi>he shall not have Knights in his Jury:</hi> By Which Book it is
evident, that a Bishop is a <hi>Peer</hi> not in respect of his Person, but of his Possessions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The whole Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is a Grant or rather a Confirmation of the
Priviledges and Liberties of the Subjects of <hi>England;</hi> and it is to be supposed that the
enjoyment of every of those Priviledges that are there granted, is a great advantage
and happiness to the Subject: but wherein the advantage of a mans being tryed <hi>per
Pares</hi> doth lie, is a Point worth the Consideration: I conceive it to be this, When
those are to be Judges, who may be under the same Circumstances with the Prisoner,
and when by their Judgment the Prisoner can lose nothing but what his Judges; if
they be under his Circumstances may lose also; he may expect that they will not give
Judgment but upon Mature Deliberation, and that the Consideration that it may be
their own case will deter them from giving a rash judgment against a man that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
or not apparently guilty: Whereas if a mans Life and Fortune, his Honour,
the Inheritable Quality of his Blood, his Name and Reputation, and whatsoever may
be comfortable in this World, were disposable at the will and pleasure of inferiour
persons, who have not every of these themselves, and consequently know not the
true value and worth of them, nor the importance of the matter that is judicially
before them; it may be presumed that they will not be so careful and concerned in
the Cause; and it is to be feared they will be too ready to give an inconsiderate and
rash judgment. This I take to be the onely benefit of a mans being tryed by his
Peers, which is very significantly expressed in the Statute <hi>De Proditoribus,</hi> 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
<hi>cap.</hi> 2. in these words; <hi>Et de ceo soit provablement attaint de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>overt fait per gents
de lour condition,</hi> &amp;c. But to apply this to our present design, let us consider what a
Temporal Lord loseth by an Attainder; In the first place he loseth his Life, his Estate
real and personal: If that were all, a Gentleman might be his Peer; but there is
something more, he forefeits his Nobility, which is irrecoverable, being quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished;
the inheritable quality of his Blood is thereby corrupted, the House of Lords
themselves suffer with him, for they lose a Member for ever: But a Bishop forfeits
nothing but what he hath in his Natural Capacity, and if he be considered as such,
he is no Peer; if he be considered as a Bishop, <hi>i. e.</hi> As holding Lands of such a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
in the Right of his Bishoprick of the King, he is a Peer, but his Peerage is in no
danger through his Attainder; the succession (which he is supposed to be as tender
of as a Natural person is of his Posterity) is not thereby tainted; for his Peerage, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all his Posterity and Land, <hi>Ratione cujus</hi> he is a Peer, go to the Successor
without any restauration; (see <hi>Stamford</hi> 187. 6.) and so the House of Lords lose
never a Member: How then can Bishops, having no Nobility which they can lose,
and consequently not being <hi>Gents de lour condition,</hi> be fit Judges upon the Life and
Death of Noble men? And upon what grounds can more Justice be expected from
such than from honest substantial Freeholders?</p>
            <p>If this do not please, let any of the most violent Maintainers of this pretended Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally-spiritual
Jurisdiction give a rational account, wherein the advantage of a
mans being tryed by his <hi>Peers,</hi> doth consist; and let him make appear that the Lords
Temporal are any Sharers of this Priviledge when they are tryed by <hi>Bishops,</hi> and I am
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98451:7"/>
satisfied; but till then; he must give me leave to conclude, that this Jurisdiction
which is pretended to, is an abuse of the Satute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and therefore a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
offered to the Liberties of the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Bishops are not <hi>Peers</hi> in that sense the Question is above stated in, because
they shall not themselves be tryed by <hi>Peers</hi> in <hi>Parliament:</hi> If their <hi>Parity</hi> be not
sufficient to Entitle them to demand a Tryal by Temporal Lords, then they cannot
be Peers, so as to be Judges upon the Tryal of Temporal Lords: but if they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Peers</hi> to all intents and purposes, then we charge all our Ancestors with a gross
Violation of the Subjects Priviledges granted by <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> for every Bishop is
<hi>Liber homo,</hi> a Subject of this Realm, and ought of Right to have the benefit of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Priviledge of being tryed by his Peers: But seeing by the constant practise in
former Ages, even in those times when the Tyranny of ambitious Prelates, and the
Insolence of Popish Usurpers, did swell to so great a height; when the poor credulous
affrightned Laity, were glad for fear of being delivered Prisoners <hi>In manus &amp; custodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Diaboli,</hi> and secluded from the Society and Conversation of Mankind, to truckle
at the Feet of the domineering Clergy, and condescend to almost all their Demands,
however unreasonable or unjust they were; insomuch, that Innovations in favour
of them were easily allowed, and new acquisitions of Honour and Power easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
I say, if in those times the Honour of being Tryed by Peers hath been denied
to them, it may well be inferred that they had no Right; for if it were a thing which
they had any colour of pretension to, is it reasonable to suppose that they quietly
without reluctancy would resign it? when we have Records and Histories full of
their Clamours for breach of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> of their Contentions with their Liege
Lord and Sovereign in things that were against the known and established Laws of
the Kingdom, tending to the diminution of the Kings Prerogative, the hindring of
the Execution of Justice upon Malefactors, and the dispossessing and injurious Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Subject from his just and hereditary Right, where they had no reason in
the world for it, onely that they were inflamed with indignation, that the Native
Courage and inbred Generosity of Mind that was in our Ancestors, not induring
themselves to be trod upon, nor their Necks to be laid under a Yoke of Tyranny
and Usurpation; did obstruct the unsufferable growth of that Power and Dominion

I shall begin with <hi>Adam de Orleton,</hi> or <hi>Tarleton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> who in the

Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> and aiding him with Horse and Arms in open Rebellion;
whereupon he was ordered to the Barr of the House of Lords; he made no Answer to
those Crimes that were laid to his charge, only that he was <hi>Suffragan</hi> to the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was his direct Judge under the <hi>Pope,</hi> and without his leave
and the consent of his Fellow-Bishops he would not answer: Now although the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Articuli Cleri</hi> restraining the benefit of Clergy to <hi>Felony,</hi> was made but eight
years before this, yet the rest of the Clergy in that disorderly time (observe the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Obedience, and Loyalty of our Spiritual Fathers in those days) had
the impudence in the presence of the King, to pull him violently from the Barr
and deliver him to the Archbishop: <note place="margin">

            <p>But to come somewhat nearer our times; <hi>Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> is Indicted,
Arraigned, and Tryed by a Common Jury, for speaking Treasonable Words against
an Act of Parliament made the 26 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. making the King Head of the Church, and

            <p>The last that I shall name, is that Holy and Renowned <hi>Martyr,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
who was Tryed with Lady <hi>Jane Gray,</hi> and her Husband Lord <hi>Guilford,</hi> and
two younger Sons of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland, Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi>
before the Lord Mayor and Judges, the Third Day of <hi>Nov.</hi> in the First Year of
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, 1553. Where they were all found Guilty, and Condemed of
High Treason. None of these were Executed upon this Judgment, except Lady <hi>Jane
Gray</hi> and her Husband, who upon a Second Miscarriage of her Father the Duke of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> in joyning with Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> to oppose King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Landing, were
Executed in the <hi>Tower</hi> the 12th of <hi>Febr.</hi> following: On the 20th of <hi>April</hi> following,
<hi>Cranmer, Ridley,</hi> and <hi>Latimer,</hi> were adjudged Hereticks at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Degraded
by Commission from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and a little after Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> succeded <hi>Cranmer,</hi>
who was burnt as a Heretick 14th of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1556. All this is known to those that are
acquainted with the Transactions of those times; and therefore it is evident both
from the Authority of Learned Men, and the Practice of all Ages in all times, that
Bishops have been Tryed by Common Juries: And sure it was not without ground
that so Grave and Judicious an Author as <hi>Camden,</hi> should say, That the Spiritual Lords
enjoy all the Priviledges that Temporal Lords do, saving only the business of Tryal
by Peers.</p>
            <p>Having thus proved what I before asserted concerning the Tryal of Lords Spiritual;
I shall in the next place consider the Answers that are generally made to these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Authorities. Those I observe to be principally two: <list>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98451:8"/>
                  <item n="1">1. They will very well agree with those Authors that say; Bishops are not to be
Tryed by Peers; but then (say they) it was not for want of Peerage, but because
they would not be put to answer for any Capital Crime before Lay-Judges.</item>
                  <item n="2">2. They say, that if it happened that at any time a Bishop was Tryed by Lay-men
and by Common Juries, then they were first Degraded.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If there were no more to be said for this, the very reading of the fore-mentioned
Precedents would easily make appear the weakness of these Objections; for it appears
by the very Records, that their Priviledge of Clergy was insisted upon, and that
with a great deal of Zeal and Fervency; insomuch that the Passage of the Bishop of
<hi>Hereford,</hi> is a thing taken notice of in a special manner by all the most Famous Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
of this Nation; and it is generally agreed, that about Fourteen Bishops came
with their Crosses erected to the place of Judgment, threatning all people with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
that offered to oppose them in that which they intended; and yet
we find that he was not delivered till after he was found Guilty: And it's manifest
from all the other Precedents, that they were found Guilty, and most of them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to die upon the Verdict of Twelve Lay-men. But as to the business<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
you may observe, that throughout the whole Records they are named
Bishops, as <hi>Episcopus Herefordensis, Eliensis</hi> and <hi>Roffensis,</hi> which could not be if
they were Degraded; for then these Titles were not rightful additions in Law.
And although it being evident that so it was <hi>de facto,</hi> is a sufficient Answer to the
Objections; yet for more abundant satisfaction, I shall be somewhat more large in
this, and shall shew that so it ought to be <hi>de jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling this Point, I shall consider these following Particulars: <list>
                  <item n="1">1. To whom this <hi>Privilegium Clericale,</hi> or Exemption from Temporal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ought to have been allowed?</item>
                  <item n="2">2. I shall consider somewhat of the Nature of this Exemption and Immunity, and
how far they were exempted from Secular Power.</item>
                  <item n="3">3. I shall examine in what Cases it was allowed, and in what, not.</item>
                  <item n="4">4. At what time.</item>
                  <item n="5">5. Upon what account it was that Clergy-men were delivered to their Ordinaries
in those Cases where the benefit of Clergy was not allowed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, I shall shew at what time regularly they were Degraded.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As for the first, It was generally allowed to all within Holy Orders, whether
Secular, or Regular, and in an equal Degree to all such, not respecting Superiority,
or Inferiority: The poor Country-Parson had as good and as large a Right to it, as
my Lord Bishop. This is proved, first, From the Canons that gave this Immunity;
the first (I think) were made by Pope <hi>Gaius,</hi> and those run; <hi>Clericus coram Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
Seculari Judicari non debet nec aliquid contra ipsum fieri, per quod ad pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
mortis vel ad mutilationem membrorum valeat perveniri,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Linwood Tit.
de foro compet. c. contingit. Polichro. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 24. <hi>of Pope Gaius, and</hi> Onuphrius <hi>in
his Comment upon</hi> Platina, <hi>in the life of that Pope.</hi> Therefore seeing he cannot take
any advantage of these Canons, except as <hi>Clericus,</hi> and must claim it by the same
Name that inferiour Priests do, he must have it in the same Degree. But that which
is a great deal stronger than the Construction of Canons, is the Confirmation that is
made by our Acts of Parliament; this Priviledge is granted to all that are <hi>Clerici,</hi> or
<hi>Clerks</hi> in French, and <hi>Clergy-men</hi> in English; and to all such indefinitely without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
or respect of the several Ranks and Degrees of men within Holy Orders:
So you will find it in <hi>Marlebridge c.</hi> 28. <hi>West.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>Art. Cler. c.</hi> 15. 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4, &amp; 5.
4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3. and the rest. So that without all question, a Bishop can pretend to no
more Priviledge than any other Clerk <hi>causa qua supra.</hi> This I thought fit to observe
first, because that every Authority and Precedent that I shall bring of an inferiour
Priest, is as strong for my purpose, as if it were of a Bishop.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As for the second Point, I shall not need to be very large upon it, but shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
one thing which will be serviceable to my present purpose, and that is this:
That every Temporal Magistrate and Judge of this Kingdom, hath, and in all times
ever had, by the Common Law, Jurisdiction over every Subject in the same Degree
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98451:9"/>
of Nobility that was resident within the Verge and local extent of his Jurisdiction:
This Power and Authority of his being Universal, he was never bound to take notice
of the Priviledges and Immunities of any particular Orders and Societies of Men, if
they themselves would not take advantage of it; so that this same <hi>Previlegium
Clericale</hi> was no absolute exemption from Secular Authority, so as to make all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
before a Secular Judge, to be <hi>Coram non Judice:</hi> but the end and design of
it was, that when any Clergy-man was Arraigned as a Malefactor before a Secular
Judge, then in some Cases, before he suffered the punishment that was due by Law, he
was delivered to his Ordinary to make his Purgation; if he could, then his Ordinary
discharged him; but if he could not, then he was Degraded and sent back to the
Temporal Magistrate to suffer punishment according to his Demerits. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of a Secular Judge upon one within Holy Orders, are not <hi>Coram non Judice,</hi>
might be proved both out of Civilians and Canonists; but that would not be much
to the purpose if I should, and therefore I shall forbear; only shall take notice of a
Passage in Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi>'s <hi>View of the Civil and Ecclesiastical Law,</hi> pag. 86. <hi>If a
Clerk</hi> (says he) <hi>be first Arrested by his Spiritual Judge, and found guilty, he shall
be Degraded and delivered over to the Temporal power; but if he be first Arrested
by the Secular Magistrate, and Tryed, and found Guilty, he shall be delivered to the
Bishop to be deprived, and then delivered back to punishment.</hi> The same in effect he
saith <hi>p.</hi> 158. whereby he doth allow, that according to the Ecclesiastical Law, the
Temporal Judges were allowed to have Jurisdiction over men within Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
But let him or any of the Civilians or Canonists say what they will, it's no
great matter; we must consider what the Law of <hi>England</hi> saith in this case: for the
Canons never were in force in <hi>England</hi> any further than they were voluntarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and so transmitted as a common Usage or Custom to Posterity by Tradition,
and so became part of the Common Law; or else were confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so became part of our Statute-Law, of which more hereafter. And that
by the Law of <hi>England</hi> the Proceedings against Ecclesiastical Persons before a Secular
Judge, are not <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> I prove by these Cases: An Appeal of Robbery
was brought against a Monk, who was tryed and acquitted; upon this the Abbot and
the Monk brought a Writ of Conspiracy against divers who procured and abetted the
said Appeal: whereupon the Defendants appear, and go to Tryal; but the Abbot and
Monk get a Verdict and Judgment to recover 1000 Marks damages, <hi>Co.</hi> 2. <hi>Inst.</hi> 638.
But it is certain, that a Writ of Conspiracy cannot lye except the Plaintiff had been <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimo
modo acquietatus,</hi> and that he could not be, if the whole Proceedings upon
the Appeal had been <hi>Coram non Judice.</hi> So if at the Common Law a Clergy-man
had been Indicted of Felony, and had confessed the Fact in Court, he could not have
had the benefit of his Clergy, because the end of granting it, was, that he might make
his Purgation before the Spiritual Judge, but that he could not after he had confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Fact in Court. <hi>Co. ubi supra, Stamford</hi> 124. And yet no Confession <hi>coram non
Judice</hi> is conclusive. All which doth evidently prove, That the allowance of those
Canons which gave the first birth to this Immunity, did not trench to the prejudice
of Temporal Judges, so as to bar them of that Jurisdiction which they have over
every Subject by the Common Law: And the Nature of it will further appear, if
we take into consideration the Third Particular, which is this:</p>
            <p n="3">III. In what Cases the benefit of Clergy was allowable, and in what not; This
Immunity was allowed in <hi>England</hi> long before any Statute was made for its confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
it was allowed onely in such cases as were judged reasonable, but never in
full satisfaction to the demands of the Clergy: <hi>Kellaway.</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 181. <hi>b.</hi> But the
Clergy (as their Custom then was) were willing to improve any Concession to their
best advantage, according to the common Proverb, <hi>When they had got an Inch, they
would take an Ell.</hi> And to that end did with a great deal of fervency and zeal (no
doubt) insist upon their Priviledge as an absolute Exemption from all Temporal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
to all intents and purposes, extending to all Crimes and Offences what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
and thundring out Excommunications, and such like Maledictions, forced
some people for quietness sake to comply with them, (as appears by <hi>Bracton,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98451:9"/>
lib. fol.</hi> 123.) to the great incouragement of all sorts of Villanies and Outrages, and
consequently to the grievous oppression and vexation of the Subject: for this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or at least hopes of Impunity, let loose the Reigns of Rapine and Violence,
and was the most effectual course that could be taken for the dissolution of any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the utter desolation and ruine of any Country whatsoever. <note place="margin">Vide Parliam. held at Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon. 11. H. 2.</note> To give
a check to this exorbitant Licentiousness, strict care is taken by the Judges
and Magistrates, that Justice be duly executed, and Offenders legally
punished; and therefore the <hi>Privilegium Clericale</hi> not to be allowed in
any Case otherwise then according to the ancient Custom: Hence were the
seeds of Envy and of a very lasting Discord between Church and State sown; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Animosities, Rancour, Revenge and Hatred, is the Subject of the History
of those times, especially the time of <hi>Thomas Beckett:</hi> Bulls, Citations, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
on the one side, and seising of Temporalities, Imprisonment and Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
on the other side, were the Complements that people were entertained with
in those days: These Differences grew to such a height, that although through a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Reconciliation, both Parties seemed to be pacified; yet the Root of the Matter
remaining untouched, the Fewds break forth, and the Matter must be decided by Act
of Parliament: And so I shall by the construction of these old Statutes, and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents,
give a direct Answer to the Question.</p>
            <p>1. It is undeniable, that <hi>Privilegium Clericale</hi> was never allowed to any that
were Guilty of <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis:</hi> The first Statute that we find among the
Printed Statutes, which doth directly speak of it, is <hi>Westm. </hi>1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. which is declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of the Common Law by the express words of the Statute, <hi>Solonque le Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
avant ces heures use,</hi> but faith not one word of Treason, only allows the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
in Cases of Felony, <hi>Si Clearke soit prise pur rette de Felony.</hi> Wherefore this
Statute being in the Affirmative, determines nothing concerning Treason, but leaves
that as it was before at the Common Law. Not long after the Clergy renewed their
Complaints, and among the rest, complain that Secular Judges have passed Judgment
of Death upon men within Holy Orders, and claim their Priviledge absolutely and
generally in Articles several, which they presented to the King in Parliament. To
this they receive Answer by the Statute commonly called <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi> in these
words: <hi>Clericus ad Ecclesiam confugiens pro Felonia pro Immunitate Ecclesiastica ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinenda,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>gaudebit Libertate Ecclesiastica, juxta laudabilem consuetudinem Regni
hactenus usitatam.</hi> This being an Answer much like the former, did not sufficiently
answer their Desires, expressing only Felony; nor on the other side did it hinder the
Temporal Judges from proceeding against them, as against Lay-men in Cases of High
Treason, as they had done always before: Wherefore they do afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
25th of <hi>E.</hi> 3. make a grievous Complaint, that the Kings Judges had given Judgment
of High Treason against <hi>Houby</hi> and <hi>Cibthorp,</hi> Priests, and several other Religious
Persons, whereby they were Hanged, Drawn and Quartered, to the great Dishononr
of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this they have a direct Answer by the Statutes of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
<hi>c.</hi> 4, &amp; 5. Whereby (reciting their Complaint) it is Enacted and Declared, that all
Clergy-men Convicted for Treason or Felony against any other Person than the Kings
Majesty, shall enjoy the Liberties of the Holy Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from henceforward
(but never before) the benefit of Clergy was allowed in Petit Treason, till by 23,
&amp; 25, &amp; 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it was taken away; but High Treason is excepted out of that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>E.</hi> 3. and therefore was ever since punished without the allowance of Clergy
as it was before: And accordingly the Abbot of <hi>Missenden</hi> was Condemned to be Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
Drawn and Quartered, <hi>Pro contra factione &amp; resectione legalis monetae Angliae,
Mich. coram Rege</hi> 31 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Rot.</hi> 55. And it is taken for a General Rule, <hi>Trin.</hi> 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
<hi>coram Rege, Rot.</hi> 173. <hi>Quod privilegium Clericale non competit seditioso equitanti
cum Armis,</hi> &amp;c. Thus I have shewn that in the Cases of <hi>Orleton, Merkes, Fisher,</hi> and
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> the benefit of Clergy could not be allowed by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> they
being Cases of High Treason.</p>
            <p>But in Cases of Felony, the benefit of Clergy was always allowed, till it was taken
away in Cases of Murder <hi>ex malitia praecegitata,</hi> Poysoning, Burglary, Robbery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98451:10"/>
by the 1 &amp; 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 10. This is sufficient for this Point.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Fourth Question, At what time the benefit of Clergy ought to be pleaded
or demanded? comes to be examined. I conceive, that the common practice both
before and after the Statute of <hi>Westm.</hi> 1. was to deliver them to the Ordinary after
Conviction, and therefore they would not suffer them to demand it before: My Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because the Statute of <hi>Westm.</hi> saith thus; <hi>Si Clearke soit prise pur rette de fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
&amp; si il soit per l' Ordinarie demand, il luy soit livere solonque la priviledge de
Saint Eccl</hi>' &amp;c. <hi>solonque le custom avant ses lieures use.</hi> This Statute grants no new
Priviledge, but confirms only that which they had before: And as for the time of
allowing the Priviledge, the words of the Statute are so ambiguous, that it is very
hard to determine the Question from thence; only the Statute refers it to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the former Ages: for the Priviledge of the Holy Church is to be allowed <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonque
le custom,</hi> &amp;c. Now all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> did after this Statute determine,
that they would not deliver any Prisoner to the Ordinary till he was first Indicted, and
also thereupon Arraigned, and till it was Inquired by an Inquest upon his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether he were <hi>Guilty</hi> or not <hi>Guilty;</hi> if not Guilty, then he was discharged
without any more ado; but if Guilty, his Goods and Chattels, Lands and Tenements
were forfeited, and his Body delivered to the Ordinary: So saith <hi>Britton,</hi> cap. 4. f. 11.
<hi>Si Clearke encoupe de felony allegga Clergie, &amp; soit per l' Ordinarie demand, donque
serra enquise comment il est miscrue</hi> (<hi>i. culpable</hi>) <hi>&amp; sil est trovenient miscrue donque
il aleraquite. Et sil soit &amp; trove miscrue, ses Chateux serroient taxes, &amp; ses terres
prises in maine le Roy, &amp; sen corps deliver al Ordinarie.</hi> The same you will find
in the <hi>Mirr. c.</hi> 3. <hi>Co.</hi> 2. <hi>Inst.</hi> 164. in his Exposition upon that Statute; and <hi>Stamford</hi> 131.
And this we must suppose to have been the practice before the Statute; because the
Statute appoints the ancient Custom to be observed, and there were none that knew
the ancient Custom so well as the Judges of those times; and therefore this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Judges was either according to the Custom <hi>avant ses heures use</hi> (as the
Statute speaks) or else it was not according to Law: but that is absurd, especially
seeing it was not only one resolution, but the constant practice ever since; for in the
Record of all Indictments of Clergy-men, if they refused to answer, but pleaded their
<hi>Privilegium Clericale,</hi> and were demanded by their Ordinary; the Record is entred
—<hi>Sed ut sciatur qualis ei liberari deberat,</hi> (i. whether Guilty or not Guilty) <hi>inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur
inde rei veritas per patriam.</hi> And in the Year-Books we have
multitudes of Cases that do prove it, as you may see in the Margent;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fitz. Tit. Cor. pl.</hi> 417. 8 <hi>E.</hi> 2. 17 <hi>E.</hi> 2. 386. 19 <hi>E.</hi> 2. 233.</note> the same is proved by the fore-mentioned Record of the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi>
30 <hi>E.</hi> 3. And there is a like Case, 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitz. Tit. Cor.</hi> 91. And the
Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. saith expresly, That all Clergy-men Convict of Treason and
Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which intimates that Clergy was not to be allowed till after Conviction.
And so I have answered what ever they can object against the above-cited Authorities
and Precedents from the benefit of Clergy; and therefore shall now briefly consider
the two last Particulars.</p>
            <p n="5">V. In the fifth place I am to consider, Upon what account it was that Clergy-men
were delivered to their Ordinaries, in those Cases where the benefit of Clergy was not
allowed: The delivering of a Clerk Convict to his Ordinary, could be only for these
ends, either that he might make his Purgation before his Spiritual Judge, or that the
Ordinary might Degrade him, and then deliver him over to the Secular Power, to be
punished according to Law as a Lay-man, lest Scandal and Indignity should be put
upon the Church: The former is onely in Cases where Clergy is allowed; for
where there is no Clergy, there can be no Purgation: The latter is, where
no Clergy can be allowed: The former is <hi>de Jure,</hi> and cannot be denied. I
do not mean <hi>Jure Canonico,</hi> but is a Custom which hath been allowed time
out of mind, and confirmed by several Acts of Parliament; and for that reason on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I say, it is <hi>de Jure.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide Co.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Inst.</hi> 636.</note> The latter is, <hi>de Gratia,</hi> and Arbitrary; for
our Judges have had such an Honour and Esteem for the Dignity of a
Priest, that they usually did deliver them to the Bishop to be Degraded,
before the Sentence of Law was executed upon them. So it is in all Cases of High
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98451:10"/>
Treason, for there being no room for Purgation, the Judges are not at all obliged to
deliver him, but out of favour they were wont to do it, to the end he might be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded;
and if that Custom were still observed, there were no great harm in it: yet
in <hi>Trin.</hi> 24. <hi>H.</hi> 8. in <hi>Spilmans</hi> Reports we have a Case of one <hi>George Nobles</hi> a Priest,
who was Convicted at the Gaol delivery of <hi>Newgate,</hi> of Clipping the Kings Coin;
and by the Resolution of all the Judges, they passed Sentence of Death upon him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Degradation, and he was accordingly Executed in his Canonical Vestments. In
a Record upon the Parliament, <hi>Roll</hi> 21 E. 1. <hi>Rot.</hi> 9. it is to be found, that one <hi>Walter,
de Berton</hi> was Convicted of Counterfeiting the great Seal; but the Record saith,
<hi>Qui convictus tradatur Episcopo Sarum qui eum petiit ut Clericum suum sed sub pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>&amp; sub forma qua decet quia videtur Concilio quod in tali casu non admittenda
est purgatio.</hi> Here it appears a person Convicted was delivered to his Ordinary in
case where there could be no Purgation; and so no benefit of Clergy; and therefore
it is evident that it was to the end he should be Degraded, and upon that the Delivery
is with a <hi>Subpoena,</hi> which can be understood no otherwise but that he should re-deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. As to the last point, at what time they ought to be Degraded, may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
partly from what hath been said already; for the end of Degradation, is only
to prevent that Scandal and Irreverence which would otherwise be thrown upon that
honourable Profession, which all sober and true Christians are very tender of: And
certainly there cannot regularly be any Deprivation or Degradation before Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for no Clerk can be Deprived or Degraded of any Benefice or Dignity, except
upon full Evidence he be found such and such a person as is uncapable of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. And as a Bishop cannot refuse a Clerk presented, except there be special
cause for it, as <hi>criminosus,</hi> &amp;c. so neither can he deprive one that is already Inducted
without special cause; and in any Court of Record the Cause must be specially
pleaded, because it is Traversable, <hi>Co. lib.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>part. fol.</hi> 58. <hi>Specots</hi> Case. Suppose
then that any Ecclesiastical Person is Arrested for Treason, the Ordinary cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him, except he first pass Sentence upon him, that he is <hi>criminosus;</hi> but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pass Sentence of Deprivation upon him, while he is under the Custody of the
Temporal Magistrate, and before he is delivered to him; for it is the greatest piece
of Injustice in the World, to Condemn a man before he be heard: indeed our Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that in case of Outlawry, but that is when he may appear, and yet after Five
solemn Proclamations, will not; but it is against the Law of Reason, and the Laws
of all Nations, to Condemn a man that is absent, when at the same time they know
he cannot appear; and therefore no Clerk can be deprived till he be delivered by
the Temporal Judge: and I have already proved that there can be no Delivery till
after Conviction; so that it doth necessarily follow, that there can be no Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
till after Conviction; and for further confirmation, see <hi>Ridley, ubi supra, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton.

it appears, first, That before Degradation, they must be allowed the benefit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their Purgation, if they can, and that they have not except they be present when
they are Condemned. 2ly, That they must be <hi>Traditi</hi> or <hi>Convicti</hi> before Deprivation.</p>
            <p>The Case of a Bishop seems parallel to the Case of any other Clerk; for the King is
Patron of all the Archbishopricks and Bishopricks of <hi>England,</hi> they being all of his
and his Progenitors Foundation: They must either therefore be Donative or Eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
before King <hi>John</hi>'s time they were Donative; <hi>per traditionem Annuli &amp; Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis
baculi:</hi> But he by his Charter 15. <hi>Jan. Anno Regni</hi> 17. granted that they should
be Eligible, and therefore were made to be in the nature of Advowsons presentable:
when therefore the King did nominate or present such a person to the Bishoprick, that
person could not be refused without some special cause of refusal; but if it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that he was either Infamous, Irreligious, Schismatick, Heretick, Miscreant,
Infidel, <hi>mere laicus,</hi> &amp;c. I conceive he might well be refused; or else to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
issued forth the <hi>Conge d'eslier?</hi> What signified King <hi>John</hi>'s making them Eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
And therefore there being the same Reason and Law of Degradation or Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98451:11"/>
after actual Investiture, that there is of refusal before: I infer there can be no
Deprivation of a Bishop without Cause, and that Cause cannot be adjudged to be in
him before he be heard, and have the Justice to defend himself as well as he can, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him; and consequently no Deprivation till after delivery out of the hands of
the Secular Power, which is in no case till after Conviction. These Particulars ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
and proved, will satisfie all those whose Sentiments are regulated according
to the Standard of Reason, that there is no strength in any of those Objections which
some ignorant people do so much insist upon.</p>
            <p>Having thus by the Rules of Law, the Authority of the most Renowned Authors,
and Variety of Precedents, proved, That a Bishop is no Peer, in respect to a Temporal
Lord, within the intent and meaning of the 29th of <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> It doth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow, that he hath no Right to claim any Jurisdiction or Right of Judicature
upon the Life and Death of a Temporal Lord; for otherwise he might suffer Death
or Banishment, or Imprisonment, by the Judgment of those who are not his Peers,
contrary to the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and the Liberties of every Subject.
And thus I conclude the first Point.</p>
            <p>The second Point that I offered to demonstrate, is, That the Bishops Votings in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Cases, is contrary to the practice of all Ages untill this day.</p>
            <p>In the first place, Let us examine how it was before the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second:
It must not be expected that this should be proved from the Records and Journals
upon the Parliament Rolls, for their Antiquity will not reach so high as to do any
considerable Service in this matter; but I shall give the same proof for this, that any
man can give for Tryals by Juries before <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> that is, an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
making Recognition of several ancient Customs practised beyond the Memory
of those that then lived; and that I hope will be sufficient Evidence: The Statute
that I mean, was made at that Great Parliament which was held at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> the
10, &amp; 11 of <hi>H.</hi> 2. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1164. In the Preamble it is, <hi>Recognizantur Advice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudines,</hi>
which proves it is declarative of the Common Law. The Eleventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
runs in this manner, <hi>Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, &amp; universa persona</hi> (holding any
Ecclesiastical Dignity) <hi>qui de Rege tenent in Capite, habeant possessiones suas de Rege
sicut Baroniam, &amp; inde respondeant Justiciariis &amp; Ministris Regis, &amp; sequantur &amp;
faciant omnes consuetudines Regias, &amp; sicut caeteri Barones debeant interesse judiciis
curiae Regis cum Baronibus quousque perveniatur ad diminutionem membrorum vel ad
mortem.</hi> Here is their Jurisdiction expresly limited, that it shall not extend <hi>ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutionem
membrorum vel ad mortem.</hi> And this Act of Parliament is declarative
of the Common Law, as appears by the Preamble, and the construction of most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
that mention it. <hi>In this</hi> (saith <hi>Doderidge</hi>) <hi>certain Recapitulations are made
of the Kings Prerogative and his Peoples Right, then sought to be infringed by the
Pope and his Clergy.</hi> So saith my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> 2. <hi>Inst.</hi> 631. and <hi>Selden, Titles of Honour,</hi>
582. Seeing therefore there can be no time assigned when this ancient Custom which
is here recapitulated, was not, consequently this limitation must be supposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be as
ancient as their sitting in the House of Lords: But to prove that this Constitution of
<hi>Clarendon</hi> (as some call it) is an Act of Parliament; <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> saith, <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentibus
etiam Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, Abbatibus, Prioribus, Comitibus, Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
&amp; Proceribus Regni. Roger</hi> of <hi>Hoveden</hi> saith expresly, that <hi>Clerus &amp; Populus
Regni</hi> were then assembled, and so mentions it as a full Parliament. <hi>Goldastus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.
Imper. Tom.</hi> 3. 347. saith, There were added to the Clergy, <hi>Nobiliores &amp; Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiores
Regni. Fitz Stephens</hi> calls it, <hi>Generale Concilium.</hi> And lastly, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Lawyers do take it for granted and undisputable. My Lord <hi>Cook in</hi> 2. <hi>Inst.</hi> 631,
and 638. calls it, <hi>The great Parliament that was held at</hi> Clarendon: So <hi>Bracton,</hi>
               <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>f.</hi> 136. And this very Article above-mentioned is in all the said Authors; and
likewise in <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Wendover:</hi> but that which is most considerable, is, that we have
<hi>Gervasius Doroberniensis,</hi> an Author that lived in that Age, and a Person within Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Orders too, reckoning this very Article among the Laws that were made at that
Parliament, in the 68. <hi>Page</hi> of his Book. But admitting it were no Parliament, but
only a great Councel of Peers; yet that is as well for my purpose, because that the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98451:11"/>
Proceedings of such a Council are Matters of Record, and therefore a Recognition
or Declaration of ancient Customs, and of the Common Law made in such a Council,
is as undeniable proof, as if it were a Declaratory Act of Parliament; for the force of
such an Act is only in point of Evidence, and doth not Enact or Constitute any new
Law. But as there is no question but that it is an Act of Parliament, the Assembly
being <hi>a Generale,</hi> or <hi>Commune Concilium,</hi> which is always understood of <hi>the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
               <hi>Co. Inst.</hi> 110. <hi>a.</hi> So except it can be proved this Statute was repealed, I
have made good my Assertion, without saying any more; for admitting that it had not
been so frequently practised, as I in his proper place shall make appear it was; yet still
it is valid and a standing Law: for no Statute loseth its force by <hi>Non-user, Co.</hi> 1. <hi>Inst.</hi>
114. although Common Law, or particular Customs, may.</p>
            <p>But this Statute we find was afterward confirmed: for saith <hi>Roger de Hoveden</hi> a
Monk, p. 30. It was Ordained in a Councel at <hi>Westm.</hi> That no Clergy-man should
<hi>Agitare Judicium,</hi> &amp;c. and he that did, was to be deprived of his Dignity and
Orders.</p>
            <p>That these Constitutions were punctually observed in after Ages, is the next thing
to be proved: And the first that I shall mention, is the Judgment against the <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi>
15 <hi>E.</hi> 2. The Lords Spiritual did withdraw, as in right they ought. These <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
were men that were great Favourites of that King; for they had succeeded <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gaveston</hi> both in the Kings Favour, and in Places of Profit and Trust about Court:
and although the Lords had then prevailed with the King to consent to an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for their Banishment, yet afterward the Tide turned, the <hi>Spencers</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
again to Court, and their Enemies severally prosecuted; whereupon the greatest
part of them departed from Court, and through the Interests which the <hi>Spencers</hi> had
with the remaining Lords, the Judgment which stood upon Record against them was
reversed for several Errors; one of which was, <hi>The absence of the Prelates:</hi> but
notwithstanding this, the Judgment is afterward Affirmed by an Act of Parliament,
in the first year of the succeeding King: <hi>Vide</hi> 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1, &amp; 2.</p>
            <p>And that the Absence of the Prelates is no cause of Reversing a Judgment, see
the Case of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> who in the 2 of <hi>H.</hi> 5. petitioned the House of Lords
to Reverse a Judgment that was given against the Earl his Father, <hi>An.</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
for Error, That the Lords Spiritual were absent: The Case was very much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
and at last it was adjudged no Error; and accordingly the Judgment was Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
But of this I shall have occasion to treat more at large by and by: See <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>

               <hi>Anno eodem,</hi> in the Parliament at <hi>Westm. post Festum Sanctae Katherinae;</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Treason being read against <hi>Montimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> That he had procured
the Death of the late King, and had under-hand-dealing with the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Stanhope
Park,</hi> and had been too familiar with the Queen-Mother, by whom she was thought
to have been with Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The King charged <hi>Les Counts, &amp; Barons, les Peers de
son Royaume,</hi> to give Judgment: And then it follows, that Judgment was given <hi>Per
les dits Counts &amp; Barons les Peers de Royaume, come Judges du Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> The King commanded <hi>Les dits Counts &amp; Barons, Peers,</hi> &amp;c. to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on <hi>Simon de Bereford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ibid.</hi> The King commanded the same against several others, and accordingly <hi>John
Matravers</hi> was judged <hi>Per les Peers, Counts, &amp; Barons, assembles in Parliament.</hi>
And so were Four others in the same Parliament, all for Treason; and not one word
of the Prelates, either when the Articles were read, or when Judgment was given:
For it is certain, they are never spoken of in any Record, but either by the Name of
<hi>Archiepiscopi, Episcopi,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>Prelati,</hi> or some such Name which doth distinguish
them from the Laity; and if they be spoken of, they are always first named and put
before <hi>Les Counts &amp; Barons;</hi> as at this day, the Records are Entred by the <hi>Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Temporal,</hi> &amp;c. And for these two Reasons they could not be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

under the General words, <hi>Et autres Grandees &amp; Nobles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 6 E. 3. <hi>Post Festum Sancti Gregorii;</hi> The Parliament were commanded to
consult of the keeping of the Peace, and punishments for the Breakers thereof; and
the Prelates departed <hi>Pur ceo que il ne attinet pass a eux Consailer du gard de la Paix
ne de chastement de tiels Malefactors:</hi> Yet afterward they came and gave their Assent
to an Act of Parliament for this purpose: The reason of which shall be considered in
another place, where we shall discourse of their Voting in Bills of Attainder. By this
Record it is evident, That the Prelates have no Judicial Power over any Personal
Crimes, which are not Parliamentary; which doth very much Fortifie the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Ground of my whole Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. The Commons prayed that such as gave up <hi>Forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>puissent estre

Seigniors &amp; Barons.</hi> And thereupon several were brought before the Lords in
Parliament, which must be understood of the Temporal Lords onely, because the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Lords are never intended in any Case to be mentioned, except they be spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
named.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. Divers Matters of Treason were to be Treated of, and several Lords
to be Tryed; and therefore the Spirituality did absent themselves from the whole
Parliament: but before their departure, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Name
of Himself, and all the Clergy of his Province, made this following Protestation:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quod Archiepiscopum Cantuariensem qui pro tempore fuit, nec non caeteros suos

            <p>From this Record you may observe:<list>
                  <item n="1">1. That the Lords Spiritual do acknowledge that they have no Right to be present

                  <item n="2">2. You may observe that they did accordingly absent themselves, and did thereby
yield Obedience to the Parliament at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the Constitution at <hi>Westm.</hi>

                  <item n="3">3. You may observe that they did not stay in the House till they came to the final

            </p>
            <p>In the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 4. The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was suspected to have been
privy to the Rebellion of his Son <hi>Hotspur,</hi> who joyned with <hi>Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi>
and <hi>Owen Glendour</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> in open Rebellion. In the 5 of <hi>H.</hi> 4. he came and
presented himself to the King and Parliament, and Protested his Innocency, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
his <hi>Jus Parietatis,</hi> and Right of Tryal by his Peers: Whereupon the Lords
(saith the Record) made Protestation, that the Judgment belonged unto them onely,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Petition being read before the King and the said Lords, as Peers of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
unto whom such Judgments do of Right belong, considering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Adjudged
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98451:12"/>
that it was neither Treason, nor Felony, &amp;c. This was the first Process that was made
against the Earl; but it doth not evidently appear whether they were present or
absent, the Roll being Lords indefinitely; yet it is most probable that it is meant
Temporal Lords onely. 1. If the Spiritual Lords had been present, they would have
been named by a special Name, as they are in all other Rolls. 2. We find the Lords
Temporal in other Cases of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Death, claiming the same Jurisdiction as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to them onely exclusively of the Clergy. <hi>Anno</hi> 4 E. 3. Judgment was given
<hi>Per les Countes &amp; Barons, les Peers de la Royaume, come Judges du Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I shall leave this, and come to the Process which Issued forth against him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
for the Earl being acquitted, returns home, and within a very little time hath
a considerable Army in the Field, together with the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> Lord <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfe,</hi>
and others; but their Army soon Disbanding, the Earl of <hi>Westmerland</hi> comes
with a considerable Strength for the King, and takes all the Lords Prisoners, except
<hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Bardolfe,</hi> who fled into <hi>Scotland:</hi> Whereupon 7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.
<hi>Rot. Processus coram Domino Rege in Parliamento,</hi> &amp;c. The King commanded
the Lords Temporal Peers of his Realm to advise what Process to make, and what
Judgment to render against the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Bardosse;</hi>
and then the Record goes on thus: <hi>And then the said Lords Advised thereon, and
Reported their Opinion to the King.—The said Lords Peers of the Realm,
by the Assent of the King, Ordained that Proclamations should be made for the said
Earl of</hi> Northumberland, <hi>and Lord</hi> Bardolfe <hi>to appear, or else to stand Convicted of
High Treason by the Award of the Peers in Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King did further demand the Opinion of the said Lords Temporal, touching the
Archbishop of</hi> York.<hi>—Vnto which the Lords Temporal said,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Advice of the said Lords Temporal, the Returns of the former</hi> Proclamations
<hi>were made at the Parliament-Door, for the said Earl and Lord to appear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Advice of the said Lords Temporal, with Assent of the King, the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
were examined.—The said Lords Temporal considered of the Errors
therein,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the said Lords Temporal, with Assent of the King, by their Authority new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
were granted.—Whereupon the said Lords Temporal then being in
the same Parliament, by Advice and Consent of our Lord the King, and by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="6+ letters">
                     <desc>••••••…</desc>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Awarded the said Earl of</hi> Northumbeland<hi>, and the Lord</hi>
Bardolfe<hi>, not appearing upon their Summons, to stand Convicted of High Treason,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here we see all was done by the Temporal Lords, from the first beginning of the
Process until the Judgment, and yet it is said to be Awarded by the Peers in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
although the Spiritual Lords are not so much as once mentioned, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
were not present, at any time whilst that Matter of Treason was handling.</p>
            <p>To Enumerate all the Instances of this Nature, and to Transcribe all the Records
of Attainders in Parliament, where the Names of the Lords Spiritual are left out,
which infers of necessity that they were absent; would swell out this Treatise into a
greater Bulk than either I intend, or then is in its self convenient. These are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to prove that Obedience was yielded to those Laws and Constitutions of this
Land, which were made for this purpose. I will mention one Precedent more, and
that is the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Case, 16 <hi>Caroli: The Bishops declined their Suffrages
on the Tryal of the Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>according to the provision of the Canon Law,
and the constant practice to this day:</hi> (says <hi>Baker,</hi> 478) and therefore withdrew:
But they desired a Protestation that their Absence should not prejudice them of that,
nor of any other Priviledge competent to them, as the Lords Spiritual in Parliament,
might be entred; which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, That this is not to be made use of as a Precedent: That (I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer)
is true as to the Matter of the Charge, and the Nature of the Crime that he
was Impeached for; no man must by colour of that Act be Adjudged a Traytor, that
doth those things which the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> did: but as to the course of Proceedings,
and all other Circumstances of the Method, it is well enough; for nothing was done
in that but what was warranted by Precedents and constant practice in Parliament:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98451:13"/>
And this Difference doth appear from the <hi>Proviso</hi> in the Bill of Attainder, for that is
no more but this: <hi>That no Judge or Judges shall hereafter interpret any Act or Acts
to be Treason, in any other manner, than he or they should or ought to have done before
the making of this Act; and any thing contained in this Act to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
So that the <hi>Proviso</hi> extends only to the Crimes, but not at all to their
manner of proceeding.</p>
            <p>From the consideration of these things, That Allegation which is made by some,
that they were wont to sit till the final Question, <hi>Guilty</hi> or <hi>Not-guilty;</hi> were put,
will plainly appear to be altogether groundless: Because</p>
            <p>First, If they have not Parity sufficient to Entitle them to any Jurisdiction in Cases
of Life and Death, as I have endeavoured to shew that they have not, in the former
part of my Discourse; then it is evident, that they cannot exercise any Judicial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at all, neither in things praeliminary to the Judgment, the Judgment it self, nor
in things subsequent to the Judgment: all which do fall within the Conusance of
Judicial Power, and do belong to the Office, Power, and Jurisdiction of a Judge. For so
saith <hi>Magna Charta, Nemo imprisonetur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nisi per legale judicium parium suorum,</hi>
and yet Imprisonment is a thing praeliminary to Judgment: The Office of a Judge is
to hear first, and then determine, <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer;</hi> but if any man be not duly
qualified to be a Judge, then he hath as little power to hear the Cause, or Act any
thing in it, as to determine it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Constitution of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> saith, <hi>Debent interesse Judiciis Curiae
Domini Regis quousque perveniatur ad diminutionem Membrorum vel ad mortem.</hi>
This must either be understood to comprehend all precedent and praeliminary things,
which do relate or tend <hi>ad diminutionem Membrorum,</hi> &amp;c. Or else if we take the
words strictly and literally, we must understand the meaning of that great Assembly
to be onely for the Exemption of Prelates from doing the Office of Executioners; which
is Non-sense: By <hi>Diminutio,</hi> &amp;c. therefore, or <hi>Mors,</hi> we must understand things
conducing and tending <hi>ad diminutionem,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>ad mortem.</hi> The Constitution at
<hi>Westminster</hi> is much plainer, <hi>Non debent agitare judicium sanguinis;</hi> the meaning is
plainly this, That they ought not to exercise any Judicial Power in Cases of Blood:
But a man may exercise Judicial Power <hi>agitare Judicium;</hi> or do the Office of a Judge
in a great many things that are both precedent and subsequent to the Judgment; as
Awarding of Process, receiving the Charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Bishops ought not
to have any praeliminary Vote which hath any tendency or relation to a Judgment
of Death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When ever the Clergy, in Obedience to these Constitutions, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
they left the whole Management of the Business from the beginning to the end
to the Lords Temporal, as appears from the Entry of the Records: so it is 4 E. 3. in
the Earl of <hi>Kents</hi> Case; he was brought before the <hi>Counts</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> &amp;c. for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
In the same year the Articles were read against <hi>Mortimer,</hi> and the King char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Les Counts &amp; Barons,</hi> to give Judgment upon the said Articles. The same was
in the Case of <hi>Simon</hi> de <hi>Bereford, Matravers,</hi> and others in that year: 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. the
Prelates departed from the House at the first Motion about the Appeals, and did not
stay so much as till the Articles were read. In the Earl of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Case, it
appears, they had not so much as one Vote from the beginning to the end of the whole
Proceedings, and the sole Management of the Case was by the Award and Judgment
of the Lords Temporal. In the 21 of <hi>R.</hi> 2. the Prelates gave their Opinions general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that Pardons were revocable, but after they had done, they departed the House,
and would not consent so far to the Death of a man, as to give a particular Vote, when
the Question was put, Whether the Pardons of the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the Earls
of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> were revokable: <hi>Baker</hi> 161.</p>
            <p>And indeed if they should have been permitted to Vote about their Answers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
it would quite frustrate and elude the Design of the Prohibition; for somewhat or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might happen to be put to the Vote in their presence, concerning the Answer,
Replication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or concerning the Form and Method of Judicature, upon which the
whole Business would depend; and by the Voices of the Spiritual Lords that Vote it,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98451:13"/>
might pass against the major part of the Temporal Lords, and so the whole Business
lost, and the Expectation of Justice frustrated; so that it is highly reasonable, that
if they be absent at all, they should be absent, <hi>Dum de hujusmodi materiis agitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus by Reason and Authority established the Truth of those Propositions
which I at first laid down, I shall now examine the Strength of those Arguments,
whereby my Adversaries do support themselves, and maintain the Jurisdiction of the
Lords Spiritual in Capital Cases.</p>
            <p>And 1. Their Grand Objection is, That they never absented themselves when Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Cases were Debated, upon any other account, then because they were prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Laws of the Holy Church, to consent to the Death of any man: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they made their Protestation, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. when they departed the House,
<hi>Juxta Sacrorum Canonum instituta non licet nobis interesse,</hi> &amp;c. And such a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Departure for Conscience-sake (say they) lest they should concern themselves
in the Effusion of Innocent Blood, could neither conclude themselves nor their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
from claiming their Right to be present by the Fundamental Law of the Land,
as Peers of Parliament. Here lies their Strength, and therefore a solid Refutation of
this will remove all manner of Scruple, and discover the vanity of their pretensions
to any Jurisdiction of this kind: Therefore in answer to this, I shall offer these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Considerations:</p>
            <p n="1">1. What-ever was the Reason that induced them to absent themselves when such
Matters came to be Debated; yet it is manifest from what hath been said, that there
was an Act of Parliament (to which they were obliged to give Obedience, as well
as the Canons of the Church) that did expresly prohibit them to exercise Jurisdiction
in those Cases: and although they did say that their Departure was in Obedience
to the Canons of the Church, yet without doubt we ought to construe their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be also in Obedience to the Laws of the Land: For the Case at the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Representation, is no more than this; The same thing is both prohibited
by the Law of God, and the Law of Man; those who forbear from the thing prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
do say they do it, because they are so commanded by the Law of God, and say
no more: In this Case we cannot construe, that either the Law of Man doth lose its
force and obligatory Power, or that those persons who said they forbore from the
thing prohibited in Obedience to the Law of God, did either not obey, or disobey the
Law of Man; I mean, <hi>In foro hum ano.</hi> If then the Prelates in former times did give
Obedience to the Laws and Constitutions of this Nation in this particular; much
more ought their Successors, whose Principle is strict Obedience to the Government
of the Kingdom and perfect submission to the Higher Powers. The truth is, it was
a happy thing that in the days of their Predecessors, the Law of the Church, and the
Law of the Land did so well agree in this particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if you would consider the
Humors and Principles of the Men, you would not wonder so much at their Non-acknowledgment
of the Laws of the Nation, when they could secure themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Compulsion of them and Punishment inflicted by them, without making
any such acknowledgment. It is not strange that those men, whose Zeal for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was seen most in their Contentions and Wranglings with the Civil Power; and
who thought that Obstinacy and Disobedience to Regal Authority, and the Laws
and Constitution of the Government, where they thwarted the Ambition and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergy, was the most certain way to merit Canonization;
and that <hi>Beckett</hi> and <hi>Stratford,</hi> and the rest of that Rebellious and Disobedient
Tribe, were the mightiest Saints that ever lived upon Earth. It is not strange that
those Men that would trample all Humane Laws under their Feet, if dissonant to the
Canons of the Church, should pretend, that when the Canons of the Church did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the Laws of the Land, they yielded Obedience to the Canons of the
Church, without taking notice of the Laws of the Land. And indeed it was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<hi>Specimen</hi> of Candor and Modesty, that they did with so fair a pretence
save themselves from the inconvenience of acknowledging the Temporal Power in the
limitation of their Honour and Jurisdiction, which they were never known to be very
forward to do: But God be thanked the times are turned, we have reason to expect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98451:14"/>
more Humility and Loyalty from our now Spiritual Fathers, whose Principles do not
allow them in the least Opposition to lawful Authority, and who it is to be hoped
will never insist upon any thing, except they think that by the Law of the Land it
is their Right.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Although they pretended that their departure from the House during
the Debates of Capital Matters, was in Obedience to the Canons of the Church;
yet it is more than probable, that the consideration of the Law of <hi>England</hi> by which
they were compellable to depart, whether there had been any such Canons in force,
or not, was the strongest Reason why they did with-draw, and that for these two
Reasons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because it is observable, That if those in whose power it was to dispense with
their Disobedience to the Laws of the Land, did at any time give way to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
or Consent, that they should exercise Judicial Power in those Cases, then the
Lords Spiritual used generally to make bold with the Canons of the Church, at least
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> vice:</hi> How then can it be supposed, that at other times when there was no such
Licence or Dispensation, their Departure was onely because of the Canons of the
Church? That Record of 21. <hi>R.</hi> 2. where they did consent to Constitute a Proxy, who
should in their Name agree, or disagree to any Judgments of Death that should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in that Parliament, is very considerable for this Point; for in that Case they
gave Authroity to another to do a thing which was unlawfull for them to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and it was done, because the King and Parliament being the Fountain of Law,
and having power <hi>unica vice,</hi> or more, to dispense with any Law, at least such as
come not within the Conusance of any other Court beside themselves, did give them
leave so to do: whereas without doubt, the passing Sentence of Death upon a man
by Proxy, was as great a Violation of the Canons of the Church, as if they had been
personally present, and had passed Judgment themselves: For can any man ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
suppose, that the Clergy were so tender Conscienced, that they should not agree
to the Effusion of any mans Blood themselves, and yet that their Consciences would
allow them to Authorize another in their Name and Place, and by their Authority
to consent to it? As if it were not the same thing in point of Conscience for me to
kill a man, as it is to procure another to do it: And so in point of Law, that which
I am prohibited to do my self, I am also prohibited to impower another to do; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that which a mans Servant, Procurator, or Attorney, doth by the Command,
and by vertue of the Authority of the Master, is in Judgment of Law and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
interpretatively the Act of the Master himself: And the Constituting a Proxy in
their Names to give Judgment of Death by vertue of an Instrument under their Hands
and Seals, will further appear to be a breach of the Canons, if you consider the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Canon made, <hi>Anno</hi> 1222. in the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 3. which you may find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Constitutiones Archiepiscopi</hi> Stephani in <hi>Linwood, f.</hi> 146.—<hi>Authoritate

constitutus litteras pro poena sanguinis infligenda scribere vel dictare presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
vel ubi Judicium sanguinis tractatur, vel exercetur intersit.</hi> From this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
I conclude, That Clergy-men ought neither to be present themselves, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
others <hi>per litteras,</hi> to be present <hi>pro poena sanguinis infligenda.</hi> We have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a very pertinent Observation upon this Matter in an ancient MS. Chronicl. <hi>in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro
Mailrosso,</hi> which hath written very largely of this Parliament that was held
21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. wherein the Prelates are blamed for that Opinion which they gave generally
about the Revocation of Pardons, because the consequence thereof was the Death of
those whose Pardons were Revoked: <hi>Dederunt ergo locum</hi> (saith the Book) <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati
judicio sanguinis in hoc facto. Ita quod debitatur a pluribus si non incurrerent
irregularitatem pro negotio memorato, unde contigit quod propter istud minus peccatum
inciderent in aliud Majus peccatum consequenter, ut laicam personam constituerint

                  </gap> foret &amp; occasio emersisset,</hi> &amp;c. So that upon the whole
Matter, it is irrational to think that their departure from the House ever before this,
was meerly in respect of the Canons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we see that the first offer of the King and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98451:14"/>
Parliament to admit them to the exercise of Jurisdiction for that time, was by them
kindly accepted with a <hi>Non obstante</hi> to the Canons of the Church. It is true, the
giving Judgment of Death by Proxy, was as great a violation of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi>
as of the Canons of the Church: yet inasmuch as <hi>Consensus tollit errorem,</hi> it was for
that time well enough.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is further illustrated, If you observe that in those Cases to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of the Law did not extend, they made no scruple of Sitting and Voting, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their Voting in those Cases was against the Canons of the Church. This may
be instanced in the Cases of Bills of Attainder: for although the Canons do prohibit
them from Voting in such Cases, as much as any Case whatsoever; inasmuch as in
passing the Bill, they Vote, That the Person is Guilty, and shall stand actually At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
of High Treason, and shall be deemed and adjudged a Traytor, and shall suffer
as in Cases of High Treason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they do generally Vote, because that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of the Law doth not extend to Voting in Bills of Attainder, seeing that is not
<hi>Agitare judicium,</hi> but onely <hi>Legis lationem,</hi> what they do in that Case is not Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
but onely the exercise of their Legislative Power; otherwise the House of
Commons would make themselves Judges, and would challenge a Judicial Power in
the Tryal of any Lord, seeing in passing Bills of Attainder they do every whit as
much as the Bishops; for they Vote that he is Guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he shall be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Traytor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Act of Parliament runs, <hi>Be it Enacted by the King, the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament assembled.</hi> For these
two Reasons I think it very improbable, that the Canons was the onely cause why
the Prelates did depart the House when Capital Cases were Debated: But that
the weakness of their Objection may further appear; I answer,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Although we should admit that the Canons of the Church were the first
occasion of the beginning of this Custom among us, and that those Histories and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
which inform us after this manner, do say true, yet this is no Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the validity of a standing Custom, the Commencemant of which is not upon
Record: for Histories and Chronicles are not Matters of Record, neither are they in
Law such strong and undeniable proof of the beginning of any usage, as to make it
no Custom; neither are the Canons of the Church Matters of Record; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot prove that there was no such Custom before the making of those Canons.
Seeing then it is without doubt that there was a Custom that the Prelates should not
exercise Jurisdiction in Capital Cases, and there is no Record that doth mention the
time when it did begin, nor any time when it could be said, There never was such an
Usage; it must of necessity be supposed that it is as ancient as the Government it
self, and part of the Fundamental Contract of the Nation, whereby their Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was originally limited that it should not extend to such and such Cases. So that
I do not argue from the validity or invalidity of those Canons, nor from any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
that may be made upon the Letter of the Canons, but insist upon it as part
of the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and do absolutely deny that it had its Original and
Force from any Authority that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> with or without his Council, or a
Convocation of the Clergy in <hi>England</hi> had, to impose Laws upon us; but affirm,
that its force and obligatory Power did solely arise from the voluntary reception, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
and usage allowed by the People of <hi>England,</hi> which being by them trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Posterity, is a thing reputed to have been used and practised time out of
mind, and is thereupon ranked among the Common Laws of this Kingdom; which
are no more but general Usages or Customs of general Concernment to the whole
Nation in things of Temporal Conisance, first upon reasonable Considerations by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
allowed, and then transmitted as a Tradition to Posterity, by whom they are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have been in ure ever since it was a Nation: But this matter of Judicature in
Capital Cases is a point of Temporal Jurisdiction in a Temporal Court; <hi>viz.</hi> The
High Court of Parliament, and therefore of Temporal Conisance: the departure of
the Clergy when such Cases came to be Debated, hath also been an interrupted pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
for many Ages together; yea and most strictly observed in the first Ages, whose
Transactions are Recorded (as hath been already proved) and it is impossible by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98451:15"/>
to trace it to its first Original: Therefore it agreeing with every part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of Common Law, is part of the Common Law it self, and doth consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bind all subjects to its Observation as a standing Law, not alterable any way,
but the same way it at first took its force, that is, by general consent, according to
the <hi>Maxime</hi> laid down by my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> in his 1. <hi>Inst.</hi> 115. <hi>b. Whatsoever was at the
Common Law, and is not ousted or taken away by any Statute, remaineth still.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although this Practice that was enjoyned by these Canons, was here allowed
and observed, yet that observation was not out of respect to the Canons as such; but
as they did command such things as were judged rational: and it had been the same
case if the Custom had begun in <hi>England</hi> in imitation of other Countries, as it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of the Canons: For though the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> claiming an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
and absolute Power of Legislation, <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> over all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
took advantage of every Opportunity that offered it self for the obtaining of
this Right, which they pretended was <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and in Right of their Vicarship
due; yet knowing that Princes would not so easily part with the Jewels of their
Crowns, in suffering their People to be in Subjection to the Laws and Constitutions
of any foreign Prince, in things which either directly or indirectly did affect their
Temporal Possessions, they thought it necessary to manage their Business with all
imaginable artifice and cunning, by bringing the Laity to the humour by degrees;
and accordingly did at first collect certain Rules and Directions for the Government
of the Clergy onely, which were called <hi>Decreta,</hi> first published in <hi>England</hi> during
King <hi>Stephens</hi> Reign (as some do think, though others reckon it was long before)
but never throughly observed in <hi>England, Kellaway.</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 184. But having got
a small incouragement by the reception of these Rules in many Countries, they
thought they might venture a little further, and then would have the Laity as well
as the Clergy, to give Obedience to their Edicts: but that must be first in some incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
indifferent things; as Abstinence from Meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and did not style them
with the Lordly Name of <hi>Leges,</hi> but with a great deal of Meekness and Humility,
and the Complement of <hi>Servus servorum Dei,</hi> did offer to their Consideration cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Rogationes;</hi> whence the Abstinence-week before <hi>Whitesunday</hi> was called <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation-week,</hi>
as <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>silius Pat. lib. Defensor. pacis,</hi> 2 <hi>part.</hi> 23. observes; Christians
having out of Piety and Honour for his Holiness, yielded Obedience to these same
<hi>Rogations,</hi> they made bold to proceed one step further; that is, They together with
their Councils made certain <hi>Orders</hi> or <hi>Decretals</hi> about Temporal Matters, (but <hi>in
ordine ad Spiritualia</hi> too) when these came first into <hi>England:</hi> See <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi>
403. To these <hi>Decretals</hi> Obedience was required from Prince and People, and all
Contumacious and Obstinate Delinquents were most severely Anathematized: The
<hi>Decretals</hi> were such as these, That any Clergy-man that was grieved by a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Sentence in the <hi>Court-Christian,</hi> or any other Court Ecclesiastical within this
Realm, might be relieved by an Appeal from <hi>Rome;</hi> That no Lay-man should have
the Disposition of any Ecclesiastical Preferment, nor the Presentation to a Church;
That he shall not Marry within such and such Degrees; That Children born before
Espousals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be legitimate; That the Clergy should be absolutely exempted from Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet these <hi>Decretals</hi> met with very little respect in <hi>England, France,</hi>
or any other part of <hi>Christendom,</hi> except <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony in <hi>Demesne,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi>
own Territories, called by the Canonists <hi>Patria Obedientiae.</hi> For in <hi>England</hi> (to wave
any discourse of the Laws and Customs of other Countries) in stead of being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and observed according to Expectation, they were stoutly opposed by the Judges
and Magistrates, as derogating from the Soveraignty and Prerogative of the King,
and tending to the detriment of the Rights and Properties of his Subjects: And in
Confirmation of this, several Acts of Parliament were made to curb the Insolence of
those usurping <hi>Popes,</hi> and to punish the audacious Enterprises of those factious and
disloyal Subjects, who did presume to attempt to controll the Judgments that were
given in the Kings Courts by Process from the <hi>Pope;</hi> or to procure Provisions and
Reservations of Benefices by <hi>Bulls</hi> or <hi>Breve's</hi> from <hi>Rome:</hi> See 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. 48 <hi>E.</hi> 3.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98451:15"/>
and Process from <hi>Rome,</hi> for the purposes aforesaid, are made liable to the Penalties of
a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> whereby the Body of the Offendor is to be Imprisoned during the
Kings Pleasure, his Goods forfeited, and his Lands seised into the Kings Hands, so
long as the Offendor liveth. How far the Benefit of Clergy was allowed, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewn; And as for the Matter of Legitimation, you may see the Statute of
<hi>Merton, c.</hi> 9. <hi>Et rogaverunt omnes Episcopi Magnates ut consentirent, quod nati ante
matrimonium essent legitimi, sicut illi qui nati sunt post matrimonium quantum ad

&amp; approbatae sunt:</hi> Vide 18 E. 4. 30. <hi>a.</hi> All which Statutes are Declarative of the
Common Law, and therefore do prove that the People of <hi>England</hi> were never obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to allow of any Decrees of Councils or Canons of the Church, further than
they judged it fit and convenient so to do; which Arbitrary Reception, together with
a Transmission to Posterity, did of it self make it one of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which
continues in force (though the Councils or Convocations should afterward repeal
their Decrees) till they be altered by Act of Parliament, <hi>Co.</hi> 5. <hi>Cawdries Case</hi> 9. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
Reports</hi> 70, 71. <hi>the case of Commendam:</hi> And the Preamble to the Statute
of Dispensations and Faculties, made 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 21. which runs in this manner:
<hi>Whereas this his Majesties Realm, recognising no Superiour under God, but onely his
Majesty, hath been and is free from subjection to any mans Laws, but onely such as
have been devised, made, and ordained within this Realm, for the wealth of the
same, or to such other as by sufferance of the King and his Progenitors, the People of
this Realm have taken at their free liberty by their own consent to be used among
them, and have bound themselves by long Vse and Custom to the observance of the
same, not as to the observance of the Laws of any foreign Prince, Potentate, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
but as to the customed and ancient Laws of this Realm, originally established
as Laws of the same, by the said Sufferance, Consents and Customs, and none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>
And so it is in <hi>Co. Rep.</hi> 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>part. fol.</hi> 31. <hi>All Canons, Constitutions, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Synods, Provincials,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are inforce that have been by general Consent and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
within the Realm allowed, and so may be general consent be corrected, enlarged,
explained or abrogated.</hi> Seeing therefore it is evident from what hath been already
said, that those Canons and Constitutions of the Church concerning Judicature in
Matters of Blood, have not onely been practised and allowed in this Nation successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for several Ages together, beyond all time of Memory, but also ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Act of Parliament; it follows, that they have the force of Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and are not alterable without an Act of Parliament; as the twelve Tables of
<hi>Athens</hi> did really become, and were properly called <hi>Jus civile Romanum,</hi> after they
were voluntarily received and allowed at <hi>Rome:</hi> And as the same may be instanced
in some parallel Cases among our selves, as the Priviledge of Clergy, Pluralities, and
Dispensations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were parts of the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> although they
became such no otherwise then by the Nations reception and observation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Church.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I am not apt to believe that this Custom was taken up upon the account of
the Canons of the Church, but rather because it was a thing agreeable to the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Government, the Reason and Rules of the Common Law, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Jurisdiction and Honour, being meerly praedial or feudal; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
upon a strict search it will be found of ancienter date than any of the Canons
of the Church; for the first Canon that I find in <hi>Linwood</hi> is that which was made <hi>An.</hi>
1222. and is among the rest of the Constitutions of Archbishop <hi>Stephen</hi> in these
words; <hi>Presenti decreto statuimus ne Clerici beneficiati aut in Sacru Ordinibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituti
villarum Procuratores admittantur, videlicet ut sint Seneschalli, aut Ballive
talium administrationum, occasione quarum laicis in reddendis ratiociniis obligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
nec Jurisdictiones exerceant seculares praesertim illas quibus</hi> Judicium Sanguinis
<hi>est annexum Authoritate quoque Concilii districtius inhibemus ne quis Clericus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiatus
vel in Sacris Ordinibus constitutus litteras pro poena</hi> Sanguinis <hi>infligenda
scribere vel dictare presumat, vel ubi</hi> Judicium Sanguinis <hi>exercetur intersit: Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98451:16"/>
146. Which Constitution was made above fifty years after the Parliament at
<hi>Clarendon,</hi> which confirms this Custom, and calls it one of the <hi>Avitae consuetudines.</hi>
These Particulars well considered, will give a very satisfactory Answer to their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and therefore I need not say any more.</p>
            <p>But it is further objected, That the Clergy in their Protestation which they made
11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. do declare, <hi>Quod ipsos personaliter interesse pertinet,</hi> (and so they did in
some Protestations which were made afterward) and after all they do insert this
Clause, <hi>Non volumus nec intendimus quod processus habiti &amp; habendi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>futuris
temporibus quomodolibet impugnentur, infirmentur, seu renoventur.</hi> From this they
argue, otherwise all the Proceedings of the House of Lords in the absence of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
are invalid and reversable, or else to what purpose is this Clause: And the Lords
Temporal giving leave that this Protestation should be entred upon Record, did impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
assent to what the Clergy alledged therein.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That a Protestation in its self is no argument of any Right neither
doth the permission and allowance of any Protestation, yield that right which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tester
is desirous to save, but only saves the right which the party had before, if he
had any; and if none, then the making that <hi>Salvo</hi> could give him none; for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
that a Protestation can do, is to anticipate a Conclusion, or Estoppel; <hi>i. e.</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
that the doing of any such Act as is Contained in the Protestation, shall not be
constructed to the Prejudice of the Party; so as to Barr or Conclude him from Claym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afterward that which <hi>in rei veritate</hi> is his right. So that this Protestation of
the Clergy is no Argument of their Right to be present and to Vote in Capital Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and that chiefly for these two Reasons: 1. By the Roll we find that the Clergy
did not only depart when Capital Cases were to be debated, but also in all other
Cases that were done that Session; because there were many Matters of Treason
to be handled, therefore they absented from the Parliament altogether: so it is in
Sir. <hi>Rob. Cotton's Abr.</hi> 322. So that this Protestation may very well be supposed to
have been made with respect to those other Matters which were not Capital, where
they had an undoubted Right to be present, and therefore such a Protestation
might be very Proper; and not to have any respect to those Cases which were
Capital, especially seeing they did alwaies in such Cases Absent themselves in
former times without making any Protestation. 2. Admitting that the Clergy
did intend that Capital Cases, as well as others which were not Capital, should
be within the <hi>Salvo</hi> of their Protestation; yet nothing can be inferred from
thence, but that they themselves said they had Right to be present, and what
then? Must it of necessity follow that they had Right because they Claimed
it? If that Consequence had been allowed to be good, I am afraid the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> had been Incorporated long ago into the Triple Crown.</p>
            <p>As for that Clause of the Protestation for the Validity of all such Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as should happen to pass in their Absence, I must confess I do not think
it was to very much purpose. 1. Because that without any <hi>Proviso</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the House of Lords in their Absence, had certainly been valid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
as I shall prove anon. 2. If they had not been good, this Clause could
not have helped them; because wherever the Assent and agreement of any person
or persons is Requisite for the perfection of a thing, it is necessary that that thing
to which the Assent is Requisite, be <hi>in esse</hi> at the time of the Assent made;
for otherwise it is an Assent to nothing, and that is as much as no Assent at
all: If therefore the Assent of the Prelates be indispensably necessary to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of every Judgment and Bill that passeth the House of Lords; Such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Assent to all that shall Pass, during their Absence in General, which is an
Assent to they do not know what themselves, will not amount to a sufficient
agreement; The Reason is, because the Law of <hi>England</hi> doth presume that in
all private Transactions between Party and Party, and much more in things of
Publick concernment and of so great moment, as Making of Laws and Giving
Judgment of Death uppon Peers of the Realm, whatsoever a Man doth is upon
Rational Inducements, and that the Conveniency and Advantage which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98451:16"/>
will Accrue thereby, is the Motive that prevails with him to agree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap> the
thing; and therefore all such Agreements as are made at aventure, when the
party agreeing knows not what it is he agreed to, (as when a man agreeth to
a thing before it be in <hi>esse</hi>) are rejected in Law as Irrational and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>:
So if a Tenant comes and say to his Lord, <hi>I agree to all Grants which you

            <p>But then you will demand, Why should the House of Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suffer these
things to be entred upon the Roll, if they did not think that their Claims
were legal? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this it may be answered: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> is only a Register

yet it doth not follow that every thing that is entred upon the Roll, is good
Authority for Matter of Law, except it appear by the Roll that it was taken for
Law by the Vote and Resolution of the House; and therefore although the House
of Lords did suffer this Protestation to be entred upon the Roll, yet it doth not
follow that they did allow that every thing that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of a Protestation is a thing which is always reckoned the best Expedient for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
of Differences when begun, or preventing of them before they are begun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or at least for diverting them till a more seasonable time, when the putting of the
Matter to a Tryal, would either prove dangerous, or expensive of more time, than the

House, the Clergy in a great Rage depart the House, and Protest against the Bills, as
abridging the Authority and Priviledges of the Holy Church; which the Lords suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

In the next, place, I shall consider the Roll of 21 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. where the first Petition
that the Commons made that Parliament to the King, was; <hi>For that divers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were heretofore undone, for that the Clergy were not present, the Commons
prayed the King, that the Clergy would appoint some to be their Common Proctor,
with sufficient Authority thereunto.—The Prelates therefore being severally exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
appointed Sir</hi> Thomas de la Percie <hi>their Proctor to Assent, as by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
appeareth.</hi> Thus was the Practice of Constituting Proxies begun.</p>
            <p>It is apparent to all men of Common Sense, That if the Clergy were forbidden
to give Judgment of Death by any Law or Rules whatsoever, that Law was violated
by their Constituting a Proxy, as much as if they had been personally present: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no their Personal Presence was prohibited by the Law of <hi>England</hi> at this time,
I leave to the Judicious Reader to determine from what hath been said before: If
they were prohibited, then certainly this Petition of the Commons was unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and contrary to Law. It is not impossible that the House of Commons being
but fallible, men spurred on by too precipitant a Zeal and Eagerness for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of a Business, should be endeavouring to make sure work, fall inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
into another extream, and through the want of due Examination of Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
become guilty of a mistake. I shall not trouble my self much in discoursing
about the possibility of the thing, for I shall make appear, that it was actually so
in our Case: For, 1. That which was the ground of the Petition of the Commons;
<hi>viz. That divers Judgments have been heretofore undone,</hi> &amp;c. was a palpable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
<hi>de facto:</hi> It is true, the two Judgments that were given against the two <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> 15 <hi>E.</hi> 2. were reversed for this cause, through the great favour and interest that
they then had at Court: And there is no question, but these two Judgments were
the ground of the Commons Petition made. 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. for there are no other Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be found that were ever reversed for this cause; but how well their Petition
was grounded you may learn from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Where this same Judgment is declared
in Parliament to be good, and that the aforesaid reversal was null and void; and the
two <hi>Spencers</hi> upon this Affirmance of the Judgment were Executed. I suppose if the
forwardness and Zeal of the Commons had given them time to search the Records
with so much diligence that they might have found this, they had not said; <hi>For that
divers Judgments have been heretofore undone,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That in point of Law the
absence of the Prelates makes not a Judgment erronious, besides the Authority of
that Record, 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. is further proved: 1. From the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Case, 2. <hi>H.</hi> 5.
who petitioned that the Judgment that was given against his Father might be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed,
and Assigns for Errour, that it was not with the Assent of the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
who are Peers of the Realm: the House of Lords upon Debate resolved, that it
was not Errour, and therefore the Judgment was good. 2ly, If the Consent of the
Clergy be absolutely necessary to every Judgment that passeth the House of Lords,
then consequently it must be necessary to every Act of Parliament: There can no
manner of Difference be Assigned between the two Cases as to this Matter, for their
Power and Jurisdiction in Legislation, is every whit as ample as their Power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature;
and therefore their Concurrence is equally necessary in both Cases. But
it is a thing of dangerous Consequence to Assert, that an Act of Parliament cannot be
made without the Consent of the Clergy, for it will make some of the best Laws
that ever were made in <hi>England</hi> before the Reformation, and which have ever been
to this day accounted firm and established Laws, of no force at all. Most of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of <hi>Mortmain</hi> were made against the will of the Clergy, and their Dissent
is recorded. The Statute <hi>De A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2+ letters">
                     <desc>••…</desc>
                  </gap>rtatis Religiosorum,</hi> is Enacted by the King,
<hi>De Concilio, Comitum, Baronum, Magnatum, Procerum, &amp; Regni sui Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum
in Parliament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. and yet proved by my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his Exposition
of this Statute to be a good Law, from the Testimony of many Records and
Acts of Parliament that recite this Statute. The Statute of 3 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. was
made against the Clergy, for the ill disposition of Dignities, Offices, Canonries, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends,
and Parsonages, and other Ecclesiastical Preferments, upon lewd and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98451:17"/>
persons, to the Scandal of Religion, and the neglect of Divine Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The Clergy being somewhat displeased that any should undertake to reform them,
at the first reading of the Bill departed, but notwithstanding the Bill past, and is said
to be Enacted by the King, Nobles of the Land, and the Commons, leaving out the
Clergy: And yet this hath been allowed for an established Law by all the Judges.
See Roll 3 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 38.—40. The Statute of 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 12. was made to impower Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
of Peace to enquire of several grievous Extortions committed by the Bishops
and their Officers, to the great grievance and oppression of the Kings Liege People,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The bringing in of this Bill offended the Clergy more than the former, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they left the House in a great Huff, Protesting against the Bill as inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to the Franchises and Jurisdiction of the Church, yet notwithstanding it
passed into a Law.</p>
            <p>The Clergy were absent all the Parliament that was held 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and yet divers
good and profitable Laws were made that Parliament never questioned for their
Validity, but always put in use, as 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. about Merchants, <hi>c.</hi> 8. concerning
the granting of Annuities, <hi>c.</hi> 9. concerning new Impositions, <hi>c.</hi> 11. of Assizes; and
several others made in the absence of the Clergy. I might for this enumerate
all the Statutes of <hi>Provisors</hi> and the Statutes of <hi>Premunire,</hi> for Suers of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,
and other Process from <hi>Rome,</hi> as 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. and 22. where the Names
of the Clergy are left out: and 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. and <hi>c.</hi> 3. where they were so
far from Assenting, that they entred Protestations against them, because they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged
the Popes Authority, as is before observed: And the 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5. passed
against the will of the whole Clergy. And so the Statute that was made in the
same year about the Queens Marriage, without the Kings Consent, was made
without the Concurrence of the Clergy; for their Assent to it was special in this
manner: <hi>So far as it is agreeable to the Law of God and the Holy Church.</hi> Which
being conditional and under a Restraint, was according to the Course of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
accounted as no Assent at all, and so it was specially Entred; and yet
none did ever question the Strength and Force of this Act.</p>
            <p>These Statutes being allowed by the Judges of <hi>England</hi> as Good and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Laws, although they were not agreed to by the Lords Spiritual, do prove
that the Concurrence of the Lords Spiritual is no more necessary to the Essence
and Perfection of an Act of Parliament, than the Concurrence of as many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Lords.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter, it appears to have been a very strange and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
over-sight in the House of Commons at that time, that they should be
the first Introducers of an Innovation upon so false a Ground as theirs was. But
however this Practice being built upon so sandy a Foundation, it seems had, no long
continuance; for there doth not occur in any Author, nor in the Abridgments of
the Records, any mention of more than Two Proxies; the first was Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> de la
<hi>Percie,</hi> the second was Sir <hi>William</hi> de la <hi>Scroope,</hi> who immediately succeeded him
in this his New Office: But seeing it is rash to Assert a Negative in a Matter of Fact,
it will be very satisfactory if any will inform us of any more, and that may easily
be done, if there were any; because none can act as a Proxy, except his Procurator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
be Entred upon the Roll.</p>
            <p>Most of those Records that are Cited in the behalf of the Spiritual Lords, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such as were in those times when the Clergy put in Proxies, as all those that
are upon or after the 21 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and about the beginning of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. Such is the Case
of the Earl of <hi>Arundel;</hi> for it appears by the Record, that the Constitution of the
Proxy was in <hi>N.</hi> 9. and the Arraignment of the Earl was not till <hi>N.</hi> 15, or 16. and
therefore after the Proxy; so that there was reason that the Records should be
Entred <hi>by the King, Bishops, and Lords,</hi> seeing the Bishops Deputy was present;
but it is no Argument of their personal presence: Or else they are Cases of Bills of
Attainder, and that is not much to our purpose; for those will as well prove that the
House of Commons have sate Judicially upon Matters of Life and Death. A Bill
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98451:18"/>
of Attainder is reckoned the strongest way, because there is a Concurrence of all the
Three Estates, of both the Judicial and Legislative Power; and that is necessary for
making a Forfeiture of all manner of Rights, Titles, and Interests, which otherwise
are not Forfeitable: And if at any time there was an opportunity for the Clergy
to transgress the Laws both Ecclesiastical and Civil. (I mean the Statutes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of this Realm) which was connived at by the rest of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
I hope that will not be accounted a Precedent to overthrow a Custom of so
Ancient a Date, and so agreeable to the Fundamental Constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Grounds and Reasons of the Common Law, and also Confirmed
by an Act of Parliament: So by degrees the whole Method and Course of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
Proceedings may be altered, and the very Being and Foundation of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shaken. So we should have had the Lords refusal to Sequester the Earl of
<hi>Danby</hi> from Parliament, a Precedent; if they had not afterward acknowledged it to
have been an Errour. We may find in many Cases the Lords Dispensing with
<hi>Magna Charta</hi>: 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 6. They passed Judgment of Death upon several Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners:
15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. We find several Particulars enumerated, wherein the Commons
complained of Breaches of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and we are not sure that all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Cases were remedied, and therefore must these stand all for Precedents? At this
Rate there are few Points of Law perhaps that will escape Doubt and Controversie:
for we shall have some of the Lords pretend they can transfer their Honours, and so
are able to make the Kings Enemies his Councellors, because in <hi>Daincourts</hi> Case, 4. <hi>Inst.</hi>
126. one Branch of the Family sate in the House by vertue of a Grant from the other
Branch of the Family, from the Raign of <hi>E.</hi> 2. to <hi>H.</hi> 6. And the Earldom of
<hi>Chester</hi> was first granted 17 <hi>H.</hi> 3. and transferred 39 <hi>H.</hi> 3. And upon these
Precedents there was an Attempt in the Lord <hi>Fitz-Walter's</hi> Case to make a
Baron by Translation of interest. Admitting therefore that Once or Twice, or
such a matter, the Bishops have Voted in Capital Cases, yet they cannot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
an Antient and well established Custom, though I am not apt to believe there
are many such Cases: However it was a very pleasant humour of a Gentleman
that wrote lately of this matter and cited a Precedent in the Raign of <hi>R.</hi> 2.
Of the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Wardor,</hi> whereas there was no such Lord as <hi>Arundel</hi>
and <hi>Wardor</hi> Created till King <hi>James</hi> his time, <hi>Vide pa. ult.</hi> so <hi>p.</hi> 30. He cites the
Case of the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who in his Petition says the Prelates are Peers
in Parliament, and assigns for Error that they were Absent when Judgment was
given against his Father; and this is a good Precedent to prove the Prelates
right to Vote in Capital Cases as Peers in Parliament: Whereas the Petition was
disallowed, and the Judgment affirmed by the resolution of the whole House.
Such a way of arguing deserves some special animadversion. But I shall super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede
any further Consideration of the matter, and shall conclude that without
an Act of Parliament the Bishops can have no right to Vote in Capital Cases,
which if this present Parliament shall think fit to make, it behoves all true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to agree thereto.</p>
