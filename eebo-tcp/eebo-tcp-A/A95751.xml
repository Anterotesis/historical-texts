            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A ſecret which would have beene ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Antiquity, that <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> all the ſeven wiſe men of <hi>Greece, Archimedes, Socrates, Plato, Euclid,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> had (if coaevals) joyntly adored him, and unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the deifying of the revealer of ſo great a Myſtery: and truly (beſides them) a great many other learned men, who for the laboriouſneſſe of long and various Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Diviſions, and Radicall extractions of ſeverall ſorts, were deterred from the proſecuting, and divulging of their knowledge in the chiefeſt, and moſt noble parts of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, would have left behind them diverſe exquiſite Volumes, of an incomprehenſible value, if the Arithmetical equality of difference, agreeable to every continued Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall proportion, had been made known unto them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I am infallibly perſwaded, that, in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſcientifically diſpoſed ſpirits, the Philoſophers ſtone is but traſh to this invention, which will alwayes (in their judicious opinions) be accounted of more worth to the Mathematicall world, then was the finding out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> to the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> or the diſcovery of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

            <p>What the merit then of the Author is, let the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious judge: for my owne part, I doe not praiſe him ſo much, for that he is my Compatriot, as I muſt extoll the happineſſe of my Countrey, for having produced ſo brave a ſpark, in whom alone (I may with confidence averre, it is more glorious, then if it had beene the conquering Kingdome of five hundred potent Nations: for, by how much the gifts of the mind, are more excellent then thoſe of either body or fortune; by ſo much the divine effects of the faculties thereof, are of greater conſequence, then what is performed by meer force of Armes, or chance of Warre.</p>
            <p>I might ſay more in commendation of this gallant man, but that my diſcourſe being directed to the Reader, he will poſſibly expect to be entertained with ſome other purpoſe then Encomiaſticks; and therefore, to undeceive him of thoſe hopes (if any ſuch there be) I will aſſure him, that to no other end I did require his obſervance here, but to be informed by me of the laudable endowments of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Baron, whoſe eminencie above others (wher-ever he be ſpoke of) deſerveth ſuch an ample Elogie by it ſelfe, that the paper, graced with the receiving of his name and character, ſhould not be blurred with the courſe impreſſion of any other ſtuffe.</p>
            <p>However the Reader ought not to conceive amiſſe for his being detained ſo long upon this Eulogiſtick ſubject, without the variety of any peculiar inſtruction beſtowed on him; ſeeing I am certaine there is nothing more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to him, or that more efficaciouſly can tend to his improvement, then the imitation of that admirable Gentleman, whoſe immortall fame, in ſpite of time, will out-laſt all ages, and look eternity in the face.</p>

            <p>Thus doth the various mixture of moſt excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

If we then conſider how a great many, deſpairing ever to get out (if once entred) of the confuſed obſcurity wherein the doctrine of Triangles hath beene from time to time invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, have rather contented themſelves barely with Scale and Compaſſe, and other mechanick tooles and inſtruments, to proſecute their operations, and in any reaſonable meaſure to glance ſomewhat neare the truth, then, thorough ſo many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterments, and harſh incumbrances, to touch it to a point, in its moſt indiviſible and infallible reality. And how others, for all their being more induſtrious, in proving their Concluſions by the <hi>Mediums</hi> from which they are neceſſarily inferr'd, are nevertheleſſe (even when they have beſtowed half an age in the Trigonometricall practice) oftentimes ſo farre to ſeek, that, without a great deale of premeditation adviſement, and recollecting of themſelves, they know not how to diſcuſſe ſome queries, corollaries, problems, conſectaries, proportions, wayes of perpendicular falling, and other ſuch like occurring deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table matters, incident to the ſcientifick meaſuring of Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles; We cannot chooſe (theſe things being maturely perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) but be much taken with the pregnancy of this device, whereby we ſhall ſooner hit to a minut upon the verity of an Angle or Side demanded, and trace it to the very ſource and originall, from whence it flowes, then another mechanically ſhall be able to come within three degrees thereof, although he cannot, for the ſame little he doth, afford any reaſon at all; And ſo ſuddenly reſolve any Trigonometricall queſtion (without

            <p>EVery Circle is divided into three hundred and ſixty parts, called Degrees, whereof each one is Sexageſimated, Subſexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſimated, Reſubſexageſimated, and Bireſubſexageſimated, in Minutes, Seconds, Thirds, Fourths, and ſo far forth as any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putiſt is pleaſed to proceed for the exactneſſe of a Reſearch, in the calculation of any Orbiculary Dimenſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As Degrees are the meaſure of Arches, ſo are they of Angles; but that thoſe are called Circumferentiall, theſe Angulary Degrees, each whereof is the three hundred and ſixtieth part of four right Angles, which are nothing elſe but the ſurface of a Plain to any point circumjacent; for any ſpace whatſoever about a point, is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in 360. parts: And the better to conceive the Analogie that is betwixt theſe two ſorts of graduall Meaſures, we muſt know, that there is the ſame proportion of any Angle to 4. right Angles, as of an arch of ſo many circumferential degrees to the whole circumference.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence is it, that the ſame number ſerves the Angle, and the Arch that vaults it, and that divers quantities are meaſured (as it were) with the ſame graduall meaſure. Angles and Arches then are Analogicall, and the ſame reaſon is of both.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Seeing any given proportion may be found in numbers, and that any two quantities have the ſame proportion that the two numbers have, according to the which they are meaſured: if for the meaſuring of Triangles there muſt be certain proportions of all the parts of a Triangle, to one another known, and thoſe proportions explained in numbers it is moſt certain, all Magnitudes, being Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures at leaſt in power, and all Figures either Triangles, or Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, that the Arithmeticall Solution of any Geometricall queſtion, dependeth on the Doctrine of Triangles.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And though the proportion betwixt the parts of a Triangle cannot be without ſome errour; becauſe of crooked lines to right lines, and of crooked lines amongſt themſelves, the reaſon is inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, no man being able to finde out the exact proportion of the Diameter to the Circumference: yet both in plain Triangles, where the meaſure of the Angles is of a different ſpecies from the ſides, and in Sphericalls, wherein both the Angles and ſides are of a circular nature, crooked lines are in ſome meaſure reduced to right lines by the definition of quantity which right lines, <hi>viz.</hi> Sines, Tangents,

            <p n="6">6. And therefore, though the Circles Quadrature be not found out, it being in our power to make the Diameter, or the ſemi-Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, which is the <hi>Radius</hi> of as many parts as we pleaſe, and being ſure ſo much the more that the <hi>Radius</hi> be taken, the error will be the leſſer; for albeit the Sines, Tangents and Secants, be irrationall thereto for the moſt part, and their proportion inexplicable by any number whatſoever, whither whole or broken: yet if they be rightly made, they will be ſuch, as that in them all no number will be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the truth by an integer, or unity of thoſe parts, whereof the <hi>Radius</hi> is taken: which is ſo exactly done by ſome, eſpecially by <hi>Petiſcus,</hi> who aſſumed a <hi>Radius</hi> of twenty ſix places, that according to his ſupputation (the Diameter of the Earth being known, and the Globe thereof ſuppoſed to be perfectly round) one ſhould not fail in the dimenſion of its whole Circuit, the nine hundreth thouſand ſcantling of the Million part of an Inch, and yet not be able, for all that, to meaſure it without amiſſe; for ſo indiviſible the truth of a thing is, that come you never ſo neer it, unleſſe you hit upon it juſt to a point, there is an errour ſtill.</p>

            <head>APODICTICKS.</head>
            <p>THe Angles made by a right Line, falling on another right Line, are equall to two right Angles; becauſe every Angle being meaſured by an Arch, or part of a Circumference, and a right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle by ninety Degrees, if upon the middle of the ground line, as Center, be deſcribed a ſemi-Circle, it will be the meaſure of the Angles, comprehended betwixt the falling, and ſuſtaining lines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it is, that the four oppoſite Angles made by one line, croſſing another, are always each to its own oppoſite equall; for if upon the point of Interſection, as Center, be deſcribed a Circle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very two of thoſe Angles will fill up the ſemi-Circle; therefore the firſt and ſecond will be equall to the ſecond and third, and conſequently the ſecond, which is the common Angle to both theſe couples being removed, the firſt will remain equall to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123211:10"/>
third, and by the ſame reaſon, the ſecond to the fourth, which was to be demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If a right line falling upon two other right lines, make the alternat Angles equall, theſe lines muſt needs be Paralell; for if they did meet, the alternat Angles would not be equall; becauſe in all plain Triangles, the outward Angle is greater, then any of the remote inward Angles, which is proved by the firſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If one of the ſides of a Triangle be produced, the outward Angle is equall to both the inner, and oppoſite Angles together; becauſe according to the acclining or declining of the conterminall ſide, is left an Angulary ſpace, for the receiving of a paralell to the oppoſite ſide, in the point of whoſe occourſe at the baſe, the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Angle is divided into two, which for their like, and alternat ſituation with the two Interior Angles, are equall each to its own conform to the nature of Angles, made by a right line croſſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paralells.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From hence we gather, that the three Angles of a plain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, are equall to two rights; for the two inward, being equall to the Externall one, and there remaining of the three, but one, which was proved in the firſt <hi>Apodictick,</hi> to be the Externall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles complement to two rights; it muſt needs fall forth (what are equall to a third, being equall amongſt themſelves) that the three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of a plain Triangle, are equall to two right Angles, the which we undertook to prove.</p>
            <p n="6">6. By the ſame reaſon, the two acute of a Rectangled plain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, are equall to one right Angle, and any one of them, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers complement thereto.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In every Circle, an Angle from the Center, is two in the Limb, both of them having one part of the Circumference for baſe; for being an Externall Angle, and conſequently equall to both the Intrinſecall Angles, and therefore equall to one another; becauſe of their being ſubtended by equall baſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſemi-Diameters, it muſt needs be the double of the foreſaid Angle in the limb.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Triangles ſtanding between two paralells, upon one and the fame baſe, are equall; for the Identity of the baſe, whereon they are ſeated, together with the Equidiſtance of the Lines, within the which they are confined, maketh them of ſuch a nature, that how long ſo ever the line paralell to the baſe be protracted, the Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cutting of in one off the Triangles, as much of bredth, as it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123211:10"/>
gains of length, (the ones loſſe accruing to the profit of the other) Quantifies them both to an equality, the thing we did intend to prove.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Hence do we inferre, that Triangles betwixt two paralells, are in the ſame proportion with their baſes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Therefore if in a Triangle, be drawn a paralell to any of the ſides, it divideth the other ſides, through which it paſſeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally; for beſides that it maketh the four ſegments, to be four baſes, it becomes (if two Diagonall lines be extended from the ends thereof, to the ends of its paralell) a common baſe to two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Triangles, to which two, the Triangle of the firſt two ſegments, having reference according to the difference of their baſes, and theſe two being equall, as it is to the one, ſo muſt it be to the other, and therefore the firſt baſe, muſt be to the ſecond, (which are the Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of one ſide of the Triangle) as the third to the fourth, (which are the Segments of the ſecond) all which was to be demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="11">11. From hence do we collect, that Equiangled Triangles have their ſides about the equall Angles proportionall to one another. <hi>This ſayes</hi> Petiſcus, <hi>is the golden Foundation, and chief ground of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonometry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. An Angle in a ſemi-Circle is right; becauſe it is equall to both the Angles at the baſe, which (by cutting the Diameter in two) is perceivable to any.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Of four proportionall lines, the Rectangled figure, made of the two extreames, is equall to the Rectangular, compoſed of the means; for as four and one, are equall to two and three, by an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall proportion: and the fourth term Geometrically exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or being leſſe then the third, as the ſecond is more, or leſſe then the firſt; what the fourth hath, or wanteth, from and above the third, is ſupplyed, or impaired by the Surpluſage, or deficiency of the firſt from and above the ſecond: Theſe Analogies being ſtill taken in a Geometricall way, make the oblong of the two middle, equall to that of the extreams, which was to be proved.</p>
            <p n="14">14. In all plain Rectangled Triangles, the Ambients are equall in power to the Subtendent; for by demitting from the right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle a Perpendicular, there will ariſe two Correctangles, from whoſe Equiangularity with the great Rectangle, will proceed ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion amongſt the Homologall ſides, of all the three, that if you ſet them right in the rule, beginning your Analogy at the main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123211:11"/>
(ſeeing the including ſides of the totall Rectangle, prove Subtendents in the partiall Correctangles, and the baſes of thoſe Rectanglets, the Segments of the great Subtendent) it will fall out, that as the main Subtendent is to his baſe, on either ſide (for either of the legs of a Rectangled Triangle, in reference to one another, is both baſe and Perpendicular) ſo the ſame baſes, which are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents in the leſſer Rectangles, are to their baſes, the Segment, of the prime Subtendent: Then by the Golden rule we find, that the multiplying of the middle termes (which is nothing elſe, but the ſquaring of the comprehending ſides of the prime Rectangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) affords two products, equall to the oblongs made of the great Subtendent, and his reſpective Segments, the aggregat whereof by equation is the ſame with the ſquare of the chief Subtendent, or Hypotenuſa, which was to be demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="15">15. In every totall ſquare, the ſupplements about the partiall, and Interior ſquares, are equall the one to the other; for by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Diagonall line, the great ſquare being divided into two equall Triangles, becauſe of their ſtanding on equall baſes betwixt two paralells, by the ninth <hi>Apodictick,</hi> it is evident, that in either of theſe great Triangles, there being two partiall ones, equall to the two of the other, each to his own, by the ſame Reaſon of the ninth: If from equall things <hi>(viz.</hi> the totall Triangles) be taken equall things (to wit, the two pairs of partiall Triangles) equall things muſt needs remain, which are the foreſaid ſupplements, whoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality I undertook to prove,</p>
            <p n="16">16. If a right line cut into two equall parts be increaſed, the ſquare made of the additonall line, and one of the Biſegments, joyned in one, leſſe by the Square of the half of the line Biſected, is equall to the oblong contained under the prolonged line, and the line of Continuation; for if annexedly to the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſide of the propoſed oblong, be deſcribed the foreſaid Square, there will jet out beyond the Quadrat Figure, a ſpace or Rectangle, which for being powered by the Biſegment and Additionall line, will be equall to the neereſt ſupplement, and conſequently to the other (the equality of ſupplements being proved by the laſt <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictick)</hi> by vertue whereof, a Gnomon in the great Square, lacking nothing of its whole <hi>Area,</hi> but the ſpace of the ſquare of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected line, is apparent to equalize the Parallelogram propoſed, which was to be demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:123211:11"/>
17. From hence proceedeth this Sequell, that if from any point without a circle, two lines cutting it be protracted to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity thereof, making two cords, the oblongs contained under the totall lines, and the exceſſe of the Subtenſes, are equall one to another; for whether any of the lines paſſe through the Center, or not, if the Subtenſes be Biſected, ſeeing all lines from the Center fall Perpendicularly upon the Chordall point of Biſection (becauſe the two ſemi-Diameters, and Biſegments ſubſterned under equall Angles, in two Triangles evince the equality of the third Angle, to the third, by the fift <hi>Apodictick,</hi> which two Angles being made by the falling of one right line upon another, muſt needs be right by the tenth definition of the firſt of <hi>Euchilde)</hi> the <hi>Bucarnon</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> demonſtrated in my fourteenth <hi>Apodictick,</hi> will by Quadroſubductions of Ambients, from one another, and their Quadrobiquadrequation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

THe novelty of theſe words I know will ſeeme ſtrange to ſome, and to the eares of illiterate hearers ſound like termes of Conjuration: yet ſeeing that ſince the very infancie of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſuch inventions have beene made uſe of, and new words coyned, that the knowledge of ſeverall things repreſentatively confined within a narrow compaſſe, might the more eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a memory ſuſceptible of their impreſſion (as is apparent by the names of <hi>Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio,</hi> and fifteen more Syllogiſtick Moods, and by thoſe likewiſe of <hi>Gammuth, A-re, B-mi, C-fa-uth,</hi> and ſeventeen other ſteps of <hi>Guidos Scale,</hi> which are univerſally received by men of underſtanding, and that have their ſpirits tuned to the harmony of reaſon) I know not why Logick and Muſick ſhould be rather fitted with ſuch helps then Trigonometrie, which, for certitude of demonſtration, hath been held inferior to no ſcience, and for ſublimity and variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is the primeſt of the Mathematicks.

            <p>IN the letter <hi>T.</hi> I have been ſomething large in the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeverall Radiuſes; for there being eleven made uſe of in the grand <hi>Scheme,</hi> whereof eight are Circumferentiall, and three Angularie, that they might be the better diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123211:15"/>
from one another, when falling in proportion we ſhould have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to expreſſe them; I thought good to allot to every one of them its owne peculiar Character: all which I have done with the more exactneſſe, that by the variety of the Radiuſes amongſt themſelves, when any one of them in particular is pitched upon, we may the ſooner know what part of the <hi>Diagram,</hi> by meanes thereof, is fitteſt for the reſolving of any Orthogonoſphericall problem: though indeed, I muſt confeſſe, when ſometimes to a queſtion propounded, I adapt a figure apart, I doe indifferently (excluding all other characters) make uſe of <hi>To,</hi> or <hi>Rad,</hi> or <hi>R</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the totall Sine, which, without any obſcurity or confuſion at all, I have practiſed for brevities ſake.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, it being my maine deſigne in the framing of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to make alcapable trigonometrically-affected Students with much facility and litle labour attaine to the whole knowledge of the noble Science of the doctrine of Triangles, I deemed it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, the more firmely and readily to imprint the ſeverall <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toquaeres</hi> or praeſcinded Problems thereof in their memories, to accommodate them accordingly with letters proper for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which, if the ingenious Reader will be pleaſed to conſider, he will find, by the very letters themſelves, the place and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of each <hi>Datoquaere:</hi> This is the reaſon why my <hi>Triſſotetras</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Etymologie of its name) is in ſo many divers Terna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and Quaternaries divided; and that the ſharp, meane, blunt, double, and Liquid Conſonants of the Greek Alphabet, are ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly beſtowed in their ſeverall roomes, being all and every one of them ſeated according to the nature of the Moods and Figures, whoſe characteriſticks they are.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Moods of the Planotriangular Table, being in all thirteene, whereof there be ſeven Rectangular, and ſix Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquangular, are fitly comprehended by the three blunt, three meane, three ſharp, and ſoure double Conſonants, the Hebrew Shin being accounted for one of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the ſixteen Moods of the Orthogonoſphericall Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotetras are contained under three ſharp, three mean, three blunt, three double, and foure Liquids, which foure doe orderly particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariſe the Binaries of the laſt two Figures.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the foure Monurgetick Loxogonoſphericals are deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phred
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123211:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by each its owne Liquid in front, according to their literall order.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, the eight Loxogonoſphericall Diſergeticks are alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the foure Liquids, but with this difference from the Monurgeticks, that the Vowels of <hi>A</hi> and <hi>E</hi> precede them in the firſt ſyllable, importing thereby the Datas of an <hi>Angle</hi> or a <hi>Side.</hi> Now becauſe theſe Diſergeticks are eight in all, there being allotted to every Liquid that characteriſeth the Figures, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diverſifie the firſt and ſecond Datas of each reſpective bina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from one another, (in ſo farre as they have reference to each its own Quaeſitum) the Figurative Liquid is doubled when a Side is required, and remaineth ſingle when an Angle.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the Oblique Sphericodiſergeticks, ſo farre as the ſenſe of the Reſolvers could beare it, I did trinifie them with letters convenient for the purpoſe, according to the ſeverall caſes of their Datoquaeres, whoſe diverſity reacheth not above the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of π. β. φ. and τ. δ. θ.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt omitted to tell you, that for the more variety in the laſt two Figures of the Orthogonoſphericals are ſet downe the two letters of <hi>Ch.</hi> and <hi>Shin,</hi> the firſt a Spaniſh, and the ſecond an Hebrew letter.

            <p>THe <hi>Axiomes</hi> of plain Triangles are foure, <hi>viz. Rulerst, Epro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, Grediftal,</hi> and <hi>Bagrediffus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rulerſt,</hi> that is to ſay, the Subtendent in plain Triangles may be either Radius or Secant, and the Ambients either Radius, Sines, or Tangents; for it is a maxime in Planangular Triangles, that any ſide may be put for Radius, grounded on this, that from any point at any diſtance a Circle may be deſcribed: therefore if any of the ſides of a plain Triangle be given together with the Angler, each of the other two ſides is given by a threefold proportion, that is, whether you put that, or this, or the third ſide for the Radius; which difference occaſioneth both in plaine and Sphericall Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles great variety in their calculations.</p>
            <p>The Branches of this Axiom are <hi>Vradeſſo</hi> and <hi>Eradetul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vradeſſo,</hi> that is when the Hypotenuſa is Radius, the ſides are Sines of their oppoſit Angles; ſo that there be two Arches deſcribed with that Hypotenuſal identity of diſtance, whoſe Centers are in the two extremities of the Subtendent; for ſo the caſe will be made plaine in both the Legs, which otherwiſe would not appeare but in one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eradetul,</hi> when any of the ſides is Radius, the other of them is a Tangent, and the Subtendent a Secant. The reaſon of this is found in the very definitions of the Sines, Tangents, and Secants, to the which, if the Reader pleaſe, he may have recourſe; for I have ſet them downe amongſt my Definitions. Hence it is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Speidels</hi> obſervation in his book of Sphericals) that the Sine of any Arch being Radius, that which was the totall Sine becomes the Secant complement of the ſaid Arch, and that the Tangent of any Arch being Radius, what was Radius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Tangent complement of that Arch.</p>

about any Triangle a Circle may be circumſcribed, in which caſe each ſide is a cord or Subtenſe, the halfe whereof is the Sine of its oppoſite Angle, and there being alwayes the ſame reaſon of the whole to the whole, as of the halfe to the halfe, the ſides muſt needs be proportionall to one another, as the Sines of their oppoſite Angles, <hi>quod probandum erat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Directory of this ſecond Axiome is <hi>Pubkegdaxeſh,</hi> which declareth that there are ſeven Enodandas grounded on it, to wit, foure Rectangular, <hi>Upalem, Ubeman, Ekarul, Egalem,</hi> and three Obliquangular, <hi>Danarele, Xemenoro,</hi> and <hi>Shenerolem.</hi>

            <p>The third Axiom is <hi>Grediftal,</hi> that is, in all plain Triangles, As the ſumme of the two ſides is to their difference, ſo is the Tangent of the halfe ſum of the oppoſite Angles to the Tangent of half their difference; for if a Line be drawne equall to the ſumme of the two ſides, and if on the point of Extenſion with the diſtance of the ſhorter ſide a Semicircle be deſcribed, and that from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the protracted Line a Diameter be drawne thorough the Circle where it toucheth the top of the Triangle in queſtion, till it occurre with a parallel to the third ſide, there will ariſe two Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crurall Triangles, one whereof having one Angle common with the Triangle propoſed, and the three of the one being equall to the three of the other, any one of the equall Angles in the foreſaid <hi>Iſoſceles</hi> muſt needs be the one halfe of the two unknowne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. This is the firſt ſtep to the obtaining of what we demand. Then do we find that the third ſide cutteth the ſides of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Triangle according to the Analogie required, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable enough, if with the diſtance of the outmoſt Parallel from the lower end thereof as Center, be deſcribed a new Circle; for then will the Tangents be perſpicuous and ſo much the more for their Rectangularity, the one with the Radius, and the other with its Parallel, which, being touched at an Angle deſcribed in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle, confirmeth the Rectangularity of both. By the Parallels likewiſe is inferred the equality of the alternate Angles, whoſe addition and ſubduction to and from halfe the ſum of the two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Angles make up both the greater and leſſer Angle. <hi>Hereby it is evident how the ſum of the two ſides, &amp;c. which was to be proved.</hi>

The fourth <hi>Axiom</hi> is <hi>Bagrediffiu,</hi> that is, As the Baſe or greateſt ſide is to the ſumme of the other ſides, ſo the difference of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſides to the difference of the Segments of the Baſe; for if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Center of the verticall Angle with the diſtance of the ſhorteſt ſide be deſcribed a Circle, it will ſo cut the two greater ſides of the given Triangle, that, finding thereby two Oblongs of the nature of thoſe whoſe equality is demonſtrated in my <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicticks,</hi> we may inferre (the Oblong made of the ſumme of the ſides, and difference of the ſides being equall to the Oblong made of the Baſe, and the difference of its Segments) that their ſides are reciprocally proportionall; that is, As the greateſt ſide is to the ſum of the other ſides: ſo the difference of the other ſides, to the difference of the Segments of the Baſe, or greater ſide.</p>

Other varieties of calculation in this, as well as other problems, may be uſed; for, beſides that every proportion of the Radius to the ſine, Tangent, or ſecant, and contrarily, may be varied three manner of wayes, by the firſt Axiom of Plaine triangles, the alteration of the middle termes may breed ſome diverſity, by a permutat, or perturbed proportion, which I thought good to admoniſh the Reader of here, once for all, becauſe there is no problem, whether in Plaine, or Sphericall triangles, wherein the Analogie admitteth not of ſo much change.

            <p>The firſt <hi>Axiome</hi> is, <hi>Nabadproſver,</hi> that is, In Obliquangular Sphericals, if a Perpendicular be demitted from the verticall Angle to the oppoſite ſide, continued if need be, <hi>The Sines comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Angles at the Baſe, will be directly proportionall to the Sines of the verticall Angles,</hi> and contrary: the reaſon hereof is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred out of the proportion, which the Sines of Angles, ſubſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Perpendiculars, have to the Sines of the ſaid perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ſo that they belong to the Arches of great Circles, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the ſame point, and that from ſome point of the one, they be let fall on the other Arches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which proportion of the Sines of the ſaid Perpendiculars, to the Sines of the Angles ſubtended by them, ſtoweth immediatly from the <hi>proportion, which</hi> (in ſeverall Orthogonoſphericals, having the ſame acute Angle at the Baſe) <hi>is betwixt the Sines of the Hypotenuſas, and the Sines of the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;</hi> the demonſtration whereof is plainly ſet downe in my <hi>Gloſſe</hi> on <hi>Suproſca,</hi> the firſt generall <hi>Axiome</hi> of the Sphericals, of which this <hi>Axiome</hi> of <hi>Nabadproſver</hi> is a conſectary.</p>

            <p>The ſecond Diſergetick Axiome is <hi>Naverprortes,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the Sines complements of the verticall Angles, in obliquangular Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi> (a Perpendicular being let fall from the double verticall on the oppoſite ſide) <hi>are reciprocally proportionall to the Tangents of the ſides:</hi> the reaſon hereof proceedeth from <hi>Sbaprotca,</hi> the ſecond generall Axiome of the Sphericals; according to which, if we doe but regulate, after the cuſtomary Analogicall manner, two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaries

of proportionals of the former Sines complements, and Tangents propoſed, we will find by the extremes alone (exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the intermediate termes) that <hi>the Sines complements of the verticall Angles (both forwardly, and inverſedly) are reciprocally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Tangents of the ſides,</hi> and contrariwiſe from the Tangents, to the Sines. The Directory of this Axiome is <hi>Allera,</hi> which evidenceth, that the <hi>Moods</hi> of <hi>Allamebne,</hi> and <hi>Erelomab</hi> depend upon it.</p>

            <p>The fourth and laſt Diſergetick Axiome is <hi>Niubprodneſver,</hi> that is to ſay, that in all <hi>Loxogonoſphericals (where the Cathetus is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly demitted) the Sines complements of the Segments of the Baſe, are directly proportionall to the Sines complements of the ſides of the verticall Angles, and contrary.</hi> The reaſon hereof is made manifeſt, by the proportion that is betwixt the Sines of Angles, ſubtended by Perpendiculars and the Sines of theſe Perpendiculars; out of which we collation ſeverall proportions, till, both forwardly and inverſedly we pitch at laſt upon the direct proportion required.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Alamebna</hi> concerneth all thoſe Loxogonoſphericall Diſerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Problems, wherein two <hi>Angles</hi> being propoſed, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjacent <hi>ſide,</hi> the third <hi>Angle</hi> is required; which <hi>Angle,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeverall <hi>Caſes</hi> of this Mood, is alwayes one of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi> at the <hi>Baſe,</hi> that is to ſay (in the termes of my <hi>Triſſotetr as)</hi> a prime, or next <hi>oppoſite,</hi> or at leaſt one of the <hi>co-oppoſites,</hi> to the Perpendicular to be demitted. And therefore, conforme to the nature of the <hi>Caſe</hi> of the <hi>Datoquaere</hi> in hand, and that it may the more conveniently fall within the compaſſe of the Axiome of <hi>Nabadproſver,</hi> an <hi>Angle</hi> by the firſt operation of this <hi>Diſergetick</hi> is to be found out, which muſt either be a <hi>double verticall, a verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> in the little <hi>rectangle,</hi> or a <hi>verticall,</hi> or <hi>co-verticall</hi> (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I call it) in one of the <hi>correctangles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much I have thought fit to premiſe of the <hi>praenoſcendum</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> before I come to its <hi>Cathetotheſis;</hi> becauſe, in my <hi>Triſſotetrall</hi> Table, to avoid the confuſion of <hi>homogeneall</hi> termes (though the order of doctrine would ſeeme to require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Method) the firſt and prime Orthogonoſphericall work is totally unfolded, before I ſpeak any thing of the variety of the Perpendiculars demiſſion, to which, owing its rectangularity, it thereby obtaineth an infallible progreſſe to the <hi>quaeſitum:</hi> but, ſeeing in the <hi>Gloſſe</hi> I am not to aſtrict my ſelf to ſo little bounds, as in my Table, I will obſerve the order that is moſt expedient; and, before the reſolution of any operation in this Mood, deduce the diverſity of the <hi>Perpendiculars</hi> proſiliencie in the ſeverall <hi>Caſes</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:123211:30"/>
Let the Reader then be pleaſed to conſider, that the generall Maxim for the <hi>Cathetotheſis</hi> of this <hi>Mood</hi> is <hi>Cafregpiq,</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof is, that, whether the ſide whereon the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is demitted be increaſed or not, that is to ſay, whether the Perpendicular fall outwardly, or inwardly, it muſt fall from the extremity of the <hi>given ſide,</hi> and oppoſite to the <hi>Angle required:</hi> however it is to be remarked, that in this <hi>Mood,</hi> whatever be the affection of the Angles (unleſſe they be all three alike) the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular may fall out wardly.</p>
            <p>The generall maxim for the <hi>Cathetotheſis</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> as well as for that of all the reſt, is divided into foure <hi>Tenets,</hi> according to the number of the <hi>Caſes</hi> of every <hi>Mood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here muſt I admoniſh the Reader, that he ſtartle not at the mentioning of foure eſpeciall <hi>Cathetothetick Tenets,</hi> and foure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Caſes</hi> belonging to each <hi>Diſergetick Mood,</hi> ſeeing, to the moſt obſervant eye, there be but three of either perceptible in my <hi>Triſſotetr as;</hi> for, the fourth both <hi>Tenet</hi> and <hi>Caſe</hi> being the ſame by way of expreſſion in all the <hi>Moods,</hi> and being fully reſolved by the third <hi>Caſe</hi> of every <hi>Mood,</hi> it ſhall ſuffice to ſpeak thereof here once for all: The <hi>Tenet</hi> of this common <hi>Caſe</hi> is <hi>Simomatin,</hi> that is to ſay, when all the three Angles in any of thoſe <hi>Diſerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> are of the ſame affection, either all <hi>acute,</hi> or all <hi>oblique,</hi> the Perpendicular falleth inwardly, whether the double verticall be an Angle given, an Angle demanded, or neither. Yet here it is to be conſidered, that ſeeing Triangles may be either calculated by their reall and naturall, or by their circular parts, or by both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that for the more facility we oftentimes, inſtead of the propoſed Triangle, reſolve its oppoſite; it is not the reall and given Triangle, that in this caſe we ſo much take notice of, as of its reſolvable, and equivalent, the oppoſite Triangle: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, If a Sphericall Triangle, with two obtuſe Angles, and one acute, be given you to reſolve, it will fall within the compaſſe of <hi>Simomatin;</hi> becauſe its oppoſite Sphericall is ſimply acute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled: and alſo if you be deſired to calculate a Sphericall Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with two acute Angles, and one obtuſe, it will likewiſe fall within the reach of the ſame <hi>Caſe;</hi> becauſe its oppoſite Sphericall is ſimply obtuſangled. The reaſon of both the premiſſes is from the equality of the <hi>oppoſite Angles</hi> of concurring <hi>Quadrants,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:123211:31"/>
which that they are equall, no man needs to doubt, that will take the paines to let fall a Perpendicular from the middle of the one <hi>Quadrant</hi> upon the other; for ſo there will be two Triangles made equilaterall: and ſeeing it is an univerſally received truth, that <hi>equall ſides ſuſtaine equall Angles,</hi> the identitie of the Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular in both the foreſaid Triangles, muſt needs manifeſt the equality of the two oppoſite Angles.</p>
            <p>I have beene the ampler in the elucidating of this <hi>Caſe,</hi> that, it over-running all the <hi>Moods</hi> of the Diſergetick Loxogonoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricals, the Reader, in what <hi>Mood</hi> or <hi>Datoquare</hi> ſoever he pleaſe to reſolve this foreſaid <hi>Caſe,</hi> may for that purpoſe to this place have recourſe; to the which, without any further intended reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Tenet, I doe heartily remit him.</p>
            <p>The firſt eſpeciall <hi>Tenet</hi> of the generall <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totheſis</hi> of this <hi>Mood</hi> is <hi>Daſimforaug,</hi> that is, <hi>When the given Angles are of the ſame nature, but different from the required, the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular falleth outwardly, and the firſt verticall is a given Angle:</hi> the ſecond <hi>Tenet</hi> belonging to the ſecond <hi>Caſe</hi> of this <hi>Mood</hi> is <hi>Dadiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreug,</hi> that is, <hi>When the propoſed Angles are of different affections, the Perpendicular is externally demitted, and one of the given Angles is a ſecond verticall:</hi> Yet this diſcrepance is to be obſerved betweene the externall proſiliencie of the Perpendicular Arch in this <hi>Caſe,</hi> and that other of the former; that in the former, it is no matter from which of the ends of the propoſed ſide, the Perpendicular be let fall upon one of the comprehending Legs of the Angle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which Leg muſt be increaſed; for it is a generall Notan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, that <hi>the ſuſtentative Leg of a perpendiculars exterior demiſſion must alwayes be continued:</hi> but in this <hi>Caſe,</hi> the outward falling of the Perpendicular is onely from one extremity of the given ſide; for, if it be demitted likewiſe from the other end, it falleth then inwardly, and ſo produceth the third <hi>Tenet</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> which is <hi>Dadiſgatin,</hi> that is, <hi>If the given Angles be of a different quality, and that the Perpendicular be internally demitted, the double verticall is one of the propoſed Angles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nature of the Perpendiculars demiſſion in all the <hi>Caſes</hi> of this <hi>Mood</hi> being thus to the full explained, we may without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment proceed to the performance of all the Orthogonoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall operations, each in its owne order thereto belonging.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:123211:31"/>
To begin therefore at the firſt, whoſe <hi>quaſitum</hi> (as I have told you already) is a <hi>verticall Angle,</hi> we muſt know, ſeeing the work is Orthogonoſpherically to be performed, that the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>praenoſcendum</hi> cannot be obtained without the help of one of the ſixteen <hi>Datoquaeres;</hi> and therefore in my <hi>Triſſotetras</hi> (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the nature of what is given, and asked in the <hi>Caſes</hi> of this <hi>Mood)</hi> I have appointed <hi>Upalam</hi> to be the ſubſervient of its <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcendum;</hi> for, by the <hi>Reſolver</hi> thereof, <hi>To—Tag—Nu☞ Mir,</hi> (the ſubtendent and an Angle being given; for one of the given ſides of every Loxogonoſphericall, if the Perpendicular be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demitted, becomes a ſubtendent, and ſometimes two given ſides are ſubtendents both) we frame theſe three peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, for the three <hi>praenoſcendas;</hi> to wit, <hi>Utopat,</hi> for the <hi>double ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> by the meanes of the great <hi>Subtendent</hi> ſide, and the <hi>prime oppoſite Angle:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>Udobaud,</hi> for obtaining of the <hi>firſt verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> in the little rectangle, by vertue of the <hi>leſſer ſubtendent</hi> in the ſame rectangle, and the <hi>next oppoſite Angle:</hi> laſtly, <hi>Uthophauth,</hi> for the <hi>first Co-verticall,</hi> by meanes of the <hi>firſt Co-ſubtendent,</hi> and <hi>firſt cooppoſite Angle:</hi> all which is at large ſet downe in the firſt <hi>partition</hi> of <hi>Alamebna</hi> in my Table.</p>
            <p>The firſt and chiefe operation being thus perfected, the verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Angles ſo found out muſt concurre with each its correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent oppoſite for the obtaining of the Perpendicular, neceſſary for the accompliſhment of the ſecond operation in every one of the <hi>Caſes</hi> of the foreſaid <hi>Mood;</hi> to which effect <hi>Amaner</hi> is made the <hi>Subſervient,</hi> by whoſe Reſolver <hi>Say—Nag—Tw☞ Nyr,</hi> theſe three Datoquaeres, <hi>Opatca, Obautca,</hi> and <hi>Ophauthca</hi> come to light, and is manifeſtly ſhown how, by any paire of three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall couples of different Angles, the Perpendicular is acquirable.</p>
            <p>Now, though of this work (as it is a ſingle one) no more then of the other ſucceeding it in the ſame Mood, nor of the laſt two in any of the <hi>Diſergeticks</hi> in their full Analogy, I doe not make any mention at all in my <hi>Table;</hi> but, after the couching of the firſt operation for the Praenoſcendas, ſupply the roomes of the other two, with an equivalent row of proportionals out of them ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, for attaining to the knowledge of the maine <hi>quaeſitum:</hi> yet in this <hi>Comment</hi> upon that <hi>Table,</hi> for the more perſpicuities ſake, and that the Reader may as well know, what way the rule
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:123211:32"/>
is made, as how thereby a demand is to be found out, I have thought fit to expatiat my ſelfe for his ſatisfaction on each ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration apart, and Analytically to diſplay in the <hi>gloſſe,</hi> what is compounded in the <hi>Triſſotetras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, according to that preſcribed method, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this <hi>Mood,</hi> the perpendicular by the ſecond operation being already obtained, it is requiſite for the promoving of a third work, that the ſaid Perpendicular be made to joyne with <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verticaline, the double verticall, and ſecond co-verticall</hi> conforme to the quality of the three Caſes, thereby to obtaine the Angles <hi>at the Baſe,</hi> for the which all theſe operations have beene ſet on foot; to wit, <hi>the next cathetoppoſite,</hi> (whoſe complement to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle is alwayes the Angle required) <hi>the prime cathetoppoſite,</hi> and <hi>the ſecond Cocathetoppoſite:</hi> for the proſecuting of this laſt work, <hi>Edoman</hi> is the ſubſervient, by whoſe Reſolver, <hi>To—Neg—Sa☞Nir,</hi> we are inſtructed how to regulate the Problemets of <hi>Catheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dob, Cathatop,</hi> and <hi>Catheuthops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe two laſt operations being thus made patent in their ſeverall ſtructures, it is not amiſſe that we ponder how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitely they may be conflated into one, to the end, that the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the finall Reſolvers of the Diſergeticks in my <hi>Triſſote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras</hi> (which are all and each of them compoſed of the ingredient termes of two different works) may be the more evidently knowne, and obvious to the reach of any ordinary capacity, for the performance hereof, the Reſolvers of theſe two operations are to be laid before us, <hi>Say—Nag—Ta☞Nyr,</hi> and <hi>To—Neg—Sa☞Nir:</hi> and, ſeeing out of both theſe orders of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals, there muſt reſult but one, it is to be conſidered, which be the foure <hi>ejectitious</hi> termes, and which thoſe foure we ſhould <hi>reſerve</hi> for the Analogy required; all which, that it may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood by the induſtrious Reader, I will interpret the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers ſo farre forth as is requiſite: and therefore <hi>Say—Nag—To☞Nyr,</hi> being, <hi>As the Sine of one of the Angles at the Baſe, or Cathetoppoſite, is to the Sine complement of a verticall: ſo the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius to the Sine complement of the Perpendicular:</hi> And the other, <hi>To—Neg—Sa☞Nir,</hi> being, <hi>As the Radius, to the Sine complement of the Perpendicular: ſo the Sine of a verticall, to the Sine complement of a Cathetoppoſite or Angle at the Baſe;</hi> it is perceivable enough

how both the <hi>Radius,</hi> and the <hi>Perpendicular</hi> are in both the rows: nor can it well eſcape the knowledge of one never ſo little verſed in the elements of Arithmetick, that the Perpendiculars being the fourth terme in the firſt order of proportionals, is nothing elſe but that it is the quotient of the product of the middle termes, divided by the firſt, or <hi>Logarithmically</hi> the remainder of the firſt termes abſtraction from the ſumme of the middle two; ſo that the whole power thereof is incloſed in theſe three termes, whereby it is moſt evident, that with what terme ſoever the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Perpendicular be employed to concurre in operation, the ſame effect will be produced by the concurrence of its ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents with the ſaid terme, and therefore in the ſecond row of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals, where it is made uſe of for a fellow multiplyer with the third terme to produce a <hi>factus,</hi> which divided may <hi>quote</hi> the maine <hi>quaeſitum,</hi> or <hi>Logarithmically</hi> to joyne with the third terme, for the ſumming of an Aggregat from which the firſt terme being abſtracted, may reſiduat the terme demanded, it is all one, whether the work be performed by it ſelfe, or by its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent, <hi>viz.</hi> the three firſt termes of the firſt order of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals, in whoſe potentia it is: whereupon the fourth terme in the ſecond row being that, for the obtaining whereof, both the Analogies are made, we need not waſte any labour about the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Perpendicular (though a ſubſervient to the chiefe quaeſitum) but leaving roome for it in both the rows, that the equipollencie of its conflaters may the better appeare, go on in work without it, and, by the meanes of its conſtructive parts, with as much certainty effectuat the ſame deſigne.</p>
            <p>Thus may you ſee then how the eight termes of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Reſolvers, are reduced unto ſix; but there remaining yet two more to be ejected, that both the orders may be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a compound row of foure proportionals: let us conſider the <hi>Radius,</hi> which, being in both the rows as I have once told you already, may peradventure, without any prejudice to the work, be ſpared out of both. Thus much thereof to any is perceiveable, that in the <hi>firſt</hi> Reſolver, it is the <hi>third</hi> proportionall; and in the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> and conſequently a <hi>multiplyer</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> and in the <hi>other</hi> a <hi>divider:</hi> or <hi>Logarithmically</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> a <hi>ſubtractor,</hi> and in the <hi>firſt</hi> an <hi>adder:</hi> now it being well known that <hi>diviſion</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws

Thus from thoſe two reſolvers, foure termes being with reaſon ejected, we muſt, for the finding out of the laſt in the ſecond Reſolver, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuat as much by <hi>three,</hi> as formerly was on <hi>ſeven</hi> incumbent, which <hi>three</hi> being the firſt, and ſecond termes in the firſt row of proportionalls; and the third in the ſecond, the two Reſolvers <hi>Say—Nag—To☞Nyr,</hi> &amp; <hi>To—Neg—Sa☞nir</hi> are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by this one <hi>Say—Nag—Sa—☞Nir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the ſine of one verticall to the Antiſine of an oppoſite; ſo the ſine of another verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to the Antiſine of another oppoſite:</hi> and though the ſecond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolver doth import, that this other oppoſite is to be found out by the Antiſine of the perpendicular, and ſine of a ſecondarie verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, yet doth it in nothing evince the coincidence of the two operations in one; becauſe the firſt two termes of the Reſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Analogie, doe adaequatly ſtand for the perpendicular, which I have proved already, and therefore theſe <hi>two</hi> in their proper places co-working with the <hi>third</hi> terme, according to the rule of proportion, have the ſelfe ſame influence, that the Perpendicular ſo ſeconded, hath upon the <hi>operatum.</hi>

            <p>Now, to contract the generality of this finall Reſolver, <hi>Say—Nag—Sa☞Nir,</hi> to all the particular <hi>Caſes</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> we muſt ſay, <hi>When the given Angles are of the ſame affection, and the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diverſe,</hi> as in <hi>Daſimforaug,</hi> the firſt caſe, <hi>Sat—Nop—Seud☞Nob* Kir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine of the double verticall to the Antiſine of the prime Cathetoppoſite: ſo the Sine of the ſecond verticaline</hi> (or verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in the leſſer rectangle) <hi>to the Antiſine of the next Cathetoppoſite,</hi> whoſe complement to a ſemicircle is the <hi>Angle</hi> required.</p>

            <p>And laſtly, if with the different qualities of the <hi>given</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> Angles, the Perpendicular be let fall within, as in <hi>Dadiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatin,</hi> the third <hi>Caſe</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> then is the finall Reſolver to be determined thus, <hi>Sauth—Noph—Seuth☞Nops * Ir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine of the firſt coverticall, to the Co-ſine of the firſt Co-oppoſite: ſo is the Sine of the ſecond coverticall, to the Co-ſine of the ſecond Co-oppoſite</hi> which is the <hi>Angle</hi> required.</p>
            <p>The originall reaſon of all theſe operations is grounded on the Axiome of <hi>Nabadproſver,</hi> as the firſt ſyllable of its Directory <hi>Alama</hi> giveth us to underſtand, which we may eaſily perceive by the Analogy, that is onely amongſt the <hi>Angles</hi> without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of <hi>ſides</hi> in the termes of the proportion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Mood</hi> of the firſt Angulary <hi>Figure</hi> (that is to ſay, the firſt two termes of whoſe datas are Angles) is <hi>Allamebne,</hi> which comprehendeth all thoſe Diſergetick queſtions, wherein two <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi> being given and a <hi>ſide</hi> betweene, one of the other <hi>ſides</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which <hi>ſide</hi> (the perpendicular being let fall) is alwayes one of the <hi>ſecond Subtendents,</hi> viz. in the firſt Caſe a <hi>ſecond Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent</hi> of the leſſer Triangle, in the ſecond a <hi>ſecond Subtendent</hi> in the great rectangle, and in the laſt a <hi>ſecond Co-ſubtendent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the knowledge of all theſe, that we may the more eaſily attaine, we muſt conſider the generall maxim of the <hi>Cathetotheſis</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> which is <hi>Cafyxegeq</hi> that is to ſay, that <hi>in all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Allamebne the Perpendicular falleth from the ſide required, and from that point thereof, where it conterminats with the given ſide upon the third ſide, continued if need be;</hi> and according to the variety of the <hi>ſecond ſubtendent,</hi> which is the ſide demanded, there be theſe three eſpeciall <hi>Tenets</hi> of this generall <hi>Maxim,</hi> to wit, <hi>Daſimfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauxy, Dadiſcracforeng,</hi> and <hi>Dadiſcramgatin.</hi>

               <hi>Daſimforauxy,</hi> the firſt eſpeciall <hi>Tenet</hi> of the generall <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Cathetotheſis</hi> of this <hi>Mood</hi> ſheweth, that, <hi>when the propoſed Angles are of the ſame quality and homogeneall, the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular falleth externally, and the first verticall is one of the given</hi>

            <p>The ſecond Tenet, <hi>Dadiſcracforeug,</hi> which pertaineth to the ſecond <hi>Caſe</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> ſheweth, that <hi>when the given Angles are of a diſcrepant nature, and heterogeneall, and that the concurſe of the propoſed and required ſides is at an acute Angle, that then the Perpendicular must be demitted outwardly, and one of the propoſed Angles becomes a ſecond verticall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third <hi>Tenet</hi> is <hi>Dadiſcramgatin,</hi> whereby we learne, that if <hi>with the various affection of the Angles given, the concurſe</hi> (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the preceding Tenet) <hi>be at an obtuſe Angle, the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular falleth inwardly, and that one of the foreſaid Angles is a double verticall.</hi> This is the onely <hi>Caſe</hi> of <hi>Allamebne,</hi> wherein the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular is demitted inwardly, ſave when the three Angles are qualified all alike, of which <hi>Caſe,</hi> becauſe it falleth in all the Moods of the Loxogonoſphericall Diſergeticks, and that in <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebna</hi> I have ſpoke at large thereof, I ſhall not need (I hope) to make any more mention hereafter.</p>
            <p>Having thus unfolded the myſteries of the Perpendiculars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in all the <hi>Caſes</hi> of this <hi>Mood</hi> (as I muſt doe in all thoſe of every one of the other Loxogonoſphericall Diſergeticks; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch Obliquangulars, till they be reduced to a rectangulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which without the Perpendicular is not performable) can never Logarithmically be reſolved) I may ſafely go on, without any let to the Reader, to the three ſeverall Orthogonoſphericall operations thereof, as they ſtand in order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>quaeſitas</hi> of the firſt operation, which are alwayes the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcendas</hi> of the <hi>Mood,</hi> are in this <hi>Mood</hi> the ſame that they were in the laſt, to wit, the double <hi>verticall, the first verticaline, and the firſt coverticall:</hi> and are likewiſe to be found out by the ſame Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas both of <hi>ſide,</hi> and <hi>Angle</hi> here, that they were in the former <hi>Mood;</hi> that is, for the <hi>ſide,</hi> by the <hi>firſt and great Subtendent: the first but little Subtendent: and the firſt Co-ſubtendent:</hi> and for the <hi>Angle,</hi> by the <hi>prime Cathetoppoſite, the neareſt Cathetoppoſite, and the first Co-cathetoppoſite:</hi> ſo that the <hi>Datoquaere</hi> ſounding thus, <hi>the Subtendent, and an Oblique Angle being given, to find the other Oblique,</hi> the Subſervient of this Computation muſt needs be <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palam,</hi> and its Reſolver, <hi>To—Tag—Nu☞Mir,</hi> which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the ſubducing of the Logarithm of the Radius from the

ſumme of the Logarithms of the Sine complement of one of the firſt Subtendents, and Tangent of one of the Angles at the Baſe, reſiduats the Logarithm of the Tangent complement of one of the verticals required, and conſequently involveth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo much generality the particular reſolutions of the <hi>Sub-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems</hi> of <hi>Upalam,</hi> viz. <hi>Utopat, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>doband,</hi> and <hi>

            </p>
            <p>The verticall Angles, according to the diverſity of the three <hi>Caſes</hi> being by the foreſaid Datas thus obtained, muſt concurre with each its correſpondent firſt Subtendent (notified by the Characteriſticks of τ. δ. θ.) for finding out of the perpendicular, requiſite for the performance of the ſecond work in every one of the <hi>Caſes</hi> of this <hi>Mood.</hi> And to this effect <hi>Ubamen</hi> is made the Subſervient, by whoſe Reſolver <hi>Nag—Mu—☞Torp☞Myr,</hi> theſe three Problems, <hi>

            <p>The Perpendicular being thus found out, muſt, for the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the third operation, joyne with the <hi>ſecond verticaline,</hi> the <hi>double verticall,</hi> and <hi>ſecond co-verticall,</hi> according to the nature of the <hi>Caſe</hi> in queſtion, (the Datas being the ſame with thoſe of the third work of the laſt <hi>Mood)</hi> thereby to attaine unto the knowledge of the ſecond <hi>little Subtendent,</hi> the ſecond <hi>great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Co-ſubtendent,</hi> the which are all the maine <hi>quaeſitas</hi> of this <hi>Mood:</hi> To the performance of this laſt operation, <hi>Etalum</hi> is the ſubſervient, whoſe Reſolver <hi>Torp—Me—Nag☞Mur,</hi> teacheth us how to deale with the <hi>under datoquaeres</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theudwd, Cathatwt,</hi> and <hi>Catheuthwth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, the coaleſcencie of theſe laſt two operations in one, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the caſting out of the Radius in both the orders of proportionals, and leaing roome for the perpendicular, without taking the paines to know its value, as hath beene ſhewne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the firſt <hi>Mood</hi> of the ſame <hi>Figure;</hi> it cannot be much
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:123211:35"/>
amiſſe in this place to give a further illuſtration thereof, and make the Reader, by an Arithmeticall demonſtration, feele (as it were) how palpable the truth is of compacting eight proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals into foure; let there be then theſe two orders of numbers, 4—6—8☞12. and 8—12.—14☞21. Where, we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe eight to be the Radius, and twelve the Perpendicular (for ſuch like ſuppoſitions can inferre no great abſurdity) and then let us conſider how thoſe termes doe beare to one another, eſpecially the 12. and 8. which, by poſſeſſing foure places, make up halfe the number of the proportionals. Firſt, we ſee that twelve in the firſt row, is nothing elſe but the reſult of the product of 6. in 8. divided by 4. And ſecondly, that 8. in the ſecond row, caſteth downe, by its diviſion, whatſoever by its multiplication it builded up in the firſt; upon which obſervations we may ground theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quels, that 12. may be ſafely left out, both in the fourth, and ſixth place, taking inſtead of it the number of 4. 6. and 8. in whoſe <hi>potentia</hi> it is: and next 8. undoing in one place, what it doth in another, may with greater eaſe void them both. So that by this abbreviated way of Analogiſing, 4. and 6. alone in their due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before 14. which is the third terme of the ſecond row, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as much to the obtaining of the fourth, or if you will eighth proportionall 21. as if the other foure termes of the two eights, and twelves, were concurrent with it. How plaine all this is, no queſtion needs to be made, and therefore, to returne to our Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (for the explicating whereof, we thought good to make this digreſſion) we muſt underſtand that the finall Reſolver, (in its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall expreſſion) made out of them (they being as they are mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially diſplayed, <hi>Nag-Mu-Torp☞Myr,</hi> &amp; <hi>Torp-Me-Nag☞Mur)</hi> is no other then <hi>Nag-Mu-Na☞Mur,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine complement of one verticall is to the Tangent complement of a Subten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: So the Sine complement of another verticall, to the Tangent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of another Subtendent:</hi> and Analytically to trace the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this operation, even to the ſource from whence it flowes, by foyſting in the Perpendicular, and Radius, we may bring it to the conſiſtence of the former two ſubordinate Reſolvers, whereof the firſt is, <hi>As the Sine complement of a first, or a double verticall, to the Tangent complement of a firſt Subtendent: ſo the Radius to the Tangent complement of the Perpendicular;</hi> and the ſecond, <hi>As the</hi>

            <p>The truth of all theſe operations is grounded on the Axiome of <hi>Naverprortes,</hi> as we are certified by the firſt ſyllable of its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory <hi>Allera,</hi> which we may perceive by the direct Analogy that is betweene the Sines complements of the verticall Angles, and the Tangents complements, (and conſequently reciprocall 'twixt them and the Tangents) of the verticall ſides, which in this <hi>Mood</hi> are alwayes ſecond Subtendents.</p>

The ſecond <hi>Tenet</hi> belonging to the ſecond <hi>Caſe</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> viz. <hi>Dadiſſexamforeur,</hi> ſheweth, that if the propoſed <hi>Angles</hi> be of diſcrepant affections, and that the <hi>ſide</hi> given be conterminat with an <hi>obtuſe Angle,</hi> the Perpendicular is demitted externally, and the demanded <hi>Angle</hi> is a ſecond <hi>verticall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third <hi>Tenet</hi> pertaining to the laſt <hi>Caſe</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> to wit, <hi>Daſimatin,</hi> evidenceth, that if the <hi>Angles</hi> propoſed be of the ſame quality, the Perpendicular falleth interiourly, and the double verticall is the <hi>Angle</hi> required.</p>
            <p>Having thus (as I ſuppoſe) hereby evinced every difficulty of the Perpendiculars demiſſion in all the <hi>Caſes</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> I may the more boldly in the interim proceed to the three rectangular works thereto belonging. Now, it being manifeſt that the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcendas</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> or the <hi>Quaeſitas</hi> of the firſt operation thereof, are the ſame with thoſe of the two <hi>Moods</hi> of the firſt Diſergetick Figure, to wit, the <hi>double verticall, the firſt verticaline,</hi> and the <hi>first co-verticall;</hi> and that, without any alteration at all, they are to be obtained by the ſame <hi>Datas,</hi> both of <hi>ſide,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> in this <hi>Mood</hi> of <hi>Amanepra,</hi> that, they were in the former <hi>Moods</hi> of <hi>Alamebna,</hi> and <hi>Allamebne,</hi> without any further ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what theſe given <hi>ſides,</hi> and <hi>Angles</hi> are (which are to the full expreſſed in the laſt two forementioned <hi>Moods)</hi> I muſt make bold thither to direct you, where you ſhall be ſure alſo to learne all that is neceſſary to know of the <hi>Subſervient</hi> and <hi>Reſolver</hi> of the firſt operation of this <hi>Mood,</hi> both which, to wit, <hi>Upalam</hi> and <hi>To—Tag—Nu☞Mir,</hi> are inſeparable dependents on all the Angularie <hi>Praenoſcendas</hi> of the Loxogonoſphericall Diſergeticks: And though within the generality of this <hi>Subſervient</hi> be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the peculiar <hi>Problemets</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topat, Udobaud,</hi> and <hi>Uthophauth,</hi> which are all three at large couched in the <hi>Triſſotetras</hi> of this <hi>Mood;</hi> yet, becauſe what hath beene already ſaid thereof in the foreſaid Figure, may very well ſuffice for this place, the Readers diligence (I hope) in the turning of a leaf, will ſave me the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of any further recapitulation.</p>
            <p>The Praenoſcendas, or the verticall <hi>Angles,</hi> according to the nature of the <hi>Caſe,</hi> being by the foreſaid <hi>Datas</hi> thus found out, muſt needs joyne with each its correſpondent oppoſite, ſpecified by the characteriſticks of π. β. φ. for the obtaining of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:123211:37"/>
which in all the reſt of the Diſergetick <hi>Moods,</hi> as well as this, is alwayes the <hi>quaeſitum</hi> of the ſecond operation, thorough all the <hi>Caſes</hi> thereof. Of this work <hi>Amaner</hi> is the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient,</hi> by whoſe Reſolver, <hi>Say—Nag—To☞Nyr,</hi> the three ſub-problems, <hi>Opatca, Obaudca,</hi> and <hi>Ophauthca,</hi> are made known, and the ſame <hi>quaeſitum</hi> attained unto by the <hi>Datas</hi> of three ſeveral both cathetoppoſites, and verticals, it being the only <hi>Mood</hi> which with <hi>Alamebna,</hi> hath a cathetoppoſite and verticall catheteure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick identity. The Perpendicular being thus obtained, is, for the effecting of the third and laſt operation, to concurre with the next <hi>cathetoppoſite,</hi> the prime <hi>cathetoppoſite,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cathetoppoſite,</hi> as the <hi>Caſe</hi> requires it, thereby to find out the main <hi>quaeſitum;</hi> which in the firſt <hi>Caſe</hi> by abſtracting the fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall, in the ſecond by abſtracting from the fourth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall, and in the third by adding the fourth proportionall to another verticall, is eaſily obtained by thoſe that have the skill to diſcerne which be the greater, or leſſer of two verticals pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. To the perfecting of this third work, <hi>Exoman</hi> is the <hi>Subſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient,</hi> whoſe Reſolver <hi>Ne-To-Nag☞Sir,</hi> inſtructeth us, how to unfold the peculiar Problems of <hi>Cathobeud Cathopat,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cathopſeuth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, the nature of proportion requiring that of two rowes of proportionals, when the fourth in the firſt order is firſt in the ſecond, that then the multiplyers become dividers, and the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders multiplyers: as by theſe numbers following you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>viz.</hi> 2—4—6☞12. for the firſt row, and 12—4—15☞5, for the ſecond; of which proportionals, becauſe of the fourth terme in the firſt rowes being firſt in the ſecond, if you turne as many multiplyers into dividers as you can, and (where the identity of a Figure requires it) daſh out a multiplyer againſt a divider, you will find, the two foures by this reaſon being raced out, and the two twelves (becauſe of their being in the power of the three firſt proportionals of the firſt row) likewiſe left out, that this Analogy of 6—2—15 doth the ſame effect, that the former ſeven proportionals, for obtaining of the <hi>quaeſitum,</hi> viz. 5. the reaſon whereof is altogether grounded upon the inverſion of a permutat proportion, or the Retrograd Analogy of the alternat termes, whereby the Conſequents are compared to Conſequents, and Antecedents to Antecedents, in the prepoſterous method of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:123211:37"/>
beginning at the ſecond of both the Conſequents and Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and ending at the firſt: therefore (as I was telling you) the nature of proportion requiring that in ſuch a <hi>Caſe</hi> the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyers and dividers be bound to interchange their places, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers of the laſt two operations, viz. <hi>Say—Nag—To☞Nyr,</hi> and <hi>Ne—To—Nag☞Sir,</hi> the firſt whereof being, <hi>As the Sine of a verticall Angle, to the Sine complement of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle at the Baſe, or one of the Cathetoppoſites: ſo the Radius to the Sine complement of the Perpendicular:</hi> and the ſecond, <hi>As the Sine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the Perpendicular, to the Radius: ſo the Sine complement of one of the Cathetoppoſite Angles, to one of the verticals,</hi> may both of them (according to the former rule) be handſomely compacted in this one Analogy, <hi>Na—Say—Nag☞Sir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine complement of an oppoſite is to the Sine of a verticall: ſo the Sine complement of another oppoſite, to the Sine of another verticall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This foreſaid generall <hi>Reſolver,</hi> according to the three ſeverall caſes of this <hi>Mood,</hi> is to be ſpecialiſed into ſo many finall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers; the firſt whereof for <hi>Dadiſſepamforaur, Nop—Sat—Nob—☞Seudfr* At* Aut* ir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the ſine complement of the prime cathetoppoſite, to the ſine of the double verticall: ſo the ſine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the neareſt cathetoppoſite, to the ſine of the ſecond verticalin; the which ſubtracted from the double verticall, leaveth the firſt and great verticall, which is the Angle required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, for the ſecond <hi>Caſe</hi> of this <hi>Mood, Dadiſſexamforeur,</hi> we muſt make uſe of, <hi>Nob—Saud—Nop☞Satfr,</hi> * <hi>Aud* Eut* ir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the ſine complement of the next oppoſite, to the ſine of the first verticallet: ſo the ſine complement of the prime oppoſite, to the ſine of the double verticall,</hi> from which, <hi>if you deduce the firſt verticalm, there will remaine the ſecond and great verticall for the Angle demanded.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The veritie of all theſe operations is grounded on the Axiome <hi>Nabadproſver,</hi> as the ſecond ſyllable of its directorie <hi>Alama,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us underſtand, and as we may diſcerne more eaſily by the ſameneſſe in ſpecies amongſt the proportionall termes; for they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:123211:38"/>
are all Angles, the firſt, and third being Angles at the Baſe (for theſe are alwaies of the oppoſits) and the ſecond, and fourth termes of the verticall Angles, which verticall Angles in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſolvers of this <hi>Mood,</hi> are according to the foreſaid Axiome, <hi>to the Angles of the Baſe directly proportionall, and contrarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Mood</hi> of the ſecond Angularie <hi>figure</hi> of the Loxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonoſphericall Diſergeticks, named <hi>Ahamepnare</hi> is <hi>Ammanepreb,</hi> which is ſaid of all thoſe obliquangularie problems, wherein <hi>two Angles, and an oppoſite ſide being given, the ſide between is required,</hi> and is alwaies one of the <hi>baſal-ſegments:</hi> to the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that we may the more eaſily attaine, we muſt conſider the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>maxime</hi> of the <hi>Cathetotheſis</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> which is <hi>Cafreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagyq</hi> that is, that the perpendicular falleth ſtill from the given ſide, oppoſite to both the Angles given, and upon the ſide requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, continued, if need be, in all and every one of the caſes of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manepreb.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Pluſminus</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> is <hi>Sindiforiu,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>ſumme of the ſegments of the Baſe, if the perpendicular fall inwardly, and the difference of the Baſes, if exteriorly, is the ſide demanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perpendiculars demiſſion, being a <hi>Sine quo non</hi> in all diſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getick operations, it will not be amiſſe, that we ponder what the three <hi>ſeverall tenets</hi> are of the <hi>Cathetotheſis</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> and what is meaned by <hi>Dadiſſepamfor, Dadiſſexamfor,</hi> and <hi>Daſimin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dadiſſepamfor,</hi> the <hi>tenet</hi> of the firſt <hi>Caſe</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> ſheweth, that <hi>if the given Angles be of ſeverall natures, and that the propoſed ſide be oppoſite to an obtuſe Angle, the perpendicular falleth externally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond tenet, <hi>Dadiſſexamfor</hi> expreſſeth, that <hi>if the propoſed Angles be different, and that the ſide given be conterminat with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſe Angle, it falleth likewiſe outwardly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Daſimin,</hi> which is the third <hi>tenet</hi> ſignifieth, that if <hi>the given Angles be of the ſame affection, the falling of the perpendicular is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This much being premiſed of the perpendicular, we may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely goe on to the orthogonoſphericall works of the Mood; and ſo beginning with the firſt operation, conſider what the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcendas</hi> are, which are alwaies the <hi>quaeſitas</hi> by the firſt operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obtainable, and in this Mood the Baſes of the Triangle; but more particularly to deſcend to the illuſtration of the <hi>Caſes</hi> of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manepreb,</hi>

            <p>This ſo often mentioned perpendicular being thus made known, muſt, for the performance of the laſt and third work, joyne with the nixt <hi>Cathetoppoſite,</hi> the prime <hi>Cathetoppoſite,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Co-cathetoppoſite,</hi> as the <hi>Caſe</hi> will beare it, the <hi>Datas</hi> being the ſame in every point here, that in the laſt operation of the foregoing Mood (as by the ſubſervients, <hi>Exoman</hi> and <hi>Epſoner,</hi> is obvious to any judicious Reader) thereby to obtaine the maine <hi>quaeſitum,</hi> which in the firſt <hi>Caſe,</hi> by abſtracting the fourth propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall from the firſt great Baſe, in the ſecond by abſtracting from the fourth proportionall, the firſt little Baſe, and in the third by adding the fourth proportionall to another ſegment of the Baſe, is findable by any, that will undergoe the labour of adding, and ſubſtracting.

Here may the Reader be pleaſed to conſider, that in all the gloſſe upon the poſterior operations of my <hi>Diſergeticks,</hi> I have beene contented to ſet downe (as he may ſee in the laſt two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions) the bare Theorems of the <hi>Reſolvers,</hi> conforme to the nature of their Analogy, without troubling my ſelfe, or any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, with repeating, or reiterating the way, how the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithms of the middle, and initiall termes are to be handled, for the obtaining of a fourth Logarithm; all that can be deſired therein, being to the full expreſſed already in my ample comments upon the Orthogonoſphericall Problems; to the which the induſtrious Reader, in caſe of doubting, may (if he pleaſe) have recourſe, without any great loſſe of time, or labour: however, for his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouragement, I give another hint thereof in the cloſure of this Treatiſe.</p>

            <p>The reaſon of all this is proved by the third Diſergetick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiome, which is <hi>Siubprortab,</hi> as is pointed at by the firſt ſyllable of its Directory <hi>Ammena,</hi> and manifeſted to us in all the Analogies of this <hi>Mood,</hi> every one whereof runneth upon Tangents of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,</hi> and Sines of <hi>Segments,</hi> both to the <hi>Baſe</hi> belonging: nor can any doubt, that heares the reſolution of the <hi>Caſes</hi> of <hi>Ammanep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb,</hi> but that the habitude, which all the termes thereof have to one another, proceedeth meerly from <hi>the reciprocall proportion, which the Tangents of the oppoſite Angles have to the Baſal-ſegments, and contrariwiſe.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Dacramfor,</hi> which is the <hi>Tenet</hi> of the firſt <hi>Caſe,</hi> ſheweth, that <hi>if the propoſed Angle be ſharp, and the required flat, the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar muſt fall outwardly.</hi>

            <p>The firſt work being thus expedited, we are to find out the Perpendicular by the ſecond, but ſo as that my direction to the Reader for the performance thereof ſhall detaine me no longer here, then the time I am willing to beſtow, in telling him, that the whole progreſſe of this operation, as well as of the preceding,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:123211:41"/>
is amply expreſſed in my comment on the laſt <hi>Mood,</hi> from which, what ere is written of the Subſervient, <hi>Ethaner,</hi> its Reſolver, <hi>To—Tag—Se☞Tyr,</hi> or the under-problems, <hi>Aetopca, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobca,</hi> and <hi>Aethophca,</hi> thereby reſolved, may conveniently be tranſplaced hither, and reſeated there againe, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to either; <hi>Ammanepreb</hi> being the onely <hi>Mood,</hi> which with this of <hi>Enerablo</hi> hath a baſal and oppoſite <hi>catheteuretick</hi> identity.</p>
            <p>The Perpendicular, by theſe meanes being found out, muſt be employed in the laſt work of this <hi>Mood,</hi> to concurre with the ſecond <hi>Baſidion,</hi> or little <hi>Baſe,</hi> the ſecond great <hi>Baſe,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Co-baſe,</hi> for obtaining of ſuch <hi>Cathetoppoſites</hi> as are, or uſher the maine <hi>quaeſitas,</hi> which in the firſt <hi>Caſe</hi> is the complement of the fourth proportionall <hi>(viz.</hi> the next <hi>Cathetoppoſite)</hi> to a Semicircle; in the ſecond <hi>Caſe</hi> the prime <hi>Cathetoppoſite,</hi> and in the third, the ſecond <hi>Cocathetoppoſite.</hi> For the perfecting of this operation, <hi>Erelam</hi> is the Subſervient, by whoſe Reſolver, <hi>Sei—Teg—To☞Tir,</hi> we are inſtructed how to unfold its peculiar Problemets, <hi>oedcathob, oetcathop,</hi> and <hi>oethcathops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the three operations being thus ſingly accompliſhed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our wonted manner, the laſt two muſt be inchaced into one, and therefore their Reſolvers, <hi>To—Tag—Se☞Tyr,</hi> and <hi>Sei—Teg—To☞Tir,</hi> muſt be untermed of ſome of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals: the which, that we may performe the more judicionſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let us conſider what they ſignifie apart; the firſt importeth (as in the laſt <hi>Mood</hi> I told you) that, <hi>As the Radius is to the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of one of the oppoſite Angles: ſo the Sine of one of the firſt Baſes, to the Tangent of the Perpendicular:</hi> the ſecond ſoundeth, <hi>As the Sine of one of the ſecond Baſes, to the Tangent of the Perpendicular: ſo the Radius, to the Tangent of an Angle, which either uſhers, of is the Angle required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby it is evident, how the Radius is a multiplyer in the one, and a divider in the other, and that the Perpendicular, which with the Radius is a multiplyer in the ſecond row, is in the power of the three firſt termes of the firſt row, whereof the Radius is one, by vertue of all which, we muſt proceed juſt ſo with theſe laſt two operations here, as we have already done with the two laſt of the Moods of <hi>Alamebna, Allamebne,</hi> and <hi>Ammanepreb,</hi> and ejecting the Radius and Perpendicular out of both, inſtead of

            <p>The firſt thereof, for <hi>Dacramfor,</hi> is <hi>Soed—Top—Saet☞Tob * Kir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine of the ſecond Baſidion, or little Baſe, is to the Tangent of the prime Cathetoppoſite: ſo the Sine of the first, and great Baſe, to the Tangent of the next Cathetoppoſite,</hi> whoſe comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a Semicircle is the Angle required.</p>
            <p>The ſecond finall Reſolver, is for <hi>Damracfor,</hi> the <hi>Tenet</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Caſe,</hi> and is <hi>Soet—Tob—Saed☞Top * Ir,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>As the Sine of the ſecond, and great Baſe, to the Tangent of the next Cathetoppoſite: ſo the Sine of the firſt Baſidion, to the Tangent of the prime oppoſite,</hi> which is the Angle required.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt finall Reſolver, is for the third <hi>Caſe Daſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaein,</hi> and is couched thus, <hi>Soeth—Toph—Saeth☞Tops * Ir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine of the ſecond Co-baſe is to the Tangent of the firſt Coca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetoppoſite: ſo is the Sine of the firſt Co-baſe to the Tangent of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Co-cathetoppoſite,</hi> which is the Angle required.</p>
            <p>The fundamentall reaſon of all this, is from the third Diſerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Axiome <hi>Siubprortab,</hi> the ſecond Determinater of whoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, <hi>Ammena,</hi> ſheweth that the <hi>Mood</hi> of <hi>Enerablo,</hi> in all the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Reſolvers thereof, oweth the truth of its Analogy to the <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>Siubprortab;</hi> becauſe of the <hi>reciprocall proportion tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here may the Reader be pleaſed to obſerve, that the clauſe of the Perpendiculars falling oppoſite to the propoſed Angle, though it be onely mentioned in this place, might have as well beene ſpoke of in any one of the reſt of the Cathetothetick comments; becauſe it is a generall tie incumbent on the demiſſion of Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars in all Loxogonoſphericall Diſergetick Figures, whether Amblygonian or Oxygonian, that <hi>it fall alwayes oppoſite to a knowne Angle, and from the extremity of a knowne ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this generall Maxim, <hi>Cafregpaq</hi> according to the variety of the ſecond Subtendent, which is the ſide required, there be theſe three eſpeciall Tenets, <hi>Dacforamb, Damforac,</hi> and <hi>Dakin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atam.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Dacforamb,</hi> the <hi>Tenet</hi> of the firſt <hi>Caſe,</hi> giveth us to underſtand, that if the given Angle be acute, and that one onely of the other two be an obtuſe Angle, the Perpendicular falleth outwardly.</p>

of this firſt work, with the manner of which (by my former inſtructions, I ſuppoſe him ſufficiently well acquainted) will proceed to the <hi>Cathetouretick</hi> operation of this <hi>Mood,</hi> and perpend by what <hi>Datas</hi> the perpendicular is to be found out.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The perpendicular being thus obtained, muſt aſſiſt ſome other terme in the third operation, for the finding out of the maine <hi>quaeſitum;</hi> which <hi>quaeſitum,</hi> though it be different from the finall one of the laſt <hi>Mood,</hi> yet is the knowledge of them both attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, by meanes of the ſame <hi>Datas;</hi> the perpendicular, and the three ſecond <hi>Baſes,</hi> being ingredients in both.</p>
            <p>It being certaine then, that the <hi>perpendicular</hi> muſt concurre in the laſt work of this <hi>Mood</hi> with the ſecond <hi>Baſidion,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Baſal,</hi> and ſecond <hi>co-Baſe,</hi> for obtaining the ſecond <hi>Subtenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Subtendentall,</hi> and ſecond <hi>co-Subtendent; Enerul,</hi> is made uſe of for their <hi>ſubſervient,</hi> by whoſe Reſolver, <hi>To—Neg—Ne☞Nur,</hi> we are raught how to deale with its ſubordinat Problems, <hi>Catheudwd, Cathatwt,</hi> and <hi>Catheuthwth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the three works being thus ſpecified apart, according to our accuſtomed Method, we will declare what way the laſt two are to be joyned into one; for the better effectuating whereof, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers, <hi>Neg—To—Nu—☞Nyr:</hi> and <hi>To—Neg—Ne☞Nur,</hi> muſt be interpreted; the firſt being, <hi>As the ſine complement of a firſt Baſe to the Radius: ſo the ſine complement of a firſt ſubtendent, to the ſine complement of the perpendicular.</hi> And the ſecond. <hi>As the Radius, to the ſine complement of a ſecond Baſe: ſo the ſine complement of the perpendicular to the ſine complement of a ſecond ſubtendent,</hi> which is the ſide required.</p>
            <p>

Now, ſeeing a multiplier muſt be daſhed againſt a divider, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both quantified alike, and that all unneceſſary peſtring of a work with ſuperfluous ingredients is to be avoided; we are to deale with the Radius, and perpendicular in this place, as formerly we have done in the Moods of <hi>Alamebna, Allamebne, Ammanep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb,</hi> and <hi>Enerablo,</hi> where we did eject them forth of both the orders of proportionalls; and when we have done the like here, inſtead of <hi>Neg—To—Nu☞Nyr,</hi> and <hi>To—Neg—Ne☞Nur,</hi> we may with the ſame efficacie ſay, <hi>Neg—Nu—Ne☞Nur,</hi> that is, <hi>As the ſine complement of one ſide, is to the ſine complement of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent: ſo the ſine complement of another ſide, to the ſine complement of another ſubtendent;</hi> or more determinatly, <hi>As the ſine complement of a first Baſe, to the ſine complement of a firſt ſubtendent: ſo the ſine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of a ſecond Baſe, to the ſine complement of a ſecond ſubtendent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This theorem comprehendeth to the full both the laſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and according to the number of the <hi>Caſes</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> is particularized into three finall Reſolvers, the firſt whereof for the firſt <hi>Caſe, Dacforamb,</hi> is <hi>Naet—Nut—Noed☞Nwd*yr,</hi> that is, <hi>As the ſine complement of the firſt Baſal, or great Baſe to the ſine complement of the firſt Subtendentall, or great ſubtendent: ſo the ſine complement of the ſecond Baſidion, or little Baſe, to the ſine complement of the ſecond ſubtendentine, or little ſubtendent,</hi> which is the ſide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>The ſecond finall Reſolver, is for <hi>Damforac,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Caſe,</hi> and is ſet downe thus, <hi>Naed—Nud—Noet☞Nwt*yr,</hi> that is, <hi>As the ſine complement of the firſt Baſidion, to the ſine complement of the firſt ſubtendentine: ſo the ſine complement of the ſecond Baſal, to the ſine complement of the ſecond ſubtendentall,</hi> which is the ſide in this <hi>Caſe</hi> required.</p>
            <p>The third, and laſt finall Reſolver is for <hi>Dakinatamb,</hi> and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thus, <hi>Naeth—Nuth—Noeth☞Nwth*yr,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>As the ſine complement of the firſt co-baſe, to the ſine complement of the firſt co-ſubtendent: ſo the ſine complement of the ſecond co-baſe, to the ſine complement of the ſecond co-ſubtendent,</hi> which in the third <hi>Caſe</hi> is alwayes the <hi>ſide</hi> required.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of all this is proved out of the fourth, and laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſergetick Axiom, <hi>Niubprodneſver,</hi> whoſe directer <hi>Ennerra,</hi> ſheweth by its Determinater, the ſyllable <hi>Enn,</hi> that the <hi>Datoquaere</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable,</hi>

            <p>All the three works being in this manner perfected, according to our accuſtomed method, we will ſhew unto you what way the laſt two are to be compacted in one: for the better expediting whereof, their Reſolvers <hi>Nag—Mu—To☞Myr,</hi> and <hi>Meg—To—Mu☞Nir,</hi> muſt be explained, the firſt being, <hi>As the Sine complement of an Angle, to the Tangent complement of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent: ſo the Radius, to the Tangent complement of the ſide requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</hi> Or, more particularly, <hi>As the Sine complement of a verticall, to the Tangent complement of a first ſubtendent: ſo the Radius, to the Tangent complement of the Perpendicular:</hi> And the ſecond <hi>Reſolver</hi> being, <hi>As the Tangent complement of a given ſide, to the Radius: ſo the Tangent complement of a ſubtendent, to the Sine complement of a required Angle:</hi> Or, more particularly, <hi>As the Tangent comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Perpendicular, to the Radius: ſo the Tangent complement of a firſt ſubtendent, to the Sine complement of a verticall,</hi> which uſhers the <hi>quaeſitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing it falleth forth, that the Perpendicular, which is the fourth terme in the firſt order of proportionals, becometh firſt in the ſecond row; and that in ſuch an exigent (as I proved already for illuſtration of the ſame point in the <hi>Mood</hi> of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nepra)</hi> the multiplyers and dividers of the firſt row muſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their roomes, and conſequently make the <hi>Radius</hi> ejecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without any prejudice or hindrance to the progreſſe of the Analogy; and a place being left for the Perpendicular in both the rowes, without taking the paines to find our its value, becauſe it is but a ſubordinate <hi>quaeſitum</hi> for obtaining of the maine, and lieth hid in the power of the three firſt proportionals, inſtead of <hi>Nag—Mu—To☞Myr,</hi> and <hi>Meg—To—Mu☞Nir,</hi> we may, with as much truth and energy, ſay, <hi>Mu—Nag—Mu☞Nir,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Tangent complement of a ſubtendent, to the Sine complement of an Angle: ſo the Tangent complement of another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent, to the Sine complement of another Angle:</hi> Or, more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>As the Tangent complement of a first ſubtendent, to the Sine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of a verticall: ſo the Tangent complement of a ſecond ſubten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>

            <p>The proſiliencie of the Perpendicular in all ſphericall Diſerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, being ſo neceſſary to be knowne (as I have often told you) becauſe of the facility thereby to reduce them to Rectangulary operations, it falleth out moſt conveniently here, according to the method propoſed to my ſelfe, to ſpeak ſomewhat of the three ſeverall <hi>Tenets</hi> of the <hi>Cathetotheſis</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> and what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by <hi>Dakyxamfor, Dambyxamfor,</hi> and <hi>Dakypambin.</hi>

            <p>The ſecond work being thus perfected, the perpendicular, thereby found out, is to aſſiſt one of the rere ſubtendents, in obtaining the illatitious terme of the maine <hi>quaſitum,</hi> correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thereto, diſcernable by the <hi>Characteriſticks</hi> or <hi>Figuratives</hi> of δ. τ. θ or, more plainly to expreſſe it, the Perpendicular muſt concurre (according as the <hi>Caſe</hi> requires it) with the <hi>ſecond ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendentine,</hi> the <hi>ſecond ſubtendentall,</hi> and <hi>ſecond co-ſubtendent,</hi> (as you may ſee in the laſt <hi>Mood,</hi> the <hi>Datas</hi> of the Reſolutory partition whereof are the ſame as here) to find out three <hi>Baſes,</hi> which, by abſtracting the firſt from another <hi>Baſe,</hi> then by abſtracting another <hi>Baſe</hi> from the ſecond; and laſtly, by adding the third <hi>Baſe</hi> to another, afford the <hi>ſumme</hi> and <hi>differences,</hi> which are the required <hi>Baſes.</hi>

            <p>All the three works being thus accompliſhed, the manner of conflating the laſt two in one reſts to be treated of; for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfecting of which deſigne, the two Reſolvers, or the ſame in its greateſt generality doubled, <hi>viz. Neg—To—Nu</hi>☞<hi>Nyr,</hi> and <hi>Neg—To—Nu</hi>☞<hi>Nyr,</hi> muſt be interpreted: The truth is, both of them, as they ſound in their vaſteſt extent of ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expreſſe the ſame Analogy, without any difference, which is, <hi>As the Sine complement of a given ſide, to the Radius: ſo the Sine complement of a ſubtendent, to the Sine complement of another ſide:</hi> but when more contractedly, according to the ſpecification of the <hi>ſide,</hi> they doe ſuppone ſeverally, they ſhould be thus expounded; the firſt, <hi>As the Sine complement of a firſt Baſe, to the totall Sine: ſo the Sine complement of a firſt ſubtendent to the Sine complement of the Perpendicular:</hi> and the ſecond, <hi>As the Sine complement of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular, to the totall Sine: ſo the Sine complement of a ſecond ſubten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to the Sine complement of a ſecond Baſe,</hi> which uſhers the main <hi>quaeſitum.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>theorem,</hi> or <hi>propoſition,</hi> comprehendeth in every point all that is in the two laſt operations, and, not tranſcending the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Caſes</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> is divided into ſo many finall Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; the firſt whereof for the firſt <hi>Caſe, Dakyxamfor</hi> is, <hi>Nut—Naet—Nwd☞Noedfr*Aet* Dyr,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt ſubtendent all, to the Sine complement of the first Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the Sine complement of the ſecond ſubtendentine, to the Sine complement of the ſecond Baſe;</hi> which ſubducted from the firſt <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> reſiduats the <hi>ſegment</hi> that is the <hi>ſide</hi> required.</p>
            <p>The ſecond finall Reſolver of this <hi>Mood,</hi> and that which is for the ſecond <hi>Caſe</hi> thereof, <hi>Dambyxamfor,</hi> is <hi>Nud—Naed—Nwt☞Noetfr*Aed* Dyr,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine complement of the firſt ſubtendentine, to the Sine complement of the firſt Baſidion: ſo the Sine complement of the ſecond ſubtendentall, to the Sine comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſecond Baſall;</hi> which, the firſt <hi>Baſidion</hi> being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from it, leaves, for Remainder, or difference, that <hi>ſegment</hi> of the <hi>Baſe,</hi> which is the ſide demanded.</p>
            <p>The laſt finall Reſolver of this <hi>Mood</hi> (belonging to the third <hi>Caſe, Dakypambin,</hi> as alſo to the fourth, <hi>Simomatin,</hi> (if what we have already ſpoke of that matter will permit us to call it the fourth) for <hi>Simomatin,</hi> together with the third <hi>Caſe</hi> of every <hi>Mood,</hi> is ſtill reſolved by the laſt finall Reſolver thereof) is <hi>Nuth—Naeth—Nwth☞Noethj*Aeth* Syr,</hi> that is, <hi>As the Sine complement of the firſt co-ſubtendent, to the Sine complement of the firſt Co-baſe: ſo the Sine complement, of the ſecond Co-ſubtendent, or alterne ſubtendent, to the Sine complement of the ſecond Co-baſe or alterne Baſe;</hi> which added to the firſt <hi>Co-baſe,</hi> ſummes an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregat of ſubjacent <hi>ſides,</hi> which is the totall <hi>Baſe,</hi> or <hi>ſide</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>The fundamentall ground of the truth of theſe Analogies, is in the fourth and laſt Amblygonoſphericall Axiome, <hi>Niubprod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſver;</hi> (as we are made to underſtand by the ſecond <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nater</hi> of its Directory <hi>Ennerra)</hi> for by the direct proportion that, amongſt the terms thereof, is viſible, <hi>(viz.</hi> betwixt the Sines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of the ſubtendents, or Sides of the verticall Angles, and the ſegments of the Baſes, and inverſedly) it is apparent, that this <hi>Mood</hi> doth no leſſe firmely depend upon it, then that of <hi>Ennerable</hi> formerly explained.</p>

Now, with reaſon doe I conjecture, that, without diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reader of his expectation, I may here ſecurely make an end of this Trigonometricall Treatiſe; becauſe of that <hi>Triſſote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall</hi> Table, which comprehendeth all the Myſteries, Axiomes, Principles, Analogies, and Precepts of the Science of Triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Calculations, I have omitted no materiall point unexplained: yet ſeeing, for avoyding of prolixity, I was pleaſed in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the eighth Loxogonoſpherical Diſergeticks, barely to expreſſe in their finall Reſolvers, the Analogie of the termes, without putting my ſelfe to the paines I took in my Spherico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectangulars, how to order the Logarithms,, and Antilogarithms of the proportionalls,, for obtaining of the maine <hi>Quaeſitas,</hi> and that by having to the full explicated the variety of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the foreſaid <hi>Moods,</hi> and upon what ſeverall <hi>Axiomes</hi> they doe depend, thereby making the way more pervious, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Logarithmicall difficulties, for the Readers underſtanding, I deliberatly propoſed to my ſelfe this method at firſt, and choſe, rather then diſperſedly to treat of thoſe things in the gloſſe (where, by reaſon of the diſturbed order, the correſpondencie or reference to one another of theſe Sphericobliquangulary <hi>Dato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaeres,</hi> could not by any meanes have beene ſo conceivable) to ſummon their appearance to the Cataſtrophe of this Tractat, that, having them all in a front before us, we may the more eaſily judge of the ſemblance, or diſſimilitude of their proportionali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,, and what affinity, or relation, whether of parity or imparity is amongſt their reſpective proportionall terms: all which, both for intelligibility and memory, are quicklier apprehended, and longer retained, by being accumulatively reſerved to this place, then if they had beene each in its proper cell (though never ſo amply) diſcourſed upon apart.</p>
            <p>Here therfore, that the Reader may take a generall view at once of all the Diſergetick Amblygonoſphericall analogiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, ready for Logarithmication, I have thought fit to ſet downe a Liſt of all the eight forenamed <hi>Moods,</hi> together with the Finall Reſolvers, in their ampleſt extent thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the manner as followeth.</p>

            <p>The Arithmeticall complements of Sines are Co-ſecants; of Co-ſines, Secants; of Tangents, Co-tangents; and of Co-tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, Tangents; each being the others complement to the double Radius: but if ſuch a Canon were framed, wherein the ſingle Radius is left out of all Secants, and Tangents of major Arches, then would each be the others complement to the ſingle Radius, and all Logarithmicall operations in queſtions of Trigonometry ſo eaſily performable by addition onely, that ſeldome would the preſectionall digit exceed an unit.</p>
            <p>Having already ſaid ſo much of theſe eight Diſergeticks, I will conclude my diſcourſe of them with a ſummary delineation of the eight ſeverall Concordances which I obſerved amongſt them; for either they reſemble one another in the <hi>Datas</hi> of their <hi>Moods,</hi> or in their <hi>Proturgetick</hi> operations, or in their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the ſame <hi>Axiome,</hi> or in the work of <hi>perpendicular</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in their <hi>Datas</hi> for the main demand, or in their materiall <hi>Quaeſitas</hi> (though diverſly endowed) or in their <hi>inverſion,</hi> or laſtly in their <hi>ſindiforation,</hi> which affinity is onely betwixt two paires of them, as the firſt two amongſt two quaternaries apeece, and the next five between foure couples each one, the brief hypotypoſis of all which is here expoſed to the view of the Reader.</p>

ſo, by divulging this Treatiſe, doe I preſent the Reader with a Key, by meanes whereof he may enter into the chiefeſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the <hi>Mathematicall</hi> Sciences; for the which, in ſome meaſure, I deſerve thanks, although I help him not to unſhut the Coffers wherein they lie incloſed: for, if the Lord chamberlain of the Kings houſhold ſhould give me a Key, made to open all the doores of the Court, I could not but graciouſly accept of it, though he did not goe along with me to try how it might fit every lock. The application is ſo palpable, that, not minding to inſiſt therein, I will here ſtop the current of my Pen, and by a circulary concluſion, ending where I begun, certifie the Reader, that if he intend to approve himſelfe an Artiſt in matters of <hi>Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiotechnie, Poliechyrologie, Coſmography, Geography, Aſtronomy, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſie, Gnomonicks, Sciography, Catoptricks, Dioptricks,</hi> and many other moſt exquiſite Arts and Sciences, Practical and Theoretick, his ſureſt courſe, for attaining to ſo much knowledge, is to be well verſed in <hi>Trigonometry,</hi> to underſtand this Treatife aright, revolve all the paſſages thereof, ruminate on the <hi>Table,</hi> and peruſe the <hi>Triſſotetras.</hi>
