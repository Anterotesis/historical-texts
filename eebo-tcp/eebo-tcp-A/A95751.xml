            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>However the Reader ought not to conceive ami≈ø≈øe for his being detained ≈øo long upon this Eulogi≈øtick ≈øubject, without the variety of any peculiar in≈øtruction be≈øtowed on him; ≈øeeing I am certaine there is nothing more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to him, or that more efficaciou≈øly can tend to his improvement, then the imitation of that admirable Gentleman, who≈øe immortall fame, in ≈øpite of time, will out-la≈øt all ages, and look eternity in the face.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Seeing any given proportion may be found in numbers, and that any two quantities have the ≈øame proportion that the two numbers have, according to the which they are mea≈øured: if for the mea≈øuring of Triangles there mu≈øt be certain proportions of all the parts of a Triangle, to one another known, and tho≈øe proportions explained in numbers it is mo≈øt certain, all Magnitudes, being Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures at lea≈øt in power, and all Figures either Triangles, or Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, that the Arithmeticall Solution of any Geometricall que≈øtion, dependeth on the Doctrine of Triangles.</p>

            <p>THe Angles made by a right Line, falling on another right Line, are equall to two right Angles; becau≈øe every Angle being mea≈øured by an Arch, or part of a Circumference, and a right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle by ninety Degrees, if upon the middle of the ground line, as Center, be de≈øcribed a ≈øemi-Circle, it will be the mea≈øure of the Angles, comprehended betwixt the falling, and ≈øu≈øtaining lines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it is, that the four oppo≈øite Angles made by one line, cro≈ø≈øing another, are always each to its own oppo≈øite equall; for if upon the point of Inter≈øection, as Center, be de≈øcribed a Circle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very two of tho≈øe Angles will fill up the ≈øemi-Circle; therefore the fir≈øt and ≈øecond will be equall to the ≈øecond and third, and con≈øequently the ≈øecond, which is the common Angle to both the≈øe couples being removed, the fir≈øt will remain equall to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123211:10"/>
third, and by the ≈øame rea≈øon, the ≈øecond to the fourth, which was to be demon≈øtrated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If a right line falling upon two other right lines, make the alternat Angles equall, the≈øe lines mu≈øt needs be Paralell; for if they did meet, the alternat Angles would not be equall; becau≈øe in all plain Triangles, the outward Angle is greater, then any of the remote inward Angles, which is proved by the fir≈øt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If one of the ≈øides of a Triangle be produced, the outward Angle is equall to both the inner, and oppo≈øite Angles together; becau≈øe according to the acclining or declining of the conterminall ≈øide, is left an Angulary ≈øpace, for the receiving of a paralell to the oppo≈øite ≈øide, in the point of who≈øe occour≈øe at the ba≈øe, the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Angle is divided into two, which for their like, and alternat ≈øituation with the two Interior Angles, are equall each to its own conform to the nature of Angles, made by a right line cro≈ø≈øing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers paralells.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From hence we gather, that the three Angles of a plain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, are equall to two rights; for the two inward, being equall to the Externall one, and there remaining of the three, but one, which was proved in the fir≈øt <hi>Apodictick,</hi> to be the Externall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles complement to two rights; it mu≈øt needs fall forth (what are equall to a third, being equall among≈øt them≈øelves) that the three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of a plain Triangle, are equall to two right Angles, the which we undertook to prove.</p>
            <p n="6">6. By the ≈øame rea≈øon, the two acute of a Rectangled plain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, are equall to one right Angle, and any one of them, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers complement thereto.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In every Circle, an Angle from the Center, is two in the Limb, both of them having one part of the Circumference for ba≈øe; for being an Externall Angle, and con≈øequently equall to both the Intrin≈øecall Angles, and therefore equall to one another; becau≈øe of their being ≈øubtended by equall ba≈øes, <hi>viz.</hi> the ≈øemi-Diameters, it mu≈øt needs be the double of the fore≈øaid Angle in the limb.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Triangles ≈øtanding between two paralells, upon one and the fame ba≈øe, are equall; for the Identity of the ba≈øe, whereon they are ≈øeated, together with the Equidi≈øtance of the Lines, within the which they are confined, maketh them of ≈øuch a nature, that how long ≈øo ever the line paralell to the ba≈øe be protracted, the Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cutting of in one off the Triangles, as much of bredth, as it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123211:10"/>
gains of length, (the ones lo≈ø≈øe accruing to the profit of the other) Quantifies them both to an equality, the thing we did intend to prove.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Hence do we inferre, that Triangles betwixt two paralells, are in the ≈øame proportion with their ba≈øes.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Therefore if in a Triangle, be drawn a paralell to any of the ≈øides, it divideth the other ≈øides, through which it pa≈ø≈øeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally; for be≈øides that it maketh the four ≈øegments, to be four ba≈øes, it becomes (if two Diagonall lines be extended from the ends thereof, to the ends of its paralell) a common ba≈øe to two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Triangles, to which two, the Triangle of the fir≈øt two ≈øegments, having reference according to the difference of their ba≈øes, and the≈øe two being equall, as it is to the one, ≈øo mu≈øt it be to the other, and therefore the fir≈øt ba≈øe, mu≈øt be to the ≈øecond, (which are the Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of one ≈øide of the Triangle) as the third to the fourth, (which are the Segments of the ≈øecond) all which was to be demon≈øtrated.</p>
            <p n="11">11. From hence do we collect, that Equiangled Triangles have their ≈øides about the equall Angles proportionall to one another. <hi>This ≈øayes</hi> Peti≈øcus, <hi>is the golden Foundation, and chief ground of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonometry.</hi>

            <p n="12">12. An Angle in a ≈øemi-Circle is right; becau≈øe it is equall to both the Angles at the ba≈øe, which (by cutting the Diameter in two) is perceivable to any.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Of four proportionall lines, the Rectangled figure, made of the two extreames, is equall to the Rectangular, compo≈øed of the means; for as four and one, are equall to two and three, by an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall proportion: and the fourth term Geometrically exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or being le≈ø≈øe then the third, as the ≈øecond is more, or le≈ø≈øe then the fir≈øt; what the fourth hath, or wanteth, from and above the third, is ≈øupplyed, or impaired by the Surplu≈øage, or deficiency of the fir≈øt from and above the ≈øecond: The≈øe Analogies being ≈øtill taken in a Geometricall way, make the oblong of the two middle, equall to that of the extreams, which was to be proved.</p>
            <p n="14">14. In all plain Rectangled Triangles, the Ambients are equall in power to the Subtendent; for by demitting from the right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle a Perpendicular, there will ari≈øe two Correctangles, from who≈øe Equiangularity with the great Rectangle, will proceed ≈øuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion among≈øt the Homologall ≈øides, of all the three, that if you ≈øet them right in the rule, beginning your Analogy at the main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent,

(≈øeeing the including ≈øides of the totall Rectangle, prove Subtendents in the partiall Correctangles, and the ba≈øes of tho≈øe Rectanglets, the Segments of the great Subtendent) it will fall out, that as the main Subtendent is to his ba≈øe, on either ≈øide (for either of the legs of a Rectangled Triangle, in reference to one another, is both ba≈øe and Perpendicular) ≈øo the ≈øame ba≈øes, which are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents in the le≈ø≈øer Rectangles, are to their ba≈øes, the Segment, of the prime Subtendent: Then by the Golden rule we find, that the multiplying of the middle termes (which is nothing el≈øe, but the ≈øquaring of the comprehending ≈øides of the prime Rectangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) affords two products, equall to the oblongs made of the great Subtendent, and his re≈øpective Segments, the aggregat whereof by equation is the ≈øame with the ≈øquare of the chief Subtendent, or Hypotenu≈øa, which was to be demon≈øtrated.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Axiomes</hi> of plain Triangles are foure, <hi>viz. Rulerst, Epro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo, Grediftal,</hi> and <hi>Bagrediffus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruler≈øt,</hi> that is to ≈øay, the Subtendent in plain Triangles may be either Radius or Secant, and the Ambients either Radius, Sines, or Tangents; for it is a maxime in Planangular Triangles, that any ≈øide may be put for Radius, grounded on this, that from any point at any di≈øtance a Circle may be de≈øcribed: therefore if any of the ≈øides of a plain Triangle be given together with the Angler, each of the other two ≈øides is given by a threefold proportion, that is, whether you put that, or this, or the third ≈øide for the Radius; which difference occa≈øioneth both in plaine and Sphericall Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles great variety in their calculations.</p>
            <p>The Branches of this Axiom are <hi>Vrade≈ø≈øo</hi> and <hi>Eradetul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vrade≈ø≈øo,</hi> that is when the Hypotenu≈øa is Radius, the ≈øides are Sines of their oppo≈øit Angles; ≈øo that there be two Arches de≈øcribed with that Hypotenu≈øal identity of di≈øtance, who≈øe Centers are in the two extremities of the Subtendent; for ≈øo the ca≈øe will be made plaine in both the Legs, which otherwi≈øe would not appeare but in one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eradetul,</hi> when any of the ≈øides is Radius, the other of them is a Tangent, and the Subtendent a Secant. The rea≈øon of this is found in the very definitions of the Sines, Tangents, and Secants, to the which, if the Reader plea≈øe, he may have recour≈øe; for I have ≈øet them downe among≈øt my Definitions. Hence it is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Speidels</hi> ob≈øervation in his book of Sphericals) that the Sine of any Arch being Radius, that which was the totall Sine becomes the Secant complement of the ≈øaid Arch, and that the Tangent of any Arch being Radius, what was Radius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Tangent complement of that Arch.</p>

about any Triangle a Circle may be circum≈øcribed, in which ca≈øe each ≈øide is a cord or Subten≈øe, the halfe whereof is the Sine of its oppo≈øite Angle, and there being alwayes the ≈øame rea≈øon of the whole to the whole, as of the halfe to the halfe, the ≈øides mu≈øt needs be proportionall to one another, as the Sines of their oppo≈øite Angles, <hi>quod probandum erat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Directory of this ≈øecond Axiome is <hi>Pubkegdaxe≈øh,</hi> which declareth that there are ≈øeven Enodandas grounded on it, to wit, foure Rectangular, <hi>Upalem, Ubeman, Ekarul, Egalem,</hi> and three Obliquangular, <hi>Danarele, Xemenoro,</hi> and <hi>Shenerolem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Axiom is <hi>Grediftal,</hi> that is, in all plain Triangles, As the ≈øumme of the two ≈øides is to their difference, ≈øo is the Tangent of the halfe ≈øum of the oppo≈øite Angles to the Tangent of half their difference; for if a Line be drawne equall to the ≈øumme of the two ≈øides, and if on the point of Exten≈øion with the di≈øtance of the ≈øhorter ≈øide a Semicircle be de≈øcribed, and that from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the protracted Line a Diameter be drawne thorough the Circle where it toucheth the top of the Triangle in que≈øtion, till it occurre with a parallel to the third ≈øide, there will ari≈øe two Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crurall Triangles, one whereof having one Angle common with the Triangle propo≈øed, and the three of the one being equall to the three of the other, any one of the equall Angles in the fore≈øaid <hi>I≈øo≈øceles</hi> mu≈øt needs be the one halfe of the two unknowne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. This is the fir≈øt ≈øtep to the obtaining of what we demand. Then do we find that the third ≈øide cutteth the ≈øides of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Triangle according to the Analogie required, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable enough, if with the di≈øtance of the outmo≈øt Parallel from the lower end thereof as Center, be de≈øcribed a new Circle; for then will the Tangents be per≈øpicuous and ≈øo much the more for their Rectangularity, the one with the Radius, and the other with its Parallel, which, being touched at an Angle de≈øcribed in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle, confirmeth the Rectangularity of both. By the Parallels likewi≈øe is inferred the equality of the alternate Angles, who≈øe addition and ≈øubduction to and from halfe the ≈øum of the two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Angles make up both the greater and le≈ø≈øer Angle. <hi>Hereby it is evident how the ≈øum of the two ≈øides, &amp;c. which was to be proved.</hi>

The fourth <hi>Axiom</hi> is <hi>Bagrediffiu,</hi> that is, As the Ba≈øe or greate≈øt ≈øide is to the ≈øumme of the other ≈øides, ≈øo the difference of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øides to the difference of the Segments of the Ba≈øe; for if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Center of the verticall Angle with the di≈øtance of the ≈øhorte≈øt ≈øide be de≈øcribed a Circle, it will ≈øo cut the two greater ≈øides of the given Triangle, that, finding thereby two Oblongs of the nature of tho≈øe who≈øe equality is demon≈øtrated in my <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicticks,</hi> we may inferre (the Oblong made of the ≈øumme of the ≈øides, and difference of the ≈øides being equall to the Oblong made of the Ba≈øe, and the difference of its Segments) that their ≈øides are reciprocally proportionall; that is, As the greate≈øt ≈øide is to the ≈øum of the other ≈øides: ≈øo the difference of the other ≈øides, to the difference of the Segments of the Ba≈øe, or greater ≈øide.</p>

Let the Reader then be plea≈øed to con≈øider, that the generall Maxim for the <hi>Cathetothe≈øis</hi> of this <hi>Mood</hi> is <hi>Cafregpiq,</hi> the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof is, that, whether the ≈øide whereon the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is demitted be increa≈øed or not, that is to ≈øay, whether the Perpendicular fall outwardly, or inwardly, it mu≈øt fall from the extremity of the <hi>given ≈øide,</hi> and oppo≈øite to the <hi>Angle required:</hi> however it is to be remarked, that in this <hi>Mood,</hi> whatever be the affection of the Angles (unle≈ø≈øe they be all three alike) the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular may fall out wardly.</p>
            <p>The generall maxim for the <hi>Cathetothe≈øis</hi> of this <hi>Mood,</hi> as well as for that of all the re≈øt, is divided into foure <hi>Tenets,</hi> according to the number of the <hi>Ca≈øes</hi> of every <hi>Mood.</hi>

            <p>Here mu≈øt I admoni≈øh the Reader, that he ≈øtartle not at the mentioning of foure e≈øpeciall <hi>Cathetothetick Tenets,</hi> and foure ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Ca≈øes</hi> belonging to each <hi>Di≈øergetick Mood,</hi> ≈øeeing, to the mo≈øt ob≈øervant eye, there be but three of either perceptible in my <hi>Tri≈ø≈øotetr as;</hi> for, the fourth both <hi>Tenet</hi> and <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> being the ≈øame by way of expre≈ø≈øion in all the <hi>Moods,</hi> and being fully re≈øolved by the third <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> of every <hi>Mood,</hi> it ≈øhall ≈øuffice to ≈øpeak thereof here once for all: The <hi>Tenet</hi> of this common <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> is <hi>Simomatin,</hi> that is to ≈øay, when all the three Angles in any of tho≈øe <hi>Di≈øerge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> are of the ≈øame affection, either all <hi>acute,</hi> or all <hi>oblique,</hi> the Perpendicular falleth inwardly, whether the double verticall be an Angle given, an Angle demanded, or neither. Yet here it is to be con≈øidered, that ≈øeeing Triangles may be either calculated by their reall and naturall, or by their circular parts, or by both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that for the more facility we oftentimes, in≈øtead of the propo≈øed Triangle, re≈øolve its oppo≈øite; it is not the reall and given Triangle, that in this ca≈øe we ≈øo much take notice of, as of its re≈øolvable, and equivalent, the oppo≈øite Triangle: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, If a Sphericall Triangle, with two obtu≈øe Angles, and one acute, be given you to re≈øolve, it will fall within the compa≈ø≈øe of <hi>Simomatin;</hi> becau≈øe its oppo≈øite Sphericall is ≈øimply acute an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled: and al≈øo if you be de≈øired to calculate a Sphericall Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with two acute Angles, and one obtu≈øe, it will likewi≈øe fall within the reach of the ≈øame <hi>Ca≈øe;</hi> becau≈øe its oppo≈øite Sphericall is ≈øimply obtu≈øangled. The rea≈øon of both the premi≈ø≈øes is from the equality of the <hi>oppo≈øite Angles</hi> of concurring <hi>Quadrants,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:123211:31"/>
which that they are equall, no man needs to doubt, that will take the paines to let fall a Perpendicular from the middle of the one <hi>Quadrant</hi> upon the other; for ≈øo there will be two Triangles made equilaterall: and ≈øeeing it is an univer≈øally received truth, that <hi>equall ≈øides ≈øu≈øtaine equall Angles,</hi> the identitie of the Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular in both the fore≈øaid Triangles, mu≈øt needs manife≈øt the equality of the two oppo≈øite Angles.</p>
            <p>I have beene the ampler in the elucidating of this <hi>Ca≈øe,</hi> that, it over-running all the <hi>Moods</hi> of the Di≈øergetick Loxogono≈øphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricals, the Reader, in what <hi>Mood</hi> or <hi>Datoquare</hi> ≈øoever he plea≈øe to re≈øolve this fore≈øaid <hi>Ca≈øe,</hi> may for that purpo≈øe to this place have recour≈øe; to the which, without any further intended reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this Tenet, I doe heartily remit him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The nature of the Perpendiculars demi≈ø≈øion in all the <hi>Ca≈øes</hi> of this <hi>Mood</hi> being thus to the full explained, we may without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment proceed to the performance of all the Orthogono≈øphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall operations, each in its owne order thereto belonging.</p>

To begin therefore at the fir≈øt, who≈øe <hi>qua≈øitum</hi> (as I have told you already) is a <hi>verticall Angle,</hi> we mu≈øt know, ≈øeeing the work is Orthogono≈øpherically to be performed, that the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>praeno≈øcendum</hi> cannot be obtained without the help of one of the ≈øixteen <hi>Datoquaeres;</hi> and therefore in my <hi>Tri≈ø≈øotetras</hi> (con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the nature of what is given, and asked in the <hi>Ca≈øes</hi> of this <hi>Mood)</hi> I have appointed <hi>Upalam</hi> to be the ≈øub≈øervient of its <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øcendum;</hi> for, by the <hi>Re≈øolver</hi> thereof, <hi>To‚ÄîTag‚ÄîNu‚òû Mir,</hi> (the ≈øubtendent and an Angle being given; for one of the given ≈øides of every Loxogono≈øphericall, if the Perpendicular be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demitted, becomes a ≈øubtendent, and ≈øometimes two given ≈øides are ≈øubtendents both) we frame the≈øe three peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, for the three <hi>praeno≈øcendas;</hi> to wit, <hi>Utopat,</hi> for the <hi>double ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</hi> by the meanes of the great <hi>Subtendent</hi> ≈øide, and the <hi>prime oppo≈øite Angle:</hi> ≈øecondly, <hi>Udobaud,</hi> for obtaining of the <hi>fir≈øt verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> in the little rectangle, by vertue of the <hi>le≈ø≈øer ≈øubtendent</hi> in the ≈øame rectangle, and the <hi>next oppo≈øite Angle:</hi> la≈øtly, <hi>Uthophauth,</hi> for the <hi>first Co-verticall,</hi> by meanes of the <hi>fir≈øt Co-≈øubtendent,</hi> and <hi>fir≈øt cooppo≈øite Angle:</hi> all which is at large ≈øet downe in the fir≈øt <hi>partition</hi> of <hi>Alamebna</hi> in my Table.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt and chiefe operation being thus perfected, the verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Angles ≈øo found out mu≈øt concurre with each its corre≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent oppo≈øite for the obtaining of the Perpendicular, nece≈ø≈øary for the accompli≈øhment of the ≈øecond operation in every one of the <hi>Ca≈øes</hi> of the fore≈øaid <hi>Mood;</hi> to which effect <hi>Amaner</hi> is made the <hi>Sub≈øervient,</hi> by who≈øe Re≈øolver <hi>Say‚ÄîNag‚ÄîTw‚òû Nyr,</hi> the≈øe three Datoquaeres, <hi>Opatca, Obautca,</hi> and <hi>Ophauthca</hi> come to light, and is manife≈øtly ≈øhown how, by any paire of three ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall couples of different Angles, the Perpendicular is acquirable.</p>
            <p>Now, though of this work (as it is a ≈øingle one) no more then of the other ≈øucceeding it in the ≈øame Mood, nor of the la≈øt two in any of the <hi>Di≈øergeticks</hi> in their full Analogy, I doe not make any mention at all in my <hi>Table;</hi> but, after the couching of the fir≈øt operation for the Praeno≈øcendas, ≈øupply the roomes of the other two, with an equivalent row of proportionals out of them ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, for attaining to the knowledge of the maine <hi>quae≈øitum:</hi> yet in this <hi>Comment</hi> upon that <hi>Table,</hi> for the more per≈øpicuities ≈øake, and that the Reader may as well know, what way the rule

            </p>
            <p>And therefore, according to that pre≈øcribed method, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this <hi>Mood,</hi> the perpendicular by the ≈øecond operation being already obtained, it is requi≈øite for the promoving of a third work, that the ≈øaid Perpendicular be made to joyne with <hi>the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verticaline, the double verticall, and ≈øecond co-verticall</hi> conforme to the quality of the three Ca≈øes, thereby to obtaine the Angles <hi>at the Ba≈øe,</hi> for the which all the≈øe operations have beene ≈øet on foot; to wit, <hi>the next cathetoppo≈øite,</hi> (who≈øe complement to a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle is alwayes the Angle required) <hi>the prime cathetoppo≈øite,</hi> and <hi>the ≈øecond Cocathetoppo≈øite:</hi> for the pro≈øecuting of this la≈øt work, <hi>Edoman</hi> is the ≈øub≈øervient, by who≈øe Re≈øolver, <hi>To‚ÄîNeg‚ÄîSa‚òûNir,</hi> we are in≈øtructed how to regulate the Problemets of <hi>Catheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dob, Cathatop,</hi> and <hi>Catheuthops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the≈øe two la≈øt operations being thus made patent in their ≈øeverall ≈øtructures, it is not ami≈ø≈øe that we ponder how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitely they may be conflated into one, to the end, that the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the finall Re≈øolvers of the Di≈øergeticks in my <hi>Tri≈ø≈øote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras</hi> (which are all and each of them compo≈øed of the ingredient termes of two different works) may be the more evidently knowne, and obvious to the reach of any ordinary capacity, for the performance hereof, the Re≈øolvers of the≈øe two operations are to be laid before us, <hi>Say‚ÄîNag‚ÄîTa‚òûNyr,</hi> and <hi>To‚ÄîNeg‚ÄîSa‚òûNir:</hi> and, ≈øeeing out of both the≈øe orders of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals, there mu≈øt re≈øult but one, it is to be con≈øidered, which be the foure <hi>ejectitious</hi> termes, and which tho≈øe foure we ≈øhould <hi>re≈øerve</hi> for the Analogy required; all which, that it may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under≈øtood by the indu≈øtrious Reader, I will interpret the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolvers ≈øo farre forth as is requi≈øite: and therefore <hi>Say‚ÄîNag‚ÄîTo‚òûNyr,</hi> being, <hi>As the Sine of one of the Angles at the Ba≈øe, or Cathetoppo≈øite, is to the Sine complement of a verticall: ≈øo the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius to the Sine complement of the Perpendicular:</hi> And the other, <hi>To‚ÄîNeg‚ÄîSa‚òûNir,</hi> being, <hi>As the Radius, to the Sine complement of the Perpendicular: ≈øo the Sine of a verticall, to the Sine complement of a Cathetoppo≈øite or Angle at the Ba≈øe;</hi> it is perceivable enough
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:123211:32"/>
how both the <hi>Radius,</hi> and the <hi>Perpendicular</hi> are in both the rows: nor can it well e≈øcape the knowledge of one never ≈øo little ver≈øed in the elements of Arithmetick, that the Perpendiculars being the fourth terme in the fir≈øt order of proportionals, is nothing el≈øe but that it is the quotient of the product of the middle termes, divided by the fir≈øt, or <hi>Logarithmically</hi> the remainder of the fir≈øt termes ab≈øtraction from the ≈øumme of the middle two; ≈øo that the whole power thereof is inclo≈øed in the≈øe three termes, whereby it is mo≈øt evident, that with what terme ≈øoever the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid Perpendicular be employed to concurre in operation, the ≈øame effect will be produced by the concurrence of its ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents with the ≈øaid terme, and therefore in the ≈øecond row of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionals, where it is made u≈øe of for a fellow multiplyer with the third terme to produce a <hi>factus,</hi> which divided may <hi>quote</hi> the maine <hi>quae≈øitum,</hi> or <hi>Logarithmically</hi> to joyne with the third terme, for the ≈øumming of an Aggregat from which the fir≈øt terme being ab≈øtracted, may re≈øiduat the terme demanded, it is all one, whether the work be performed by it ≈øelfe, or by its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent, <hi>viz.</hi> the three fir≈øt termes of the fir≈øt order of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals, in who≈øe potentia it is: whereupon the fourth terme in the ≈øecond row being that, for the obtaining whereof, both the Analogies are made, we need not wa≈øte any labour about the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Perpendicular (though a ≈øub≈øervient to the chiefe quae≈øitum) but leaving roome for it in both the rows, that the equipollencie of its conflaters may the better appeare, go on in work without it, and, by the meanes of its con≈øtructive parts, with as much certainty effectuat the ≈øame de≈øigne.</p>
            <p>Thus may you ≈øee then how the eight termes of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Re≈øolvers, are reduced unto ≈øix; but there remaining yet two more to be ejected, that both the orders may be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a compound row of foure proportionals: let us con≈øider the <hi>Radius,</hi> which, being in both the rows as I have once told you already, may peradventure, without any prejudice to the work, be ≈øpared out of both. Thus much thereof to any is perceiveable, that in the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Re≈øolver, it is the <hi>third</hi> proportionall; and in the <hi>≈øecond,</hi> the <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> and con≈øequently a <hi>multiplyer</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> and in the <hi>other</hi> a <hi>divider:</hi> or <hi>Logarithmically</hi> in the <hi>≈øecond</hi> a <hi>≈øubtractor,</hi> and in the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> an <hi>adder:</hi> now it being well known that <hi>divi≈øion</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws

ami≈ø≈øe in this place to give a further illu≈øtration thereof, and make the Reader, by an Arithmeticall demon≈øtration, feele (as it were) how palpable the truth is of compacting eight proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals into foure; let there be then the≈øe two orders of numbers, 4‚Äî6‚Äî8‚òû12. and 8‚Äî12.‚Äî14‚òû21.

            <p>The fir≈øt work being thus expedited, we are to find out the Perpendicular by the ≈øecond, but ≈øo as that my direction to the Reader for the performance thereof ≈øhall detaine me no longer here, then the time I am willing to be≈øtow, in telling him, that the whole progre≈ø≈øe of this operation, as well as of the preceding,

is amply expre≈ø≈øed in my comment on the la≈øt <hi>Mood,</hi> from which, what ere is written of the Sub≈øervient, <hi>Ethaner,</hi> its Re≈øolver, <hi>To‚ÄîTag‚ÄîSe‚òûTyr,</hi> or the under-problems, <hi>Aetopca, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobca,</hi> and <hi>Aethophca,</hi> thereby re≈øolved, may conveniently be tran≈øplaced hither, and re≈øeated there againe, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to either; <hi>Ammanepreb</hi> being the onely <hi>Mood,</hi> which with this of <hi>Enerablo</hi> hath a ba≈øal and oppo≈øite <hi>catheteuretick</hi> identity.</p>

The eighth and la≈øt generall Re≈øolver is, <hi>Nu‚ÄîNe‚ÄîNu‚òûNyr,</hi> which (running altogether upon Co-≈øines of Subtendents, and Ba≈øes, both fir≈øt, and ≈øecond of either, and is nothing el≈øe but the ≈øixth inverted) ≈øheweth, that the ≈øumme of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øines of a ≈øecond ≈øubtendent, and fir≈øt Ba≈øe, with the Arithmeticall complement of the co-≈øine of a fir≈øt Subtendent, (ob≈øerving the u≈øuall pre≈øection) affords the Co-≈øine of the ≈øecond Ba≈øe, illati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to the ≈øegment required; which <hi>Ba≈øes</hi> and <hi>Subtendents,</hi> both <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> and <hi>≈øecond,</hi> are peculiarly denominated according to the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Ca≈øes</hi> of this <hi>Sindiforiuting Mood.</hi>

            <p>Thus have I fini≈øhed the <hi>Logarithmication</hi> of the generall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolvers of the Loxogono≈øphericall Di≈øergeticks, ≈øo farre as is requi≈øite, wherein I often times mentioned the Arithmeticall complement of Sines, Co-≈øines, Tangents, and Co-tangents: and though I ≈øpoke of that purpo≈øe ≈øufficiently in my Spherico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectangular comments, yet, for the Readers better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof, I will once more define them here.</p>
            <p>The Arithmeticall complements of Sines are Co-≈øecants; of Co-≈øines, Secants; of Tangents, Co-tangents; and of Co-tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, Tangents; each being the others complement to the double Radius: but if ≈øuch a Canon were framed, wherein the ≈øingle Radius is left out of all Secants, and Tangents of major Arches, then would each be the others complement to the ≈øingle Radius, and all Logarithmicall operations in que≈øtions of Trigonometry ≈øo ea≈øily performable by addition onely, that ≈øeldome would the pre≈øectionall digit exceed an unit.</p>
            <p>Having already ≈øaid ≈øo much of the≈øe eight Di≈øergeticks, I will conclude my di≈øcour≈øe of them with a ≈øummary delineation of the eight ≈øeverall Concordances which I ob≈øerved among≈øt them; for either they re≈øemble one another in the <hi>Datas</hi> of their <hi>Moods,</hi> or in their <hi>Proturgetick</hi> operations, or in their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the ≈øame <hi>Axiome,</hi> or in the work of <hi>perpendicular</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in their <hi>Datas</hi> for the main demand, or in their materiall <hi>Quae≈øitas</hi> (though diver≈øly endowed) or in their <hi>inver≈øion,</hi> or la≈øtly in their <hi>≈øindiforation,</hi> which affinity is onely betwixt two paires of them, as the fir≈øt two among≈øt two quaternaries apeece, and the next five between foure couples each one, the brief hypotypo≈øis of all which is here expo≈øed to the view of the Reader.</p>
