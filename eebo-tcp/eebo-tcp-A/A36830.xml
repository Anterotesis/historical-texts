            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Hiſtory of <hi>William Sommers.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>WIlliam Sommers</hi> of Nottingham, ſonne in law to <hi>Robert Cowper</hi> of the ſaid towne, and by trade of life a Muſician, about 8. or 9. yeares paſt, as he journeyed from Bellyn in the County of Wigorne, (where hee then dwelt with one M. <hi>Anthony Brackenbery)</hi> to Bramſgrove, a market towne in that ſhire, accompanyed with an old woman dwelling in the ſaid Bellyn, found an hat with a copper band: the woman requiring the ſame, he gave her the hat, though unwillingly, but the band he utterly refuſed to give, ſuppoſing it to bee of gold: whereupon ſhe threatning him, ſaid, That it had beene as good for him to have given it her. After this, in the night he ſaw a ſtrange light in the chamber where he lay, which caſt him into a great feare, and thus hee continued frighted for a time. Shortly after M. <hi>Brackenbery</hi> his maſter removed to Holme, neare to Newark upon Trent, in the County of Nottingham, being there ſent about his maſters buſineſſe unto Newark, in the way as he went thither, he was ſuddenly throwne into a ditch, ſome 8. yards diſtant from the high way wherein he went; after he had lyen there a certaine time, he got up and went forward in his journey, but by that he had gone a very little way further, he was taken again and caſt into a thorne buſh about 60. yards diſtant from the high way: but how he came into it or the ditch hee knew not. In theſe two places hee lay for the ſpace of ſome 4. houres, as he perceived after by the time of the day. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this let, to Newark he went, when in his returne he drew near Holme he began to be ſicke: from ſickneſſe he came to carry himſelfe after that ſtrange manner by fits, that his maſter ſuppoſed him to play the counterfeit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he whipped him. But notwithſtanding all the whipping was uſed (which he felt not at all) he continued after that ſame manner, and was more ſtrangely handled every day then other; at length it well appeared to be ſome ſtrange vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation and hand of God, whereupon his maſter procured one in the Miniſtery to come to him, he being for the ſpace of 3. weekes or thereabouts a continuall trouble, and his maſter not knowing by what means to procure his amendment, ſent him accompanied with 3. perſons to Nottingham to his mother, being then a widow: whilſt he was at Holme he heard ſomething ſay unto him, that upon ſuch a day he would leave him, and not come to him (ſo far as I remember hee ſaid) untill the end of 6. yeares. Now after hee had beene 5. weekes at Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham afflicted after his accuſtomed and ſtrange manner, and that the ſaid appointed day was come, he indeed amended in the judgement of man, and ſo continued: inſo much that ſhortly after he was bound prentice to one <hi>Thomas Porter</hi> of Nottingham, a Weaver and Muſician; who after gave over his trade of weaving, and betooke himſelfe wholly to the other, from whom the ſaid <hi>William Sommers</hi> did twice run away.</p>
            <p>His foreſaid maſter <hi>Thomas Porter</hi> ſent him to Walton in Darbiſhire, the now dwelling houſe of Sir <hi>William Bowes,</hi> to a ſiſter of his wifes there named <hi>Mary</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94797:3"/>
               <hi>Milwood.</hi> In his going thither there met him in Blackwell Moore at a deepe coale-pit hard by the high way ſide, an old woman (as he thought) who asked him where he dwelt, and whither he was going, without any more words. About a mile and halfe further (he having gone forward a journying pace without ſtay) ſhe met him againe, and paſſed by him without any words. The next day hee returning from Walton homewards, ſhe met him at the aforeſaid pit, and asked him how he did? ſaying further, I muſt have a penny from thee. He anſwered, that he had no money. Thou haſt (quoth ſhe) <hi>Mary Milwood</hi> gave thee 2. pence, I will have a penny of it or I will throw thee into this pit, and break thy necke. Hereupon for feare, ſhe giving him 2. pence, he gave her 3. pence which indeed had bin given him by the ſaid <hi>Mary.</hi> After this ſhe put her hand to a bag ſhe had about her, and taking thence a peece of bread with butter ſpred on it, bad him eate it. He refuſing, ſhee threatned him againe to throw him into the pit and breake his necke if he would not eate it. Whereupon (greatly againſt his will, and for feare) he did eat it, and in the eating it ſeemed as ſweet as any honey. She ſaid moreover unto him, Doſt thou not know <hi>Katherine Wright?</hi> No, qooth he. She is my neighbour (ſaid ſhe) and ſhe and I will come to Nottingham one of theſe dayes, and ſee how thou doeſt. Then a cat (as the boy thought) leapt up into her boſome, the which ſhe imbraced, and with her armes claſpt it unto her, and thus they parted each from other.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Sommers</hi> (being at Nottingham in the houſe of his maſter <hi>Thomas Porter)</hi> did uſe ſuch ſtrange and idle kinde of geſtures, in laughing, dauncing, and ſuch like light behaviour, that he was ſuſpected to be mad: ſundry times he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all kinde of meat for a long ſpace together, in ſo much as hee did ſeeme thereby to pine away: ſometimes he ſhaked as if hee had had an ague: there was heard a ſtrange noiſe or flapping from within his body: he was often ſeen to gather himſelfe on a round heape under his bed clothes, and being ſo gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bounce up a good height from the bed: alſo to beat his head and other parts of his body againſt the ground and bedſtead, in ſuch earneſt manner, and ſo violently, that the beholders did feare that thereby he would have ſpoyled himſelfe, if they had not by ſtrong hand reſtrained him, and yet thereby received he no hurt at all. In moſt of his fits he did ſwell in his body, and in ſome of them did ſo greatly exceed therein, as hee ſeemed to be twice ſo big as his naturall body. Oft alſo was he ſeene to have a certaine variable ſwelling or lump to a great bigneſſe, ſwiftly running up and downe betweene the fleſh and skinne, through all the parts of his body: and many times when that ſwelling was, theſe or the like words were heard out of his mouth, I will goe out at his eyes, or eares, or toes: at which ſpeeches the ſaid ſwelling evidently appearing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſuch parts, did immediately remove and vaniſh away. This ſwelling did not onely run from eye to eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from cheeke to cheeke, and up and downe along ſtill in the body, but beſides being now in the one leg, preſently it would be in the other, and ſo of the armes in like manner: and looke in which arme or leg it ſtayed (as often it did for a certaine ſpace) the ſame member was inflexible and
<pb facs="tcp:94797:3"/>
exceedingly heavy, as it had beene ſo much iron. Thus it went with him, though not in all, yet in many of his fits, wherein over and beſides theſe things, he was ſtrangely handled, for ſuddenly (if he were ſtanding when the fit came) he would be caſt headlong upon the ground, or fall downe, drawing then his lips awry, gnaſhing with his teeth, wallowing and foaming. In ſundry of his fits he did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo ſtrange and fearfull ſchrieking as cannot bee uttered by mans power, and was of ſuch ſtrength as ſometimes 4. or 5 men, though they had much advantage againſt him by binding of him to a chaire, yet could they not rule him: and in ſhewing that ſtrength he was not perceived to pant or blow, no more then if he had not ſtrained nor ſtrugled at all. Sometimes he cryed extreamly, ſo as teares came from him in great abundance: preſently after he would laugh aloud and ſhrill, his mouth being ſhut cloſe. And being demanded concerning thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, he proteſted he knew of no ſuch matter, neither felt he any paine. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he was oftentimes caſt into the fire, ſome bare part of his body alſo lying in the fire, and yet was not burned; and ſometimes caſt violently againſt the ground, and againſt the wall or poſts of the houſe, without any hurt of his body, and did many wayes ſeeke to deſtroy himſelfe; by reaſon whereof they were driven to take away his knife, girdle, garters, &amp;c. yea with the ſheet of his bed hee had like to have ſtrangled himſelfe. Whereupon, as alſo through the increaſing of his fits, they were conſtrained to watch him continually, even day and night. His beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour generally towards all that came, was very pleaſant, moſt impudent alſo and ſhameleſſe, with much uncleanneſſe. His ſpeeches were uſually vaine, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in very ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffing manner and many times filthy and uncleane, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit once to be named, or blaſphemous, ſwearing moſt fearfully, uſing one bloody oath after another: ſometimes ſaying, I am God, and ſometimes, There is no GOD.</p>
            <p>Being moved to ſay the Lords Prayer, when he came to theſe words, Lead us not into temptation, hee would ſay, Lead us into temptation: Divers fond ſpeeches did he uſe to interrupt them that prayed for him. Many ſtrange ſpeeches alſo were uttered by him, not in his owne name, but as ſpoken by an evill ſpirit poſſeſſing him: upon occaſion of ſome queſtion or ſpeech uſed by ſome in their ſimplicity and ignorance: as, That his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had ſent him, that his name was <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ye,</hi> that he was King, that he was Prince of darkneſſe. You thinke I have no power of him, yet I can uſe his tongue, his teeth, lippes, hands, legges, his body and all parts of him. And as the ſpirit named each part, hee uſed it. And this ſpeech with the action was very common: Was I (ſaid he to one <hi>John Wiggin)</hi> never in heaven? Yea, quoth he, but God for thy pride threw thee downe into hell, there to remaine. One <hi>John Sherwood</hi> charging him to tell who ſent him thither, he anſwered, a woman. He charged him againe to tell where ſhe dwelt: he anſwered, in Worceſterſhire. Whether is ſhe living or dead? Dead ſaid hee. Wherefore did ſhe ſend thee? For a hat and hatband. Then the boy, when the fit was done, was queſtioned with concerning theſe things: where unto he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for anſwer, that which is ſet downe in the beginning of this ſtory, which he
<pb facs="tcp:94797:4"/>
had concealed untill that time. Hereunto I might adde certaine direct anſwers he made in Latine to thoſe ſpeeches which in Latine were uſed unto him: a little Greek he alſo ſpake, being ignorant in thoſe languages, altogether in the one, and underſtanding little or nothing in the other.</p>
            <p>In going thus with the boy, I was importuned in his behalfe, firſt by two letters, after by another from the Maior, and thereupon I went unto him. At when &amp; about the time I condeſcended to goe, (being 14. miles off him) hee ſpake thereof to them which were about him: So when I was come to Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, hee inſtantly told the ſame, and foretold my comming unto him when I drew neere the houſe, as he had alſo foretold M. <hi>Aldridge</hi> (the Preacher of the Towne) his comming at ſundry times.</p>
            <p>Towards that evening I came, he ſeemed to be ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke, and his ſickneſſe greatly to increaſe upon him, ſo as they feared he would have dyed, or had been dead: for he lay an houre with his face and hands blacke, cold as ice, no breath being perceived to come from him. Whereupon I was no ſooner light, but tidings here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was brought to me by one of the neighbour women <hi>Ioane Pye</hi> by name, who came purpoſely from him to ſignifie the ſame unto me. To whom I anſwered, that was the meere act or operation of the Divell, and that the boy was nothing leſſe then either dead, or in danger thereof. Forthwith with her I went to him, whom we found very lively, and in one of his accuſtomed Fits, many being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him.</p>
            <p>My ſpeech I carried for a ſeaſon doubtfully; but after a while perceiving how it was with him, I did aſſure him that he was poſſeſſed, and had in that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his a Divell, and withall did ſo frame the words of my mouth, as might beſt ſerve to prepare and ſtir him up to a ſpirituall fight againſt Satan, or reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of him in faith. This evening he acted many ſins by ſignes and geſtures, moſt lively repreſenting and ſhadowing them out unto us: as namely, brawling, quarrelling, fighting, ſwearing, robbing by the high wayes, picking and cutting of purſes, burglary, whoredome, pride both in men and women, hypocriſie, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe in hearing the Word, drunkenneſſe, gluttony, alſo dancing with the toyes thereto belonging, the manner of anticke dances, the games of dicing and carding, the abuſe of the viole, with other inſtruments. At the end of ſundry of theſe he laughed exceedingly, divers times clapping his hands on his thighes for joy: And at the end of ſome of them, as killing and ſtealing, he ſhewed how he brought them to the gallowes, making a ſigne thereof. During this time, which continued about an houre, as hee was altogether ſilent, ſo was hee moſt active, though his eyes were cloſed; and in many things he did, there was great and neceſſary uſe of ſight. In a word, theſe things were in ſuch lively and orient colours painted out (as I may ſay) unto us that were preſent, being to the number of ſome ſixty, that I for my owne part, (and I am perſwaded the reſt of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders are of my minde) doe verily thinke, that it is not in the skill and power of man to doe the like. Whilſt we were recommending him and his grievous eſtate to the Lord, and intreating his Majeſty in his behalfe, hee uttered theſe words: I muſt be gone.</p>

The next day being the Lords day, I came not at him untill about 3 a clocke in the afternoon, (finding company with him) at which time I uſed ſome ſpeech, wherein I endevoured to prepare both him and his maſters family, as alſo his parents (whom that judgement principally concerneth) unto the holy exerciſe the day after to be performed. Towards evening much people reſorted to the houſe, then ſome words of exhortation were uſed by my ſelfe, for the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo many of us, whoſe ſpirits God ſhould ſtirre up, to joyn in that ſolemne ſervice and worſhip of God to be performed on the day following. As the night and day before he had little or no reſt from Satan afflicting him: ſo this eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and all the night long, he handled him more extreamly then before. At this time among other things the ſpirit retorted his tongue into his throat, and this he did often, whereupon many looked with a candle into his mouth, where they could ſee no tongue nor part of it, onely in his throat they beheld the root thereof, hee uttered often theſe words, For corne, for corne, with a few more thereunto appertaining, noting the unſatiable deſire of gaine, or raiſing the price of corne in corne men. This night was ſpent by ſome well diſpoſed people, in reading and praying. This evening I requeſted the Miniſter of that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, M. <hi>Aldridge,</hi> M. <hi>Aldred,</hi> and M. <hi>Halam,</hi> Paſtors of two ſeverall townes neere acjoyning unto Nottingham, to joyne with me on the morrow in the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word and Prayer: whereunto they condeſcended. And this I did the rather, that thereby I might proclaime and make knowne unto all men, that as I have no ſpeciall or greater gift herein then the reſt of my brethren: ſo neither doe I arrogate or challenge any ſuch thing to my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>In the morning many of us were aſſembled together in the next convenient and ſeemly roome to the place of his abode. The boy was brought with ſtrange and fearfull ſcrikings, by ſix or ſeaven ſtrong men, who had all of them enough adoe to bring him, and laid him on a couch in the midſt of us. M. <hi>Aldridge</hi> began, and after prayer proceeded to the interpretation of the 4. of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> the two firſt verſes. When he had finiſhed, my ſelfe intreated of that ſtory ſet downe in the 9 of Mark, from verſe 14. untill the 30. where the father bringing his poſſeſſed childe to Chriſt to be cured, had him healed accordingly. All this day he was continually vexed and tormented by Satan, having little no reſt at all, ſo as the ſame for vexation by the ſpirit, farre exceeded any of the dayes before. His torments in his fits were moſt grievous and fearfull to behold, wherein his body being ſwelled, was toſſed up and downe. In theſe fits his ſtrength was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, ſo as being held downe with five ſtrong men, hee did notwithſtanding all their ſtrength, againſt their wills, riſe and ſtand upright on his feet. Hee was alſo continually torne in very fearfull manner, and disfigured in his face; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſometimes his lips were drawne awry, now to the one ſide, now to the other. Sometimes his face and necke diſtorted to the right and to the left hand, yea ſometimes writhen to his backe. Sometimes he thruſt out his tongue very farre and bigge, and ſometimes turned backwards into his throat, gaping ſo wide that we might afarre off perceive it. Now he gnaſhed, with his teeth, now he fomed

like to the Horſe or Boare, roaping downe to his breaſt, notwithſtanding there was one purpoſely ſtanding by with a cloath ever and anon to wipe it away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not to ſay any thing of his fearfull ſtaring with his eyes, and incredible gaping.</p>
            <p>This day, notwithſtanding he was ſo held, as is aforeſaid, hee went about to have choked and ſo deſtroyed himſelfe: ſpeeches he uſed none, ſave once in a great voyce, <hi>Corne.</hi> And when I applied that ſpeech of our Saviour, All things are poſſible to him that beleeveth; hee uſed theſe words, Thou lieſt. Divers times he ſcriked or cried aloud in a ſtrange and ſupernaturall manner: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he roared fearfully like a Beare, and cried like a ſwine.</p>
            <p>Towards the evening, as I was treating of theſe words, Then the ſpirit cryed and rent him ſore, and came out, and he was as one dead, inſomuch that many ſaid he is dead. The boy was rent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſore indeed, cryed, and that aloud. Then the people which were preſent, as men aſtoniſhed, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
