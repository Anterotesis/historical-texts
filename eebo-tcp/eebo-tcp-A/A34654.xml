            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Which hanging, pent-house-like, does overlook</l>
               <l>The dreadful Channel of the rapid Brook,</l>
               <l>So deep, and black, the very thought does make</l>
               <l>My brains turn giddy, and my eye-balls ake.</l>
               <l>Over this dangerous <hi>Precipice</hi> you crawl,</l>
               <l>Lost if you slip, for if you slip you fall;</l>
               <l>But whither, faith 'tis no great matter, when</l>
               <l>Y'are sure ne'er to be seen alive agen.</l>
               <l>Propt round with <hi>Peasants,</hi> on you trembling go,</l>
               <l>Whilst, every step you take, your <hi>Guides</hi> do show</l>
               <l>In the uneven Rock the uncouth shapes</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Men,</hi> of <hi>Lions, Horses, Dogs,</hi> and <hi>Apes:</hi>

But so resembling each the fancied shape,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Man</hi> might be the <hi>Horse,</hi> the <hi>Dog</hi> the <hi>Ape.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And straight just in your way a<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Fonts.</hi>
                  </note> stone appears,</l>
               <l>Which the resemblance of a <hi>Hay-cock</hi> bears,</l>
               <l>Some four foot high, and beyond that a less</l>
               <l>Of the same Figure; which do still increase</l>
               <l>In height, and bulk, by a continual drop,</l>
               <l>Which upon each distilling from the top,</l>
               <l>And falling still exactly on the Crown,</l>
               <l>There break themselves to mists, which trickling
down,</l>
               <l>Crust into stone, and (but with leasure) swell</l>
               <l>The sides, and still advance the Miracle.</l>
               <l>So that in time, they would be tall enough,</l>
               <l>If there were need, to prop the hanging Roof,</l>

Break off much more at one injurious blow,</l>
               <l>Than can again in many <hi>Ages</hi> grow.</l>
               <l>These the Wise <hi>Natives</hi> call the <hi>Fonts;</hi> but there</l>
               <l>Descending from the Roof there does appear</l>
               <l>A bright transparent<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Bacon-Flitch.</hi>
                  </note> Cloud, which from above,</l>
               <l>By those false lights, does downwards seem to
move,</l>
               <l>Like a <hi>Machine,</hi> which, when some <hi>God</hi> appears,</l>
               <l>We see descend upon our <hi>Theaters.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Unlike in figure, and in posture, this</l>
               <l>With the two nam'd before, owes its increase</l>
               <l>To the same cause the others grow up by,</l>
               <l>Namely, the petrifying quality</l>
               <l>Of those bright drops, which trickling one by one,</l>
               <l>Deliberately crust, as they glide, to stone;</l>
               <l>By which the <hi>Stiria</hi> longer, bigger grows,</l>

To see these thriving by these various ways,</l>
               <l>It seems, methinks, as if the first did raise</l>
               <l>Their heads the pond'rous <hi>Vault</hi> so to sustain,</l>
               <l>Whilst th'other pendant Pillar seems to strein,</l>
               <l>And, at full stretch, endeavour to extend</l>
               <l>A stable foot to the same needless end.</l>
               <l>And this forsooth the <hi>Bacon-Flitch</hi> they call,</l>
               <l>Not that it does resemble one at all;</l>
               <l>For it is round, not flat: but I suppose</l>
               <l>Because it hangs i'th' roof like one of those,</l>
               <l>And shines like salt, <hi>Peake Bacon-eaters</hi> came</l>
               <l>At first to call it by that greasie name.</l>
               <l>This once a fellow had, another Stone</l>
               <l>Of the same colour, and proportion:</l>
               <l>But long ago, I know not how, the one</l>
               <l>Fell down, or eaten was; for now 'tis gone.</l>

Which, on a Rocks sharp ridge taking its root,</l>

With such a noise striking th' astonisht ear,</l>

               <l>Thorough the secret <hi>Conduits</hi> of her Springs,</l>
               <l>With such a harmony of various Notes,</l>

               <l>Whose works all humane <hi>Art</hi> so far excell?</l>
               <l>For doubtless he that <hi>Heaven</hi> made, made <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>This leads into a handsom Room, wherein</l>
               <l>A <hi>Bason</hi> stands with waters Crystalline,</l>

To welcome such, as, once at least, shall grace</l>
               <l>With unknown light this solitary place.</l>
               <l>On this side many more small <hi>Grotto's</hi> are,</l>
               <l>Which, were the first away, would all seem rare:</l>
               <l>But, that once seen, we may the rest pass by,</l>
               <l>As hardly worth our curiosity.</l>
               <l>But we must back, ere we can forward go,</l>
               <l>Into the <hi>Channel</hi> we forsook below;</l>
               <l>Through which the rugged pass does only lye</l>
               <l>T' a further, and compleat discovery.</l>
               <l>Being return'd, we now again proceed</l>
               <l>Thorough a <hi>Vale</hi> that's salebrous indeed,</l>
               <l>Squeezing our guts, bruising our flesh and bones,</l>
               <l>To thrust betwixt massy, and pointed stones</l>
               <l>Some three, some four, and others five foot high,</l>
               <l>Puffing, and sweating in our industry;</l>
               <l>Till after three, or fourscore paces more,</l>
               <l>We reach the second <hi>Rivers</hi> marble shoar,</l>
               <l>Four times as broad, as that we past before.</l>

The waters <hi>margent</hi> here goes down so steep,</l>
               <l>That at first step you chop in middle deep;</l>
               <l>But, though the way be cumbersom, and rough,</l>
               <l>'Tis no where more, and foardable enough.</l>
               <l>This, as the other clear, differs in this,</l>
               <l>That bottom is of Sand, this stony is,</l>
               <l>And here withal the water is so strong,</l>
               <l>That as you raise one foot to move along,</l>
               <l>Without good heed, you will have much ado</l>
               <l>To fix the other foot from rising too,</l>
               <l>And yet there is no current here, nor spring</l>
               <l>T' occasion such an unexpected thing;</l>
               <l>For, though the <hi>Country People</hi> are so wise</l>
               <l>To call these <hi>Rivers,</hi> they'r but <hi>Stagnancies,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Left by the flood; which, when retir'd again,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Cave</hi> does in her hollow <hi>lap</hi> retain.</l>
               <l>As here through cobling stones we stumbling wade,</l>
               <l>The narrowing <hi>Cave</hi> cast such a dreadful shade,</l>

That being thence unable to discover,</l>
               <l>With all our lights how far the <hi>Lake</hi> was over,</l>
               <l>We made a halt, and, as the rest desir'd,</l>
               <l>I now half willing was to have retir'd,</l>
               <l>And had not <hi>Resolution</hi> then stept in,</l>

               <l>But ore we got, and from our cloaths there rain'd</l>
               <l>A welcome showr upon the thirsty Sand,</l>
               <l>Of which we here vast Mountains saw by <hi>Seas</hi>

               <l>Over these <hi>Hills</hi> we forward still contend,</l>
               <l>Wishing, and longing for our Journeys end,</l>
               <l>Till now again we saw the Rock descend</l>
               <l>Forming a Roof so even, smooth, and sleek,</l>
               <l>Without, or crack, or seam, or chink, or nick,</l>
               <l>Some twenty paces long, and ten foot high,</l>

For here again, who ere shall try will know,</l>
               <l>The humorous <hi>Rock</hi> descends so very low,</l>
               <l>That the swoln floods when they in fury rave</l>

               <l>Where, though the <hi>Brook</hi> offer'd to guide us still,</l>

               <l>So near the Rock we on all four must creep,</l>

               <l>And to reward us for the mighty pain,</l>
               <l>Brought us unto our little <hi>Nymph</hi> again.</l>
               <l>Which we some paces follow'd still, when there</l>
               <l>A suddain noise striking th' astonish't ear,</l>
               <l>We neither could guess what, nor tell from whence,</l>
               <l>Strook us into amazement, and suspence.</l>
               <l>We stood all mute, and pallid with the sight;</l>
               <l>A paleness so increast by paler light,</l>

That ev'ry wand a <hi>Caduce</hi> did appear,</l>
               <l>As we a <hi>Caravan</hi> of dead folks were:</l>
               <l>But really so terrible a sound</l>
               <l>Sure ne're was heard above, or under ground.</l>
               <l>To which the difficulties we had had,</l>
               <l>And horror of the place did so much add,</l>
               <l>That it was long before a word came out</l>
               <l>To ask a question, or resolve a doubt.</l>
               <l>But, by some one, the silence being broke,</l>

               <l>Either to get, or give intelligence.</l>
               <l>So when a tall, and richly laden Ship,</l>

               <l>Suddenly strikes upon some unseen Rock,</l>

On the right hand an open passage lies</l>
               <l>Where once again the Roof does sloping rise</l>
               <l>In a steep craggy, and a lubrick shoar,</l>
               <l>As high at least, as any where before;</l>
               <l>Where from the very top of all the <hi>Hill,</hi>

               <l>A murm'ring fountain does her streams distill,</l>

               <l>Though here it does in gentle whispers brawl</l>
               <l>Through little stones, and is scarce heard at all.</l>
               <l>The water falling down so silent here,</l>

For many paces more we had not gone,</l>

               <l>Some thirty paces long, and thirteen wide,</l>
