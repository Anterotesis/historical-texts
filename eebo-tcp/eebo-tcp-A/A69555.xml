            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Wandring Beauty.</head>
            <p>I Was not above Twelve Years old, as near as I can remember, when a Lady of my Acquaintance, who was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned in many of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, very pleaſantly Entertained me with the Relation of the Young Lady <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Adventures, who was Eldeſt Daughter to Sir <hi>Francis Fairname,</hi> a Gentleman of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family, and of a very large Eſtate in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> a True Church-Man, a great Loyaliſt, and a moſt diſcreetly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Parent: nor was his Lady any way Inferiourr to him in every Circumſtance of Virtue. They had only Two Children more, and thoſe were of the ſoft, unhappy Sex too; all very Beautiful, eſpecially <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> and all very much alike; Piouſly Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and Courtly too, of Naturally Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Principles and Inclinations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:39418:4"/>'Twas about the Sixteenth Year of her Age that Sir <hi>Robert Richland,</hi> her Father's great Friend, and inſeparable Companion, but Superiour to him in Eſtate, as well as Years, felt the Reſiſtleſs Beauty of this young Lady Raging and Burning in his Aged Veins, which had like to have been as Fatal to him, as a Conſumption, or his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterical Year of Sixty Three, in which he dy'd, as I am told, though he was then hardly Sixty. However, the <hi>Winter</hi> Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wou'd fain have been Inoculated in the <hi>Summer</hi>'s Nacturine. His unſeaſonable Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite grew ſo ſtrong and inordinate, that he was oblig'd to diſcover it to Sir <hi>Francis</hi>; who, though he lov'd him very ſincerely, had yet a Regard to his Daughter's Youth, and Satisfaction in the Choice of a Husband; eſpecially when he conſider'd the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in their Age, which he rightly imagined wou'd be very diſagreeable to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>'s Inclinations: This made him at firſt uſe all the moſt powerful and perſuading Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in his Capacity, to Convince Sir <hi>Robert</hi> of the Inequality of ſuch a Match, but all to no purpoſe; for his Paſſion increaſing each Day more violently, the more aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and with the greater vehemence he preſt his Friends to uſe his Intereſt and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with his Lady and Daughter, to conſent to his almoſt unnatural Propoſition; offering this as the moſt weighty and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Argument, which undoubtedly it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39418:4"/>
was, That ſince he was a Batchelor, he wou'd ſettle his whole Eſtate upon her, if ſhe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived him, on the Day of Marriage, not deſiring one Penny as a Portion with her. This Diſcourſe wrought ſo powerfully with her Mother, that ſhe promis'd the old Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Aſſiſtance he cou'd Hope or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from her: In order to which, the next Day ſhe Acquainted her fair Daughter with the Golden Advantage ſhe was like to have, if ſhe wou'd but conſent <hi>To lye by the Parchment that convey'd 'em to her.</hi> The Dear, Fair Creature, was ſo ſurpriz'd at this Overture made by her Mother, that her Roſes turn'd all into Lilies, and ſhe had like to have Swoon'd away, but having a greater Command of her Paſſions than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally our Sex have, and chiefly Perſons of her Age, ſhe, after ſome little diſorder, which by no means ſhe cou'd diſſemble, ſhe made as Dutiful a Return to her Mother's Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as her Averſion to it would permit, and for that time got liberty to retreat, and lament in Private the Misfortune which ſhe partly fore-ſaw was Impending. But her Grief (alas!) was no Cure of her Malady; for the next Day ſhe was again doubly At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd by her Father and Mother, with all the Reaſons that Intereſt and Duty cou'd urge, which ſhe endeavoured to Obviate by all the Arguments that Nature and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cou'd offer, but ſhe found 'em all in vain, ſince they continu'd their ungrateful Sollicitations for ſeveral Days together, at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39418:5"/>
the end of which they both abſolutely Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her to prepare her ſelf for her Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials with Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> ſo that, finding her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under a neceſſity of Complying, or at leaſt of ſeeming ſo; ſhe made 'em hope that her Duty had overcome her Averſion; upon which ſhe had a whole Week's Liberty to walk where ſhe wou'd, unattended, or with what Company ſhe pleas'd, and to make Viſits to whom ſhe had a Mind, either of her Relations or Acquaintance thereabouts; though for three or four Days before, ſhe was ſtrictly Confin'd to her Chamber.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, on the third Day of her Enlargement, being <hi>Summer</hi>-Time, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to her Mother that ſhe wou'd take a Walk to a Couſin of hers, who liv'd about Four Miles thence, to entreat her to be one of her Bride-Maids, being then in a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, plain Dreſs, and having before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd very pleaſantly and freely of her Wedding-Day, of what Friends ſhe wou'd have Invited to that Solemnity, and what Hoſpitality Sir <hi>Robert</hi> ſhou'd keep when ſhe was Marry'd to him: All which was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to her Parents, who then cou'd not forbear Thanking and Kiſſing her for it, which ſhe return'd to 'em both with a Shower of Tears. This did not a little Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize 'em at firſt, but asking her what cou'd cauſe ſuch ſigns of Sorrow after ſo chearful a Diſcourſe on the l<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te Subject. She anſwer'd, <hi>That the Thoughts of her going now, ſuddenly to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39418:5"/>
Live from ſo Dear and Tender a Father and Mother, were the ſole occaſion of ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Grief.</hi> This Affectionate Reply did amply Satisfie their Doubts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently took leave of 'em, after having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd that they wou'd not be uneaſie if ſhe ſhou'd not return till a little before 'twas dark, or if her Couſin ſhou'd oblige her to ſtay all Night with her; which they took for a diſcreet Caution in her; and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that young Maidens love dearly to talk of Marriage-Affairs, eſpecially when ſo near at hand: And thus eaſily parted with her, when they had walk'd with her about a Mile, over a Field or two of their own.</p>
            <p>Never before that time was the dear Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glad that her Father and Mother had left her, unleſs when they had preſs'd her to a Marriage with the old Knight. They were therefore no ſooner got out of ſight, e'er ſhe took another Path that led croſs the Countrey, which ſhe purſu'd till paſt Eight at Night, having walk'd Ten Miles ſince Two a Clock, when Sir <hi>Francis</hi> and her Mother left her, ſhe was juſt now got to a little Cottage, the poor, but cleanly Habitation of a Husbandman and his Wife, who had one only Child, a Daughter, about the Lady <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Age and Stature. 'Twas happy for him ſhe got thither before they were a Bed; for her Soft and Beautiful Limbs began now to be tired, and her Tender Feet to be gall'd.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39418:6"/>
To the good Woman of the Houſe ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies her ſelf, deſiring Entertainment for that Night, offering her any reaſonable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. The good Wife at firſt Sight of her had Compaſſion of her, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately bid her walk in, telling her that ſhe might lye with her Daughter if ſhe pleaſed, who was very cleanly, tho not very vine. The good Man of the Houſe came in ſoon after, who was very well pleaſed with his new Gueſt; ſo to Supper they went very ſeaſonably for the poor young Lady, who was e'en ready to faint with Thirſt, and not overcharged with what ſhe had eaten the Day before. After Supper they ask'd her whence ſhe came, and how ſhe durſt venture to travel alone, and a foot. To which ſhe reply'd, that ſhe came from a Relation who liv'd at <hi>Exeter,</hi> with whom ſhe had ſtay'd till ſhe found ſhe was burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. That ſhe was of Welſh Parents, and of a good Family; but her Father dying, left a cruel Mother-in-law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom ſhe cou'd by no means continue, eſpecially, ſince ſhe wou'd have forc'd her to marry an old Man, whom it was impoſſible ſhe ſhou'd love, tho he was very Rich; that ſhe was now going to ſeek her Fortune in <hi>London,</hi>, where ſhe hop'd, at leaſt, to get her a good Service. They all ſeem'd to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty her very heartily, and in a little time after they went to their two ſeveral Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; in one of which <hi>Arabella</hi> and the Damſel of the Houſe went to Bed, where
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39418:6"/>
the young Lady ſlept ſoundly, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hardneſs of her Lodging. In the Morning about Four, according to her Laudable Cuſtom, the young hardy Maiden got up to her daily Employment, which wakned <hi>Arabella,</hi> who preſently bethought her ſelf of an Expedient for her more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and eaſie Eſcape from her Parents Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit and Knowledge, propoſing to her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow an Exchange of their Wearing Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. The Heireſs and Hope of that little Family was extreamly fond of the Propoſal, and ran immediately to acquaint her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it, who was ſo well pleaſed, that ſhe cou'd hardly believe it, when the young Lady confirm'd it; and eſpecially, when ſhe underſtood the Exchange was to be made on even Hands. <hi>If you be in earneſt Forſooth</hi> (ſaid the Mother) <hi>you ſhall e'en have her Sunday-Cloaths. Agreed</hi> (return'd <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella) but we muſt change Shifts too; I have now a Couple about me, new and clean, I do aſſure you: For my Hoods and Head-dreſs you ſhall give me two Pinners, and her beſt Straw-Hat; and for my Shooes, which I have not worn above a Week; I will have her Holyday-Shooes. A Match, indeed, young Miſtreſs</hi>; (cry'd the Good Wife). So without more Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, the young unhappy Lady was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in her Bedfellow's Country-Weeds, by Help of the Mother and Daughter. Then after ſhe had taken her leave of the good old Man too, ſhe put a broad round Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into his Wife's Hand, as a Reward for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39418:7"/>
her Supper and Lodging, which ſhe wou'd fain have return'd, but t'other wou'd not receive it. <hi>Nay, then, by th' Mackins,</hi> (ſaid her Hoſteſs) <hi>you ſhall take a Breakfaſt e're you go, and a Dinner along with you, for fear you ſhou'd be ſick by the way. Arabella</hi> ſtay'd to eat a Meſs of warm Milk, and took ſome of their Yeſterdays Proviſion with her in a little courſe Linnen-Bag. Then asking for the direct Road to <hi>London,</hi> and begging a few Green Wallnuts, ſhe took her laſt Farewel of 'em.</p>
            <p>Near Twelve at Noon ſhe came to a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Meadow, thro which there ran a little Rivulet of clear Water, about Nine Miles from her laſt Lodging, but quite out of the way to <hi>London.</hi> Here ſhe ſate down, and after drinking ſome of the Water out of the hollow of her Hand, ſhe open'd her Bag, and made as good a Meal as the courſeneſs of the Fare, and the niceneſs of her Appetite would permit: After which ſhe bruis'd the outward green Shells of a Wallnut or two, and ſmear'd her lovely Face, Hands, and part of her Arms, with the Juice; then looking into the little purling Stream, that ſeem'd to murmur at the Injury ſhe did to ſo much Beauty; ſhe ſigh'd and wept, to think to what baſe Extremities ſhe was now likely to be reduc'd! That ſhe ſhou'd be forced to ſtain that Skin which Heaven had made ſo pure and white! <hi>But ah!</hi> (cry'd ſhe to her ſelf) <hi>if my Diſobedience to my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had not ſtain'd my Conſcience worſe, this rents

needed not to have been done.</hi> Here ſhe wept abundantly again; then, drying her Eyes, ſhe waſh'd her Feet to refreſh 'em, and thence continued her Journey for Ten Miles more, which ſhe compaſs'd by Seven a Clock; when ſhe came to a Village, where ſhe got Entertainment for that Night, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, and the next Morning, before Six, aſſoon as ſhe had fill'd her little Bag with what good Chear that Place afforded, ſhe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd on till Twelve again, ſtill croſſing the Country, and taking her Courſe to the Northern Parts of <hi>England,</hi> which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs was the Reaſon her Father and his Servants miſs'd of her in their Purſuit; for he imagin'd that for certain ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her neareſt way to <hi>London.</hi> After ſhe had refreſh'd her ſelf for an Hours time by the ſide of a Wood; ſhe roſe and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd again near twelve Miles by Eight a Clock, and lodg'd at a good ſubſtantial Farmer's.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhe continued her Errantry for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Fortnight, having no more Money than juſt Thirty Shillings, half of which brought her to Sir <hi>Chriſtian Kindly</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi> 'Twas near Five a Clock in the Afternoon, when ſhe reach'd that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Port, when coming to the Hall-Door ſhe inquired for the Lady of the Houſe, who happily was juſt coming into the Hall with a little Miſs in her Arms, of about Four Years old, very much troubled with weak and ſore Eyes: The fair Wanderer addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39418:8"/>
her ſelf to the Lady with all the Humility &amp; Modeſty imaginable, begg'd to know if her Ladyſhip had any Place in her Family va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, in which ſhe might do her Service? To which the Lady return'd (by way of Queſtion) <hi>Alas! poor Creature! what canſt thou do? Any thing, may it pleaſe your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> (replied the Diſguiſed Beauty) <hi>any thing within my Strength and my Knowledge, I mean, Madam. Thou ſayſt well</hi> (ſaid the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) <hi>and I'm ſorry I have not any vacant for thee. I beſeech your Ladyſhip then</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella) let me lodge in your Barn to Night; for I am told it is a great way hence to any Town, and I have but little Money. In my Barn, poor Girl</hi>! (cry'd the Lady, looking very earneſtly on her) <hi>Ay, God forbid elſe; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can find a better Lodging for thee. Art thou Hungry or Thirſty? Yes, Madam,</hi> (reply'd the wandring Fair One) <hi>I cou'd both Eat and Drink if it pleaſe your Ladyſhip.</hi> The Lady commanded Victuals and Drink to be brought, and cou'd not forbear ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hall till ſhe had done; when ſhe ask'd her ſeveral Queſtions; as of what Country ſhe was? To which ſhe anſwer'd, truly of <hi>Somerſetſhire.</hi> What her Parents were, and if living. To which ſhe return'd, <hi>They were Good, Honeſt, and Religious People, and ſhe hop'd they were alive, and in as good Health as when ſhe left 'em.</hi> After the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had done Catechiſing her, <hi>Arabella,</hi> looking on the little Child in her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Arms, ſaid, <hi>Pardon me, Madam, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39418:8"/>
you, if I am too bold in asking your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip how that pretty Creatures Eyes came to be ſo bad? By an extream Cold which ſhe took</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Lady.) <hi>I had not preſum'd</hi> (return'd t'other) <hi>to have asked your Ladyſhip this Queſtion, were I not aſſur'd that I have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Cure for the Infirmity: And if (Madam) you will be pleaſed to let me apply it, I will tell your Ladyſhip the Remedy in private.</hi> The Lady was much ſurpriz'd to hear a young Creature ſo meanly habited, talk ſo gentile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and after ſurveying her very ſtrictly, ſaid the Lady, <hi>Have you ever experimented it before? Yes Madam,</hi> (reply'd the fair Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian) <hi>and never without happy Succeſs: I dare engage, Madam,</hi> (added ſhe) <hi>that I will make 'em as well as my own, by God's Bleſſing, or elſe I will be content to loſe mine; which Heaven forbid. Amen</hi> (cry'd the good Lady) <hi>for they are very fine ones on my word.—Stay Child, I will deſire Sir</hi> Chriſtian <hi>to hear it with me, and if he approves it, you ſhall about it; and if it take good Effect, we will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to requite the Care and Pains it ſhall coſt you:</hi> Saying thus, ſhe immediately left her, and return'd very ſpeedily with Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> who having diſcourſed <hi>Arabella</hi> for ſome time with great Satisfaction &amp; Pleaſure, took her into the Parlour with his Lady, where ſhe Communicated her Secret to 'em both; which they found ſo Innocent and Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they deſir'd her to prepare it as ſoon as poſſible, and to make her Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it withal convenient ſpeed; which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39418:9"/>
ſhe cou'd not do till the next Morning. In the mean time ſhe was order'd a Lodging with the Houſe-Maid, who Reported to her Lady, <hi>That ſhe found her a very ſweet and cleanly Bed-fellow</hi>; adding, <hi>That ſhe never ſaw nor felt ſo white, ſo ſmooth, and ſoft a Skin. Arabella</hi> continu'd her Remedy with ſuch good Succeſs, that in a Fortnights time, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Miſs's Eyes were as lively and ſtrong as ever. This ſo endear'd her to the Knight and his Lady, that they Created a new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in their Family, purpoſely for her; which was Attendant on their Eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Eleanora,</hi> a Lady much about her Years and Stature, who was ſo Charmed with her Converſation, that ſhe cou'd not ſtir abroad, nor Eat, nor Sleep, without <hi>Peregrina Good-houſe</hi> (for thoſe were the Names ſhe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd:) Nor was her Modeſty, Humility, and Sweetneſs of Temper, leſs engaging to her Fellow-Servants, who all ſtrove which ſhou'd beſt expreſs their Love to her. On Feſtival-Days, and for the Entertainment of Strangers, ſhe wou'd lend her helping Hand to the Cook, and make the Sauſe for every Diſh, though her own Province was only to Attend the young Lady, and prepare the Quidlings, and other Sweet-Meats, for the Reception of Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Friends, all which ſhe did to Admiration. In this ſtate of eaſie Servitude ſhe liv'd there for near Three Years, very well contented at all times, but when ſhe bethought her ſelf of her Father, Mother and Siſters, Courted by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39418:9"/>
all the principal Men-Servants, whom ſhe refus'd in ſo obliging a manner, and with ſuch ſweet, obliging Words, that they cou'd not think themſelves injur'd, though they found their Addreſſes were in vain. Mr. <hi>Prayfaſt,</hi> the Chaplain himſelf, cou'd not hold out againſt her Charms. For her Skin had long ſince recover'd its Native White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; nor did ſhe need Ornaments of Cloaths to ſet her Beauty off, if any thing cou'd Adorn her, ſince ſhe was dreſs'd altogether as Coſtly, though not ſo Richly (perhaps) as <hi>Eleanora. Prayfaſt</hi> therefore found that the Spirit was too weak for the Fleſh, and gave her very broad Signs of his Kindneſs in Sonnets, Anagrams, and Acroſticks, which ſhe receiv'd very obligingly of him, taking a more convenient time to Laugh at 'em with her young Lady.</p>
            <p>Her kind Reception of 'em encourag'd him to that Degree, that within a few Days after, ſuppoſing himſelf ſecure on her ſide, he apply'd himſelf to the good Old Knight, his Patron, for his Conſent to a Marriage with her, who very readily comply'd with his Demands, eſteeming it a very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Match for <hi>Peregrina,</hi> and withal told him, <hi>That he wou'd give him Three Hundred Pounds with her, beſides the firſt Benefit that ſhou'd fall, within his Gift. But</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>as I doubt not that you are ſufficiently Acquainted with her Virtues, and other excellent Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 'tis neceſſary that you ſhou'd know the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39418:10"/>
worſt that I can tell you of her, which is, That ſhe came to us a meer Stranger, in a very mean, though cleanly Habit; and therefore, as ſhe has own'd to us, we may conclude, of very humble, yet honeſt Parentage. A! (poſſibly) her Father might have been, or is, ſome Husbandman, or ſome-what Inferiour to that; for we took her up at the Door, begging one Night's Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Barn.</hi> How, Sir! (cry'd <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,</hi> ſtarting) have you no better knowledge of her Birth, then what you are pleas'd to diſcover now? <hi>No better, nor more</hi> (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Knight.) Alas! Sir, then (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the Proud Canonical ſort of a Farmer) She is no Wife for me: I ſhall diſhonour my Family by Marrying ſo baſely. Were you never told any thing of this before? (ask'd the Knight.) You know, Sir, (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Prelate that wou'd be) that I have not had the Honour to Officiate, as your Chaplain, much more than half a Year; in which time, 'tis true, I have heard that ſhe was Receiv'd as a Stranger; but that ſhe came in ſo low a Capacity, I never learn'd till now. <hi>I find then Parſon,</hi> (ſaid the Knight) <hi>That you do not like the Author of your Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at leaſt, who might be ſo, becauſe ſhe comes to you in ſuch an humble manner; I tell you the Jews are miſerable for the ſame Reaſon.</hi> She cannot be ſuch perfectly to me (return'd t'other) without the Advantage of good Birth. <hi>With that I'm ſure ſhe wou'd not,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd his Patron, and left him to go to <hi>Peregrina,</hi> whom he happily found alone.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39418:10"/>
               <hi>Child</hi> (ſaid he to her) <hi>Have you any Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Mr.</hi> Prayfaſt? As how, Sir? ſhe ask'd. <hi>Do you love him? Have you made him any Promiſe of Marriage? Or, has he any way Engaged himſelf to you?</hi> Neither, Sir (ſhe Anſwer'd.) 'Tis true, I love him as my Fellow-Servant, no otherwiſe. He has indeed been ſome-what Laviſh of his Wit and Rhimes to me, which ſerv'd well enough to divert my young Lady and me. But of all Mankind, perhaps, he ſhou'd be the laſt I wou'd chuſe for a Husband. <hi>I thought</hi> (ſaid the good humour'd old Knight) <hi>that he had already obtain'd a Promiſe from you, ſince he came but juſt now to ask my Conſent, which I freely gave him at firſt, upon that Thought; but he is doubtful of your Birth, and fears it may diſhonour his Family, if he ſhou'd Marry you.</hi> On my Word, Sir (return'd <hi>Peregrina,</hi> bluſhing, with diſdain, no doubt) our Families are by no means equal. <hi>What thy Family is I know not</hi> (ſaid Sir <hi>Chriſtian) but I am ſure thou art infinitely Superiour to him in all the Natural Embelliſhments both of Body and Mind. Be juſt to thy ſelf, and be not haſty to Wed; Thou haſt more Merit than Wealth alone can Purchaſe.</hi> O! dear Sir (ſhe return'd) you Ruin me with Obligations, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be Re-paid but in Acknowledgment, and that imperfectly too. Here they were Interrupted by the young Lady, to whom ſhe Repeated the Conference betwixt Sir <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Prayfaſt,</hi> as ſoon as ever Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi> left the Room.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:39418:11"/>About a Week after, Sir <hi>Lucius Lovewell,</hi> a young Gentleman, of a good Preſence, Wit and Learning enough, whoſe Father dying near a Twelve-month before, had left him upwards of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, which too was an Excellent Accompliſhment, though not the beſt, for he was admirably good Humour'd, came to Viſit Sir <hi>Chriſtian Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and as ſome of the Family imagin'd, 'twas with deſign to make his Addreſſes to the young Lady, Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Daughter; whatever his Thoughts were, his Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was very generous and kind. He ſaw the Lady, and lik'd her very well; nay, doubtleſs, wou'd have admitted a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for her, had not his Deſtiny at the ſame time ſhewn him <hi>Peregrina.</hi> She was very Beautiful, and he as ſenſible; and 'tis not to be doubted but that he immediately took Fire. However, his Application and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, free and unaffected as it was, were chiefly directed to Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Daughter: Some little Reſpects he paid to <hi>Peregrina,</hi> who cou'd not chooſe but look on him as a very fine, good-humour'd, and well Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Gentleman. When the Hour came that he thought fit to retreat, Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> ask'd him, When he wou'd make 'em Happy again in his Converſation? To which he return'd, <hi>That ſince he was not above ſeven or eight Miles from him, and that there were Charms ſo Attractive at Sir</hi> Chriſtian<hi>'s, he ſhou'd take the liberty to Viſit him ſooner and oftner, than he either expected or deſir'd.</hi> T'other
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39418:11"/>
reply'd, That was impoſſible; and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much more Ceremony, he took his leave of that delightful Company for two or three Days; at the end of which he return'd with Thoughts much different from thoſe at his firſt coming thither, being ſtrongly Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Paſſion for <hi>Peregrina.</hi> He took and made all the opportunities and occaſions that Chance and his own Fancy cou'd offer and preſent to Talk to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both before, at, and after Dinner, and his Eyes were ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fix'd on her, that he ſeem'd to obſerve nothing elſe, which was ſo viſible to Sir <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> his Lady and Daughter, that they were Convinc'd of their Error, in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he came to make his Court to the young Lady. This late Diſcovery of the young Knight's Inclinations, was no way unpleaſant to Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and his Lady, and to the young Lady it was moſt agreeable and obliging, ſince her Heart was already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd elſewhere; and ſince ſhe did equally deſire the good Fortune of her Beautiful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant with her own.</p>
            <p>The Table was no ſooner clear'd, and a Loyal Health or two gone round, e'er Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ask'd his young Amorous Gueſt to take a Walk with him in the Gardens: To which Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> readily conſented, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcloſe that to him for a Secret, which was but too apparent to all that were preſent at Table: When therefore he thought he had ſufficiently Admir'd and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39418:12"/>
Commended the neatneſs of the Walks, and beauty of the Flowers, he began to this Effect:
<q>Poſſibly Sir <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I ſhall ſurprize you with the Diſcourſe I'm going to make you; but 'tis certain, no Man can avoid the neceſſity of the Fate which he lies under; at leaſt I have now found it ſo.— I came at firſt, Sir, with the hopes of prevailing on you, to Honour and make me happy in a Marriage with Madam <hi>Eleanora</hi> your Daughter; but at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant I was ſeiz'd with ſo irreſiſtible a Paſſion for the Charming <hi>Peregrina,</hi> that I find no Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, Fame nor Wit, can make me perfectly Bleſt here below, without the Enjoyment of that Beautiful Creature. Do not miſtake me, Sir, (I beſeech you, continu'd he) I mean an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Enjoyment</hi> — I will make her my Wife, Sir, if you will be generouſly pleas'd to uſe your Intereſt with her on my part.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which the good old Knight reply'd, What you think (Sir) you have now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted as a Secret has been the general Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all my Family e'er ſince you gave us the Happineſs of your Company to day: Your Paſſion is too great to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed; and I am extreamly pleaſed that you can think any thing in my Houſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Honour you intend <hi>Peregrina.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had you made any particular and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Addreſs to my Daughter, I ſhould have believ'd it want of Merit in her, or in us,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39418:12"/>
her Parents, that you ſhould after that quit your Pretenſions to her, without any wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or known Offence committed on our ſide. I therefore (Sir) approve your Choice, and promiſe you my utmoſt Aſſiſtance afar. She is really virtuous in all the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Virtue; Her Beauty is too viſible to be diſputed by, ev'n by Envy it ſelf: As for her Birth, ſhe leſs can inform you of it; I muſt only let you know, that as her Name imports ſhe was utterly a Stranger, and entertain'd by us in pure Charity. But the Antiquity and Honour of your Family can receive no Diminution by a Match with a Beautiful and Virtuous Creature, for whom, you ſay, and I believe, you have ſo true a Paſſion. I have now told you the worſt (Sir) that I know of her; but your Wealth and Love may make you both eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy on Earth. And ſo they ſhall, <hi>by her Dear ſelf</hi> (return'd the Amorous Knight) if both of 'em may recommend me to her, with your Perſwaſions added, which ſtill I beg. Say, rather you <hi>Command</hi>; and with thoſe Three Hundred Pounds which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her, if ſhe marry'd with my Conſent to Sir <hi>Lucius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this, the other ſmiling, reply'd, <hi>Her Perſon and Love is all I court or expect, Sir: But ſince you have thought her worthy of ſo great an Expreſſion of your Favour and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I will receive it with all Humility as is from a Father, which I ſhall ever eſteem you—
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39418:13"/>
But ſee, Sir,</hi> (cry'd he in an Extaſie) <hi>how ſhe comes, led by Madam</hi> Peregrina, <hi>your Daughter.</hi> The young Lady coming to him, began thus. <hi>I know (Sir) 'tis my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother's Deſire and Ambition to ſhew you the heartieſt Welcome in their Power, which can be no means be made appear ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and undiſputably, as by preſenting you with what you like beſt in the Family; In Aſſurance therefore that I ſhall merit their Favour by this Act, I have brought your Dear</hi> Peregrina <hi>to you, not without Advice, and ſome Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of mine, that may concern her Happineſs with you, if diſcreetly obſerv'd, and purſued by her. In ſhort (Sir) I have told her that a Gentleman of ſo Good a Figure, ſuch excellent Parts, and generous Education of ſo Antient and Honourable a Family; together with ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful an Eſtate, as you at preſent poſſeſs, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bringing Happineſs to any, the Faireſt Lady in this Country at leaſt.</hi> O Madam (return'd <hi>Sir Lucius</hi>) your Obligation is ſo great, that I want Senſe to receive it as I ought; much more Words to return you any proportionable Acknowledgment of it. But give me Leave to ſay thus much, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; that my Thoughts of making my Court to your Ladyſhip firſt invited me to give Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi> your Father, the trouble of a Viſit, ſince the Death of mine. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the over-ruling Powers have thought to divert my purpoſe, and the Offering of my Heart, which can never reſt, but with this <hi>Dear Charming Creature.</hi>—Your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39418:13"/>
Madam —are ſufficient for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on whom I entirely fix'd my Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, before you did me the Honour, and your ſelf the Trouble of your firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, interrupted Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Daughter. <hi>And now, Sir,</hi> (added ſhe to her Father) <hi>if you pleaſe, let us leave 'em to make an end of this Buſineſs between themſelves.</hi> No, Madam, (cry'd <hi>Sir Lucius</hi>) your Father has promiſed me to make uſe of his Intereſt with her for my ſake. This I now expect, Sir. <hi>Then (ſaid the Old Knight) thou Dear Beautiful and Virtuous Stranger! If I have any Power to perſwade thee, take my Advice, and this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Gentleman to thy loving Husband; I'm ſure he'll prove ſo to thee. If I could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee, I would.</hi> Ah Sir! (ſaid ſhe, kneeling, with Tears falling from her Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eyes) I know none living that has greater Right and Power. — But (alas Sir!) this Honourable Perſon knows not the Meanneſs of my Birth, at leaſt, he cannot think it any way proportionable or ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to His. <hi>O thou dear Creature, (cry'd her Lover, ſetting one Knee to the Ground, and taking her up) Sir</hi> Chriſtian <hi>has already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed all thy Circumſtances to me. Riſe and Bleſs me with thy Conſent.</hi> I muſt ask my Lady's, Sir, (ſhe reply'd). See, here my Mother comes (ſaid the young Lady) and entreated her good Word for Sir <hi>Lucius.</hi> The good antient Lady began then to uſe all the Arguments to incline her to yield to her Happineſs; and in fine, ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:39418:14"/>
on to ſay, <hi>I do Conſent, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſerve the Honourable Title of your Dutiful Wife, Sir.</hi> 'Twas with no common Joy and Tranſport that he receiv'd her Hand, and kiſſed thoſe dear Lips that gave him an Aſſurance of his Happineſs; which he reſolv'd ſhould begin about a Month or two afterwards; in which time, he might ſend Orders to <hi>London</hi> for the making their Wedding Cloaths. Into the Houſe then they all went, Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> leading <hi>Peregrina,</hi> and the firſt they met of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was <hi>Prayfaſt,</hi> who was not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd nor diſcompos'd at that Sight; and more eſpecially when Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi> told him, <hi>That tho he did not think that Beautiful Sweet Stranger worthy the Title of his Wife, yet now he ſhou'd be obliged to joyn her to that Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſon.</hi> The Slave bow'd, and look'd very pale.</p>
            <p>All things were at laſt got ready for the Conſummation of their Bliſs, and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt</hi> did their Buſineſs effectually, tho much againſt his Will, however he receiv'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Twenty broad Pieces. The Wedding was kept for a Week at Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Houſe; after which they adjourn'd to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's, where it laſted as long as at Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s; his Lady, Daughter, and the reſt; of that Family would ſtay. As they were leaving him, Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> diſpos'd of Two Hundred Pounds amongſt Sir <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39418:14"/>
Servants, and the reſt of the Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred he diſtributed among the Poor of both Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>When they were gone, the Affectionate Tender Bridegroom cou'd by no means be perſwaded by any Gentlemen, his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to hunt with 'em, or to take any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, tho but for half a Day; eſteeming it the higheſt Unkindneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to leave his Lady: Not that ſhe could be alone neither in his Abſence; for ſhe never wanted the Viſits of all the Ladies round about, and thoſe of the beſt Quality; who were equally Charm'd with her Sweetneſs of Temper, as the Men were with her outward Beauties. But in a Months time, or thereabout, obſerving that he was continually ſollicited and courted to ſome Sport or Paſtime with thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his Neighbourhood, ſhe was forc'd to her ſelf the Violence to beg of him that he would divert himſelf with 'em as before their Marriage he us'd: And ſhe had ſo good Succeſs, that he did allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf two Days in the Week to hunt: In one of which, coming home about Five a Clock, and not finding his Lady below Stairs, he went directly up to her Chamber, where he ſaw her leaning her Head on her Hand, and her Handkercheif all bath'd in Tears. At this Sight he was ſtrangely amaz'd and concern'd. <hi>Madam, (cry'd he, in an unuſual Tone) what means ſuch Poſtures as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39418:15"/>
theſe? Tell me! For I muſt know the occaſion.</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and Trembling at this his unwonted manner of ſaluting her, ſhe ſtarted up, and then, falling on her Knees, ſhe wept out, <hi>O thou Dear Author and Lord of all my Joys on Earth! Look not, I beſeech you, ſo wildly, nor ſpeak terribly to me!</hi> Thou Center of all my Happineſs below (return'd he) Riſe and make me acquainted with the dreadful Occaſion of this Afflicting, and Tormenting Sight! <hi>All you ſhall know, (ſhe reply'd) Deareſt of Humane Bleſſings! But ſit, and change your Looks; then I can ſpeak.</hi> Speak then, my Life (ſaid he) but tell me all; All I muſt know. <hi>Is there a Thought about my Soul that you ſhall not partake?</hi> I'm ſure there is not, (he reply'd) ſay on then. <hi>You know, Sir, (ſhe return'd) that I have left my Parents now Three Years, or thereabouts, and know not whether they are Living or Dead. I was refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting therefore on the Troubles which my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful and long Abſence may have cauſed 'em. For, poor and mean as they may be, they well inſtructed me in all good things; and I wou'd once more, by your dear Permiſſion, ſee 'em, and beg their Pardon for my Fault. For, they're my Parents ſtill, if living, Sir; tho (unhappily) not worth Your Regard.</hi> How! (cry'd he) can that Pair who gave my Deareſt Birth, want my Regard! or ought I can do for 'em! No, Thou ſhalt ſee 'em, and ſo will I. But tell me, <hi>Peregrina,</hi> Is this the only Cauſe of your Diſcompoſure? <hi>So may I ſtill be bleſs'd in your dear Love (ſhe reply'd) as this is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:39418:15"/>
Truth, and all the Cauſe.</hi> When ſhall we ſee 'em then? (he asked) <hi>We ſee 'em (cry'd ſhe) O your Goodneſs deſcends too much; and you confound me with your unmerited and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kindneſs. 'Tis I alone that have offended, and I alone am fit to ſee 'em.</hi> That muſt not be (return'd her Affectionate Husband) no, we'll both go together; and if they want, either provide for 'em there, or take 'em hither with us. Your Education ſhews their Principles, and 'tis no Shame to own Virtuous Relations. Come, dry thy dear lamenting Eyes; the beginning of the next Week we'll ſet forwards. <hi>Was ever Diſobedience ſo rewarded with ſuch a Husband (ſaid ſhe) thoſe Tears have waſh'd that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Guilt away. And there is no Reward above thy Virtue.</hi>

            <p>In a few Days <hi>Monday</hi> began the Date of their Journey to the Weſt of <hi>England</hi>; and in Five or Six Days more, by the help of a Coach and Six, they got to <hi>Cornwall</hi>; where, in a little Town, of little Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, they were oblig'd to take up their Lodgings the firſt Night. In the Morning (ſaid his Lady to him) <hi>My Dear, about a Mile and a half hence lives one Sir</hi> Francis Fairname <hi>and his Lady, if yet they be living, who have a very fine Houſe, and worth your ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I beg of you therefore, that you will be ſo kind to your ſelf as to walk thither, and Dine with the old Gentleman; for that you muſt, if you ſee him; whilſt I ſtay here, and ſend to my
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:39418:16"/>
Father and Mother, if to be found, and prepare 'em to receive you at your Return. I muſt not have no Denial</hi> (added ſhe) <hi>for if you refuſe this Favour, all my Deſigns are loſt—Make haſte my Life; 'tis now Eleven a Clock. In your Abſence I'll dreſs, to try if Change of Cloaths can hide me from 'em.</hi> This was ſo ſmall a Requeſt, that he did not ſtay to reply to't, but preſently left her, and got thither in leſs than half an Hour, attended only by one Footman. He was very kindly and reſpectfully receiv'd by the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who had certainly been a very Beautiful Perſon in his Youth; and Sir <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> fixing his Eyes upon his Face, could hardly remove 'em, being very pleaſantly and ſurpriſingly entertain'd with ſome Lines that he obſerv'd in it. But immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himſelf, he told him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard how fine a Seat that was, his Curioſity led him to beg the Favour that he might ſee it. The worthy old Knight return'd, that his Houſe and all the Accommodations in it, were at his Service: So inviting him in, he ſatisfied his pretended Curioſity; and after he had ſhewn all that was worthy the ſight of a Stranger in the Houſe, he led him into his Gardens, which furniſh'd Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> with new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Admiration; whence the old Knight brought him into the Parlour, telling him that 'twas his Cuſtom to ſuffer no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to return till he had either din'd or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39418:16"/>
ſupp'd with him, according as the Hour of the Day or Night preſented.</p>
            <p>'Twas here the Affectionate Husband was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd at the Sight of a Picture, which ſo nearly counterfeited the Beauties of his dear liv'd Lady, that he ſtood like an Image himſelf, gazing and varying; the Colours of his Face agitating by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of his Thoughts; which Sir <hi>Francis</hi> perceiving, ask'd him what it was that ſo viſibly concern'd him? To which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That indeed he was concern'd, but with great Satisfaction and Pleaſure, ſince he had never ſeen any thing more Beautiful than that Picture, unleſs it were a Lady for whom he had the moſt ſincere Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction imaginable, and whom it did very nearly repreſent; and then enquir'd for whom that was drawn? Sir <hi>Francis</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him, <hi>'Twas deſign'd for one who</hi> Was, <hi>I dare not ſay who</hi> Is <hi>my Daughter, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two nere drawn for her younger Siſters, And ſee, Sir,</hi> (purſued he) <hi>here they come follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Mother</hi>: At which Words Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> was obliged to divorce his Eyes from the <hi>Charming Shadow,</hi> and make his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them; which were no ſooner over than Dinner was ſerv'd in, where the young Knight eat as heartily as he could, conſidering he ſate juſt oppoſite to it, and in ſight of the two Ladies, who were now exactly like his own Wife, tho not ſo very Beautiful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:39418:17"/>The Table being uncover'd, Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> deſir'd to know why Sir <hi>Francis</hi> ſaid he doubted whether the Original of that Picture were yet his Daughter? To which the Mother return'd, (big with Sorrow, which was ſeen in her Tears) <hi>That her Husband had ſpoken but too rightly: For</hi> (added ſhe) <hi>'tis now Three Years ſince we have either ſeen her, or heard from her.</hi> How Madam! Three Years (cry'd Sir <hi>Lucius</hi>) I believe I can ſhew your Ladyſhip a dear Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of mine, ſo wonderfully like that Picture, that I am almoſt perſwaded ſhe is the very Original; only (pardon me, Madam) ſhe tells me her Parents are of mean Birth and Fortune. <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> (cry'd the Tender Mother) <hi>Is ſhe in this Country?</hi> She is not Two Miles hence, (reply'd Sir <hi>Lucius). By all things moſt dear to you, Sir,</hi> (ſaid the Lady) <hi>let us be ſo happy as to ſee her, and that with all convenient Expedition! For, it will be a Happineſs to ſee any Creature, the only</hi> Like my Deareſt Arabella. <hi>Arabella,</hi> Madam! Alas. No, Madam, her Name is <hi>Peregrina. No matter for Names, Sir,</hi> (cry'd the Lady) <hi>I want the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>Francis</hi>). So without farther Ceremony Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> left 'em, and return'd to his Lady, whom he found ready dreſs'd, as he wiſh'd he might. <hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>where are your Father and Mother?</hi> I know not yet, my Dear, ſhe repiy'd. <hi>Well</hi> (return'd he) <hi>we will expect 'em, or ſend for 'em hither at Night; in the mean time I have engag'd to bring you with me to Sir</hi> Francis Fairname <hi>and his Lady with all imaginable Expedition.</hi> So immediately as ſoon as Coach and Six, and Equipage, was ready, he hurry'd her away with him to Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> whom they found walking with his Lady and two Daughters in the outward Court, impatiently expecting their Coming. The Boot of the Coach (for that was the Faſhion in thoſe Days) was preſently let down, and Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> led his Lady forwards to them; who coming within Three or Four Paces of the good old Knight, his Lady fell on her Knees, and begg'd their Pardon and Bleſſing. Her Affectionate Father anſwer'd 'em with Tears from his Eyes; but the good antient Lady was ſo overcome with Joy, that ſhe fell into a Swoon, and had like to have been accompanied by her Daughter, who fell upon her Knees by her, and with her Shrieks recall'd her, when ſhe ſtrait cry'd out, <hi>My Daughter, my Daughter's come again! my</hi> Arabella <hi>alive!</hi> Ay, my dear offended Mother, with all the Duty and Penitence that Humanity is capable of, return'd the Lady <hi>Lovewell.</hi> Her Siſters then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt their Love in Tears, Embraces and

Kiſſes, while her dear Husband begg'd a Bleſſing of her Parents, who were very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſurpriz'd to know that their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo happily marry'd, and to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of ſuch an Eſtate and Quality as Sir <hi>Lucius</hi> ſeem'd to be: 'Twas late that Night e're they went to Bed at Sir <hi>Francis</hi>'s. The next day, after they had all pretty well eas'd themſelves of their Paſſions, Sir <hi>Francis</hi> told his Son-in-Law, that as he had three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo he had 3000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, and he wou'd divide it equally among 'em; but for Joy of the Recovery of his eldeſt Daughter, and her Fortunate Match with ſo worthy a Gentleman as Sir <hi>Lucius,</hi> who had given him an Account of his Eſtate and Quality, he promiſed him Ten Thouſand Pounds in ready Money beſides; whereas the other young Ladies were to have but Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand apeece, beſides their Dividend of the Eſtate. <hi>And now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Daughter, the Cauſe of your Retreat from us, old</hi> Sir Robert Richland <hi>has been dead theſe Three Months on ſuch a day.</hi> How, Sir, (cry'd ſhe) on ſuch a day! That was the very Day on which I was ſo happy as to be marry'd to my Dear Sir <hi>Lucius.</hi>

            <p>She then gave her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Siſters, a Relation of all that had happen'd to her ſince her Abſence from her Dear Parents, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pleaſed with the Account of
