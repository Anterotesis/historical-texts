            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is now about fourteen Years, I think, ſince two of my Neighbours being deſired by me to coard or geld a Ram for me, one of them, <hi>(Robert Hareby</hi> by Name) having Ground joining unto mine, finding a Ram (very much like mine) in his Paſture, caught him, (verily thinking he was mine) and brought him to my Yard, where my other Neighbour (Mr. <hi>John Lark</hi> by Name) did coard him, as I had formerly deſired him, and let him go, not doubting but he was mine, and they both knew my Sheep as well as my ſelf. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>This Account is teſtified under the Hands of</hi> John Hareby <hi>(Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſaid</hi> Robert Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by) <hi>Mr.</hi> Roger Lark, <hi>(Son to the ſaid Mr.</hi> John Lark) Tho.

            <p>But as ill Men deſire to abuſe the Innocent, ſo this Accident became a Reproach to me; and from gelding a Ram, they turn'd it to ſtealing a Ram. But my Neighbours knowing my

Innocency, did vindicate my Reputation, ſo that the Clamor ceaſed in thoſe parts where I then lived, <hi>[which was at</hi> Aſhby <hi>next</hi> Spilsby <hi>in the County of</hi> Lincoln] inſomuch that none but vile Perſons would ſo much as mention it.</p>
            <p>Now ſince I came to dwell in <hi>Norwich,</hi> there came a Seller of Wool under the Title of Mr. <hi>Toathby,</hi> (whom I could not ſee, though I went to his Inn as ſoon as I heard of him) and he was pleaſed to reproach me by this Accident, in the vileſt manner that might be, (as the Inn-keeper told me) and his Slander was very pleaſing to ſuch as delight in Falſhood, inſomuch as I found it needful to detect this lying Slander, by the Teſtimony of ſuch of my Neighbours at <hi>Aſhby</hi> aforeſaid, who are yet living, and who very well know the Circumſtances of this matter. What I wrote to them, with their Anſwers, I ſhall here commit to Poſterity, to detect the Wickedneſs of ſuch as have or hereafter ſhall attempt to abuſe me upon this occaſion.</p>

            <p>And ſeeing that Satan ſo violently rages againſt me, meerly becauſe I endeavour to ſerve God and this Generation in my Miniſtry, with all poſſible Fidelity, I doubt not but after my Deceaſe he will by ſuch baſe ways do what he can to deface my poor (though ſincere) Labours. I do therefore here, in the Fear of God, challenge all the World, whilſt I am yet alive, to bring a juſt Accuſation againſt me, if they can, in reſpect of my Converſation, from my Youth to this Day: For though I am a Man of Infirmities (as all are) yet by the Grace of God, I have been kept from all theſe things whereof I have by the Tongue of Infamy been ſo unworthily accuſed.</p>
