            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not pretend (as our <hi>Apologist</hi> doth) to have been forced into this Work, by the Authority of some great Man, tho' I may, with as much sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, averr, that I have no pleasure in this Eristick Exercise: Especially on a subject that bringeth with it a necessity of a Reflecting, and blaming of others, with whom I had rather live in peace and good correspondence; whatever different sentiments I may have from theirs, in some things. The necessity that Truth and Innocency shou'd be vindicated, and it not being done by them who could do it to more advantage, is that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth with me to undertake this unpleasant Task. Notwithstanding, If this Author had not engaged in some Theological debates occasioned by some passages in some of my former Books, it is like his abusive, and unjust Reproaches, against me and others, whom he is pleased to name, should not have brought me into this debate with him. As his squeamishness made my Book ly by him six Months, till he was over powered by commands to take it up and read it; so did his ly by me for some Months, through the throng of other Affairs, that I look on as of more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and necessity: The <hi>Apologist</hi> should have had great advantage against his Antagonist, if all these things with which he chargeth him were manifest from the Book he refuteth, or could be otherwise made appear: And if he himself had shuned these things that he doth, with such contempt, blame in others, but if neither of these can be observed (as I suppose will appear to the impartial Reader) he is like to have little credit by this his Essay.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. It is a wonder if this Author believeth all that he writteth of them that he setteth for his mark, and shooteth all the invenomed Arrows against, that his quiver can afford: And If he, mean while, used no Reflection, whereby to discover the very same errours in his own Book, which he so tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically exposeth in that he refuteth; But it is not rare to spy a Mote in our Brothers Eye; when there is a Beam in our own. It is an old Observation, <hi>ubi invidia &amp; odium in consilio sunt, caecum est ibi Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi> and the wise <hi>Seneca</hi> did well observe, <hi>plerique sunt diserti in convicium suum, quos si audias in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varitiam, in libidinem</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Perorantes, indicium sui putesprosessos, ita redundant in ipsos malidictain publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumemissa; quos non aliter intueri decet, quam medicos, quorum tituli remedia habent, pyxides venenum.</hi> If the <hi>Vanity, Partiality</hi> and <hi>Sophistry</hi> of this Title page, the <hi>Scarrility, ill Nature, Rudeness; Tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, Lying, uncharitableness,</hi> and such like qualities, that he liberally ascribeth to his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in many places of his Book, be found with his Antagonist, and not with himself; he hath whereof
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97831:3"/>
to boast; The Tryal of which will afterwards fall in, when he cometh to prove some of these benign As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions. He giveth just Grounds to think that the whole Book was written in a passion for P. 1. He telleth us, that 'every line of the Book that he refuteth provoked him to the undecencies of passion, and P. 2. that he did but once peruse it, with purpose <hi>not to read it any more.</hi> From which one may expect, by a natural consequence, indigested Notions, a partial Refutation, and but of some things here and there that he was most angry at, and where he thought the Attack was easiest, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Huffing, Angry Efforts of a commoved mind: Whether this effect do not appear in the strain of his Book, I shall not determine, let the Reader judge. If there be no farther degree of passion in his Lines then what amounteth to <hi>Indecency,</hi> and if there be nothing worse then idle words, (of which yet we must give an account) it will be the better for him. Surely a perpetual passion, or lasting Anger, on which the <hi>Sun goeth down,</hi> is no good temper for writting of Books. <hi>Impedit ira animum ne possit cernere verum.</hi> I pretend to no such prodigious parts, as to Answer his Book by Reading it once over, and whatever dislike I may have with not a few things in it, I shall consider them with out passion.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. His first head is, he will examine the general Apology, by which the <hi>Vindcator</hi> thinks to ward off the blame of the <hi>Barbarous Rablings</hi> of the Clergy, from his party: But me thinks he should have first made it appear that these <hi>Rablings</hi> were as <hi>Barbarous</hi> as his complices had represented them in their Pamphlets, Answered in the <hi>Second Vindication.</hi> For he knoweth, that some matters of fact by them alledged, are neither denied, nor defended, yet many of them are simply denied, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, others are shewed to have been, tho' not commendable nor innocent Actions, yet far short of what they are aggravated into by these Narraters, but he is resolved to suppose all to be certain and undeniable truth, and only prove that they are imputable to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in General; and about this is our present debate with him. We maintain that these practices were acted by a very few; and not approved by either the most, or the best part of the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. He is pleased to represent the <hi>Vindicators</hi> defence in this matter, as if he held that the <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronians</hi> were no <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; and yet they are Zealous Godly Men: And that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are clear in this, because these things were not acted by <hi>Sober Presbyterians,</hi> and that it is incumbent on them who blame the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to prove that the Actors in these disorders were Sober and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Men. <hi>A,</hi> It is easy to deform the best Face by an ill paint, and the best Cause by misrepresenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And our Author thinketh it convenient to use this Art to make his Refutation easy which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise might have proved hard for him: He should have shewed, where it was said that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronians</hi> are no <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> Or where it was hinted that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> or his complices, were obliged to prove them to be Sober and Intelligent: All that was said to this purpose was, that the <hi>Cameronians</hi> had gone out from the rest of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and had taken up some principles, and used practices, that the rest did not own, nor approve, and therefore if he should prove a thousand times, that the <hi>Cameronians</hi> are <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> he saith nothing to the purpose: unless he prove that they are all the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and that there are no <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> or no Body of Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Designation, who are not, in the things now under debate, of their way, which I hope he shall never evince. That I owned, they are Godly Men, is sophistically alledged: I doubt not but there are such among them; tho' I never thought what they differ in from the rest of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to be any part of their Godliness. But I never called them (yea nor any other party of Men) universally Godly. nor thought that all was well done, that is committed among a Body of Men where are many Godly: Yea nor that whatever is done by good Men is Good: Christs Disciples were good Men, yet their forsaking him and flying, was no Good Action. It is probable enough that some bad Men might creep in among these zealots, and might much influence these Disorders as the <hi>mixt multitude</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the <hi>Israelits</hi> to Murmuring in the Wilderness.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. But he will prove the <hi>Cameronians</hi> to be <hi>Presbyterians</hi>: a Conclusion which (in the sense given we deny not) let us hear his Arguments. 1. <hi>If they be not</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>to what Communion then do</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97831:3"/>
they belong? A. This is as if we should alledge that the <hi>Arminians</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal</hi> Party; and ask them who deny it, To <hi>what Communion do they belong:</hi> Surely neither to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> nor <hi>Independents, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore I answer directly, tho' in most things they agree with the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> yet in other things they are a Communion by themselves: And indeed till the Lord was pleased to abate the heat of that division that was among us, they had cast off <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Presbyterian Church,</hi> and would hear none of her Ministers, but cleaved to two or three of their own way. His second Argument is, <hi>have they any Principles, Discipline, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, different from the Presbyterian Church</hi>? A. For Discipline and Government, the <hi>Arminians</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have none different from the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church, and yet the <hi>Apologist</hi> and others might Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blame us if we should not distinguish between <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Episcopalians.</hi> For Principles, they had principles both with Respect to the Civil Government, and as to that Submission that is due to Church Governours, which other <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did never hold. And tho' this had not been; and if they had been Members of our Congregations, our Dislike of the practice, and having no accession to it, doth clear us from the blame of it, and all that can be inferred against us is, that some <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> have done ill things: And if he can instance in any party of Men, of whom the like cannot be said, we shall yield to his Argument: I hope he will not alledge it of his own party. His third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, <q>were not the leading men lately owned and received by the pretended General Assemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, without retracting any Articles of Doctrine, or disowning any of their practices that they so zealously recommended to their followers, in the West,</q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> (to say nothing of his Discretion in the Epithet <hi>Pretended</hi> that he bestoweth on the <hi>Assemblie,</hi> which the King and Parliament indicted and owned, as well as it was the representative of the Church of Scotland) It is true the three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters who had headed that party, were received upon promise of Submission to the Church, and orderly behaviour; which they have since faithfully performed; and by that means multitudes of the People that followed them are brought to more sober Courses, and do wait on the ordinances of God dispensed by the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers, which before they could not be perswaded to. And was it not wisdom in the <hi>Assemblie</hi> to so pite these Divisions by lenitie, rather than to exasperate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them, by putting men on formal retractation of what was done, seing the same thing was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially performed. Will any man (who is not fond of picking Quarrels) say, that by this Course the Assembly approved of what these men have done, or that all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are of the same senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that these men had been of? especially considering that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church hath received into Ministerial Communion, and admitted to a share of the Government of the Church, severals of them who had complyed with <hi>Episcopacy</hi> (and are ready to do the same by all good and useful men among them who will not endeavour the hurt of the setled Government) without puting them to express retracting of their former principles or practices, this considered. I hope the Reader will see, to how little, purpose his <hi>Simile</hi> is, brought from the imagined Apology of the several parties among the <hi>Donatists:</hi> For if one only of these parties he mentioneth were guilty of these Irregularities he speaketh of, there is no reason to blame the other factions in those things; whatever blame might be fixed on them all in these things wherein they agreed.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. What he asserteth page, 3. <hi>That the most intelligent among them (the Presbyterians) did contrive and manage the irregular Heats, and Motions of their own Partizans.</hi> (I suppose he means the <hi>Cameronians</hi>) This we deny, and shall consider the proofs of this assertion in its place. But before he cometh to this, he pretendeth to oppose the vanity of this Apology more closely: How he performeth what he promiseth <hi>tanto hiatu</hi>; let us now hear; he saith, that the knoweth no Opinions that <q>Mr. <hi>Cameron</hi> propagated which were peculiar to himself; He followed most closely, and ingenuously the Hypotheses of the old and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Presbyterians.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> We know that he and they who joyned with him, and they who succeeded to him, held that they owed no alledgeance to the King, because he had broken the Covenant: That they might not lawfully hear any of the Ministers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> because either they had received Indulgence from the King, or owned such as Ministers who had received it, or did not declare against them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97831:4"/>
Were these the Hypotheses of the Old and zealous <hi>Presbyterians</hi>? But whatever were his principles, his practice in making so wide a separation from all the other <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers in <hi>Scotland</hi> is a sufficient Apology for their Innocency, who neither were of his way, nor had any hand in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders that we now debate about, which were committed by that party which he had headed, while he was alive. Another effort of his more closs arguing is, <q>Mr. <hi>Cameron</hi> was not a proper Man to be the founder of a new Sect.</q> As if profound Learning, and deep policy, were alwayes necessary to mislead a few of the less intelligent People, especially when the severity of persecution had imbittered their Minds, both against the Rulers, and the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church, it was easy to set them oft from them: And from all that did not make the same Resentments with them, of what was then acted. I am yet unable to find out his close Reasoning, for what followeth is, <q>That the <hi>Episcopal</hi> party first called that party <hi>Cameronians,</hi> and by that name mean all <hi>Presbyterians</hi> whose zeal for their Faction over-drives them beyond all Discretion:</q> and this all along he imputeth to all <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and therefore he will allow no difference among <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> some will call this a loose Declaration rather than close Argumentation, for whatever names he is pleased to give to persons, or things, they who know any thing of our affairs do know, that all <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did not join with, nor allow the courses of Mr. <hi>Cameron,</hi> and his followers: It is of the same stampt that cometh next. <hi>viz.</hi> That <q>the <hi>Cameronians</hi> had better studied their Principles, and drawn more natural Conclusions from them than others:</q> This is barely and falsely asserted. Also that <q>the <hi>Cameronians</hi> did assert their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when others were silent:</q> This is also false, others did always, as they had opportunity, assert their Principles tho' not the same way that they were asserted by the <hi>Cameronians.</hi> this was done both in Field Meetings, and in other Meetings, such as then could be had. Tho' I confess the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> made it more their Business to inculcate upon Peoples minds the great truths of the Gospel, on which our Salvation dependeth, than what belongeth to Church Government.</p>
            <p n="7">§ 7. What further goeth with this Author, for his <q>close Reasoning is, to shew that what the <hi>Cameronians</hi> did was according to <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principles:</q> All that I can find for proof of this most absurd assertion, is that the people may (with their Pastors) Reform the Church <q>when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate is slack, or opposit to the designed Reformation, and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> hold <hi>Presbytry</hi> to be <hi>Juris Divini,</hi> and the removal of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Clergy was necessary for this Reformation.</q> 
               <hi>A.</hi> If he condemn all popular Reformations of the Church (as he here seemeth to do) he will not approve of many Reformations, either from Heathenism, or from Popery. But I will not digress to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate this, the soundness of this principle rightly understood is made evident by the Learned <hi>Claude, Historic. Defence of the Reformation P.</hi> 7 &amp;c. So that it is not to be lookt on as a principle peculiar to <hi>Scotch Presbyterians.</hi> The principle that they hold is, that every Man in his station, should endeavour the Reformation of the Church; that people may believe the Truth, and Worship God according to his institution, whether the Magistrat allow it or not: But if he will prove that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church did ever determine, that private persons, or Ministers, may, by force of Arms, carry on this Reformation, then shall we own the <hi>Rablings</hi> that he is pleading against: And unless he can make this appear, all his talk is beside the purpose. He boldly, but most falsely, asserteth in the end of P. 4. and P. 5, that the <hi>Rable</hi> had the best directions that could be had: And had exact Intelligence, by their Agents, what they might venture on. This was in the Pamphlets formerly refuted, asserted with the same confidence, and was denyed in the <hi>second Vindication</hi> and is still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: But it is below this high pretender to <hi>closs Reasoning,</hi> to take notice of that: or to bring any shadow of proof for it: But this, <q>the Rablings was not acted by the Parishoners of these Ministers who were Rabled; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was done by vertue of a League and Covenant among the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in general, or the chief Men of them.</q> The meanest in our Universities would be ashamed of such Logick; could not a few who had separated from the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> as well as from the <hi>Episcopalians,</hi> manage such an affair as this, without advice from Men of note, either in the state, or in the Church however this Authors tinctured fancy doth represent the <hi>Rabling</hi> to him, we see nothing in it which looketh like a Combination of the whole Society, (<hi>viz. Presbyterians</hi>) but rather, like the efforts of Passion, and Revenge: Or at least, an undiscreet zeal of a few Persons.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97831:4"/>
That <hi>some of the Gentrie of the West, were scared from opposing these Rablings,</hi> is like his other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove a Combination of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in this matter: Men of less understanding than this Author pretendeth to, may conjecture other Reasons for their forbearance; they saw the interest they had fallen in with sinking, and they had no heart to appear for it, either by defending their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters who had led them upon the Ice, or by being active in the Elections for the Convocation for setling the Nation, that then was in a Convulsion, but were glad to Lurk. His Charitable assertions of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (without exception or limitation) I shall not endeavour to refute: pitieing the Author who thus doth expose his Temper while he crieth out against others for their <hi>want of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that becometh the Gospel:</hi> They are, that <hi>they never forgive any Injury, and they never say the Lords Prayer, because it is so opposite to their Nature: It is impossible to oblidge them by favours, that the People of the West are generally Cunning, Avaritious, and Dissembling beyond measure.</hi> Of these and many such like Assertions sprinkled, as the flowers of Rhetorick, throughout his Book, I shall only use his own words (<hi>mutato nomine de te</hi> &amp;c <hi>p.</hi> 27 that such Assertions <hi>carrie with them all the marks by which a wilful and deliberate lie may be known from modest and ingenious truth,</hi> or our Author had <hi>Causam scientiae</hi> of the truth or falshood of these things. Let it also be considered, how agreeable these imputations are to that <hi>Charity and Gospel Spirit</hi> that he elsewhere talketh of.</p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. After he hath reasserted without farther (that is without any) proof, that the <hi>Maxims of our Moral Theologie do allow the greatest Villanies acted on the Clergy;</hi> he bringeth another Argument of the <hi>Rabblings being concerted by the Party,</hi> viz. <hi>Presbyterians:</hi> That <hi>some Presbyterians then at London contradicted the Reports that were sent thither concerning them</hi> As well they might deny many of them, tho I do not hear any denied all of them: He might know, that many of these sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which are printed, are not only denied, but disproved: And it is not like that the reports sent to <hi>London,</hi> were more universally true. What is Argumentative in his Paper, I am willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider; but am not concerned to answer what filleth up page sixth, and seventh, which is asserting the 5<hi>th,</hi> 6<hi>th,</hi> and 7<hi>th</hi> time, that <hi>what was done by these</hi> Rabbles <hi>was concerted by the Presbyterians.</hi> One good Argument would have convinced us more than such bold and repeated Affirmations. That the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> States men (and the Church and People also in their wishes) <hi>preferred Presbytery to union with England</hi>; is not to be wondered at by any, but them who think more of their civil Interests, than of what concerneth Religion. His out-cries against the Covenant and the Transactions of that time I do not regard, what was said more distinctly to that purpose in the <hi>Ten questions</hi> is answered, and he is not pleased to take farther notice of it, then to declame in the same strain of obloquie. His Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal note, <hi>p.</hi> 7. Insinuating that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do preach against the use of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> is Injurious: I have heard many in Sermons asserting the Lawfulness of using it, tho at the same time they deny the necessity of using it; or that it is commanded to use these words: But I never heard any Preach against the use of it.</p>
            <p n="9">§ 9. He bringeth <hi>p</hi> 8. an instance of a <hi>Presbyterian Rabble Misrepresented by the Vindicator,</hi> in which he insulteth, as if he had at one blow, not only routed the poor <hi>Vindicator,</hi> but the whole <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party (his big words are enough to fright an unwarry Reader) that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> doth by this passage <q>Flie in the Face of all Evidence, and contradict the Conviction of all the Inhabitants at <hi>Edinburgh:</hi>
               </q> And a little below, <hi>from this one single instance his Book is ruined, and his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity bested,</hi> &amp;c. And he telleth us of his Antagonist's <hi>shifting</hi> and <hi>confounding two very different Stories into one,</hi> viz. <hi>The tumultuous defacing of the Kings Chappel, and the burning of the Pope in Effigy.</hi> The former he says, <hi>was a horrible Tumult, the Latter an orderly Action.</hi> Let us now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the ground of this his Triumph, he citeth the words of the 2<hi>d.

If the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had feared such m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Also, it were the way to excite men to make a Massacre, as also to give some colour for Justifying it, thus to assault them who were living in peace. 3 That there was a Night spent in such confusions, or that there were such Screeching, and Terrour in the City, on this occasion, I cannot find by the best Information: Only such a fancy is Subservient to our Authors design; and it seems he can serve himself with truth or untruth, as need requireth. 4. That a report was spread that some were Killed, who were not Killed, is not denied, but that this Report was the contrivance of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to animate the People to rifle the King's House, is one of the grossest of Falsehoods: And that few of the Students of the Colledge were there is not true. 5. That this Tumult was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> he endeavoureth to prove, Because <hi>the Master of</hi> F. <hi>and several others whose Names he thinketh fit to conceal, were present.</hi> I know that many Men of good Note did appear, after the killing of the Boyes, and that by Authority <hi>Wallace</hi> was ordered to remove with his Guard: The acting of these Men was not concurring with the <hi>Rabble,</hi> the one acted without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the other with it; but that any such Persons either appeared with the <hi>Rabble,</hi> and without Command from Superior Powers, or had any hand in defacing any part of the Abbey, he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to prove. If he can either by confession of Party, or any probable Evidence, make it appear that G. <hi>S.</hi> or Mr. <hi>M,</hi> were the Contrivers of this Tumult; or that they glory in it (as he would have us believe) he shall have the better in this particular; but if there be no Truth in this (as indeed there is not) then the Reader may know who best deserveth to be thus branded, that <hi>the spirit of Lies and Vanity runneth through his Book.</hi> The Plea of an Advocate at the Tryal of Mr <hi>Wallace</hi> is a ridiculous Argument to prove what it is brought for; every Body knoweth, that in their Pleadings, they consider only what may make for the Cause which they are Patrons of.

And will he dare to say, that none were persecuted but they who taught these wild Principles? Wherefore it was not Zeal for the Peoples Souls, but a Spirit of Persecution, which prompted them to this Conduct. Yea, I have known, where Minister and People dayly went to hear the Parish Minister; only after both Sermons the Minister used to exercise in his own Family, and some Neighbours came to joyn with the Family, and for this he was persecuted; while they could charge him with no thing else, in Doctrine, or in Practice. His 3<hi>d.</hi> Argument is, <hi>they made Schisms,</hi> and therefore they must be persecuted. Who made the Schism, I have made elsewhere appear: And shall now only deny that the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> made it: They were forced to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he shall bring Arguments for his Assertion, they shall be considered.

For <hi>Boutefeues and Incendiaries,</hi> who labour to raise Sedition in the State, or do unpeaceably dissent from the Church, we plead for no Toleration to them: But were none else persecuted? Yea, I could make it appear in many Instances that several of the most peaceable Dissenters suffered most Obloquie, and much Persecution.

If any ever looked on the immoralities of the Clergy as a sufficient Argument against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and that it should therefore be overturned, tho (as he supposeth) it had continued since the dayes of the Apostles: I conclude such a Person to be no good Logician: yet I cannot shun to averre, that if it can be proved, that there are other good grounds for laying it aside, and withal, it do appear, that immorralities have much flourished under its wings, among the People and among the Clergie; this is a good commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Argument for its abolishment. If any of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have gathered stories against the Clergie, which they could not prove; let them bear their Blame: We dislike such practices, as much as he doth.

Here is little either Wit, or Honesty, or of that good Nature, that he chargeth his Antagonist with the want of. What Wisdom is it to say that we question the allowableness of an Act, when we are resolutely, and deliberately, and openly doing it? Is he not charging some <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers with the horridest of Crimes, and that in the basest manner without giving occasion to the Church to try them, or them to vindicate themselves, their Names being concealed: he can neither vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Honesty, nor good Nature in this matter, unless he name the Persons, and prove the things, and when he has done that, if they be not duly censured, let him reproach us at his pleasure. If I knew any such Persons among the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> I should have little peace in concealing their Faults. If he (which he asserteth) <hi>know not five of the Clergy of</hi> Scotland, <hi>who could not undergo the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Examinations:</hi> I hope he will not blame others because their knowledge is more extensive than his. Many more have been orderly convicted of Immoralities, and more are notoriously of a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: But I dislike this subject, as much as he pretendeth to do, and therefore leave it. We do not envy or derogate from any good that any of them have done, or designed to do; nor his <hi>Joy and Gloriation</hi> that he speaketh of in his Suffering: Only I cannot well reconcile this strain, with the rest of his Book.

            <p n="16">§. 16. Our Author bringeth us another Topick used <hi>to vindicate the</hi> Presbyterians: That <hi>the Clergy pressed the Consciences of the</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>and that the People could not own them as their Ministers, because they were obtruded on them, and not invited by Popular Elections:</hi> And for this he citeth <hi>p.</hi> 52. and 87. in neither of which places there is one word to that purpose: I have taken some pains to find that passage (for I believe it is some where in that Book, tho' may be not to the purpose that it is here brought for) but cannot find it: Not being at leasure to read every Line of the Book for the sake of this Citation. What I hold in this matter is, That it is the Peoples right to chuse their Pastors; and it is a grievance to have a Pastor set over them by the <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Patron,</hi> without their Consent: And that tho' it is their Wisdom, to consent <hi>a post facto,</hi> if the man be qualified; yet till they consent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, or implicitly, they are under no tye to own that Man as their Minister: However they may lawfully receive the Ordinances from him. Let us now hear what our <hi>Apologist</hi> hath to say on this Head. He first bringeth some <hi>argumenta ad hominem</hi>: As that <hi>Popular Elections could not be had for a</hi> Presbyterian <hi>in the North. A.</hi> This is not universally true: But where it is so, the Church will not obtrude a Pastor on that Flock, unless they neglect to chuse a person whom the <hi>Presbytry,</hi> on tryal, may find to be qualified; and this neglect continueth for the time appointed by the Law: And then the Election in all reason, as well as by the Law of the Nation, devolveth into the hands of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry.</hi> And when the <hi>Presbytry</hi> hath set a Man so over a People, such of them as will not own him as their Minister, I see not how he is obliged to own them as his Flock, further than to do what he can to perswade them to good and to restrain them from Sin. Next he tells us of <hi>many Remonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors inducted by</hi> Cromwell's <hi>Troopers. A.</hi> I never thought that a Pastoral Relation could be founded on such induction; where no consent of the People was, either antecedent, or consequent to it. He 3<hi>dly.</hi> mentioneth, That <hi>the same was done in the old Colledge of</hi> Aberdeen <hi>without regular and Collegiate Election, and without Tryal or Examination. A.</hi> It is a wise Argument from a Colledge to a Church: The Affairs of the one are to be regulated by the Laws of the Nation; the other by the Institution of Christ. In that Colledge by a Visitation, in a Legal and Orderly way, the Principal and Sub-Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, and two of the Regents were deposed: To supply the two Regents places, all who would offer themselves were invited by a Program to dispute; six or seven appeared; after several days disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, two of them were chosen (as having fairly won these places) by the Masters of the Colledge, with some who were by Publick Authority to assist them. The Principal and Sub-Principal did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Officiate till two years after, by the Authority of <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> (who then was owned as having the Supreme Authority <hi>de facto</hi>) A Visitation was appointed; and these two Places were found Vacant, and a Minister of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> was put into the Principal's place; and one of the two Regents
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97831:8"/>
who had entered as abovesaid, and had taught Philosophy two years, was made Sub-Principal: What is there in all this that can be blamed, further than that it was the general Calamity of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be under a Forreign Power, by whom all the places of the Nation were then disposed of, I know our Author would not have so impertinently digressed, but that he would have a fling at a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for whom he seemeth to have no kindness, and whose having a Room in a Colledge is an Eye-sore to him.</p>
            <p n="17">§ 17. Now the Author will <hi>no more trisle</hi> (as hitherto he hath indeed done) let us then hear his solid and serious Reasons. He giveth a long account of the way of Admission in the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church, against which I could object several things; but I shall only take notice of what is to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>an Edict is served, and the People allowed to object against the Candidate,</hi> whom the Patron hath chosen for them. Even this is often so done that it were as good it were not done; as when Mr. <hi>Mckenzie</hi>'s Edict to be Minister at <hi>Kirklistoun</hi> was served at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> about twenty six Miles distant. But supposing it were always duly managed, it doth not sufficiently answer the right that the People have to chuse their own Pastors. His Argument from disorders happening upon po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Election is fully answered, <hi>Rational defence of Nonconform, Part</hi> 5. §. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 207, 208. But it is like the Apologist cannot read such Books as that without the <hi>Indecency of Passion.</hi> Tho' he is pleased to bring a passage out of it, when he fancieth he can expose the Author by it. It is his way, here and elsewhere, to assert strongly, the conclusion, without taking notice of Reasons against it. That this, as all Christs Institutions, managed by sinful Men, may be abused, we deny not. Hath not Prelatical Power often degenerated into Tyranny; and yet I suppose he would not have it abrogated. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied (which he saith <hi>cannot be denied) That the methods of Election differed, often in divers Ages and Countries, since the first plantation of Christianity:</hi> Unless he understand this of the more degenerate Ages of the Church, after the eighth Century: Before that, it was uniform and constant, <hi>viz.</hi> It was done <hi>a clero &amp; populo</hi>; as it is abundantly proved in the Book cited, <hi>p.</hi> 201. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is also false, <hi>That no Christian Church came nearer the Apostolick Method than the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>under the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Constitution.</hi> For it is evident that in the Apostolick, and Primitive Church, there was no Election made by a Patron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Act of the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> depriving a disaffected Parish of the Power of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ection, maketh nothing for his design. For it is without question, that Peoples Rights and Church Priviledges, may for some Causes, be Suspended, by Authority of the Church: His account of the Election of <hi>Leith</hi> is most false. Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> had not one of the Legal Eldership for him, nor the Magistrates of <hi>Leith,</hi> who represent the Heritors; and a great body of the People did oppose him; with what Brow then, can our Author say, That <hi>this Election was unanimous.</hi> For <hi>Muslebrugh</hi> and <hi>Tranent,</hi> none hath, to this day, been Elected in a Legal way, that is, by the Heritors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. That Patronages were not taken away in <hi>Scotland</hi> till 1649; proveth no more, then that <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> think it not unlawful to own a Man who is not antecedently Elected by the People; and this was never denied by us: Only it was pleaded, that when the People had other objections against a Minister, this might fortify their aversion from him, that he had not entered in a due way. <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> did always think Elections by Patrons to be a great Grievance: Yet they bare it; till it could be removed by Law. The reason of his following discourse I cannot comprehend, <hi>viz.</hi> How it should come to pass that <hi>so many Artifices are needed to promote a Clergy Man, if Popular Election take place: And that it is otherwise, where the Patron chuseth.</hi> Nothing is more evidently false, then are both parts of this Assertion. For our way is, when a Parish is Vacant, the <hi>Presbytry</hi> sendeth two or three, or more, by turns, to preach among them; if the People desire to hear yet others; it is granted: And the People chuse whom they like best. Where doth the Artifice lie, that the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date can use, except it be to Preach better than another doth? On the other hand, all do know what Artifices to gain a Presentation from a Patron are commonly used: And how seldom it is seen, that a <hi>retired Clergy Man is forced out of his Solitude by the Patron</hi> (which our Author dreameth) Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal Compact: and other Solistations are far more frequent.</p>

Also let it be considered how wisely the <hi>Apologist</hi> compareth joyning in these form: with <hi>Subscribing the Confession of Faith?</hi> Surely this Gentleman must either have a low esteem of the Christian Faith contained in that <hi>Confession</hi> of it; or a superlative value for the use of Forms: For we have no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie with him about the matter that is under these forms of words. It is not true, that <hi>addressers to the General Assembly did plainly declare that they would Subscribe the Westminster Confession, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Fundamentals of the Protestant Religion.</hi> This is not truly represented nor is there advantage to his design in mentioning it. There was no mention in their <hi>Formula</hi> (and they would not when required, add on word for explaining it) of <hi>the fundamentals of the Protestant Religion.</hi> And if they had so far condescended, what security could such Subscription befor their Orthodoxic: For the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> are very few; and it is a controversie among Divines, what is their number: And sure if these men dislike any Article of the <hi>Confession</hi> they will alledge it is not fundamental: And indeed by such Subscription they are at liberty to believe, and Preach what they will. On this occasion he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clameth (with many words, but nothing of Argument) against the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; because they would be secure that they whom they receive, be not <hi>Arminians</hi>; as if the <hi>Arminian</hi> controversies were only abstruse, <hi>Metaphysical Notions</hi>; and would have these left as disputable points. But he might have known that the Apostle, by the direction of the unerring Spirit, thought sit to instruct the Church in these points: And is it a Crime in us if we endeavour to explain what he hath taught.

It is not for not teaching the People the School Notions in these matters that we blame some of his Clergy; but for teaching Errour, and that against the plain and positive Doctrine contained in Scripture, and in the Confession of Faith.</p>

owning and submitting to Kings who brake the Covenant, disowned it, and made the People abjure it. Such unlimited and unproved affirmations, are more fit to give a Character of the Author of them, than to refute his Antagonist. Another Assertion like this is <hi>p.</hi> 20. <hi>I know no notion that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians can have of a King, but that he should be Arch-bedle to the Kirk: And that he should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his power to execute their Decrees.</hi> And for this he citeth <hi>Sanquhair Declaration,</hi> and a saying of the <hi>Provest of Rutherglen:</hi> Which <hi>Presbyterians</hi> never owned. But do abhor such Principles: And therefore all that followeth in his Discourse on this Head falleth to the Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Clergy in the West having never met with any thing but acts of Hostility, without Law, Tryal, or Justice</hi> (an accusation against the present Government, which giveth a Specimen of the Author) <hi>they ought to continue in opposition to King</hi> William, <hi>by these Principles.</hi> Let them who own these Principles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, and consider the consequents of them. I do not remember where the <hi>Vindicator foundeth a Libel against the Clergy on account of the Doctrine of Non Resistance:</hi> Tho' this he is charged with <hi>p</hi> 20. and our Apologist is shy of telling his Opinion about it, <hi>p.</hi> 21. He well knoweth that this Point hath been debated <hi>hinc inde,</hi> and that not all the <hi>Episcopalians</hi> do stand for it. I am as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to enter the Lists on this Subject as he is, but am rather willing to observe that many who plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vehemently for it, have changed their Principle: Others have practised quite contrary to that Principle, and yet will maintain their old Opinion in defiance of Sense and Reason, sheltering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under some distinctions, and explications, that few Men can understand. Tho' our Author will not tell his Opinion directly; yet he doth it intelligibly enough: While he not only condemneth some late Insurrections (about which I will not Controvert with him) but telleth us of a <hi>Supreme Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal (which with us is King and Parliament) from which there is no Appeal, and which may not be resisted; by every one whose Caprice is not satisfied; running to Arms.</hi> I applaud his Wit not debating this question till he understand it better, and learn to fix <gap reason="foreign">

I will neither debate this, nor determine any thing in it, nor take notice what aspect the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, and present Settlement hath toward the determination of this question. I shall leave this head, after I have observed a pretty pleasant Argument this high pretender, and despiser of others, bringeth for his Opinion: <hi>Do not we see every day, such as opposed the Government any where, Fined, Confined, or Executed.</hi> If he had hence inferred, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no Government is willing to be resisted; the consequence could not have been denied: But the conclusion must be <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is unlawful to resist any Supreme Governour. Some will say it is pitiful Logick.</p>
            <p n="20">§. 20. Because he cannot find sufficient ground to blame his Adversary, he thinketh fit to use some Artifices to reach him. He <hi>p.</hi> 21. citeth the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> affirming, That <hi>the Authority of the Nation in the Convention, or Parliament, may take away the Legal Right that belongeth to the Clergy.</hi> But he leaveth out what might vindicate that Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That he expresly leaveth the decision of that question to Lawyers; and giveth no Opinion about it. Here the <hi>Apologist</hi> maketh a heavy complaint, of the Arbitrary Power acted by the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party, in what the Convention now did, and what the Covenanting Parliaments had done before. I shall here also determine nothing but leave it to Men Learned in the Law, to inform us whether the notion of acting Arbitrarily can agree to the Parliament, where the body of the People with the King are represented (none doubteth but they may act irrationally and wickedly) or if it be peculiar to Executors of the Law when they act not by Law, but take their own will for their Rule. He imputeth to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and to the Author of the <hi>Vindication</hi> p. 22. This Assertion That <hi>the kindness that any hath for Episcopacy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Episcopal Clergy their Indulging Men in their Sins and Immoralities.</hi> And for this he citeth <hi>p.</hi> 76. and <hi>p.</hi> 166. In the former of the two places there is not one word to this purpose: In the other, all that is said is, reproving his <hi>Antagonist</hi> for saying that <hi>Presbyterians were dreaded as the plague of Mankind.</hi> The <hi>Vindicator</hi> replyeth, That <hi>they are not so looked on by any but a debauched Crew, whom his Faction indulged in their Immoralities; to which Presbyterian Discipline is a Terrour.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97831:9"/>
Now let the Reader judge whether this Author dealeth fairly? Is this Assertion so universal as he maketh it? Is it said, or hinted at, that none have respect to <hi>Episcopacy</hi> on other accounts, tho' I am perswaded that not a few like it on that account, yet I never thought nor said, that all who are for <hi>Episcopacy</hi> are of that Stamp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know some of them, Ministers and others, who hate Immoralities. But let us hear his Refutation of this Assertion. What we first meet with is; <hi>this is Spight and Malice: They are Sons of Strife who say so, it is Impudence, it is a senseless Accusation</hi>: Who can stand before such Arguments: The force they have is to shew the Man's Spirit who useth them. I only take notice, that he calleth the Accusation also <hi>indefinite</hi>: Which is most injurious; it is limited to the profane Persons among the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party. He cometh next to run down this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion; by this tuant Reason. <hi>The Episcopal Church hath taught no Doctrine that hath any tendency to breaking any of Gods Commandments.</hi> As if no Church could be negligent in the exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, unless it be also her Doctrine, that Discipline should be neglected. He hath Supeciliously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted over the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> when nothing so ridiculous or contemptible was said. For another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he falleth with a great deal of scorn and bitterness, on the Discipline exercised in the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Church against Whoredom. He hath two quarrels against it; the former, <hi>Bringing Whores to receive a publick Rebuke, causeth the murthering of many Bastards</hi>; the other is, <hi>Three Women can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be named who ever mounted the Publick stool of Repentance but they became Prostitutes, their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick appearance rendering them Impudent.</hi> Can any think that such Stuff needeth an Answer? That <hi>they that sin</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> openly and scandalously) <hi>should be rebuked before all,</hi> is the express Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, by his Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. <hi>id est, palam &amp; in publico caetu, graviter &amp; severe, increpa,</hi> saith <hi>Estius,</hi> and he was no <hi>Presbyterian</hi>: It is true, he saith, it is likely the Apostle had an eye at the faults of Elders; but he addeth, <hi>Idem tamen faciendum cum aliis.</hi> It is a shame for this Author to speak against the strictness of Discipline against publick Scandals, which even <hi>Papists</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, when they consider things without the prejudice of the practice of their Church. Yea, <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Admonebantur criminosi a senioribus astante &amp; audiente plebe, magno cum pondere.</hi> If this publick Rebuke be given, we are not fond whether the Person be on the <hi>Stool of Repentance</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, in the Church, tho' we think it (as our Ancestors did) a convenient place, where the person may be seen and heard by all; as the Minister is in the Pulpit. It is strange that this Author should speak against pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ick Rebuking of Offenders; for it was ever the practice of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; even under <hi>Prelacy</hi>; and under the late <hi>Prelacy</hi>; tho' it was not so frequently used as there was need for it: But he is now in <hi>England,</hi> and it seems thinketh himself obliged to rail at all that is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>English</hi> way. That Womens murthering their Bastards is the effect of this Discipline, is a strange Assertion, and an effort of a confidence not to be reguarded: It may enervate that wild con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is pleased to reproach us for too strict observation of the Lord's Day: When he complaineth, that the People are not allowed to have fresh Water. This is false; the prohibition at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> is, that none, on that day, bring Water from the Wells in greater quantity then a Scotch Pint; which is supposed to be, ordinarily, enough for drinking, or for the necessities of the Sick: In any extraordinary case, they may have what they need: But for other uses in Families it is thought as much may be provided on <hi>Saturday</hi> night as may serve for the Sabbath. This is especially necessary in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where all that populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is served by a few Wells, to which great Crowds resort, and often make disturbance, by striving who should be first served, which might occasion much profanation of that Holy Day. His ill words against this Discipline, I overlook, intending only to defend our way against what may look like Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. After all this, our Author hath the Brow, to wish <hi>that the ancient Discipline of the Church
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97831:10"/>
were revived.</hi> I would gladly learn of him, what that Discipline is, which is not either the same with ours, or is not a great deal more strict and severe.</p>
            <p n="21">§. 21. Thus our <hi>Apologist</hi> hath finished his Defence of the Clergy: With what Success, let tho Reader judge: And let it be considered, whither the things that he laboureth to excuse, or justifie, were ever charged upon the Clergy; but only on the Pamphleteers refuted in that Book which he opposeth: Or on some particular Persons among the Clergy; and if it be found that no such charge is laid against the Clergy; let every one judge, whether he hath not hitherto been fighting with a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. His next work (which beginneth <hi>p.</hi> 26. and filleth up the greatest part of his Book) is to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his Antagonist, and Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>; against whom he seemeth to have a particular indignation (it is not hard to guess at the Cause of it) which design he manageth by some very unmanly Methods; to say no worse. Such silly Artifices should be utterly despised, if a matter of more importance were not struck at then the credit of either of them. They are known (and so is this Author) in <hi>Scotland</hi>: And every one will judge (some as they know, others as they affect) let him say what he pleaseth: The first thing that he thinketh fit to charge his Adversary with, is <hi>Partiality.</hi> In his attempt to make this appear, he hath a kind of Apology for what he is about to say; which I cannot well reconcile with what followeth; it looketh so like <hi>protestatio contraria facto</hi>: He <hi>will not conclude him habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually such as he representeth him to be,</hi> but ascribeth his Book to <hi>Paroxisms of Passion.</hi> Here is a high pretence to charitable Judging; some would think that so many acts as must be in composing a Book of so many Sheets, if they did not flow from a previous habit, might at least produce one: But let him call me whether actually, or habitually passionate, as best pleaseth him, if he can make the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxisms that he talketh of appear, I shall take with blame: But I hope he will, mean while, allow indifferent Readers a liberty of judging of the temper of that mans mind, in writing a Refutation of a Book who could not read it without being <hi>provoked to the indecencies of Passion by every line of it</hi>; as he saith himself <hi>p.</hi> 1. The <hi>expressions</hi> that he taxeth as <hi>unmannerly,</hi> are only so, when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly applyed. I suppose there are none in the World of whom every one of them may be said: If he will prove any of these to be imputed directly, or indirectly to his Party (as he often layeth heavier charges to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> without exception) or to any person, or more, without cause; when he shall point to the place of my Book where it is done, if I cannot shew that he mistaketh, let him censure at his pleasure; but it is his way (here and elsewhere) to pick up some words, here and there, which he thinketh found harshly, and from these to expose his Adversary, without taking notice where, or on what occasion, or against whom, such expressions were used: Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch is an easie way to make any Man black enough; if it be a fair way, if not, it is enough to make himself so. <hi>The absurdity of venting Passion in Personal Reflections,</hi> he doth justly blame: But doth pitifully lay it off himself, when he telleth us of his <hi>fixing nothing on his</hi> (the <hi>Vindicators</hi>) <hi>person; but what naturally followeth from his own words, or deeds, or some ground given by themselves.</hi> Such Reflections are then blameworthy when they are either groundless, or needless; by which let the Reader judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, or I, be more guilty of <hi>venting Passion in personal Reflections.</hi> But I have staid too long on this preliminary.</p>
            <p n="22">§ 22. He proveth the <hi>Vindicator's Partiality,</hi> from his <hi>rejecting the Testimony of such as are not of his Party.</hi> This is false: His proof is, <hi>The Testimony of a Baily in</hi> Glasgow <hi>is rejected because he was chosen by the Archbishop.</hi> It is evident <hi>p.</hi> 94. (which he citeth) that the story it self is disproved as false, whence it will follow that no Witnesses should be believed in asserting of it: And it is but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that the Baily, and some others there named, were the less to be regarded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Men who had shewed much ill will against the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> If we reject any Episcopal person relating matter of Fact that is probable, and not <hi>aliunde</hi> found to be false, only because of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Opinion about our present differences; let us then bear the blame of <hi>Partiality.</hi> The same is answered to what he citeth out of <hi>p.</hi> 85.100. &amp; 109 his <hi>great and exact Historians</hi> Testimony is not rejected; but his accounts are disproved, and his Vouchers found to be insufficient; as the best of Men might be when he is found to assert a Falsehood. What he alledgeth concerning the Writer of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97831:10"/>
the first Letter, refuted by the <hi>Vindicator</hi> (who he saith is Mr. <hi>Morer</hi>) is far remote from truth; the falsehood of that Authors Histories is asserted, and made evident; but it is no where said, nor hinted, that he was not to be believed because a <hi>Jacobite.</hi> I shall not contradict the <hi>Apologists</hi> account of his Loyalty to King <hi>William</hi> (tho' some are such Infidels as not to believe the conclusion, though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises were true) but I judged of the Man by his Book: And I know not what any Man, on such a subject, could have said more against King <hi>William</hi>'s interest. That <hi>all the accounts be</hi> (the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>) <hi>had from the West, in defence of the Enemies of the Episcopal Clergy, are thus overthrown with one dash of his Pen,</hi> Is a wide mistake: For these accounts were not from any of the <hi>Rabblers</hi> of the Clergy; but from such as he can make no rational exception against; either for their Morality in their Conversation, or for their concern in that matter: That <hi>they</hi> (the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) <hi>are obliged by their Oaths to ruin Episcopacy,</hi> would indeed be to his purpose, if he could make it appear, that the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> or any other Oath, doth bind us to tell lies, or use any means, good or bad, toward that end: But if that be false (as all do know) let it be considered, what Morality, or Argumentative Skill, the Man is Master of, who doth so boldly affirm this, and maketh such inference from it.</p>
            <p n="23">§. 23. Another thing whereby he endeavoureth to vilifie his Adversary (for that is the professed scope of this part of the <hi>Apology</hi>) is, <hi>he is for the divine right of Presbytry.</hi> If he, or any of his party, could disprove this Opinion (which I have not yet seen, nor expect to see) yet I think few, except this Author, will think this sufficient to render a man contemptible: Many with whom the <hi>Vindicator</hi> will not compare, and to whom I think the <hi>Apologist</hi> is not equal, are of the same Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And have strenuously maintained it; and if it be so ridiculous to assert the <hi>Divine Right of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytry,</hi> what is it, to write and think so of <hi>Episcopacy</hi>? as the <hi>Apologist</hi> doth <hi>p.</hi> 23. where he calleth it <hi>the Apostolical Government</hi>: if it be Apostolical it must be Divine; for the Apostles were guided by a Divine, and infallible Spirit.

I hope he looketh on these two qualities as distinct: And is obliged to prove them both; whereas I find nothing that looketh like an attempt to prove the latter. But it will not be difficult to retort it on himself, by any who considereth the Supercilious strain of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and his contempt of his Adversary: For the former, his proof is, <hi>The Vindicator representeth his Adversary as a Liar, and Villain: Tho' he cannot prove that the Author of the History of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly wrote one Lie: If his Informations were not exact, he is not to blame: But it cannot be proved that any information he got was false. A.</hi> He should have shewed where he was represented as a Villain, for I do not remember it, and no place is cited, unless he take a Liar and a Villain for the same. It is a pleasant Vindication from being <hi>his Information was not exact:</hi> Our Author here would shew his Critical Skill; but do we not in ordinary Speech call gross Falsehoods, Lies, not considering the knowledge or intent of the Speaker; And all that was said was, that the things wrote were Lies.

What is said of the Councils leaving the Case of the Clergy to the determination of the Parliament, is strangely improved, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is the <hi>Vindicator's Doctrine, that the Council may stop, and dissolve the Laws.</hi> He would think it Vanity indeed, If I should impute the making of such an inference to his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the due way of Arguing; wherefore I leave the Reader to ascribe it to what he thinketh most probable: Only I may adventure to say, it is absurd to infer the approbation of a Fact, or the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Legal Power for doing that Act, from a bare Narrating that such an Act was done: Which is all that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> can be Charged with, about that deed of the Council.</p>

And he telleth us what I (nor I think none else) never knew, That <hi>the Party had determined to break through all Obstacles of Justice and Decency rather than suffer any of the Episcopal Clergy, or any who had made any advances of complyance, to continue in</hi> Edinburgh: And proveth this by the case of Mr. <hi>Willkie.</hi> This Diviner (by a kind of <hi>scientia media</hi>) can tell not only what hath been, and what should be, but what will be in <hi>futuris contingentibus, &amp; conditionatis:</hi> Yea, he taketh upon him to tell of some resolutions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that never were so much as moved, or determined, in any Church Assembly. The instance he bringeth doth overturn and falsifie all that he here saith: For Mr. <hi>Willkie,</hi> who once complyed, is to this day preaching in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> hath a publick Church, and a Congregation in it, is received by the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church to a share of the Government; and sitteth constantly in the <hi>Presbytry,</hi> and other Meetings.

What then must we think of this Author, who not only affirmeth what every one knoweth to be false in matter of Fact, but magisterially determineth contrary to manifest and known Truth, about Mens purposes and inclinations: He would do well to be more sparing of his Censures, lest they recoil on himself.</p>

He will have this to be no less than <hi>a willful and deliberate Lye</hi>; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his usual Modesty, and Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He seemeth to suppose that the <hi>Vindicator</hi> will have them believe that the number was just so many and not one more or fewer: Otherwise his questions <hi>who saw them Mustered, and where</hi>? were impertinent; which were a Crime to surmise of one who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down from such a height on other Mortals, as this Soring Author doth. I was not in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> nor in the Nation when this was acted, but had information from persons of as good Intelligence, and as much Veracity as any in the Nation: And not only (what he denieth) but 50 or 60 in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> will affirm; that there were then gathered together at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and about it, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of King <hi>James</hi>'s disbanded Forces, which by a modest and rational estimate, might be reckoned to two thousand: And there was as great evidence as the thing was capable of, that <hi>Dundee,</hi> and others were upon a design to employ them against the <hi>Convention,</hi> and this was the ground of that prudent Care that was used, to call in some from the West, to guard the <hi>Convention</hi>: All this our Author laboureth not to disprove only, but to ridicule (beside the Topicks above mentioned) by others, as weighty. <hi>Is it like</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi> Dundee, <hi>at the head of two thousand, could be forced to retire from</hi> Edinburgh. <hi>A.</hi> He was no other way forced than that his designs were disappointed: And he thought he could effect them better in the <hi>Highlands</hi>: Whether he straight went; and gathered a greater Force than these two thousand: Many of whom it is like followed him thither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again, <hi>when he went from</hi> Edinburgh <hi>he had not above thirty or fourty to attend his person.

The <hi>Vindicator</hi> might not give a check to Mr. <hi>Morer</hi>'s confidence of the event of the <hi>High-land</hi> War, if <hi>Dundee</hi> had lived; but the <hi>Apologist</hi> must have a harangue on this, as if we judged all the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Men to be <hi>Atheists.</hi> We disown such a consequence. What he farther chargeth me with, about Dr. <hi>Canaries,</hi> is fully answered in a Letter to the Doctor, in answer to one that he had written to a Person, whom he supposeth to be the Author of the <hi>Vindication.</hi> It is there shewed that the <hi>Doctor</hi> gave advice, that they should apply to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church; that it was evident to all, that their Application was on terms that they could not once dream could be satisfying: And this is called <hi>Feigned Obedience</hi>; which words are put in <hi>Italick</hi> Letters, as being a noted Word in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and contained the substance of what was to be expressed. The <hi>Apologist,</hi> I perceive, hath seen this answer to the Doctor's Letter; and yet is not pleased to answer what was brought to prove, that the whole of this Address was a Sham; and the obedience that they gave was <hi>Feigned Obedience.</hi> Some fancy they may triumph over their Adversaries, if they can discourse a little on a word or two of what is said while they leave the substance untouched.</p>

A.</hi> Where is this insinuated? Here is mention made indeed, of that struggle: But is it any where hinted that he debateth against the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party? Is it not rather evident from the whole strain of the Book, that it is some Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Party, that had filled their Pamphlets with Lies and Railing, that many Sober Men of their own side are ashamed of: And it is shewed, in the same place, that he citeth, §. 6. of the Preface; how consistent the sharpness that sometimes he useth is with that Brotherly respect that is due to such unfair Dealers: Our Lord did not disown <hi>Peter,</hi> tho' he called him <hi>Satan</hi> to reprove his Errour: Yea, we may treat even them as Brethren, who are justly Excommunicated by the Church. Another inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency is, <hi>He is acquainted with but few of the Matters of Fact: Yet he taketh not things on hear say, or common talk.</hi> This is pure trifling: Where one hath a Matter of Fact on the Testimony of two or three Persons of known Veracity; and, may be, witnessed upon Oath, before a Judge: Is not here a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> between Personal Knowledge, and Common Talk: Wherefore there is here no <hi>Inconsistency,</hi> nor Contradiction, which any one can imagine; except such a one as the Authors of the <hi>Scotch Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Eloquence</hi>; who objecteth the same. That <hi>the Materials of the Vindication are but the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of them who were the Actors, or Abettors of the Western Villanies</hi> (the civil word that this severe

The story about Mr. <hi>George Henry</hi> was not built on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk only; but on the Testimony of one who pretended personal knowledge, and if it were a mistake, it can no way disparage the other Historical Passages, because it tended no way to reflect on Mr. <hi>Henry,</hi> but rather to vindicate him, and no stres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Another mighty Inconsistency; <hi>He telleth us they do not look on King</hi> William <hi>as an Idolater, and yet some Preach that the Church of</hi> England <hi>is Idolatrous</hi>: It is pity to trouble the Reader with such stuff, but some Mens mouths must be stopped. Here is no Inconsistency, unless he could shew that either the Author hath said both these: Or that all <hi>Presbyterians</hi> hold them both. If farther answer to this were needed, it should be brought. Lastly, <hi>He will not allow that the Clergy who addressed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission had any wit</hi> (I know not where that is said or hinted; tho' I am sure they did not act wisely, in that matter) <hi>and yet their Contrivances were founded on deep Consults.</hi> I will not impute to this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author that ignorance of a Contradiction, that some will gather from this passage. May not some who have much wit, be far from using it, in some cases? Again, may not Men who have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wit, have what they are to act concerted for them, by them who have more wit? We know also that all deep Consults are not wise Consults.

I shall say nothing in answer to the civil words he frankly bestoweth on him; such as <hi>Proud and Supercilious, p.</hi> 33. <hi>Nothing so palpably ignorant and foolish,</hi> ibid. <hi>Resenteth the least contradiction to his Nonsence, with Bitterness and Indignation.

I neither incline to resent these, nor may safely do it, considering in what a fit of Passion (above <hi>Indecency</hi>) it put him, when a very modest <hi>Apology</hi> was made against some such Defamations before; and that not against one Man, but against all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>: That (p. 31. ad finem) <hi>a Presbyterian had rather be accused of Adultery, Sodomy, or Incest, than to be thought Ignorant:</hi> If these be the words of Truth or Soberness, the Reader will judge. I shall also say but little of the things that he chargeth my Friend with: Nor will I trouble the Reader with a <hi>Vindication</hi> of him, or of my self; farther than the interest of Truth doth acquire. The first thing he quarrelleth (as also his Friend the Author of the <hi>History of the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> had done) is, That <hi>Rational Defence of Nonformity,</hi> p. 164. he had expounded a passage of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> contrary to the Sense that commonly it is taken in: And this he insulteth upon, as a <hi>sign of the most unparalelled Ignorance.</hi> But as wise as he will think (even supposing it to be a mistake and that it cannot be defended) that it is consistent with more Learning than ever Mr <hi>Rule</hi> pretended to, or than our <hi>Apologist</hi> is Master of. Some Learned men have had odd apprehensions of some things, and which easily might be refuted. <hi>Grotius</hi> the wonder of his Age for Learning and for Critical Skill in particular, yet will have <gap reason="foreign">

Again, if Mr.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97831:13"/>
               <hi>Rule</hi> were answering for himself, it is like he would say, that, Veneration for this Learned Father, did drive him into that untrodden path; who cannot otherwise be defended from contradicting, by that expression, the whole of that Epistle, in which it is found: For if <hi>Ordination of Presbyters</hi> be not in the power of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but only of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as the sentence now in debate doth plainly import if it be expounded in the ordinary way: This destroyeth the Identity of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>: Which he had been largely, and of purpose proving: Or we must say (which is also mentioned in the place cited) that <hi>Jerome</hi> wrote sometimes his own Opinion, and sometimes that of others: and that so intermixed, as that it is hard for the Reader to discern them, as himself confesseth in a passage there also cited: And if he use such Liberty in matters of Opinion, why not, in taking the same word in divers significations? And it is certain, that not only all <hi>Lexicographers</hi> give the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of <hi>ordinare</hi>; but in the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">

The Reasoning by which he maketh Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s Exposition to be inferred is ridiculous enough: But it is none of his, but the <hi>Apologist</hi>'s own. From what is said, all the instances of the use of that word for <hi>potestative mission,</hi> appear to be inconcludent; for they only prove that that is the more usual signification of it: Which none deny: And the Ridiculous Sense that he putteth on this place of <hi>Jerome,</hi> from the use of the Word elsewhere, is Inconsequential: For the Sense given may, and doth, quadrat here, tho' it do not in some other places. Ye may either take <hi>Jerome</hi>'s word <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> in the more <hi>Grammatical,</hi> and proper, tho' less usual Sense; and make the passage Congruous to the whole of his discourse, in which it is: Or in the more frequent, but less proper Sense, and look on this Sentence as none of his own, but what others said, and he had set down in his <hi>Adversaria</hi>: And so it cannot derogate from his Opinion about <hi>Bishops,</hi> expressed in that Epistle.

            <p n="30">§. 30. He lasheth the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> very severely, with all Rods that his Invention, and the help of <hi>Latin</hi> Authors that he had read, can afford, because when his Adversary complained of the Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Colledges by the late Change, and of the Insufficiency of them who were put in the room of such as were Ejected; he very modestly denied that they had any thing to brag of; did appeal to the esteem of Impartial Men; and to the <hi>Indicia</hi> of Learning any had given, this is wound up to the high degree of <hi>Thrasonical Boasting</hi>: As if his Party were Modest and Humble Men, when they Monopolize all Learning to themselves, and would make the World believe that it will dye with them: But <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are proud if they Mutter; and do not tamely assent when they are trampled on with the greatest Insolency. I doubt not but the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Enemies said the same of him, when he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Zeal, and Diligence: nor that <hi>Job</hi>'s angry Friends did the like, when he pleaded for his Wisdom, and Understanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He should also have considered that there was no Comparison made of any one Man with another, but of one Party with another; and that he cannot fix Self Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on any Man (so that his Citations to that purpose are wholly impertinent) but one Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending those of his way. And I am still confident to say (let him make what use of it he will) that tho' the Person he sheweth his great displeasure against, were as insignificant as he imagineth; yet the rest who enjoy Places in Universities in <hi>Scotland</hi> need not be ashamed of their Sufficiencies, whether considered with respect to their Work, or with comparison to their immediate Predecessours. His three Instances of Mr. <hi>Rule</hi>'s speaking false <hi>Latine,</hi> as himself calleth them Impertinencies <hi>p.</hi> 36. so do I judge them: If they were all true they are nothing to the determination of the debate between the two Parties of the Church, now in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and tho' he doth not think himself above a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of such escapes; and hath heard some who pretend to more Volubility in the <hi>Latine,</hi> and in the <hi>English</hi> too, and value themselves upon it, lapse into as sensible blunders (for <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) yet he doth positively deny that, to his knowledge, or what he hath ever heard from any Person, there is truth in any one of these Instances; and that this <hi>Apology</hi> gave him the first
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97831:14"/>
notice of them. Beside, it is evident that the <hi>Apologist</hi>'s Eye and Ear Witnesses have misinformed him, as to the first Instance. For he having had Praelections, for some time, <hi>de Idololatria</hi>; hath insisted on the Idolatry of the Heathen, of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church in her degenerate times, and of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Only the Contriver of the Story was pleased thus to circumstantiate it. For the other two Instances, our <hi>Apologist</hi> sheweth as little Skill in Critical Learning as he thinketh others to have in speaking of <hi>Latine</hi>: (tho' he could not forbear the pedantry of trying it, by a sought occasion) For if he consult his <hi>Lexicons</hi> he will find that <hi>Requiro</hi> doth signify to require, or demand: Whatever it signify beside, tho' I deny not, but he who is accused might, and I am perswaded did, express the thing in other terms more common than this. His Criticism on the third Instance is also Childish; For <hi>Statum Regni,</hi> signifieth the state and condition of the Nation; or the present constitution, or settlement of it. And can no ways be put for <hi>Ordines Regni:</hi> But that our Author, or his Informers, knew the Speaker's mind, that he so intended it, as they would have it: But of this too much. He mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also the same Author asserting a <hi>docretum praeteritum &amp; praedamnatum,</hi> which I confess, were it truly chargeable upon him, he ought to be ridiculed for Nonsence; and censured for Blasphemy: But because our Author, fond of this occasion of triumph over his Adversary, insisteth again, and more fully on this <hi>p.</hi> 51.52.

He concludeth this part of his Book, with the same Charity and Civility that hath often been observed in it, <hi>viz.</hi> He (the <hi>Vindicator</hi>) <hi>is so deeply tinctured with the sullenness of his Faction, that he'll rather question whether the Body of the Sun be Luminous, than admit the least scruple concerning the Divine Right of Presbytry.</hi> I have no answer to such talk, but leave it to the Reader to judge whether this be Disputing or Railing.</p>
            <p n="32">§. 32. The next thing that the <hi>Apologist</hi> thinketh fit to take notice of is, the <hi>Theological Reasonings</hi> that he findeth, here and there, in the <hi>Vindication,</hi> not insisted on but occasionally touched: And that as occasion was given by the Adversaries. If he had pleased to argue closely and fairly on these heads, I should like better to enter the Lists with him, on such subjects, than on what he hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to led me into. The <hi>venemous Squibs</hi> that he blameth me for, I should have examined whether they deserve that name; and have craved pardon for them if they indeed were such: But neither of these I can do; for he hath neither told us what they are, nor where to be found. The first Controversie that he engageth in, is about the <hi>observation of Christmass, p.</hi> 39. on which he discourseth to <hi>p.</hi> 41<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The most difficult part of my task in answering him, is to pick out of his long Harangue, what hath any shew of Argument: For I have seldome read so many words, on a controverted point of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in which there was less of Argument, and the Reasons that are hinted, are so confusedly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larded with what is little to the purpose; and so distinct one from another, and there are so many little digressions, and some of them false History, that it is not easie to follow him: But I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to overlook nothing that hath any seeming weight against what we hold. I had denied, that the <hi>Court of Heaven celebrated the Anniversary of Christs Nativity.</hi> This he ridiculeth: Because <hi>the Angels</hi> (Luke 2.23.) <hi>Celebrated the Nativity of Christ, and the Church, in imitation of them, do yearly Celebrate it. A.</hi> The question is not, whether we ought to thank God for the birth of Christ, as the Angels did: But whether a day should be separated from the rest of the days in the year: And made Holy by Men, when God hath made no day Holy but one in a week, which the Angels did not do. Another strong Argument he hath is, <hi>Might not the Church take care that this glorious mystery should never be forgotten. A.</hi> No doubt but she might, and should: And the Lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a way how this should be done; while the History of this Glorious mystery is written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which the Lord hath appointed to be read, and explained, and applyed, by his Ministers to the end of the World: But hath not injoyned it to be done by observing a Holy day for it: The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not about the Commemoration of it, but whether this Commemoration should be by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, or by an Appointment of Men? We know that Christ hath appointed his death to be Commemorated; and therefore we Celebrate his Holy Supper for that end; because he hath institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97831:15"/>
it: But we do not keep <hi>Good-Friday</hi> in remembrance of Christs death, because he hath not injoyned it. <hi>Dies Christo dicatos tollendos existimo. Judicoque</hi> (saith <hi>Danaeus</hi>) <hi>quotidie nobis, in Evangelii praedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, nascitur, circumciditur, moritar, resurgit Christus.</hi> Another Argument, or what he pleaseth to call it, is, <hi>Could the Christian Church take more effectual methods to preserve the memory of it than by this Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Festival. A.</hi> Yes, <hi>viz.</hi> By reading and hearing the word: For I am of opinion (and must be so till I see stronger Reasons than any here produced) that Christs Institutions are <hi>more effectual methods</hi> toward attaining what they are appointed for, then mens devices can be. His next Argument is from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> of this usage: And indeed herein lyeth the strength of his Cause, such as it is: And therefore we have this over and over again; his Pages are full of <hi>the Universal Church, the practice of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c. I have not met with an Author who useth to hard words (both for the confidence and for the bitterness of them) and so soft Arguments; but seing his Weapons are so blunt, he doth well to put to <hi>the more strength. If the Church</hi> (saith he) <hi>did not use it from the days of the Apostles we desire to know when it began<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A.</hi> This is <hi>iniquum postulatum</hi>: Nor are we obliged to pitch on the precise time of its beginning: Both because of the obscurity and defectiveness of the History of the first Ages of the Church; and because most of these Superstitions had no solemn, or observable beginning, to be universally used; but crept in by degrees: Being first used by some Churches and after by more: And being first an Embrio, and in process of time, lickt into the form that they now have. Again, we can prove, by the silence, both of Scripture, and of other Church History, that this Festivity was not used for three hundred years after Christ, and a notable confirmation of this Argument may be taken from the notice that is taken of <hi>Easter</hi> in these times; and not a word of <hi>Christmass.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was, because many of the Christians were very tenacious of the old <hi>Jewish</hi> Customs (one of which the observation of <hi>Easter</hi> was) but had not then begun to devise new Holy days of their own. <hi>Cent.

Polit. lib.</hi> 5. § 69. <hi>Christs extraordinary works</hi> (saith he) <hi>have san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified some times, and advanced them, so that they ought to be, with all Men that honour God, more holy then other times.</hi> And afterward, <hi>as Christs extraordinary presence sanctifieth some places, so his extraordinary works sanctifie some times.</hi> And if so, the Church in chusing another day, doth act without Warrant, and Arbitrarily; as she doth also absurdly, in neglecting the day that was so signalized. And it is, at least, a probable Argument, that the Lord would not have a recurrent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day, observed on the account of Christs Birth; in that he hath concealed from us what day it was, on which Christ was born. He hath instituted, that the day of the Week on which our Lord rose from the dead, should be kept holy; and therefore hath not left us to guess what day he rose upon; but expresly told us that he rose the first day of the Week. Another objection he answereth is, the <hi>Vindicator thinks that such an Anniversary day is not to be kept by Gods appointment.</hi> His answer is, <hi>Hath not God appointed us to obey the Apostles, and their Successors, our lawful Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rulers, to the end of the World</hi>? Here is <hi>shuffling</hi> with a witness: The <hi>Apostles,</hi> and they whom he is pleased to call their Successours, are confusedly put together, to hide the nakedness of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. I confess we are commanded to obey the <hi>Apostles,</hi> because they were infallibly guided: And so their Commands are the Commands of Christ; but I deny the <hi>Apostles</hi> instituted the Holy days that he pleadeth for: For their Successours (real or pretended) I deny that we are commanded to obey them farther than they bring Divine Warrant, (either positive, by Institution, or natural) for what they teach, or injoyn. It is pleasant to observe, that our Learned <hi>Apologist</hi> is forced to use the same Argument for <hi>Christmass,</hi> that the <hi>Papists</hi> use for blind Obedience to all that their Church injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For farther answer, he asketh, <hi>May not they order the publick Solemnities, and Returns of Gods Worship. A.</hi> If by ordering, he meaneth determining the Circumstances that are needful to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and are not determined in Scripture; we grant they may: Such as appointing what hour we should meet for publick Worship: or what day to meet for Fasting, or Thanksgiving, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence doth, in a special manner, call to that Work: But if he mean, that they may appoint days not appointed by the Lord, to be perpetually recurrent; we say they may not: Because we see no such power granted to the Church: And this were a Power to make some days so Holy, as they could never be applyed to civil use: Such discrimination of days the Lord hath reserved in his own hand.</p>
            <p n="34">§. 34. That <hi>this Regulation hath a tendency to preserve and propagate the great Truths of the N. T.</hi> is neither true (it is often seen to have the contrary effect; to propagate Prophaness and Atheism) nor can it inferr any thing to our purpose: for it is not the natural tendency of a thing, but the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, and his blessing following on that, which can make any thing conducive to Religious ends: We must preserve and propagate Christs truths by his own means; not by Mens devices. He telleth us, <hi>If all Ecclesiastical Constitutions had been written in the Bible they could not have been read in a thousand years: And that either immediate revelations behoved to be continued, or the ordering of publick Solemnities must be left to Reason: A.</hi> The distinction above used doth take off the strength of this Argument: Ordering all Circumstances could not be written, they are so various, therefore they are left to Reason; but perpetual sequestring a day from Civil use, is more than a Circumstance: And surely a short Chapter in the <hi>N. T.</hi> might have contained all the Holy days that the <hi>Popish,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal</hi> Party have thought fit to make universally binding to all Christians; as the 23<hi>d. chap.</hi> of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus</hi> containeth all that the <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged to observe. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> is severely lashed <hi>p.</hi> 40. <hi>Sub finem,</hi> For bringing a Latine Sentence (tho' out of <hi>Augustine</hi>) to excuse from not observing any Holy days, save what are injoyned in Scripture: <hi>As if</hi> (saith the <hi>Apologist</hi>) <hi>Nonsence could change its nature by being put into Latine</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It seems we poor Mortals may not meddle with Latine; himself
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97831:16"/>
and some others have the Monopoly of it, and often he bringeth Latin Citations out of Authors less to be regarded than the excellent <hi>Augustine</hi>: If we cite a Greek Author out of a Latine Translation, that offended him <hi>p.</hi> 35. And now when <hi>Augustine</hi> is cited in the Language he wrote in, here is still matter of quarrell. We know not how to please him, and the ordinary effect of such difficulty is, to make one regardless of pleasing them who are so humoursom. If this Sentence be <hi>Nonsence.</hi> either in it self, or as applyed. <hi>Augustine</hi> must answer for it: For he useth it to the same purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the <hi>Nonsence</hi> lieth in this: <hi>The question is not</hi> (saith the <hi>Apologist</hi>) <hi>about Articles of Faith, but concerning the Constitutions of the Universal Church:</hi> If it might be said, without provoking him to <hi>the Indecencies of Passion,</hi> it is <hi>Nonsence</hi> indeed to apply this Sentence to the Articles of Faith; which are not the <hi>Jussa</hi> of Religion; but the observation of Holy days belongeth to that head if to any thing that can be called Religious. It is not a day being <hi>Anniversary</hi> (as he dreameth) that is the ground of our Scruple: For we do not disallow Anniversary days for any Civil work or Solemnity: But that Men should separate, by their own Authority, one day of the year from the rest, by sequestring it from Civil use (for which the Lord hath allowed us all the six days of the week) and dedicating it to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious imployment, we think this belongeth to God alone. It is a strange fancy that <hi>Christmass,</hi> and such days, <hi>are needful for Educating our Posterity in that Faith which we believe:</hi> As if Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances were not sufficient for that end, without the addition of Mens devices. It is as wild an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, that it is <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> to be against such days. I will not vilifie him so much as to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether he understandeth what is <hi>Enthusiasm</hi>: (tho' he is not sparing in shewing such respect to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) but I hope it may be said, he did not consider what it is, when he put that <hi>Epithete</hi> on this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; and on being for the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of <hi>Presbytry.</hi> For we do not pretend to any knowledge in these, but what we build on Scripture, and Reason; we plead no immediate Revelation. If he can prove our Grounds to be insufficient, he may conclude our Opinions false; but not that they are <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick:</hi> All the Divines that I have read on that subject take <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> for a pretension to imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation, or Inspiration, or Instinct, or <hi>Afflatus,</hi> of things that they who pretend to it can give no other ground for: And even <hi>Plutarch</hi> calleth it <hi>Instinctus divinus: de defect; Oracul. c'</hi> 67. If he can either prove that we pretend to this, or that we bring no other grounds for what we affirm, let him brand us with <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> at his pleasure: That <hi>all the subdivisions of Dissenters in</hi> England <hi>are for Anniversary Holy days,</hi> is so well known to be false, that I wonder he should insinuate so much, without blushing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That <hi>the Anniversary day for the burning of</hi> London, <hi>is observed by them all with Fasting and Prayer,</hi> is not true, for any thing that I know. And if it were true, will he also say that they have sequestred that day from all Civil Employment, and dedicated it to Religion: If he say not this the Case is not paralell to what we now debate about.</p>
            <p n="35">§ 35. His conclusion of what he had discoursed is, That <hi>it is dangerous, if not impious, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Church, in these excellent Constitutions that are received from the beginning, and in all Countries, where the name of Jesus hath been worshipped: Such Constitutions and Solemnities have been derived from the Apostles, or Apostolick times.</hi> Here are big words: If the strength of his forgoing Reasons were but proportioned to the confidence of his Assertion; our Cause must fall to the ground. But the Reader will judge whether any one word of this <hi>Thras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nick</hi> triumph be true, or have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent foundation, in what he hath proved. He telleth us (but I know not to what purpose) that <hi>the knowledge of Christ doth not extinguish the light of Reason: Therefore such Constitutions (as the reason of all Mankind is agreed in) have nothing in them contrary to the purity of our Religion.</hi> It is tedious to refute, or to read such loose Arguings, of which the meanest Logician might be ashamed. We deny not the use of Reason in Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> For understanding what is revealed, and for drawing Native Consequents from these great truths: But that the use of Reason is to appoint new Ordinances, or Means of Grace, that Christ hath not appointed, we deny. And if our Author do not assert that, he saith nothing for his Holy days: And if he do not prove it, his Argument is insignificant. For Holy days are such means, if we may believe this Author, who speaketh of them as the means of propagating the Christian Faith. That <hi>these Constitutions are agreed on by all Mankind,</hi> is a supposition as far from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97831:16"/>
Truth, and from Modesty, as any thing can be, He hath not yet done with this subject, but falleth on it afresh, in a discourse two pages long; which he calleth <hi>a short digression</hi>: Wherein any thing that looketh like Argumentation hath been, many times, to far greater advantage, proposed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his way; and as often answered by Men of our side: So that I wonder that so high a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is not ashamed so to tris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: Some things indeed he hath that are new, <hi>viz.</hi> Some Historical pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which are as far remote from Truth, as Darkness is from Light. Let us hear the particulars: He pleadeth <hi>p</hi> 41. that Anniversary Solemnities may be used in the Worship of God; tho' they have been abused to the Worship of Idols: <hi>A.</hi> We have better Arguments against these, and other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ceremonies, than from the abuse of them by <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi>: But even this wanteth not its weight, only we never used this Argument against the use of things necessary; and therefore the Author doth unwisely mention the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Seasons</hi>; the use of which we must not lay aside, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever abuse them: But of things that are of no necessity; such as all Human Ceremonies are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be, by the most Learned of the Patrons of them. Our Argument hath yet greater strength, if we consider, not only that the Holy day now debated about was kept by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> in Honour of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>; and hence called <hi>Yule</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>: And is still abused by many Superstitious Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries among the <hi>Papists</hi>: But is generally, by the far greater part of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Observers of it, spent in Idleness, Feasting, and Playing; and by very many, it is horribly profaned by all manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess and Debaucheries. It is a wonderful confidence: <hi>Do we not see</hi> (saith he) <hi>all Nations agree in this, that Publick Solemnities and Anniversary Festivities, and Fasts, are necessary to the Being, and Beauty of Religion: So</hi> p. 41. and p. 42. <hi>we ought to remember that the stated Festivals, and Fasts, of the Church, do preserve, and increase our Mortification,</hi> ibid. <hi>The stated periods of Fasting oblige the most stubborn, and impenitent to think of his Soul; and the visible practices of the Church preach Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, more effectually, and make more lasting impressions, then the loose and indefinite Homilies of Self conceited Men.</hi> And p. 43 he imputeth <hi>to the neglect of Fasting among Protestants, the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Reformation of the</hi> Grecian <hi>Churches.</hi> And ibid. <hi>The publick seasons of Devotions are the Catechism of the People.</hi> A few Remarks, to expose these flights of his Fancy. First, What could be more said of the Word and Sacraments, and other Ordinances instituted by Christ? What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Elogies are given to them in Scripture? For indeed he saith as much as <hi>Christmass</hi> and other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes, are <hi>the power of God to Salvation.</hi> 2. This is contary to the Sentiments of all that ever wrote on this subject: Who agree, that these Ceremonies are indifferent things: And yet he will have them <hi>necessary,</hi> and that not only to the <hi>beauty of Religion,</hi> but to the <hi>being</hi> of it. 3. Then it seems there was no Religion in the <hi>Apostolick Church</hi>; nor among the <hi>Waldenses</hi>; nor in <hi>Geneva</hi>; and several other Reformed Churches: I add not the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in all the Ages of it; because he will hardly allow any thing of Religion to be among us. This is his <hi>Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> of which he talketh: He doth indeed damn all them to Hell who observe not <hi>Christmass.</hi> He is the first of this Opinion, and I hope he shall be the last. 4. If all this were true, it were impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Irreligion, Impenitency, or Immorality, could be (at least, be frequent, and abundant) in a Church where these forms are used: Which I hope none will say, who have lived in <hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or in the Romane Communion. It is but suitable to his <hi>Genius</hi> to vilisie the Preaching of <hi>Presbyterians, as the loose and indefinite Homilies of Self conceited Men:</hi> But it had been fit to have told us whether there be any Preaching that can equal these forms, in efficacious working on the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If this be not what the <hi>Pharisees</hi> are reproved for; <hi>making void Christs Ordinances for Mens Traditions</hi>; I know not what can be so represented. 5. If the neglect of Fasting among <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> hinder the Reformation of the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches; why doth not the frequent Fasts in the <hi>Popish</hi> Church (with which they have more occasion to converse than with <hi>Protestants</hi>) contribute to advance that Reformation. 6. Seeing he is pleased to digress from <hi>Feasting</hi> to <hi>Fasting</hi>; he might know, that real <hi>Fasting</hi> used to be more frequent among the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> than among the <hi>Prelatists</hi>; for their set <hi>Fasts</hi> of <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Good Friday,</hi> how few among them do observe them?</p>
            <p n="36">
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:97831:17"/>§. 36. He telleth us next, of <hi>Anniversary Holy days among the</hi> Jews, <hi>besides these which God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and yet not reproved p</hi> 41. and 42. and he instanceth in the Fasts mentioned. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. and <hi>the Feast of the Dedication at which Christ was present, Joh.</hi> 10.22. That these Fasts were not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is said without all warrant: God disowneth them; if he say they were only disowned, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the neglect of seriousness in managing them, this must be proved. Again, Christ, and the Prophets, had so many things of greater moment to reprove and insist particularly upon, that they contented themselves to comprehend such things as these, under general reproofs, which were not wanting; and might, by a thinking Man, be applyed to all such Observations: As when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is reproved for devising Holy days that God had not appointed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.33. And Christ condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Humane Devices in Worship, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15 9. And the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s condemned some Worship that was in it self most abominable, on account that it was <hi>not commanded, Jer.</hi> 7.31. Christ's presence at the <hi>Feast of Dedication</hi> was no more, but his walking in the Temple, while the People were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating that Feast: Which can no ways be strained to signifie either Joyning, or Approbation. He talketh of <hi>shaking off all Externals of Religion, p.</hi> 42. and calleth it <hi>the Errour of Dissenters.</hi> That is palpably false: We have the External administration of the Word, and Sacraments among us: But it seems he will not only have his Humane Devices to make a great Figure in External Religion, but to be the ALL of it: Such loose talk is unbecoming a Divine. That which followeth, is an odd fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>It is certain that nothing preserveth the knowledge of Christian Religion among the body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, more than the Festivals of the Church.</hi> What? Not the Word and Sacraments? Whether this looketh rather like <hi>raving,</hi> than like <hi>disputing,</hi> let the Reader judge. He saith also, that <hi>we teach the People to despise all Forms</hi>: That is false; we keep the form of Baptizing, and Celebrating the Lords Supper, that we find in the Scripture. It is another horrid Falsehood (and I know not how it could fall from one who hath regard to the God of Truth) that <hi>it is rare to find a Presbyterians Child in the West of</hi> Scotland <hi>who can repeat the Commandements, or the Creed,</hi> and he complaineth; that <hi>by this means, Atheism is promoted, and that the Clowns laugh when a Curate recommendeth to their Children, the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the ten Commandements.</hi> None are more careful to instruct their Children, in these, and other Principles of Religion, than <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parents are; both in the <hi>West,</hi> and other places. And it is the constant practice of Ministers when they Catechise the People, to examine them on all these three; and to require the People to get them by heart; and to make them understand them. It is also false, that <hi>we have no Opinion of a Mans understanding, unless he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain us with discourses of Gods unsearchable decrees.</hi> These are very seldom the subject of our Preaching. But it is beyond all his other reproaches, that he imputeth to <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that <hi>they Preach Justification before Conversion.</hi> I know not a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> that is of that Opinion. If sometimes Ministers instruct their People <hi>how the Convictions of Natural Conscience may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Convictions that proceed from the Spirit of God.</hi> I think that is not to be exposed to ridicule, nor made a reproach by any who is acquainted with the deceit of the Heart, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of delusion about the truth of Grace in the Soul. What he discourseth <hi>p.</hi> 43. of <hi>the ancient Discipline of the Church,</hi> being conducive to Reformation, I heartily close with: But am far from thinking, that that Discipline lay in <hi>Festivities</hi> or <hi>Fasts,</hi> appointed by Men, but in censuring of Sin according to the appointment of Christ.</p>
            <p n="37">§. 37. He beginneth a new head <hi>p.</hi> 43. near the end which is a large discourse about the <hi>Schism</hi> that he alledgeth the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to be guilty of. And all this he foundeth on a word, occasionally, and transiently, written by the <hi>Vindicator</hi> (if our Author cite his words true, which we cannot know, seing he doth not direct us) <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he knoweth no Schism but such as was caused by his Opposites.</hi> If I knew on what occasion this was said, I could the better judge whether it was well said, or not: But he hath left us here (as often elsewhere) to guess; as he also citeth Scriptures without Chapter or Verse: And it is not easie to find out one short Sentence, which may be hath no more joyned to it on that subject in a large Book: Before I consider his Refutations of this Assertion, I shall shew, in what sense this may be maintained. 1. In <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are not guilty of Schism, nor do they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97831:17"/>
desert the Church; but are driven away by Her; because she Excommunicateth them, unless they wil practise some <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that they cannot use, with a good Conscience: This hath been proved against Bishop <hi>Stillingfleet, Rational Defence of Nonconformity.</hi> And if our Author please to debate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, his Reasons shall be considered. 2. In <hi>Scotland</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who had freedom to hear the Conformists, and yet had Meetings wherein they heard their own Ministers, who were unjustly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ected, could not be guilty of sinfull Separation: Because they still owned the <hi>Episcopal Church</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> as a True, tho' Corrupted <hi>Church,</hi> and did not shun to partake in the Ordinances with Her, but were under no obligation to cast off their own Ministers who were orderly called and settled among them, and not removed from them by any Church Authority; but only by the Civil Power, which (however it might forcibly hinder the publick exercise of a Mans Ministry) could neither make him no Minister, nor not the Minister of that People: And these <hi>Presbyterian Ministers</hi> and People, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ately not only by the Gospel, but by the Law, the <hi>Church of Scotland</hi>; and the ceasing of their Legal Right by the change of the Law, could not take away their Gospel Right: And any thing that might look like Separation, was <hi>caused by our Opposites,</hi> in that they had violently thrust us from our Places. 3. Even they who did so separate from the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all Communion with her, and to refuse to joyn with Her, in any Ordinances, could be charged with no <hi>Separation,</hi> but what was <hi>caused by our Opposites:</hi> For their overturning the settled, and found Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and driving away the Pastors that those Persons could freely hear, did tempt them to this Course: Tho' I do not approve of their Principle of not Hearing; yet the blame lay not only on them, but on them who had driven them on this precipice.</p>
            <p n="38">§. 38. Let us now hear with what weighty Arguments he will refute the Assertion, that he levelleth his Discourse against: A great part of his Discourse is not fit to be answered; such as, That <hi>the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Church is not to strike Sail to the Novelties of Upstarts, p.</hi> 43. This is true, but wholly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent: Unless he can prove that the <hi>Scotch Episcopalians</hi> are either the Universal Church, or in this maintained the Cause of the Universal Church: And that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are Upstarts: Which we maintain have been since the Apostles days: And were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> since the <hi>Reformation</hi> from <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and before the entrance of <hi>Popery</hi>: But of this after; That <hi>by our Baptismal Vow we are bound to keep the Unity of the Catholick Church;</hi> we willingly confess: But at the same time, we affirm, that the same Vow obligeth us, not to tempt others to break it. His Arguments to prove the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of</hi> Scotland <hi>Separatists</hi> have this general fault; that they touch not the Conclusion: Nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Assertion that he would refute: For if I should grant them to be <hi>Separatists</hi>; yet this <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may be <hi>culpably caused by our Opposites.</hi> They have also another Fault; that they make no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the <hi>Separation</hi> (on whose side soever the Crime of it was) between one sort of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and another: Whereas it is certain, that some did live in the Communion of that Church (tho' they did not approve of all her ways) and others did not. His first Argument is <hi>p</hi> 44. <hi>They sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from all Churches Ancient and Modern: Nor is there a Church on Earth, with which they can Communicate, without fear of being polluted.</hi> This is false: None of us refused to Communicate with the Churches of <hi>Holland, France</hi> (when they had liberty) <hi>Geneva</hi>; and many others: But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us, did cheerfully Communicate with them. His proof of this his Assertion is, all other Churches have some things we disl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke. This is not concludent, for we never thought it unlawful to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with a Church which was not as pure as we could wish: What we dislike in any, we abstain from the practice, or approbation of it, but do not for that, deny Communion with the Church, where it is found. He again argueth, <hi>p.</hi> 44. and 45. That <hi>the former Presbyterians did not separate from the publick Worship in the Episcopal Church. A.</hi> Neither did all the present <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; and they who did were tempted, yea driven, into that Course, by his Parties Apostacy, and overturning the settlement of the Church, by force, without either any Act of Church Authority, or indeavour to satisfie the Consciences of the People. I do not approve, more than he doth, of all that is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Apologetical Relation.</hi> That <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers made use of the Lords Prayer, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not; nor did we ever condemn it. The same we say of using the <hi>Creed in Baptism:</hi> Nor did we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97831:18"/>
ever <hi>separate</hi> from the Church on these grounds: For the <hi>Doxology,</hi> we know it was used, but I know no warrant for the constant use of it, when the several parts of the Songs composed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, to be Sung in the Church, were more seldom used.

A.</hi> That there are ties on us to Communicate with the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Congregations, we deny; and what may be pretended in favour of such obligation, is above answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Reason that be asketh, is plain, because I may have other obligations which hinder me to do that constantly, which I may do sometimes: I may lawfully Preach in another Mans Pulpit, when he calleth me to it, but it is not fit I should do it fixedly, and desert mine own.</p>
            <p n="39">§. 39.

A.</hi> All the strength of this Argument lieth in the sound of words: A <hi>Bishop,</hi> in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, was not a <hi>Diocesan,</hi> with sole Power of Jurisdiction and Ordination; if he prove that, we shall give <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and him leave to call us <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> A <hi>Bishop</hi> then was the Pastor of a Flock, or the <hi>Moderator of a Presbytry</hi>; if he can prove that we separate from our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, or from the <hi>Presbytry,</hi> with their <hi>Moderator,</hi> under whose inspection we ought to be, let him call us what he will.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97831:18"/>
are of his Kidney: In whose Discourses little of the <hi>Righteousness of Christ</hi> and that <hi>strength and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from Him,</hi> by which we must obey His Laws, is to be found. Another falsehood is, that any Man is censured for <hi>Preaching Morality.</hi> That which is taken notice of is, that some do so preach <hi>Morality,</hi> as to neglect that which is <hi>Divinity</hi>: That is, so to Preach the Duties that are required of us, as not to open to People the mystery of Christ, and Salvation by him: In shewing them that we can do nothing that is acceptable to God without an interest in Christ as our Righteousness; and without the aids of his Spirit. It is our daily work to Preach <hi>Morality,</hi> and the necessity of <hi>Holiness in all manner of Conversation</hi>: But we look on this, but as the half of Gospel Preaching: And that, even when we press a Holy Life, and particular Duties, on these excellent Motives taken out of the Scripture, which he, at great length, insisteth on, about which I am far from controverting with him: Only I must tell him, that the Gospel, which we must Preach, and by which we look for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is not only <hi>Morality,</hi> even <hi>Christian,</hi> let be <hi>Pagan</hi>; which he describeth to be <hi>Evangelical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Holiness, without which no man shall see God</hi> (tho' that be an essential part of it) but it comprehendeth also knowledge of, and Faith in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as our Righteousness and Strength: Of which there is little in the Sermons of some of his Party: And not a word, in his long Discourse on this Head; tho' it be designed to shew how fully they Preach the Gospel: And I still affirm, that this is not that <hi>Divinity,</hi> that Christ and his Apostles taught: And I hope the Reader may, by this time see that there is no nicety in distinguishing between his <hi>Christian Morality</hi> and the <hi>Christian Divinity</hi> that Ministers should Preach. He saith, <hi>p.</hi> 48. That <hi>there are no</hi> Socinians <hi>among the Episcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of</hi> Scotland: In which I do not contradict him: For I know them not; but if he had said there are no <hi>Socinianizing Arminians</hi>; I could have made the contrary appear. He is angry with the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator, p.</hi> 50 that he saith, <hi>May be we understand what the</hi> Pagan <hi>Philosophy is as well as our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:</hi> But we shall not quarrel with him, tho' <hi>p.</hi> 49 he saith, <hi>May be we have read</hi> Seneca <hi>with as much attention as he did, and can give as good account of the defects of the Stoical Philosophy.</hi> I do not envy his Learning, and I do not pretend to have any such degree of it, that may provoke others to Envy. He defendeth, <hi>p.</hi> 50. an Argument used for the Orthodoxy of the Clergy: That they could sign the 59 <hi>Articles of the Church of</hi> England: And is displeased that it is objected, that <hi>some do so, who yet preach against what they have signed.</hi> I hope this is no <hi>judging of Mens Hearts,</hi> as he wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commenteth on it; but of the inconsistency of two overt acts: Neither is it a refutation of this, that the Clergy cannot, by hardships, now be brought to comply with the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>: For some of them are more yielding, and others are more fixt in their way; which may be imputed to Conscience in some, and in others, to other Motives.</p>
            <p n="41">§. 41. What he next chargeth on his Adversary, <hi>p.</hi> 51 is a Censure on the Author whom he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing; who insinuateth that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> talk every day to the People of Gods Decrees and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; by denying this to be the practice of <hi>Prelatists.</hi> And it is answered by the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> that this is impertinent, if he mean as he expresseth it: <hi>For who</hi> (saith the <hi>Vindicator</hi>) <hi>ever blamed any Man as erroneous, because he insisted not always on such subjects</hi>? The <hi>Apologist</hi> first representeth this as if it had been expressed, that <hi>we do not require that one should always talk of Decrees and Reprobations.</hi> I know no design in using such senseless expressions, but to expose his Opposite as Ridiculous: Whereas these silly expressions are his own: The <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s words are these abovementioned.

            <p n="42">§. 42. Another Theological debate (or Historical, about a Theological head) he beginneth, <hi>p.</hi> 52. where he leaveth the <hi>second Vindication,</hi> and picketh occasion of this quarrel with his Antagonist, out of the first. What he insisteth against is, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> had asserted that the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before <hi>Popery</hi> entered into it, and in the first time of its being <hi>Christian,</hi> was not governed by <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>; but by the Pastors of the Church (then called <hi>Culdees</hi>) acting in Parity. This he alloweth to be <hi>of some consideration; not for any Historical Truth that is in it, but because the Learned</hi> Blondel <hi>made use of it:</hi> Yet he calleth it <hi>an imaginary Hypothesis:</hi> And laboureth to run it down (after his wont) with very severe words: As if he would <hi>Hector</hi> us out of our Principles: What is the strength of his Arguments we shall try.

               </gap>oncealing what was needful to set the matter before the Reader, in its true light. For <hi>Blondel, Apolog. prosententia Hieron p.</hi> 314, 315. Citeth <hi>Fordon, Joan. Major &amp; Boet.</hi> Wherefore he took it not from <hi>Buchanan</hi> alone: It is also an odd blunder to say that <hi>Boetius</hi> and the others that <hi>Buchanan</hi> had it from, were <hi>his contemporary Monks.</hi> For <hi>Boetius</hi> and <hi>Major,</hi> were not Monks nor were they contemporary with <hi>Buchanan:</hi> And <hi>Fordon</hi> was far removed from his time: Nor did any two of these mentioned live at the same time. He doth also deal unfairly, and not as a Disputant, with the <hi>Vindicator</hi>; for he taketh no notice of what grounds he brought for what he affirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Palladius</hi> was the first <hi>Bishop</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and yet Christianity was pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His first and chief Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Assertion is, there were none that lived near that Age who writeth the History of it, and the Monks who wrote any thing were extreamly ignorant: Wherefore this story of the <hi>Culdees</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Church, hath no Credibility. This is the substance of what he discourseth at length, <hi>p.</hi> 52, 53. In answer to which. 1. This is at one blow to raze the Foundation of the History of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and of that of most others: And to make them all to be Fools who have enquired into these Antiquities that concern our Nation, and others: Such as <hi>Fordon, Major, Beda, Usher, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, <hi>Baronius,</hi> the <hi>Centuriatores of Magdeburgh,</hi> and such famous Historians, have spent their time in vain, if this new Judge of Learning may be heard. 2. he might have taken notice, that <hi>Prosper</hi> was cited, out of <hi>Spondanus,</hi> by his Antagonist: And he wrote about the year 420. not far from the time that he telleth us <hi>Palladius</hi> was made the first <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is ridiculous to talk of <hi>the Acts of the Assemblies, in that ancient period, p.</hi> 53. For we do not assert (as is expresly said, <hi>first Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He telleth, <hi>ibid. of his Opinion, if he dare interpose it,</hi> that the Monks advanced this Fable to gratify the <hi>Pope</hi> in his design of keeping the <hi>Bishops</hi> low: And yet with the same Breath; this is so known, that it needeth neither proof, nor il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration: How to reconcile this timidity, and this confidence, is beyond my Capacity.</p>
            <p n="43">§. 43. Another thing like Argument is, <hi>p.</hi> 54. <hi>All the known Records of the Christian Church una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously declare for the Hierarchy in the</hi> 2<hi>d. and</hi> 3<hi>d.

This is denied, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hath been proved: It is too much confidence to assert this, till our Author take time to answer all that the Learned <hi>Blondel,</hi> and many others, have written. 2.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97831:19"/>
its conclusion, that it should lead us to: For our present debate is, what <hi>Church Government</hi> was in <hi>Scotland</hi> about the 2<hi>d</hi> and 3<hi>d</hi> Centuries. What followeth is built on the same bottom; and falleth by the answer already given: <hi>Had</hi> Scotland (saith he) <hi>any other Church Government than what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Christian Church when they were Converted</hi>? It is said that <hi>no parallel instance can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> He here still supposeth that which he knoweth we debate against the <hi>Prelatists</hi>; which is no good way of Argumenting Let him read <hi>Blondell</hi> from the beginning to the end, and he shall find instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all the Christian Churches, in <hi>Asia, Europe,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> He should have answered all that he such written in his <hi>Apology,</hi> before he had complained that no instance can be given of a Christian Church without a <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> It is still to the same purpose, when he asketh, <hi>by whom were they</hi> (the Scots) <hi>Converted? Is it not reasonable to think, that they who Converted them would plant that Church Government among them that they were acquainted with themselves? A.</hi> If he can prove that they were Converted by <hi>Prelatists,</hi> or <hi>Prelats,</hi> he gaineth what is now in debate. <hi>Spondanus</hi> out of <hi>Prosper,</hi> saith that <hi>Palladius</hi> was the first <hi>Bishop,</hi> who came among them: And <hi>Baronius</hi> sheweth, that they were Converted some Centuries before his time: As was shewed in the very place our Author pretendeth to refute. It is a great mistake in our Author, <hi>p.</hi> 54. That <hi>we appear with our</hi> Culdees <hi>against the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Records of Fathers, Councils; &amp;c.</hi> For these Records have been examined, and found not to be so undoubtedly on his side; But this he hath a mind to suppose. Again, we bring not the <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees,</hi> or their Authority, for proving what we say: It is the Testimony of others concerning them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all this, the <hi>Fathers, Councils, &amp;c.</hi> say nothing of the Church Government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the first Ages of its Christianity; which is the thing now in debate. His last effort, under this head, is, <hi>If he confess there were</hi> some <hi>Priests in</hi> Scotland <hi>before Bishops, yet those had their Ordination, and Mission from Bishops in other places, to whom they might give account of their Travels, and Success: And this was ordinary before Nations were Converted, but when they received the Faith, then were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>placed among them. A.</hi> This doth no way meet with the case in hand, for it is proved <hi>first Vindic. p.</hi> 4.5. That not only some were become Christians, but the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the body of the People had received the Christian Faith, upward of three hundred years before <hi>Palladius,</hi> their first <hi>Bishop</hi> came among them: Did they all this time continue not an Organical Church; and without Church Officers, and Government: I hope his confidence, as high as it flies, will not reach this far.</p>

I hope they who are indeed concerned about their Souls Case, will find more of the Marrow of the Gospel in these Sermons, than in many of the slanting and starcht Discourses that this Author commendeth. This losty Soul is next (<hi>p.</hi> 55.) displeased with the <hi>Vindicator's creeping Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> because he discourseth of the <hi>Act of the Assembly against the private administration of Baptism</hi>: And calleth this, <hi>one of his little Impertinencies.</hi> By this means he reproacheth greater Men than that Author ever pretended to be: For that Controversie is not new, nor of his invention: And howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver little it be, it is none of his <hi>Impertinencies;</hi> but of his Adversaries, who reproacheth the <hi>General Assembly</hi> for it: Is it <hi>Impertinency</hi> to answer what an Antagonist doth object; or is it such to call such Conduct by that name? Let us now see how <hi>pertinent</hi> his Refutation of this our Principle is.

how the Ordinances of the Gospel should be managed. He supposeth that we make it necessary, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in this he mistaketh the state of the Controversie; which is whether Baptism (when the other Ordinances of the Gospel can be had publickly) should be administred before the Congregation, or such of them as on due warning to the whole, do give their presence, or may be done in a Corner as People please. If he had said any thing against our Principle in this, it should have been considered. That he chargeth the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers and People with want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Phrase, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> we misregard.</p>

He beginneth his Discourse with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, (which it seems either the Author of the <hi>Manuscript,</hi> or the <hi>Apologist,</hi> or both, taketh for a concludent Argument against <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) that none of our <hi>Martyrs</hi> spake, or wrote against <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: But all who write of them, praise them for dutiful submission to their Bishops, and Superiours. A.</hi> 1. They had so many great abominations in the way that they opposed, to insist on, that it is no wonder they over lookt this: We know <hi>Luther</hi> opposed but few things in <hi>Popery,</hi> at first; now if he had been cut off by <hi>Martyrdom</hi> in the beginning of his Reformation, as these Worthy Men were; would his silence have been a good Argument for all these points of <hi>Popery</hi> that afterward fell under debate? 2. He confesseth the <hi>Martyrs</hi> spake against <hi>Popish Tyranny</hi> (which I hope he will acknowledge was exercised by the <hi>Bishops</hi>) I ask then, when they did thus condemn <hi>Tyranny in Bishops,</hi> did they own any Lawful Authority they had? Which might have been expected, if they had been of this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Opinion. Yea, it can be made appear, that some of them said the <hi>Pope hath no more power than another Man</hi>; and if this be said of the <hi>Chief Bishop,</hi> it may with better reason be said of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. 3. Where any Historian gave an account of the <hi>dutiful submission</hi> of these <hi>Martyrs</hi> to their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> I do not find; except it were while they were still in the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, which is not to the purpose in hand. Another Argument he seemeth to bring from <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who turned off <hi>Presbytry at the</hi> Barrow-moor, <hi>being wearied with its Confusions and Insolencies.</hi> This needeth little answer; I hope this Author will not now own <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Actings, as Exemplary, and Instructive.

on such Passages as seem to question <hi>Presbytry</hi> being the first Church Government among the <hi>Scotch Protestants,</hi> is all that I need here to mind. He saith, <hi>p.</hi> 58 at the end, that <hi>five Superintendents were named for the Diocesses where the Bishops were Popish: For there are no Superintendents named for</hi> Galloway <hi>and</hi> Argile, <hi>because the Bishops of these Diocesses were Protestants.</hi> This is the Author's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; no such Reason of that Conduct is given by <hi>Arch-Bishop Spotswood;</hi> out of whom he taketh his History. And indeed, it is contrary to Reason, as well as without Ground; for there were more <hi>Diocesses</hi> than six or seven in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and but two of the <hi>Bishops</hi> were Protestants (<hi>exore túo</hi>) why then did they not place <hi>Superintendents</hi> in the rest of the Diocesses; which behoved (by his own account) either to be Vacant, or furnished with <hi>Popish Bishops</hi>? Further, He, it seems, hath read the Author that he citeth, very carelesly; for <hi>Spotswood</hi> saith expresly, that one of the five Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (viz <hi>John Kerswell</hi>) was placed in <hi>Argile</hi> and the Isles: And yet my <hi>Antagonist</hi> maketh <hi>Argile</hi> one of the two Diocesses in which the <hi>Bishops</hi> were Protestants: There must then be some other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for appointing these five <hi>Superintendents,</hi> and no more; than that the <hi>Bishops</hi> of these Diocesses were <hi>Popish</hi>: And it is evident from this very passage, that the <hi>Protestants</hi> did not own <hi>Episcopal</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, in any Man, even though he were <hi>Protestant</hi>; seing they set a <hi>Superintendent</hi> in <hi>Argile,</hi> where the <hi>Bishop</hi> was Protestant; and tho' the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Argile</hi> did then sit in Parliament (as <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> hath it, <hi>p.</hi> 149. near the end) yet the Protestants set another over the Church in that Diocess. And it is also clear from this passage, that they did not look on <hi>a Superintendent</hi> and a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as the same, nor as having the same Authority in the Church. The material and great differences that are between a <hi>Superintendent</hi> (which the <hi>Protestant Church in Scotland</hi> in that case of necessity, did, for a time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at the Reformation) and a <hi>Bishop,</hi> may be seen at length, in <hi>Calderwood</hi>'s History, <hi>p.</hi> 26, 27. whom; I hope I may, without blame, quote as well as he doth, that of <hi>Arch-bishop Spotswood,</hi> If it may be done without giving him offence (which he seemeth to take at my <hi>referring to mine own little Books</hi>) I would tell him, that all the weight that here, and after, he layeth on <hi>Superintendents</hi> being set over large districts, is taken off by what the <hi>Apologist</hi> might have read, and should have answered, if he had dealt fairly. 1<hi>st.

I shall with all due respect to his Lordship examine this History. And 1. I observe, that he bringeth no Vouchers for these passages; but we must take, on his own single Testimony, things that were beyond the memory or knowledge of his Father; of much more than a hundred years standing. 2. <hi>Arch bishop Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> expresly saith, <hi>p</hi> 260. That <hi>these Articles were admitted by the Assembly at</hi> Perth <hi>only for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, till a more perfect Order might be obtained from the King, Or Regent</hi>: And what that Order was, time did try; for not <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was afterward settled; but <hi>Presbytry.</hi> 3. It is a great mistake that they who made these Articles were a <hi>Commission of the Assembly,</hi> for that Meeting at <hi>Lieth</hi> was no <hi>General Assembly</hi> of the <hi>Church of Scotland,</hi> tho' <hi>Spotswood</hi> is pleased to call it so: Both <hi>Calderwood p</hi> 49. and <hi>Petrie Cent.</hi> 16. <hi>p</hi> 372 witness, that in the Register it is called a <hi>Convention</hi>; which word is always used for extraordinary Meetings, whether of Church or State. That Meeting did indeed Vote it self a <hi>General Assembly</hi>: For in the second Session, it was concluded that <hi>this Meeting should have the force and strength of a General Assembly; and that all things may be treated, and ended therein, that use to be treated and ended in a General Assembly.</hi> Also that <hi>the Moderator of the last Assembly shall continue till the next ordinary Assembly in</hi> March: <hi>And that all present should be there also.</hi> So both the Historians last cited.

I hope none will say, that this was a <hi>Church</hi> Meeting, or what they did was the deed of the <hi>Church.</hi> 4. It is certain that this was not lookt on by the <hi>Church of Scotland</hi> as one of her <hi>General Assemblies</hi>: Not only because the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> appointed by the former <hi>Assembly,</hi> met at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> a few Weeks after that <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Leith,</hi> viz. <hi>March</hi> 6. but likewise, they took no notice of the <hi>Arch. bishop of St. Andrews,</hi> tho' he sat among them, but chused Mr. <hi>Robert Hamiltoun,</hi> Minister of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to be their Moderator: Which they could not have done, had they owned a <hi>Prelacy</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> 5.

They that desire the Churches good and safety let them take heed of this Pestilence: And seing ye have put that plague to flight timously, I heartily pray you that ye never admit it again; albeit it seem plausible, with the pretence, or colour of keeping Unity; which pretence deceived the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Yea, even many of the best of them.</q> 6.

At the same time were brought in also <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priars,</hi> as well as <hi>Bishops</hi>; and for the same end, <hi>viz.</hi> That some Great Men, under their shadow, might reap the profits, only the Name, and some small Rent remaining to them: So that this whole contrivance was purely, and evidently a piece of State Policy not any inclination of the <hi>Church of Scotland</hi> to cast off <hi>Presbyterial Government,</hi> altho' some Church Men were drawn into it. 8. This Constitution never obtained in the <hi>Church of Scotland.</hi> For not only the names of <hi>Arch-bishops, and Deans</hi> were protested against in the <hi>Assembly, March</hi> 6, 1572. But never a <hi>Bishop</hi> was suffered to Moderate in any of the subsequent <hi>General Assemblies</hi>; and in several <hi>Assemblies</hi> Acts were made against <hi>Bishops,</hi> till at last, the <hi>General Assembly</hi> at <hi>Dundee,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun July 12, 1580, did absolutely condemn the Office of <hi>Bishop,</hi> as then used; and commanded all <hi>Bishops</hi> to forbear the exercise of such Power: And to this effect appointed them to appear before the several <hi>Provincial Synods,</hi> where they lived. And afterward, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1592, <hi>Presbyterial Government</hi> was fully settled. 9. The Account given of Mr. <hi>Melvil</hi> is not fair; not only in that his opposition to <hi>Bishops</hi> is imputed to his not being preferred. For he was zealously opposite to <hi>Episcopacy</hi> before; and when he came to <hi>Scotland</hi> he refused Preferment at Court, when offered: But also, that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that Mr. <hi>Dury,</hi> and others, made to <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is abscribed to his instigation. These Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and Worthy Men acted from their own light, and were not Tools to be used by another. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I could not have expected from a Person of <hi>Honour and Learning,</hi> such an account of the <hi>Book of Policy</hi> made in the year 1578: As <q>That it was stuffed with the Spirit of Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> himself; it was rather a proposal for overthrowing of all Just Authority, than an Establishment of a Religious Government: That it could not (even in these distracted and furious times) obtain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of any Authority: But was lookt on as a Rapsody of groundless Assertions, and full of mischievous Novelties.</q> This is not to write like an Historian. His Author, <hi>Spotswood,</hi> speaketh with more modesty of this matter: That <q>the Book of Policy being presented to the States, they had not then leasure to peruse it; but gave a Commission to some of their number to conferr with the Commissioners of the Church: And if they did agree, to insert the same among the Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> So he <hi>p</hi> 289. That it was not rejected with such disdain, as his Lordship is pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, is evident; not only in that nothing of such resentment of it, when proposed, is left on Record, by any Historian; but is the fierce Zeal of a new set of <hi>Episcopalians</hi>; not the temper of the old <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church of Scotland</hi>; but <hi>Archbishop Spotswood p.</hi> 289. to 302. Setteth down all the Articles of that Book at length, and on his Margine, noteth what was agreed to, what was referred to farther reasoning, and what amendements of it were desired by the other Party. It is also observed by <hi>Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, p.</hi> 116. That the delay of ratifying the <hi>Book of Policy,</hi> by the State, was much occasioned by what is contained in the eighth ninth and Tenth Chapters of it, concerning the disposing the <hi>Church Rents,</hi> otherwise than some great Men desired, and to their disadvantage, as they imagined. A piece of manifestly false History followeth, <hi>viz. Ann.</hi> 1580. <q>An Assembly met at <hi>Dundee,</hi> called by Mr. <hi>Andrew</hi> and his Associates, without a shadow of any permission from the Civil Authority: Where they declared the Office of a Bishop to be without warrant from the Word of God.</q> That they had not the Magistrates allowance is not only said without the Authority of any Historian, and is a pure invention of this Author: But it is certain, that then they had their <hi>Assemblies</hi> in Course, by the States allowance, and that the succeeding <hi>Assembly</hi> was appointed at the dissolution of the former. It is also asserted by <hi>Calderwood, p.</hi> 89. That <q>the King sent two; the Prior of <hi>Pittenweens,</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Lundie,</hi> instructed with power to assist the Assembly with their Presence, and Counsell;</q> from all which it is also evident to be a mistake, that this <hi>Assembly</hi> was called by Mr. <hi>Melvil and his Associates.</hi> The observation of our Author on the <hi>Assemblies</hi> declaring against <hi>Bishops,</hi> is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gang of his Party; that <hi>it is against plain Scripture, the Doctrine of the Apostles</hi> (how this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the former I know not) <hi>and of the Fathers, and the Canons of all Oecumenical Councils, and the rule of Apostolical and Primitive Practice.</hi> If he, or any else, will prove all this, our Cause must needs fall to the ground: But I have often read, and heard such confident Assertions, but never yet saw sufficient proof of them. It offendeth him highly, that in the end of the Act against Bishops, the Assembly referreth to the next Assembly to reason upon the disposing the Patrimony of the Kirks possessed by the Bishops; as if in this they usurped on the Kings <hi>Regale.</hi> But here is not one word of considering how <hi>They</hi> should dispose of this Patrimony; and I hope it is no Usurpation in Church-men, to advise and reason, in order to give their Opinion, and putting up their Supplication to them to whom it belongeth to dispose of it.</p>

Church, for this, and other gross things were also laid to his charge: The King allowed them to proceed against him on any thing they could charge him with in his Life, or Doctrine: But would not permit them to censure him for accepting the <hi>Bishoprick:</hi> Whereupon he was accused of gross Crimes; his Libel was sent to the King: The King left him to make his own Answer. After this the <hi>Presbytry</hi> of <hi>Stirling</hi> suspended him for disorderly Baptizing, he slighted this Sentence, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised his Ministry. Whereupon he was cited to appear before the <hi>Synod;</hi> of which the King being informed, warned the <hi>Synod</hi> to appear before him at <hi>Stirling;</hi> and discharged all proceeding against him; some of them appeared, and protested, that tho' in <hi>Obedience</hi> (not <hi>Civility,</hi> as our Author hath it) they had compeared, yet they did not acknowledge his Majesty, and the Council, Judges in the matter, it being a Cause Ecclesiasticall: They did not say, as the <hi>Manuscript</hi> hath it, that <hi>they did not acknowledge the King and Councils right in any Ecclesiastical matter.</hi> I shall say no more of this purpose; save that, not only the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; but also not a few <hi>Episcopalians</hi> (especially when the Civil Authority acteth against their Interests, and Inclinations) do controvert, whither the Magistrate can hinder the Church to censure her own Members; when the matter is purely Ecclesiastical. I wish our Author would shew us what Invasion is made on the <hi>Kings Authority,</hi> when the Church censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any person for Immoralities, that are manifest Scandals to the People, and do no way touch the Civil State.</p>

That the Noblemen desired the General Assembly to approve this deed of theirs; which the Assembly would not do, till they consulted with the King himself; and till he desired them to do it: Confessing to them that Religion was in hazard; and indirect Courses taken to overturn it; and that his own hazard was joyned with that of Religion: And desiring that they for their own part, would help to remove the same.</q> He sheweth also that <q>this deed of the Lords was fully approved by a Convention of Estates at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> called by the King.</q> Let it then be considered, whether it be so monstruous a thing for the Church to shew her Opinion, when required, in concurrence with the <hi>King,</hi> and Estates of the Nation; whether the <hi>King</hi> did really think what he expressed, or what he acted was the effect of his restraint, it was not their part to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.

Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil's declining of the King as Judge</hi> in prima instantia, <hi>of what is preached by Ministers in publick</hi> which he bringeth as an accusation against the <hi>Presbyterians p</hi> 61.) is as far from the purpose, as what was formerly observed: It doth not shew any step of the prevalency of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy per vices;</hi> which is pretended to be the design of the <hi>Manuscript.</hi> For the thing it self I shall not give my Opinion; but only relate the Grounds all edged by him, on which he built this his practice; which were not only the word of God; but Acts of Parliament, and a late Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt some Lords of the Privy Council, and some Ministers; and the practice ensuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; that when a Minister is delated for any thing spoken in Preaching, or Prayer, he is first to be tryed by his Ordinary, whether <hi>Provincial</hi> or <hi>General Assembly.</hi> Also he pleadeth the Priviledge of the University of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> lately confirmed by his Majesty; that when Offences were committed in the University, by Masters or Students, the Rector and his Assistants should be Judges <hi>in prima in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia, p.</hi> 61.62. He heapeth together a great multitude of reproaches against Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> and others of the faithful Servants of God, who could not comply with the actings of the Court, nor designs of some about it, to overturn the Religion setled in the Nation; but he giveth so indistinct an account of things, and so partially, that there is no other way to answer what he saith, but by a full History of these times; which it is needless for me to transcribe. The Reader may be satisfied of this Authors unfair dealing; even out of <hi>Spotswood's</hi> History, though his account of things might in some things be examined: But more fully out of <hi>Calderwood</hi> and <hi>Petrie.</hi> I do not deny, but that in the years 1585, and some that followed, there were great Animosities in <hi>Church</hi> and State; one Party endeavouring to preserve the reformed Religion and the Discipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> that had been used in <hi>Scotland</hi> from the Reformation, and was practised in almost all the Reformed Churches: The other Party labouring to overturn the one, and to weaken and undermine the other. And it is like these heats did drive both Parties to some Excesses and undue Practices: But unbyassed Men will see that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party shewed all respect to Authority, even when they could not comply with its Injunctions; and what they did, that is by some constructed <hi>Unpeaceableness,</hi> was from the aw of God obliging them to appear in their Stations for his Ordinances: I except the imperfections, and overlashes that sinful Men are liable to, in managing that Zeal which is for God. I never thought that good Men did always manage a good Cause with that perfection of discretion that is to be wished. He concludeth this Accusation of the Brethren <hi>p.</hi> 62. with an account of his design, which is to shew <hi>the ground of their dislike of Parity:</hi> And as before, setteth in opposition to it, <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Apostolick Practice, Fathers, Councils, and all well established Christian Churches, and that there is no imaginable warrant for it from any of these.</hi> This is partly answered above: For what he addeth to what he had said before, of <hi>well established Churches</hi>; he doth wisely in putting the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis on <hi>Well</hi>; and therefore putteth that word in another Character: For if we object most of the <hi>Churches</hi> of the Reformation, he will deny them to be <hi>Well</hi> Established, because they want <hi>Bishops:</hi> Whatever they have beside to commend them. If we should muster up all the miscarriages of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party, and the Immoralities of Ministers and People that hath been among them; and the Pride, Tyranny, and Oppression of the <hi>Bishops</hi>; and the steps by which that interest hath been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and should give a just Character of the States-men and Church-men, by whom it hath been carried on: It is like we might give a ground of our dislikes of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> not inferiour to what he mentioneth; and much more weighty with all the true Lovers of serious Religion; but this way of Arguing is not what we lay much weight on, in debate with our Adversaries: Tho' I doubt not but that there is reason to think that that which is Christs Institution is usually found to be a more effectual mean for advancing true Religion in the Church, than that which is a device of Man.</p>

That <hi>when three Lords were tried, the Ministers would needs order the Process and stirred up the Rabble to back them; nor would they disband, tho' prohibited by Proclamation from King and Council.</hi> The true History is, some Popish Noblemen were known, all the Nation over, to be guilty of dangerous plotting against the Reformed Religion, and designs to ruin the Professors of it: They had Friends at Court, so that they had too much advantage to carry on their designs: All the found Protestants in the Nation obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this, and saw the danger that they, and the true Religion was in; wherefore a Meeting of <hi>Barons, Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> (which when challenged by the King for their meeting, offered to make it appear that it was with sufficient warrant and advice from his Majesty) did petition the King that those Lords might be brought to Tryal; which was appointed to be done; the Protestants resolved to meet before hand to appoint some to prosecute the Criminals, which they did: Neither can it be made appear, that any violence was offered to any Person; and all that <hi>Spotswood</hi> saith of it is, <hi>p.</hi> 399. that great Companies came to <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; without mention of Arms or Violence: And indeed the danger was such, as it is no wonder that they who had Zeal for the true Religion were forward to cry for Justice, when they evidently saw that all Methods were used for palliating the matter, land protecting these Criminals, to the manifest hazard of Church and State. The Issue was, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention called by the <hi>King</hi> for trying these Lords, referred the matter to a Commitee, where they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed some Ministers, whom they named, to be present; and to propose what they should think fit. Here is nothing of Ministers ordering the Process, nor of a Rabble in Arms.</p>

up that image, yea, and to give them more power in the Church than was due: But that in these times <hi>Bishops</hi> had ruling Church power (except in 1572, as is said) I utterly deny: Wherefore most of his Citations are wholly beside the purpose. I shall then only examine such of them as seem to make against what I have asserted. He saith <hi>p.</hi> 64. That <hi>the Authority of the Bishops is owned by Act</hi> 63. <hi>Parl.</hi> 5. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. <hi>Ann.</hi> 1575 of which none of our Histories do take any notice: And the Act it self is, <hi>anent the visitation of Hospitals</hi>; all that is said of <hi>Bishops</hi> is, that they, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Diocesses, shall visit Hospitals. I hope here is no Church power allowed them. In the year 1579, Act 71, <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. there is no more said, but that <hi>young Noblemen or others, who had been out of the Country for their breeding, shall at their return go to the Bishop, or Superintendent, or Commissioner of the Kirk.</hi> Neither is this any governing Authority over the Church. The two following Citations are only to shew, that <hi>Bishops</hi> continued 1581, so that of 1587, and several others of his Quotations, design no more, but that <hi>Bishops existed by Law, sat in Parliament, some were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to rich Benefices:</hi> All which is wide from the purpose. He saith that 1584, Act 132, Parl. 8. <hi>Jac.</hi> 6. the <hi>Bishops Authority is fully owned.</hi> It is indeed said in that Act, That <hi>Ministers may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived by the ordinary Bishop of a Diocess; or others the Kings Majesties Commissioners, to be constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Ecclesiastical Causes</hi>: Where it is evident, that Church power is placed in the <hi>King</hi> rather than in the <hi>Bishop:</hi> Who can by this Act do nothing but as he is the <hi>King's Commissioner,</hi> even in censuring of Ministers: If this be a full owning of <hi>Episcopal</hi> power, let him enjoy it: This making them the King's <hi>Bishops</hi> not Christ's; nor is there any thing beside in that Act, which alloweth them any Church power. But we have another Answer to this Quotation: <hi>That Parliament</hi> (saith <hi>Spotswood p</hi> 333) <hi>was declared Current at that time, for the more speedy dispatch of business</hi>; whereas the former was in <hi>October</hi> 1581, and is called in the Records <hi>the seventh Parl</hi>: and this is called the <hi>eighth Parliament</hi>; which is inconsistent with its being Current; or the former Parliament yet subsisting: But some things were to be done, that could not pass in a full Parliament; and therefore, as <hi>Calderwood</hi> hath it, <hi>p.</hi> 155, there was no intimation by Proclamation before the meeting of it; nor reasonable time grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the accustomed order. It was almost ended before it was heard of: The Lords of the Articles were sworn to keep secret the matters to be treated. One of whom, tho' he would not reveal particulars; wrote to a Minister, that the whole intent of that Parliament was against the Kirk and the Discipline of it. These are the Methods by which <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and Erastianism behoved to be supported in these times, when they could have no Countenance from the <hi>Church,</hi> nor from the Nation.</p>
            <p n="56">§. 56. He next citeth a <hi>Conference at Falkland,</hi> 1596 where <hi>some Articles were agreed on, about some Ministers having Vote in Parliament, and that these were confirmed by an Assembly at</hi> Montross 1600, <hi>and there some Bishops Elected for Diocesses.</hi> It is not to be denyed, that there was a working toward <hi>Prelacy</hi> among some Courtiers; and Ambitious Churchmen, about that time: And one of their Methods was, to get some Ministers to Vote in Parliament; the tendency of this was seen, and the thing opposed by good Men: And even in Parliament it met with such opposition, that they hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried it. Yea, the making the <hi>Voter in Parliament</hi> for the Church perpetual, and that he should not be chosen yearly, was carried but by three Votes: However this was the beginning of that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy</hi> that afterward came to a greater height; and the design of setting up <hi>Bishops</hi> did soon appear, however they for a time did labour to cover it. That which I chiefly observe here is, that this stickle that then was made for setting up some Ministers to Vote in Parliament, is an evidence against the whole of this <hi>Manuscript, viz.</hi> That <hi>Bishops</hi> did not then, nor always exist in the <hi>Reformed Church of Scotland</hi>: For if they had, they were the Men who should have sat in Parliament, to represent the Church; and there needed not such steps for bringing them into the Church. The story of Mr. <hi>Dury</hi>'s Recantation at his Death, and owning <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> I find not in any of the Historians that I can meet with; neither hath our Author directed us where to find it: And if it were true, it proveth no more but that all and every one of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were not faithful to the end. For the <hi>General Assembly</hi> at <hi>Brantisland</hi> 1601, which he mentioneth; I have nothing to observe about it: For he alledgeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97831:25"/>
there done toward the advancing of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> Next he telleth us of an <hi>Assembly,</hi> at <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrood House, and of the Kings Clemency to some Ministers:</hi> And <hi>his proposals for Provisions, both for Bishops and Presbyters; this was</hi> 1602. Here is a great mistake: The King did not mention <hi>Bishop</hi> in his Proposals, as they are set down by <hi>Spotswood, p.</hi> 468. The overtures about this were made by the <hi>Assembly</hi> at the Kings desire. Neither are <hi>Bishops</hi> there mentioned. The words are, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Prelacies should be disponed to actual Ministers, Churches annexed thereto being provided sufficiently, and the tenth of the Superplus paid to the King, or otherwise that all the great Benefices be dissolved; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Prelate enjoying the Principal Church and Temporal Lands; and the Churches annexed disponed to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: Both they and the Prelate paying a yearly duty to the King.</hi> Where I take notice, 1. That <hi>Prelate,</hi> in the Dialect of that time, did rather signifie an <hi>Abbot</hi> or <hi>Prior,</hi> than a <hi>Bishop</hi>: At least when ever it is used in the History of that time especially, by <hi>Spotswood,</hi> it comprehendeth all the three. Wherefore, 2. It cannot be gathered from this passage, that <hi>Bishops</hi> did otherwise exist than <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priors</hi>: That is, that some Church-men had the Titles, and some States men had the Revenues; but neither of both had Church Authority above ordinary Ministers. And 3. This is clear, that before this, Men had these <hi>Prelacies</hi> who were not actually Ministers: Which maketh plainly against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of <hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> with Governing power, at that time. 4. The dissolution of all great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, that is there propounded by way of Alternative doth shew, that it was not the mind of that <hi>Assembly</hi> that either <hi>Bishops,</hi> or <hi>Abbots,</hi> or <hi>Priors</hi> should continue so much, as to enjoy the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities that formerly they possessed; so far is it from designing that <hi>Bishops</hi> should be provided for, and advanced, as such: It only provideth for the Minister of the place, where a Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> once ruled.</p>
            <p n="57">§. 57. His Assertion of <hi>the activity of hot headed Presbyters in stirring up prejudices against the Church of England:</hi> And his high Elogies of that Church, which he insisteth on <hi>p.</hi> 66. I shall not stand upon; seing he hath neither mentioned particulars nor given any ground for what he affirmeth. If <hi>Presbyters</hi> were then active to preserve the Government of the Church then established; it was a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and necessary duty, that every one was bound to make Conscience of in his station. For then might they rationally fear that the <hi>King</hi> who had been influenced by some Corrupt Men, to oppose the settling of <hi>Presbytry,</hi> would now be more bent, and had more advantage, to overturn it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it fell out. In the business of the <hi>Assembly at Aberdeen,</hi> which he aggravateth with all his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, I shall not interpose my Opinion: I find it diversly represented, by divers Historians. I am sure whatever he make of it, he cannot draw from it this conclusion, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> then took place in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is the design of his <hi>Manuscript.</hi> The tale that concludeth the <hi>Manuscript</hi> about the <hi>Chancellour</hi> and the <hi>Ministers,</hi> I find not in History, nor are we directed where it is to be sought for, and therefore I neglect it, being assured that these Men who had appeared so much, and with so much hazard, against <hi>Popery,</hi> would not be guilty of conniving at it.</p>
            <p n="58">§ 58. The <hi>Apologist</hi> having transcribed this <hi>Manuscript</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 67. maketh a number of Inferences from it. All which do fall to the ground by the answers already given to the Paper it self, which is the foundation of them: And most of them are particularly obviated in what hath been said. The 1. is answered §. 47. where it is shewed, our Martyrs had no occasion to consider the Government of the Church, being exercised about greater points, that needed Reformation. That the first Reformers submitted to the <hi>Episcopal Jurisdiction</hi> of Protestant <hi>Bishops</hi>; is absolutely false: For he cannot make it appear that any such Jurisdiction was exercised at, or soon after the Reformation. The 2<hi>d.</hi> That <hi>Episcopacy was never legally abolished,</hi> is disproved § 54. That <hi>Presbyterians always watched the difficult Circumstances of the King</hi>; which is the third, is not true: They did in all Circumstances en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to settle the Discipline and Order of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His fourth; asserting the <hi>Presbyterians pleading exemptions from the Secular Powers, as the Papists,</hi> is not only false, but shamelesly affirmed. The 5<hi>th</hi> is answered §. 54<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The 6<hi>th. Episcopacy was not quarrelled, as unlawful in it self, in these times.</hi> Not only is no way deducible from any thing said in the <hi>Manuscript</hi>: But is false; and affirmed against the clearest light that such a matter is capable of: Doth not even the <hi>Book of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> (in which all the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of these times agreed) declare <hi>Episcopacy</hi> to be contrary to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97831:25"/>
word of God; while <hi>cap.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> it saith, <hi>He</hi> (God) <hi>willeth that they should rule with mutual consent as Brethren; with an quality of Power, every one according to their Function. And there are four ordinary Offices in the Kirk of Christ; the Office of Pastor, Minister, or Bishop; the Doctor, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, or Elders and the Deacon:</hi> And after, <hi>no more Offices ought to be received, or suffered in the Church of Christ established according to his word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="59">§. 59. For the Eighth. Whatever he fancy of <hi>the Royal Authority being forced to all that was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Presbyterians</hi>: Let him answer for this Imputation of Hypocrisie and Dissembling in the King that then was; It is enough to us, that the Church Power was granted to <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> by King and Parliament: and that they declared they did it willingly and sincerely. The Tenth (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his wonted Charity and Candor) maketh the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s Book to be <hi>one intire shuffle from top to bottom</hi>: And his ground is, <hi>the Presbyterians of old did some very ill things</hi>: And yet the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor would perswade the World, that Presbyterians are not capable of such Villanies, as the rabbling of the Clergy.</hi> I wish he would learn to speak Truth, and to use a little more Reason in his Discourses. The <hi>Vindicator</hi> hath said nothing of the Capacity of <hi>Presbyterians</hi>: They are sinful Men, and capable of very bad things, if the Lord leave them: All that was asserted (and it is made evident against all h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s attempts) is, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did not do such things, as he, and others of his Gang, charge them with. For these odious things that he chargeth the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of the former age with: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough hath been said for their Vindication by others; tho' I had been silent. Let him read Mr. <hi>Baillies</hi> pieces, and answer them if he can. His impugning of the distinction between <hi>Cameronians</hi> and <hi>Sober Presbyterians,</hi> hath been answered before; but he loveth to repeat, rather than to say nothing. The Eleventh Inference is, That <hi>Presbyterians have no principle of Unity; because the lesser number may remonstrate against the greater, so as to stop the course of Discipline.</hi> This last Clause is groundless: For the greater part of a Church meeting may go on in the exercise of Discipline, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be remonstrated to the contrary, by the lesser part; nor doth the <hi>Manuscript</hi> give any ground to think that Discipline could not be exercised because some did remonstrate against it. For the former part of his Inference, I gladly would know, whether that principle of Unity be owned among his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that none may remonstrate against what the <hi>Bishop</hi> or the greatest part of the meeting doth. If so then the Consciences of Men like <hi>Issachar</hi>'s Asse, must tamely couch under the burden of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is imposed: And if my Lord <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the plurality of his Clergy, decide all the Controversies between us and <hi>Papists</hi> on the side of the <hi>Romish Synagogue,</hi> no man may mutter, or reclaim. It was an ancient Maxim, even in the <hi>Canon Law, Cuivis supplicare &amp; protestari licet.</hi> To deny this is to banish Conscience, or to bring in that Atheist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cal Principle, that our Actions must be directed not by our own, but by <hi>the publick Conscience.</hi> The last Inference doth not differ from the former, but to make up the round dozen, he hath put it in other words which labour under the same evil that he there chargeth others with, <hi>viz. General words, which at the bottom have no particular signification</hi>: For he chargeth us with <hi>Tyranny, Disobedience, poisonous Principles, that we slie in the face of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> &amp;c. And all this made out by the <hi>protestation</hi> against the <hi>General Assembly,</hi> 1651, which he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down at length. We have now (through the mercy of God) buried that unhappy difference. And the Revivers of it should reflect on the Builders of <hi>Jericho</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall only say as before, that to condemn all Protestations and Remonstrances against any company of Men who pretend to Church Authority, or against whatever a Lawful Authority doth, is to take from Ministers, and People, the liberty of professing and owning the Truth of God.</p>
            <p>I have now done with this <hi>Apology.</hi> The Postscript I meddle not with, it is in answer to a Paper. The Author of which can make a Reply, if he thinketh fit.</p>
