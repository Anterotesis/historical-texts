            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>EPISTLE To the WHIGS.</head>
            <p>FOR to whom can I dedicate this Poem, with ſo much juſtice as to you? 'Tis the repreſentation of your own Heroe: 'tis the Picture drawen at length, which you admire and prize ſo much in little. None of your Ornaments are wanting; neither the Landſcap of the Tower, nor the Riſing Sun; nor the <hi>Anno Domini</hi> of your New Soveraign's Goronation. This muſt needs be a gratefull undertaking to your whole Party: eſpecially to thoſe who have not been ſo happy as to purchaſe the Original. I hear the <hi>Graver</hi> has made a good Market of it: all his Kings are bought up already; or the value of the remainder ſo inhanc'd, that many a poor <hi>Polander</hi> who would be glad to worſhip the Image, is not able to go to the coſt of him: But muſt be content to ſee him here. I muſt confeſs I am no great Artiſt; but Sign-poſt painting will ſerve the turn to remember a Friend by; eſpecially when better is not to be had. Yet for your comfort the lineaments are true: and though he ſate not five times to me, as he did to <hi>B.</hi> yet I have conſulted Hiſtory; as <hi>Italian</hi> Painters do, when they wou'd draw a <hi>Nero</hi> or a <hi>Caligula;</hi> though they have not ſeen the Man; they can help their Imagination by a Statue of him, and find out the Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>onius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Truth is, you might have ſpar'd one ſide of your Medall: the Head wou'd be ſeen to more advantage, if it were plac'd on a Spike of the Tower; a little nearer to the Sun.
<pb facs="tcp:44131:3"/>
Which wou'd then break out to better purpoſe. You tell us in your Preface to the <hi>No-proteſtant Plot,</hi> that you ſhall be forc'd hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to leave off your Modeſtie: I ſuppoſe you mean that little which is left you: for it was morn to rags when you put out this Medall. Never was there practis'd ſuch a piece of notorious Impudence in the face of an Eſtabliſh'd Government. <hi>I</hi> believe, when he is dead, you will wear him in Thumb-Rings, as the <hi>Turks</hi> did <hi>Scanderbeg;</hi> as if there were vertue in his Bones to preſerve you againſt Monarchie. Yet all this while you pretend not only zeal for the Publick good; but a due veneration for the perſon of the King. But all men who can ſee an inch before them, may eaſily detect thoſe groſs fallacies. That it is neceſſarie for men in your circumſtances to pretend both, is granted you: for without them there could be no ground to raiſe a Faction. But I would ask you one civil queſtion, what right has any man among you, or any Aſſociation of men, (to come nearer to you) who out of Parliament, cannot be conſider'd in a publick Capacity, to meet, as you daily doe, in Factious Clubs, to vilify the Government in your Diſcourſes, and to libel it in all your Writings? who made you Judges in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> or how is it conſiſtent with your Zeal of the publick welfare, to promote Sedition? Does your definition of loyal, which is to ſerve the King according to the Laws, allow you the licence of traducing the Executive Power, with which you own he is inveſted? You complain that his Majeſtie has loſt the love and confidence of his People: and by your very urging it, you endeavour what, in you lies, to make him loſe them. All good Subjects abhor the thought of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, whether it be in one or many: if you were the Patriots you would ſeem, you would not at this rate incenſe the Multitude to aſſume it: for no ſober man can fear it, either from the King's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or his Practice: or even, where you would odiouſly lay it, from his Miniſters. Give us leave to enjoy the Government and the benefit of Laws under which we were born, and which we deſire to tranſmit to our Poſterity. You are not the Truſtees of the publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: and if you have not right to petition in a Crowd, much leſs have you to intermeddle in the management of Affairs:
<pb facs="tcp:44131:3"/>
or to arraign what you do not like: which in effect is every thing that is done by the King and Council. Can you imagine that any reaſonable man will believe you reſpect the perſon of his Majeſty, when 'tis apparent that your Seditious Pamphlets are ſtuff'd with particular Reflexions on him? If you have the confidence to deny this, 'tis eaſy to be evinc'd from a thouſand Paſſages, which I only forbear to quote, becauſe I deſire they ſhould die and be forgotten. I bave perus'd many of your Papers: and to ſhow you that I have, the third part of your <hi>No-ptoteſtant Plot</hi> is much of it ſtolen, from your dead Author's Pamphlet call'd, the <hi>Growth of Popery:</hi> as manifeſtly as <hi>Milton's</hi> defence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, is from <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan, de jure regni apud Scotos:</hi> or your firſt Covenant, and new Aſſociation, from the holy League of the <hi>French Guiſards.</hi> Any one who reads <hi>Davila,</hi> may trace your Practices all along. There were the ſame pretences for Reformation, and Loyalty, the ſame Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the King, and the ſame grounds of a Rebellion. <hi>I</hi> know not whether you will take the Hiſtorian's word, who ſays it was reported, that <hi>Poltrot</hi> a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> murther'd <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations of <hi>Theodore Beza:</hi> or that it was a <hi>Hugonot</hi> Miniſter, otherwiſe call'd a <hi>Presbyterian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (for our Church abhors ſo deviliſh a Tenent) who firſt writ a Treatiſe of the lawfulneſs of depoſing and murthering Kings, of a different Perſwaſion in Religion: But <hi>I</hi> am able to prove from the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and Principles of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan,</hi> that they ſet the People above the Magiſtrate: which if I miſtake not, is your own Fundamental: and which carries your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty no further than your likeing. When a Vote of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons goes on your ſide, you are as ready to obſerve it, as if it were paſs'd into a Law: But when you are pinch'd with any former, and yet unrepealed <hi>Act of Paliament,</hi> you declare that in ſome caſes, you will not be oblig'd by it. The Paſsage is in the ſame third part of the <hi>No-proteſtant Plot:</hi> &amp; is too plain to be denied. The late Copy of your intended Aſſociation, you neither wholly juſtify nor condemn; But, as the Papiſts, when they are unoppos'd, fly out into all the Pageantry's of Worſhip; but in times of War, when they are hard preſs'd by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:44131:4"/>
lie cloſs intrinch'd behind the <hi>Council of Trent:</hi> So, now, when your Affairs are in a low condition, you dare not pretend that to be a legal Combination, but whenſoever you are afloat, <hi>I</hi> doubt not but it will be maintain'd and juſtify'd to purpoſe. For indeed there is nothing to defend it but the Sword: 'tis the proper time to ſay any thing, when men have all things in their power.</p>
            <p>In the mean time you wou'd fain be nibbling at a parallel betwixt this Aſſociation, and that in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> But there is this ſmall difference betwixt them, that the ends of the one are directly oppoſite to the other: one with the Queens approbation, and conjunction, as head of it: the other without either the conſent, or knowledge of the King, againſt whoſe Authority it is manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. Therefore you do well to have recourſe to your laſt Evaſion, that it was contriv'd by your Enemies, and ſhuffled into the Papers that were ſeiz'd: which yet you ſee the Nation is not ſo eaſy to believe as your own Jury; But the matter is not difficult, to find twelve men in <hi>New-gate,</hi> who wou'd acquit a Malefactour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have one onely favour to deſire of you at parting, that when you think of anſwering this <hi>Poem,</hi> you wou'd employ the ſame Pens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, who have combated with ſo much ſucceſs againſt <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel:</hi> for then you may aſſure your ſelves of a clear Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, without the leaſt reply. Raile at me abundantly; and, not to break a Cuſtome, doe it without wit: By this method you will gain a conſiderable point, which is wholly to wave the anſwer of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Never own the botome of your Principles, for fear they ſhou'd be Treaſon. Fall ſeverly on the miſcarriages of Government for if ſcandal be not allow'd, you are no freeborn ſubjects. If God has not bleſſ'd you with the Talent of Rhiming, make uſe of my poor Stock and welcom: let your Verſes run upon my feet: and for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt refuge of notorious Block-heads, reduc'd to the laſt extremity of ſenſe, turn my own lines upon me, and in utter deſpaire of your own Satyre, make me Satyrize my ſelf. Some of you have been driven to this Bay alreadie; But above all the reſt commend me to the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt Parſon, who writ the <hi>VVhip and Key.</hi> I am afraid it is
<pb facs="tcp:44131:4"/>
not read ſo much as the Piece deſerves becauſe the Bookſeller is every week crying help at the end of his <hi>Gazette,</hi> to get it off. You ſee I am charitable enough to doe him a kindneſs, that it may be publiſh'd as well as printed; and that ſo much skill in Hebrew Derivations, ma not lie for waſt-paper in the Shop. Yet I half ſuſpect he went no far<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther for his learning, than the Index of Hebrew Names and Etymo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logies, which is printed at the end of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles. If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi> ſignify the Brother of a Fool, the Author of that Poem will paſs with his Readers for the next of kin; perhaps' tis the Relation that makes the kindneſs. Whatever the Verſes are; buy 'em up I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you out of pity; for <hi>I</hi> hear the Conventicle is ſhut up, and the Brother of <hi>Achitophel</hi> out of ſervice.</p>
            <p>Now Footmen, you know, have the generoſitie to make a Purſe, for a member of their Society, who has had his Livery pull'd over his Ears: and even Protestant Socks are bought up among you, out of veneration to the name. A Diſſenter in Poetry from Senſe and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, will make as good a Proteſtant Rhymer, as a Diſſenter from the Church of <hi>England</hi> a Proteſtant Parſon. Beſides if you encourage ayoung Beginner, who knows but he may elevate his ſtilea little, above the vulgar Epithets of prophane, and ſawcy Jack, and Atheiſtick Scribler, with which he treats me, when the fit of Enthuſiam is ſtrong upon him: by which well-mannerd and charitable Expreſsions, <hi>I</hi> was certain of his Sect, before <hi>I</hi> knew his name. What wou'd you have more of a man? he has damn'd me in your Cauſe from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations:</hi> And has half the Texts of both the <hi>Teſtaments</hi> againſt me, if you will be ſo civil to your ſelves as to take him for your interpreter; and not to take them for <hi>Iriſh</hi> Witneſſes. After all, perhaps you will tell me, that you retain'd him only for the opening of your Cauſe, and that your main Lawyer is yet behind. Now if it ſo happen he meet with no more reply than his Predeceſsours, you may either conclude, that <hi>I</hi> truſt to the goodneſs of my Cauſe, or fear my Adverſary or diſdain him, or what you pleaſe, for the ſhort on't is, 'tis indifferent to your humble ſervant, whatever your Party ſays or thinks of him.</p>
