            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DEFENCE OF Sir Robert Filmer.</head>
            <p>I AM not of the number of thoſe, who delight to rake in the Aſhes of the Dead; and had this unfortunate Gentleman ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the memory of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> or treated him with more Truth and Generoſity, I would never have appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, how much ſoever I deteſt the Cauſe of his Ruine; for I think Death a ſufficient Puniſhment even for Treaſon, and would rather commiſerate the miſery, and folly of Mankind, in being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſuch lewd, and wicked Practices, as ſhould hurl them into an Ignominious and Untimely Grave, than inſult over them that are ſo <hi>unfortunate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when Perſons of Noble Birth, and great Eſtates, the Favourites of Heaven and Earth; whoſe infancy promiſeth a great Honour and Happineſs to their Country: When theſe Morning Stars, I ſay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and become the Plagues and Miſeries of the Age; when they endeavour to undermine that Throne, which hath diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, or their Anceſtors from the Populace, and affixed deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honours upon their Families, when ſuch as theſe prove not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ungrateful but unnatural, if it were in my power, their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould periſh with them, that when-ever this happened, Poſterity might ſtand amazed at it, as a New and Monſtrous thing.</p>
            <p>But this Gentleman might have claimed from me, a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Pity than ſome other, upon the account of the time of his Birth, and Education. For <hi>he was,</hi> as he tells us in the end of this Paper, <hi>engaged from his Youth in the Old Cauſe,</hi> and had accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cant of thoſe Times imbibed an Opinion, that <hi>God had often wonderfully declared himſelf for it.</hi> And ſome men, being once throughly ſeaſoned with any thing, become thereby ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, that they are never after able to deliver their Souls, and to ſay, is there not a Lye in my right hand! And tho' theſe may juſtly be cut off, they being the worſt, moſt incurable, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Members of a Society, yet Humanity will teach us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49128:3"/>
them with Silence, and Sorrow, as we do the Putrified and Gangreen'd Members of a Living Body.</p>
            <p>But when ſuch as theſe, unſatisfied with the Miſchief they have done in their Lives, ſhall endeavour to intail their <hi>Ills</hi> upon Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and defame the Memory of Virtuous Men, who are dead, and not able to anſwer for themſelves, this is ſo Barbarous, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, that I think every man is obliged to defend the Common Intereſt, who would be willing to have his Good Name flouriſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death. And this, and nothing elſe, hath engaged my Pen on the behalf of a Gentleman, who was known to me by nothing but his Learned, and Ingenious Works, and in all probability died when I was an Infant.</p>
            <p>I will be as ſhort, and put as little Gall into my Ink, as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for the ſake of Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Relations, and if I happen to ſpeak ſome things, that have been ſaid by others upon this very Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per before, I humbly beſpeak the Pardon of the World, for I have not ſeen one of thoſe Papers, that have been Printed upon it.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Seaſon of the Year, the Infirmities of his Age, encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a cloſe Impriſonment of above five Months, might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as reaſonable Cauſes, why he ſhould not ſpeak much at his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; yet in my poor judgment, they will afford him little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe either for what he hath, or what he hath not delivered in Writing, ſince he was pleaſed to take that way: For it had been as eaſy, and much more becoming a Chriſtian, a Subject, and a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, as he ſeems deſirous to be thought, to have told the World, whether he were Guilty, or not, of the things laid to his Charge, than to Arraign his Judges; to have exhorted the People to Loyalty and Obedience towards their Gracious King, and to have prayed for the Peace, and Proſperity of his Prince, and Country, as to complain of the Age, and yet at the ſame time endeavour to make it worſe, by an unſeaſonable, and unbecoming Declamation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We live,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in an Age that maketh Truth paſs for Treaſon: I dare not ſay any thing contrary unto it, and the Ears of thoſe that are about me will probably be found too tender to hear it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very ſtrange, that Truth and Treaſon ſhould of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch near Allies, that a cautious, a dying man ſhould fear they might be miſtaken one for the other on the Scaffold. A modeſt man at that time would have looked a little jealouſly howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon ſuch a parcel of Truths, and have ſuſpected them for falſhoods, and deluſions, or at leaſt have ſuſpended his Judgment for a few Minutes, till Death might have diſſipated that Miſt of Mortality, which as probably might have miſled him, as all thoſe that were about him.</p>
            <p>But whatever his Opinion was, there was no reaſon for the Complaint, whatever he had ſpoken, or written could make his Condition no worſe in this World. And he knew, no man better, that the Age in which we live permits a licentious Liberty to all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tacit. H. Lib.</hi> 1.</note>
               <hi>—Rara Temporum faelicitate, ubi ſentire quae velis, &amp; quae ſentias dicere licet,</hi> to think what they pleaſe, and to ſpeak (almoſt) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49128:3"/>
they think, at leaſt I believe this Rare Felicity, was never more abuſed, than in the Age in which we live; and if there were never another Inſtance to be given of it, the Printing his Paper would ſatisfie Poſterity, this Complaint was neither reaſonable nor well grounded.</p>
            <p>But, alas! this Gentleman had taken up a Set of Opinions, which are, and ever will be accounted Treaſons in all Governments, but Pure Democracies, to the end of the World. And I am perſwaded the Pretended Common-Wealth of <hi>England</hi> would hardly have endured ſuch Doctrines, as he hath broached in this Paper: At leaſt I am ſure it was contrary to their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>What he hath ſaid concerning the Evidence given againſt him, and the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> I ſhall leave to others, my Chief concern being with the Papers, and not with them, neither as they were produced to prove Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> Guilty, but as written againſt Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s Patriarcha, or, the Natural Power of Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> (the Teſtimony by word of Mouth) <hi>being laid aſide,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the whole Matter is reauced to the Papers, ſaid to be found in my Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet by the Kings Officers, without any other Proof of their being Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by me, than what is taken from Suppoſitions, upon the Similitude of an Hand, that is eaſily Counterfeit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But was it only ſaid, that they were found in his Cloſet? Was it not Sworn by a Gentleman, againſt whoſe Credit Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> had nothing to object, at the Tryal? And was not all the care ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable taken that no Counterfeit Papers might be foiſted in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by Sealing them up in a Trunk,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tryal. p.</hi> 21.</note> and Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired  to ſet his Seal too on them for his further aſſurance? Such groundleſs, and almoſt impoſſible Surmiſes as theſe, betray a bad Cauſe ſupported with much wilfulneſs.</p>
            <p>But that which follows is much worſe. For tho' we ſhould grant it no very difficult thing to Counterfeit a Name, or a few Lines, who can think ſo large a Diſcourſe, as that Printed in his Tryal, and yet it was not the fiftieth part of the whole, that was produced, and not the tenth of that offered to be read, as he tells us in this  Paper.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 2.</note> Can any man in his right Wits, think, any man could, or would counterfeit at this prodigious rate? He tells us in his Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, If theſe Papers are right it mentions 200 and odd Sheets.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 34.</note> A  bold and unheard of Undertaking, to pretend to Counterfeit ſo much. And ſtrange muſt be the Legerdemain that could get them into the Study ſo opportunely. <hi>Quae ſic mihi narras, incredulus odi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the crafty Rogue did not only Counterfeit his Hand ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, that they, that were beſt acquainted with it, ſwore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was all written by Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> but hit his Judgment too; ſo that he ſaid at his Tryal, <hi>I do not know whether they are my own or no,</hi> (which if they had been Counterfeit, he could not have ſaid) <hi>but theſe very Papers, ſuch as they are, do abhor, as much as any one can, ſuch a Deſign.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 32.</note>Which he could never have ſaid nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,  if that had been the firſt time he had ever ſeen them: As he ſeems to inſinuate at his Tryal, <hi>p.</hi> 26. when he replyed, <hi>My Lord, let him give an account of it</hi> (the Libel) <hi>that did it.</hi> Nor hath he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49128:4"/>
retracted one Title in this his laſt Paper, of that which was read at his Tryal, but rather confirmed it, and in all probability the Truths, he ſo feared would be taken for Treaſons, may all be found in thoſe Papers. I had not inſiſted ſo long on this, but to ſhew the temper of the man, and to ſhew the Reader how juſt it is, he ſhould not too eaſily believe the Account he gives of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on thus, <hi>But if I had been ſeen to Write them, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would not be much altered, They plainly appear to relate unto a large Treatiſe written long ſince, in Anſwer to</hi> Filmer<hi>'s Book, which by all Intelligent men is thought to be grounded upon Wicked Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, equally pernicious unto Magiſtrates and People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, if there was ſo little in it, why was all this pains taken to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate an Opinion into the minds of men, that they might poſſibly (for he no where affirms it poſitively) be Counterfeit? And it was much leſs excuſable to do it in this Paper, than at his Tryal: Here he ought to have laid by all his Arts, and Diſguiſes, and with the freedom of a dying man have told the world, whether that Libel were his, or no, for whatever he might think at the Bar, he was ſure on the Scaffold it could not hurt him any further.</p>
            <p>But as nice as he is in this, he tells us pretty roundly, what his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is of <hi>Filmer</hi>'s Book, and no man muſt paſs for an Intelligent man, who ſhall preſume to be of another judgment. In very good time! Are all the Intelligent men in the world become Republicans? For I am confident no other man can approve of this Cenſure; and it will poſe a wiſer man, than he ever was, to prove any one of Sir <hi>R. Filmer's</hi> Principles (without wreſting) wicked or pernicious to any other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, or People, but ſuch as have itching Fingers to be plucking down their Princes, and calling them to account, and revenging their own ſuppoſed Wrongs on them. And for ſuch Magiſtrates, ſuch People, none but Traytors would concern themſelves in a Monarchy, any otherwiſe than to deteſt and abhor them and their pernicious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>Having thus paſſed a general Cenſure upon Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi>'s Book, he comes in the next place to a more particular, which runs thus,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 2.</note>
               <hi>If he might publiſh unto the world his Opinion, That all men are born under a Neceſſity derived from the Laws of God and Nature, to ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an abſolute Kingly Government, which could be reſtrained by no Laws or Oath; and that he, that hath the Power, whether he came unto it by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Election, Inheritance, Uſurpation, or any other way, had the Right, and none muſt oppoſe his Will, but the Perſons, and Eſtates of his Subjects muſt be indiſpenſably ſubject unto it; I know not why I might not have publiſhed my Opinion to the contrary, without the breach of any Law, I have yet known.</hi>

            <p>Theſe are his words, and it is my duty to enquire how far he hath truly repreſented Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s judgment.</p>
            <p>And as to his firſt Propoſition, <hi>That all men are born, &amp;c.</hi> I believe he will not be able to ſhew it me <hi>in terminis</hi> any where in Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi>'s Works, but I think I can ſhew him the contrary, <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> p. 6.</p>
            <p>I am not to queſtion, or quarrel at the Rights, or Liberties of This, or any Other Nation, my task is chiefly to enquire from whom Theſe firſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49128:4"/>
came, not to diſpute what, or how many theſe are; but whether they were derived from the Laws of Natural Liberty, or from the Grace and Bounty of Princes. My deſire and hope is, that the People of <hi>England</hi> may, and do enjoy as ample Priviledges, as any Nation under Heaven; the greateſt Liberty in the World (if it be duly conſidered) is for a People to live under a Monarch, it is the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of this Kingdom, all other ſhews or pretexts of Liberty, are but ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Slavery, and a Liberty only to deſtroy Liberty.</p>
            <p>And after this, <hi>pag.</hi> 53. he hath theſe words, <hi>Indeed the world for a long time knew no other ſort of Government, but only Monarchy. The beſt Order, the greateſt Strength, the moſt Stability, and Eaſieſt Government, are to be found all in Monarchy, and in no other Form of Government.</hi> And he doth every where prefer Monarchy before all other Forms, but that he hath any where condemned Ariſtocracies, or Democracies, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of God, and Nature, is not to be ſhewn in him; tho' at the ſame time he owns Monarchy, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did, to be the Firſt, the Natural, and the Divineſt Form of Government, <hi>p.</hi> 53. But to infer from hence, That all men are born under a Neceſſity, derived from the Laws of God and Nature, to ſubmit unto an abſolute Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is ſuch a Conſequence as nothing but paſſion could draw from thoſe Principles. <note n="*" place="margin">Grotius de jure Belli &amp; pacis. l, 2.

               </note> That is free from the Coactive Power of Laws, as Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi> hath it p. 91. So that what ever he doth, his Subjects cannot call him to an account, or puniſh him. Tho' I ſay theſe things are Eſſential to all Monarches, as ſuch; yet it will not preſently follow, that all Monarches have equal Powers, becauſe tho' at firſt they were all equal, yet ſince ſome of them have granted to their Subjects greater Priviledges, than others have; and ſo, tho' the People cannot claim them, as Natural Liberties, nor reſiſt their Princes with Force, and Arms, if they be invaded: Yet they may petition them, to continue to them the Grace, and Bounty of their Anceſtors. And ſuch Princes are bound ſo to do, not out of Fear of puniſhment from their Subjects, but that they may have the Love, and Advance the Welfare of their Subjects, which is indeed their own.</p>
            <p>That this is agreeable to Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> appears, pag. 93. <hi>(Sect.</hi> 6.) Now albeit Kings, who make the Laws, be (as King <hi>James</hi> doth teach us) above the Laws; yet will they rule their Subjects by the Law; and a King Governing in a Setled Kingdom, leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, ſo ſoon as he ſeems not to Rule according to his Laws; yet where he ſees the Laws rigorous, or doubtful, he may mitigate, and interpret. And a little after, altho' a King do frame all his Actions to be according to the Laws, yet he is not bound
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49128:5"/>
thereto, but at his good will, and for good example; Or ſo far forth as the General Law of the ſafety of the Common-weale doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bind him; for in ſuch ſort, only Poſitive Laws may be ſaid to bind the King, not by being Poſitive, but as they are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Beſt or Only means for the preſervation of the Common-Wealth. By this means are all Kings, even Tyrants and Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, bound to preſerve the Lands, Goods, Liberties and Lives of all their Subjects, not by any municipal Laws of the Land, ſo much as the Natural Law of a Father, which binds them to ratifie the Acts of their Fore-fathers and Predeceſſors, in things neceſſary for the Publick Good of their Subjects.</p>

            <p>His next Complaint is, <hi>That,</hi> according to Sir <hi>R. Filmer, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power could not be reſtrained by any Oaths.</hi> Now let us ſee, in the next place, what <hi>Filmer</hi> ſaith for that, and we ſhall find it, Patriarcha, <hi>pag.</hi> 95. (7.) Others there be that affirm, that although Laws of themſelves do not bind Kings, yet the Oaths of Kings, at their Coronations, tye them to keep all the Laws of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. How far this is true, let us but examine the Oath of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> at their Coronation, the Words whereof are theſe. <hi>Art thou pleaſed to cauſe to be Adminiſtred in all thy Judgments indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and upright Juſtice, and to uſe diſcretion with Mercy and Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Art thou pleaſed that our upright Laws and Cuſtoms be obſerved, and doſt thou promiſe, that thoſe ſhall be Protected and Maintained by thee?</hi> Theſe are the Articles of the Kings Oath, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Laity, or Subjects in general; to which the King anſwers affirmatively; being firſt demanded by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, Pleaſeth you to confirm and obſerve the Laws and Cuſtoms of Anticot Times granted from God, by juſt and devout Kings, unto the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation, by Oath unto the ſaid People, eſpecially the Laws, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Cuſtoms, granted unto the Clergy and Laity by the Famous King</hi> Edward. We may obſerve, in theſe Words of the Articles of the Oath, that the King is required to obſerve not All the Laws, but only the Upright, and that with Diſcretion, and Mercy. The word, Upright, cannot mean all Laws, becauſe in the Oath of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Second, I find evil, and unjuſt Laws mentioned, which the King ſwears to aboliſh.—So that in effect the King doth Swear to keep no Laws, but ſuch as in his Judgment are Upright, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49128:5"/>
thoſe not literally always, but according to the Equity of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, joyned with Mercy, which is properly the Office of a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor rather than of a Judge; and if a King did ſtrictly ſwear to obſerve all the Laws, he could not without Perjury give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Repealing, or Abrogating of any Statute by Act of Parliament, which would be very miſchievable to the State.</p>
            <p>But let it be ſuppoſed for truth, that Kings do ſwear to obſerve all the Laws of their Kingdoms, yet no man can think it reaſon, that Kings ſhould be more bound by their voluntary Oaths, than common Perſons are by theirs. Now if a private Perſon make a Contract, either with Oath, or without Oath, he is no further bound than the Equity, and Juſtice of the Contract ties him; for a man may have relief againſt an unreaſonable, and unjuſt promiſe, if either Deceit, or Errour, or Force, or Fear induced him thereunto; or if it be hurtful, or grievous in the performance. Since the Laws in many Caſes give the King a Prerogative above common perſons, I ſee no reaſon, why he ſhould be denied the Priviledge, which the Meaneſt of his Subjects doth enjoy.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi>'s own words, and now let the Reader judge, whether Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> have truly repreſented him in this particular. I come now to his next particular, which is about acquiring the Right of Dominion, wherein Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> repreſents Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi>'s Opinion in theſe words: <hi>And that he, that hath the Power, whether he came unto it by Creation, Election, Inheritance, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>jurpation, or any other way, had the Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, had an equal right, for ſo it muſt be underſtood. Now of theſe, the firſt, <hi>Creation,</hi> is not mentioned in Sir <hi>R. Filmer,</hi> and is non-ſenſe, when it is applyed to a Soveraign Prince; the other two, <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Inheritance,</hi> are not quarrel'd; but upon the laſt, Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> ſpends all his forces: Before I conſider what he hath ſaid, I will repreſent Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi> in his own words. <hi>Patriarcha, pag.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it pleaſe God for the Correction of the Prince, or Puniſhment of the People, to ſuffer Princes to be removed, and others to be placed in their rooms, either by the Factions of the Nobility, or Rebellion of the People; in all ſuch Caſes, the Judgment of God, who hath power to give and to take away Kingdoms, is moſt juſt; yet the Miniſtry of Men, who execute Gods Judgments without Commiſſion, is ſinful and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

There is, and always ſhall be continued to the end of the World, a Natural Right of a Supreme Father over every Multitude, although by the ſecret Will of God, many at firſt do moſt unjuſtly obtain the Exerciſe of it.</hi>

But if the Right Heir, or Family fail, or is extinguiſhed; then that Obligation fails, and the Event is to be taken as the declaration of the Will of God, and the Heirs of the Uſurper will have a good Title againſt any other Perſon, or Family, in the World; who can have no right to Uſurp upon them, becauſe their Anceſtors did ſo upon another preceding Family. And this is for the Peace, and Welfare of the World. And that Injury, which Uſurpers do, is reſerved to the Juſtice of a Righteous, and Almighty God, who will puniſh them ſeverely in the next world, if they eſcape in this: But on the other ſide, if there ſhould be left an Eternal Liberty to Subjects, and other men, to revenge from one Generation to another, one Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation with another, the World would be turned into an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> a Field of Blood, to the ruine of many thouſands of poor innocent ſouls.</p>
            <p>His laſt Complaint in this Paragraph is, That, according to Sir <hi>R. F. None muſt oppoſe His</hi> (the Princes) <hi>Will, but the Perſons and Eſtates of His Subjects muſt be indiſpenſably ſubject unto it.</hi> Now, if by Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing be underſtood Reſiſting, I yield him the point; and I think it is the only point, in which he hath truly repreſented Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi>'s Judgment.</p>
            <p>Now, in Anſwer to this, I ſay, <hi>1ſt.</hi> That in every Society, or Community under Heaven, that is <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Licet ſingulae per ſe ſpectatae (Communita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) perfecta ſunt: tamen illa, quae eſt pars al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius, ſub hac ratiene imperfecta eſt, non abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutè, ſed comparatè, ſeu reſpectivè.</hi> Suarez de leg. <hi>L.</hi> 1. c. 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 19.</note> perfect within it ſelf, and doth not depend upon another, there muſt be an abſolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable Power fixed ſome where, which may indiſpenſably, and irreſiſtably diſpoſe of the Eſtates, and Perſons od the Subjects within that Society, or Community. For if every man be left at liberty to diſpoſe of his own Eſtate, and Perſon, as he pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then can he have no Protection but what his own Natural Force will afford him, and that will certainly be overpowred at one time or other, by others.</p>
            <p>Without this, there can be no juſtice Adminiſtred within the Society; for if every particular man may be Judge in his own caſe, the right will certainly be aſſerted on both ſides, tho' it really can be but on one; no Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor will ever condemn himſelf, nor ſubmit to Juſtice, if he can and may reſiſt, and if a War happen, every man will be for ſaving his own Goods from the expence, his own Perſon from the danger of it.

            <p>Now if he (Mr. <hi>Sidney)</hi> did not know, that he might not publiſh his Opinion to the contrary of theſe things, he was very ignorant, but <hi>ignorantia Legis excuſat neminem,</hi> eſpecially when the ignorance is wilful, or but pretended, that a man may with impunity inſtill Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Principles into the Rabble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I might as freely, and as publickly have declared my Thoughts, and the reaſons upon which they were grounded, and I perſwaded to believe: That God had left Nations unto the liberty of ſetting up ſuch Governments, as beſt pleaſed themſelves.</hi>

            <p>And when <hi>Adam</hi> died, his Authority died not with him, for God had before determined on whom it ſhould deſcend, when he told enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Cain,</hi> that his brother <hi>Abels</hi> Deſire ſhould be ſubject to him, and he ſhould rule over him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7.

So that here is an Hereditary Monarchy ſetled by God himſelf in the very infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Mankind, as Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi> hath proved more at large.</p>
            <p>And it belongs to Mr. <hi>Sidney,</hi> and ſuch as he, to ſhew when, and how Nations, or, more properly ſpeaking, the Subjects in Nations, obtained this Liberty. The firſt Nations, after the Flood, had diſtinct Fathers, and are called the Children of their Founder, and were no otherwiſe ſubject to him, than as they were his Children, and it is apparent, that for many hundreds of years, all the Governments of the World were Monarchies, and that the firſt Kingdoms were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, and hereditary.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch a beginning of Mankind, and ſuch a propagation of them, is not conſiſtent with Mr. <hi>Sidneys</hi> Liberty of ſetting up what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment beſt pleaſed themſelves; why were not <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children left at liberty after his death? Why ſhould God ſubject <hi>Eve</hi> to her husband, <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Cain,</hi> if he were ſuch a lover of Equality? Was it not as eaſy to have made 20000 Men and Women as one, and would they not have peopled the World, in much leſt time than one Man, and his Wife? Nay, why did he not make one of either Sex here at firſt, as he did in all the other Creatures? Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi> will give you the reaſon of this, p. 30. out of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, God made all mankind of one Man, that he might teach the World, to be Governed by a King, and not by a Multitude.</hi>

            <p>Now if any man will pretend to oppoſe Reaſons, againſt plain matter of Fact recorded, he will diſcover nothing but his folly, if he own the Bible for the Word of God; his impiety, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</p>
            <p>I conclude then, if the Multitude have any ſuch liberty now, they had it not from the beginning, and therefore their Advocates muſt produce their Charter, and make good their Title, or elſe I can ſee no more reaſon to believe them, than the Devil, when he told our Saviour, <note place="margin">

               <hi>All this Power will I give thee, and the Glory of them, for that is delivered to me, and to whomſoever I will, I give it.</hi> The Devil hath put in his Claim too, and pretends a Deed of Gift, and, I believe, can as eaſily produce it, as the People can theirs.</p>

This depends upon the former, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not deſerve an anſwer, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe much ſtreſs is laid upon it of late, I will reply to it: The Term of Magiſtrate is very improper in this place, becauſe it denotes a Subordinate <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>In ſhort, if God be the Author and Giver of Kingdoms, this Argument is a ſham, a deluſion; if he be not, but they are of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inſtitution, then there may be ſomething in it. But becauſe the firſt of theſe contradicts the whole current of Scripture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will take more time to prove it to an Unbeliever, than I can ſpair now; and to others it need not be proved.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now this is juſt as wiſe, as that which went before, for how came Countiers by Laws? Were Princes before Laws, or Laws before Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? did the Multitude firſt make Laws, and then chuſe Princes to execute them? Or did Princes give Laws to their Subjects? Were our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws for inſtance, made by our Princes or no? Go to  the Heathen, and he will tell thee, <note place="margin">

So that this is a very ſilly Propoſition, and the Allegiance which we owe to our Soveraign, and our Anceſtors ow'd to his, is the cauſe of our ſubmiſſion to the Laws, and not the Laws, the cauſe of our ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, and them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe all this be granted, what follows? Why nothing, but that Princes ſhould be as careful, as is poſſible, to keep their Laws in exerciſe, and not to break their Oaths.

Which is the moſt</hi> Temperate of all Powers, <hi>conſulting the Welfare of the Children, and preferring their Good before its own. It is a long time before a Father can reſolve to cut off one of his own limbs, and when he hath unwillingly done it, could wiſh it on again; and in the Act groans, and delays a long time before he doth it. For he ſeems to Condemn willingly, who does it quickly; to puniſh unjuſtly, who doth it too ſeverely. The People of</hi> Rome, <hi>in our memory, almoſt ſlew</hi> Erixion, <hi>a Gentleman, in the Market-place, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcourged his Son to death; for the Authority of</hi> Auguſtus Caeſar <hi>could hardly deliver him from the inraged Hands of the</hi> Roman <hi>Fathers and Children.</hi>

            <p>And now let any man read Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi>'s <hi>Patriarcha,</hi> and ſee if he have aſcribed one dram of Power to Princes, which will not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſpring, and ariſe from Supreme Paternal Power. Which how much ſoever Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> may diſlike it, is no Exorbitant height.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond period, or member of this Paragraph, the allowing unto Uſurpers, all the rights belonging unto Princes, upon which Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> ſo enlargeth himſelf, in diſplaying the miſchiefs that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, I have formerly ſet forth Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi> in his own words, by which it will appear, how little reaſon, he hath given for ſuch a declamation.</p>
            <p>For firſt he calls it a judgment <hi>of God, for the correction of the Prince or a Puniſhment of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly. <hi>Tho' in this he acknowledgeth God's juſtice, yet he declared the Act to be ſinful, and damnable in them that do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this will make a Man a moſt dangerous Enemy unto Kings, how yet can Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> pretend to correct him, who in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paper allows the expulſion of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> the inſurrection againſt <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> the Slaughter of <hi>Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> to be good Acts of State; and will not allow <hi>Pipin,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> to be Uſurpers, becauſe they did it by the Conſent of Willing Nations? So that we may ſet our hearts at reſt, for there never was, nor ever ſhall be an Uſurper, except ſuch as having good Titles do not think it neceſſary to Cajole the People, but preſuming upon that, enter the Government without the Leave of Mr. <hi>Multitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He concludes his reaſons againſt Uſurpers, Thus. <hi>This is the Scope of the whole Treatiſe; (viz.</hi> That, part of which was at the Tryal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt him) <hi>the Writer gives ſuch reaſons as at preſent did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur unto him to prove it. This ſeems to agree with the Doctrines of all times, Nations, and Religions; the Beſt and Wiſeſt of all Kings have ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it.—the Scriptures ſeem to declare it;</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now it is a little wonderful, that he ſhould be ſo well acquainted with a piece that was Counterfeit, and laid in his Study; but yet it is much more wonderful, that there ſhould even ſeem (tho' but to him) to be ſuch an Agreement about the power of the People, in ſetting up ſuch Governments as beſt pleaſed them; that the People are judge of all differences that happen between them and their Prince; that he muſt be content to ſubmit his Intereſt unto theirs, ſince he is no more then any one of them, in any other, Reſpect than that, he is by the Conſent of all, raiſed above any other. <note place="margin">

            <p>Indeed the Heathen Philoſophers, and Hiſtorians, being ignorant of the true Hiſtory of the Creation, do generally ſeem to think, that Regall power (which they all own to have been the firſt form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,) was introduced by the conſent of the People, and thus <hi>Cicero</hi> expreſſeth it,<note place="margin">

            <p>But with Chriſtianity this Doctrine expired; and all the Fathers and Ancient Chriſtians without exception, looked upon God as the Author of Kingly Government, and the Giver of Kings, I will quote only one, St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi>

            <p>Of this the Scriptures give ſeveral Examples, and ſome of them have proved excellent Princes, But then ſuch Princes have ever had Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, or Protectors.</p>
            <p>But this Gentleman ſeems to yield the Point, when he ſaith, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be</hi> (any Prince) <hi>could deduce his pedigree from the Eldeſt Son of</hi> Noah, <hi>and ſhew, that the ſucceſſion had ſtill continued in the Eldeſt of the Eldeſt Line, and been ſo deducted to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, what if a Prince could do this? then it ſeems Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> would allow him a right to his Crown without the conſent of the people,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49128:10"/>
which muſt be by the right of Primogeniture, and Nature. Well, there is certainly ſuch a man in the World, how came the people in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation by his right?</p>
            <p>If any Prince ſhould pretend a Right to an Univerſal Monarchy, I think it were but reaſonable, he ſhould be put to make out his Title, according to Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Rule; but ſeeing no body does ſo, to the beſt of my knowledge, it is but reaſonable that all Princes ſhould in the mean time enjoy what they are in lawful poſſeſſion of, till this Heir of <hi>Noah</hi> hath make out his Pedigree and Title, and then they may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der further of it.</p>
            <p>And in the interim, Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> will certainly be wiped out of Mr. <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi> Calendar of Saints, and Martyrs, for thus betraying their Caſe to the Kings, and Princes of the World, who will never now willingly ſurrender their Crowns, and Scepters, but ſtill pretend (when all other Arguments fail) they keep them to the uſe of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Heir general.</p>
            <p>Thus I have, with as much brevity as I could, anſwered what ever I have remarked, in this Paper or the Tryal, that doth particularly relate to Sir <hi>R. Filmer;</hi> and if the Reader will but be pleaſed to read that piece himſelf, it will abundantly ſatisfie him, that all Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi>'s Clamour againſt it is cauſeleſs, and unreaſonable, the ſole Effect of paſſion, intereſt, prejudice, and ſuch other humane infirmities.</p>
            <p>For tho' this is a <hi>Poſthumous</hi> piece, and for want of the laſt hand of that Learned Gentleman, is not ſo full, and perfect as he might have made it, yet there are ſuch threads of Learning, Truth, Modeſty, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and Prudence, run through every part of it, that the Reader will think his pains abundantly recompenſed.</p>
