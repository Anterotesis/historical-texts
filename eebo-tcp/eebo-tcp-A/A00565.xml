         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

being of great fame by her conuersation and science, by counsell of them all, she was chosen to be Pope: But in the Papall seate by her familiar friend, shee became preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with childe, yet vnskilfull of the time that women recon for their birth-right: when shee was tending her iourney from Saint <hi>Peters</hi> vnto <hi>Lateran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now because that my Lord the Pope, dooth alwaies shunne that place, that way: it is beleeued on all sides that he doth it for detestation, and hate of that fact. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it put into the Catelogue of the holy high Priestes, as well for the sex of her womanhood, as for the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of so fowle a deede.

he but gathered these and other things too, as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the Proaeme, beginning his Chronicle doth well signifie? And besides that <hi>Mariane</hi> in the verie entry of his worke doth rehearse, out of whose monuments hee heaped vp this story, who were eyther all of them inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then, or else done to dust some where, or being dead, they were dismembred and lay hid, not any aliue. But if it were true that <hi>Martine</hi> was the first that euer commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this to writing, shall we therefore thinke it to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Many thinges certes in stories both diuine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane we read of, the which their owne Authors hauing heard it of olde men, their elders and betters, did first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any others comprehend it in writing.</p>
            <p>And should we therefore doubt in ambiguitie of the truth of all these writers and matters? <hi>Anastasins</hi> the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Librarie (they alleadge with others) in that same time suruiuers being Chroniclers, doe make no mention of <hi>Ione</hi> the woman High-priest.

Let vs erre therfore with the multitude, in this matter: albeit it may appeare that this that I haue said, is out of those things, which may be, by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssibility beleeued to be true.

nothing then fearing the offence of the potentate, who (it may be thought) was nothing offended with this verity. No man euer before this time did deny this history, no man tooke it greeuously, no man contradicted it, no man call it in question, it being Dedicated to the very Popes themselues to the Cardinals, to the Abbots, by the Authors of this story. And these for the most part were Italians, neighbours to the great Pope, and therefore more worthy of our beleefe in this, for that they might sooner and easier get notice of these matters, then other strangers, both by the relation and report of theyr seniors, as also by the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries neare at hand.</p>
