            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

at their wits end what to say or do; they resolued to publish a counterfeit and pretensed answere, rather then none at all; so to stay in some sort at the least, the outcryes &amp; exclamations of the people against them. And to the ende, their couzonage and legier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaine should not be espyed, if that were a thing possible to bee done and effected: their scurrilous Libell, (which containeth onely fiue Chapters in all,) is fraught with nothing else for the foure first, but with notorious lyes, antichristian speeches, vain bragges, railing words, couzoning trickes, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous asseverations, most slaunderous and false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations. Yea, of fiue partes, one only is reserued, for their pretensed answere to my booke. I say (of their pretensed answere,) because all the Iesuits,<note place="margin">

                  </note> or at the least the best of them, aswell beyond the seas, as in this kingdome, gaue their best aduise for the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof. Now if any man demaund the cause, why they bestir themselues so much, waste so much pretious time, &amp; spend so many Chapters in things meerely impertinent and plaine by-matters: mee thinketh I can not answere that question more fitly, then by relating their owne words in their scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and shamelesse Libell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> albeit by them intended to an other purpose.</p>
               <p>These are their expresse words: If he be such a sincere writer, as he protesteth, &amp; so consideratiue and respectiue in the penning of his bookes, that no suspition of misreporting, or corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can be iustly fastned vpon him: then doth it euidently followe,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that of force and meere necessitie it must be graunted, that the Papists haue great dissentions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> among them, euen in matters of Faith. Secondly, that their very best doctors, be the bane of the Pope, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and the Popes religion. Thirdly, that it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, that I make challenge vpon challenge, and stil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> remaine vnanswered. Fourthly, that those doctors whom they take for their friends, and doe relie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, stand in open field against them, as if they were their sworne enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1607:8"/>Fiftly, that many Papists begin to stagger, and to stand in doubt of the popish Religion; and that by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> reading of my bookes, as by an Instrument vnder God in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that the libeller himselfe hath bene assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> with that which hath beene gathered out of my bookes.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, that the doctrine deliuered in my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> books, is verie markable in euery mans eye. Blessed be our Lord God, for all his mercies and fauours to this our Church of England. Wee see here, (gentle Reader,) that the Papists generally, euen the Iesuits and Seminarie-Priests, begin to feare the ruine and downe-fall of Poperie. One thing the Reader must heere remember; that the first foure notes or obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations are respectiue, &amp; must be vnderstood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally; viz. that if the Papists doe not confute my bookes effectually; then must they all and euery of them perforce and of necessitie, be truly verified of the papists, &amp; of their popish religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It therfore stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Papists vpon, to answere me both directly and soundly; for else destruction of necessitie must come vpon them, and breake the necke of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie. This confession, (God be praised,) I haue by insoluble reasons, and euident demonstrations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from their owne pennes. But (gentle Reader) they will neuer answere my bookes till the worlds end, because they cannot; and consequently, euen by their owne free confession, (which is to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,) Poperie must haue a downefal: the sooner, the
<pb facs="tcp:1607:9"/>
better. Amen: the case is cleere and evident, euen to euery child. For they that haue bene buzzing about the answering of my bookes these many yeares,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke this well. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied.</hi>
                  </note> and confesse freely withall, that the life of their Poperie depends vppon the confutation of my bookes, and thereupon haue assaid all meanes they could deuise; haue no doubt made choyse of those small parcels, with which they thought themselues most able to deale. VVherein for al that, they haue done nothing else indeede; but onely laid open to the viewe of the world, their great malice and extreame folly. VVhich (if I bee not deceiued,) euery indifferent Reader will affirme with mee, so soone as hee hath perused this my briefe &amp; plaine discourse; so briefe and succinct, as none (I thinke,) will deeme it tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; so sound and sincere, as none can iustly and truly reproue it; and so plaine, facile, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, as euery childe may vnderstand the same. For if I doe not soundly, pithily, and effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Libeller; yea, euen turne him out of his skin, I will be content and well pleased, to lose my life for my paines. And let the Reader thus perswade himselfe, bcause euident reason conuinceth it to be so; that if the Iesuits and Iesuited Papists are not able to make good against mee, those sillie snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and pieces of my bookes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Iesuits and all other Iesuited Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, are here goared to death.</hi>
                  </note> whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue made the choyse; that much lesse are they able to confute my whole workes. No, no, they doe in effect confesse so much, while they dare neither answere any one booke of all, nor
<pb facs="tcp:1607:9"/>
yet any one Chapter wholy; heere and there, an odde piece or sentence. I protest vnto the gentle Reader, that I partly blush on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</p>

well, all this notwithstanding, I haue so mangled and maymed him with my dartes, and so wounded him with my bullets; that the scarres and markes will bee seene vpon him, so long as he liueth in this world. In his fift and last Chapter, (though he hath dealt very sparingly in answering those fewe sentences, whereof he made his choyse,) I wil God willing, so bicker, skirmish, and grapple with him; as I shal nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaue him one whole bone in his skin, nor one tooth in his head, nor yet one haire on his beard. That done, I will send him to his good maisters, as a cur-dogge that barketh apace, but cannot bite, and as a beardlesse boy without haire on his face, voide of all learning, wit, sense, and reason; that so hee may bring them newes of his good fortune. VVhat I doe here promise, I hope in God to performe the same in due season.</p>

Nay, it was but then resolued amongst them, that some answere should bee made vnto my Bookes. And therefore saith <hi>Parsons</hi> the detector, that hee was once determined to haue said somthing against my books, but hearing that his fellowes were about the same matter, he altered his purpose. Well, this detection was published,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:1607:14"/>
that the answere is suppressed, and vpon iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on stayed from the publication. Because indeede there is no such answere in <hi>Rerum natura</hi>; or else which is worse, when they had well viewed their said answer, it seemed so deformed, and ill fauoured in their eyes, that they were ashamed to publish it. Let vs put together these two seueral assertions.

                     </note> that my bookes were answered fiue yeares agoe, and yet vnanswered two yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe.

For no Papist may reade either my books, or any other bookes against poperie, without a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall licence from the Pope himselfe. For, if all were permitted to reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Pope would soone haue but a small company, in this kingdome of England. Yet the wiser sort I hope, will borrow a dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the safegard of their soules. For, (O miserie of
<pb facs="tcp:1607:15"/>
all miseries!) seeing they may not reade my bookes, they must beleeue what their Maisters tell them: to wit, that this Fore-runner hath answered me galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Although he hath confuted himselfe vnawares; when he saith, the answere is yet to bee published, and that, that which he hath done, is but a taste.

For I doubt not, but so many &amp; such will see what is best. Where we haue to learne by the way, in <hi>perpetuam reimemoriam</hi>: that not onely Iesuit or Seminarie-priest writeth against mee, but euen the whole broode, tagge &amp; ragge, haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their bowes to shoote their arrowes at me.

But he faileth aswel in the naming as he doth in the performing.

                        <hi>I haue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Pope euen to death &amp; that with his owne doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and yet no Papist is of courage, once to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter me therein.</hi>
                     </note> as all the Iesuits and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited Popelings in England and else where, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer able to heale, &amp; cure the wounds of their Pope. He is so gashed, so bitten, and so wounded with the teeth of his owne dogges, that his sores are become incurable. What the sillie Libeller saith against my other bookes, is as harmelesse to the truth thereof; as the biting of a toothlesse beagle, is to a Beare, Bull, or Lion. And I must needes giue him to wit; that it is as good nothing at al, as neuer a whit the better; that it is as good nothing at al, as neuer a whit the better. Touching the contents of their answere, (if any such can be found,) our Libeller telleth vs, that their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to my Motiues, and Suruey,<note place="margin">

I thinke it comes as neere the matter; as if one should aske, how farre to London; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other should answere, a poke full of Plumbes. For so it falleth out with this Libeller, as partly wee haue seene alreadie, and more plainly it wil appeare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.<note place="margin">

                     </note> The first book of their supposed answere (saith our Libeller,) containeth many of my notable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vntruthes,
<pb facs="tcp:1607:17"/>
corruptions, and falsifications. The second presenteth a gallant and desperate fray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the reformed Minister of <hi>Baskall,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bell,</hi> Preacher of the word. The third handleth a couple more of extraordinarie and choise contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The fourth entreateth of the weake grounds of my workes. The fift and last answereth the recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my Suruey. The Libeller hauing thus gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly discouered theirs &amp; his owne treacheries, got bread &amp; cheese, &amp; went laughing away. But soft and faire, good sir, haue once about with you, if yee goe but one mile a day. My answere to this forged tale, of a meere chimericall imagined answere flying in the aire, and congealed in the middle region, standeth thus.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 33.</note> First, the Libeller protesteth in sad earnest, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he would haue none to beleeue him vpon his bare word. I for my part agree thereunto, and wish all others to doe the same. And consequently, there is no answere at all against my bookes. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause forsooth, he bringeth no reason to proue it; and (as we haue heard,) wee may not beleeue his bare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> word. Secondly, if there were notable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; falsifications found out by his brethren, in my bookes of Suruey, &amp; Motiues; it had bene more for his credite, to haue alleaged some one of them at the least; then to stand buzzing about things of smal or rather no importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, neither can go thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitch with the same. And it wil not serue his turne to say, that he will not meddle with my Suruey &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, for that his brethren haue dealt therewith. The
<pb facs="tcp:1607:17"/>
reason is euident, because he hath made choise of a sentence taken out of my Motiues, which mightily galleth &amp; goareth himselfe; as shall God-willing be seene, when I come the second booke. Thirdly, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> one of the fiue imagined bookes of answere, doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly touch either my Suruey or my Motiues, the last onely excepted; as euery child may conceiue by their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents, expressed &amp; set down by the Libeller. And that last book (as we heare) is afraid to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, and to answere directly either of my bookes. For, it professeth onely, to answere the recapitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Suruey. Alas, alas, who can but blush on their behalfe? who doth not see their backes at the wall? who will beleeue them any longer? who seeth not the weakenesse &amp; nakednesse of late Romish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? who will not detest &amp; abhorre poperie? we see, they are not able to defend their late vpstart reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They dare not by their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, answere directly to any one Chapter of any one booke. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will answere the end or recapitulation of my Suruey. That is to say; they dare not deale with my grounds, reasons, &amp; proofes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>What a shamelesse dealing is this? their consiences condemne them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their hearts faile them.</hi>
                     </note> but onely with my bare recital of the contents of my bookes. As if they had said; we wil plead for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of our Church after our olde wonted manner; so still to seduce the people, as we haue done. But with his grounds, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and authorities, with which he battereth down our Popes vsurped Primacie, and confuteth our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, we will not deale at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1607:18"/>For, in my recapitulation, I onely tell the Reader plainly and briefely, what I haue proued in my whole booke; so to helpe the memorie and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the ignorant. And I pray you (my good friends) is this your manner of answering? then doubtlesse, you neede not haue staid so long simpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon the matter. VVell, let mee haue your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere such as it is, about which you haue beene buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing aboue tenne yeares; and I promise, (if God graunt mee life and health,) to returne my replie vnto it, within the space of one yeare. Thus much for the third lie.</p>
                  <p>The Libeller gageth his credite many waies, and sets it a sale for a souse; so to worke my discredite, if it would or could be brought to passe. These are his wordes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 19.</note> hee giueth them most iust cause, to suspect him of playing bootie, and that his heart is still an harbourer of Poperie, or at least not replenished with the liuely liquor of the new Gospell. These are his glorious wordes. It were enough for his answer, to tell him, that by his owne lawe, his wordes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe, are of no credite at all. But I will answere himselfe with himselfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 9,</note> and confound him with his owne wordes, and beate him with his owne rodde. In another place,<note place="margin">

                     </note> he hath these wordes; we make no doubt, but that he mightily enuieth her felicitie, (he meaneth their Romish Church,) and greedily thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth after her destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>haec ille.</hi> Now, if the Reader wil couple and combine the former sentence, where he impudently auoucheth, (like a wretched Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller
<pb facs="tcp:1607:18"/>
and bondslaue of Satan,) that I am an harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of Poperie in my heart; together with this other, in which he maketh it out of doubt, that I thirst gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily the destruction of their <hi>Romish</hi> Church; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but see euidently a flat contradiction, with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest lye implied in the same.<note place="margin">

                     </note> For <hi>I</hi> cannot both harbour Poperie in my heart, and greedily desire the ruine thereof. Thus much for the fourth lye.

And consequently, that not my selfe am a coward, but our Libeller, &amp; all other Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Iesuites and Iesuited Papists.

                     <hi>O impudent Iesuits, more impudent then impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie is selfe.</hi>
                  </note> no man in his right wits will say it. Yet we see, that our Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber affirmeth both the one and the other. No, No, their combes are cut, their crests are falne, they stand amazed with feare, their spirits rampant are made couchant, their doome will soone appeare. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Libellers brethren in <hi>Wisbich,</hi> and maister <hi>Wright</hi> in the Clinke, if their courages had not failed them, would haue accepted the challenge, and haue requested, that the trial might haue bene made heere in England; but they had no such desire. Againe, the Iesuites might easily haue procured a safe conduct, and so haue called me beyond the Seas. And that done, if I had refused
<pb facs="tcp:1607:20"/>
to performe my challenge, they might with reason haue exclaimed against me. But seeing their coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges failed them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Iesuits are cowards, not daring to defend their poperie vpon their owne soule.</hi>
                  </note> and that they went neuer about the matter, <hi>I</hi> may with great reason both exclaime and declaime against them, and truly tell them all, that they are cowards indeede.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, seeing the Recusants in <hi>Yorke</hi> refused to talke with me, it gaue me iust cause to suspect, that the rest would haue done the like; especially seeing none of them durst vndertake to answere the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the best triall is to be made by writing, the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for sundry respects. First, because the Parties may better consider the matter, and lay downe their conceits more orderly. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many men of good vnderstanding haue weake memories. Thirdly, because sundry for their present wit and excellent memorie, are farre ouermatches <hi>extempore</hi> for many learned men, who indeede are better learned then themselues <hi>multis parasangis</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Better lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Multis parasangis.</hi>
                  </note> Fourthly, bicause the vulgar people are caried away with sugred words, if they be deliuered with a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tongue, howsoeuer they be void of truth. Fiftly, because the truth cannot wholy and truly be repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for that none can write so fast as words doe passe in any disputation. Sixtly, because <hi>littera scripta ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> but wordes passe as the winde. Many other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may bee alledged; but these for this time shall suffice. Lastly, these things notwithstanding, I haue lately sent a booke to the presse, before the Libellers
<pb facs="tcp:1607:20"/>

               <p>I likewise confesse, that I haue in a godly sort revolted from that Religion, which I once did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace; yet not <hi>aplos</hi> wholy, but <hi>cata ti,</hi> that is, from the corruptions &amp; superstition lately crept into the Romish Church.

meerly accidentall and extrinsecall, and no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall or essentiall to the thing it selfe. Where I must needes tell the Papists this one thing, which (I feare) they wil not brooke kindly, nor take it in good part. This it is. They tell vs, that their sacrament of Priesthood (as they terme it) imprinteth an indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character in the receiuer;<note place="margin">

                  </note> and yet doe I auouch it constantly, that neither the Pope himselfe, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Popish so supposed Priest, can be assured by an infallible signe, rule, or proofe, that he is a Popish Priest. This I knowe, wil at the first seeme a wonder; but I shal God willing, make it so cleere and euident, that euery child may perceiue the same; and euerie Papist sigh, sob, and mourne, when he remembreth it. Marke well gentle Reader, what I shall deliuer in this behalfe. The Popish general Councel of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> hath these wordes; <hi>Haec omnia sacramenta tribus perficiuntur;</hi>

               <p>All these sacraments (Baptisme, confirmation, eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, penance, extreame vnction, order, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie) are finished and made perfect with three things, <hi>viz.</hi> with the things as with the matter, with the wordes as with the forme, and with the person of the minister that giueth the sacraments, and hath intention to doe that which the Church doth. Of which three things, if any one want, the Sacrament is not perfect. Out of these words of this popish gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:1607:24"/>
councel, (which by Popish doctrine cannot erre) I note this point of great importance, viz. that none can be a perfect Priest, but he that is made priest of that Bishoppe, who had intention to make him a Priest.

                  </note> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, no Priest, not the Pope himselfe, can tell and affirme certainly of himselfe, that he is a Priest. Hereupon two most lamentable corollaries, must be inferred of necessitie: Alas, alas, for pittie. The first,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I answere; First, in my second booke of Motiues, and eight chapter,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyues, chap.</hi> 8. <hi>art.</hi> 12.</note> I haue handled two &amp; thirty articles of dissentions amongst the Papists: all which I haue proued by the testimonies of very learned and famous Popish writers: among the which 32. articles, this ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing &amp; ranging Iesuitical Libeller, can find but this one for his purpose. In this very same book, being the first that euer I published in print against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I haue impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; battered to the ground, ten special articles of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fayth &amp; religion. First, I haue shewed the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, blasphemy, and absurdities of popish pardons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that the Pope both may erre, and hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>de facto,</hi> not only as a priuate person in priuate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but euen as Pope and publike person, and that in his iudiciall and definitiue sentence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that general Councels in these latter daies, are nothing els but a meere mockery and sophisticall subtility, to deceiue Gods people withall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1607:27"/>Fourthly, that the Popes dispensations are wicked,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> licentious, and intolerable.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that Kings are aboue Popes, that their power <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> royall is independant, &amp; that they are subiect to none, but to God alone. Sixtly, that popish dissention is of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> matters most important, and incredible to such, as are not wel acquainted with their books. I haue set down 32. in number, of their dissentions. Seuenthly, that the writings of the ancient fathers, are to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> with great reuerence; yet so, as we acknowledge them to be men, to haue their errours, and to bynd vs to their authorities no further, then they accord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the holy scriptures. Eyghtly, that all things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> necessary for our saluation, are contayned in the holy scriptures, and that popish vnwritten traditions are so vncertaine, as the best learned Papists cannot agree therein. Ninthly, that after this life there is neyther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> merit, nor demerit, nor satisfaction to be made; and that the bookes of the Machabees cannot establish popish purgatory. Tenthly, that the specificall enumeration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and confession of all our sinnes, is not onely not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Scriptures, but flat repugnant to the same, &amp; impossible to be accomplished by the power of man. All which poynts and articles I haue proued, not only by scriptures, authorities and reasons, but euen by the expresse testimonies of the Popes owne deare Doctors, and best learned Papists. A demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so forceable against the Papists, as nothing can be more.</p>
                  <p>This book was extant in print, about 12. yeres ago.
<pb facs="tcp:1607:28"/>
The Iesuits haue bene long fiddling &amp; buzzing about some answere to this &amp; my other books; yea, they haue many yeres ago promised the world, that they would speedily frame an answere to the same: but while the grasse growes (as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon saying is) the horse dyes. My selfe am now wel stricken in yeres, &amp; by the course of nature, shortly to go the way of al flesh. They are so nettled, so pricked and goared, and their religion so battred, with their owne best learned Doctors, &amp; most skilfull Proctors, that gladly they would satisfy their Iesuited Popelings, &amp; wipe away that discredit which hangeth at their beards; for which end they vse many coozening tricks, iugglings, &amp; legierdemains, so to stay the out-cries of the people, vntill I be dead, and then, by your fauour, they will come vpon me with good speed: for <hi>Canis mortuus non mordet.</hi>

                     </note> But before that day (my life I gage in that behalfe) they dare not for their guts, publish any direct and full answere to my bookes: I say, any direct and full answere; because to snatch here a piece, and there a piece, is no answere at all, but a meere toy for yong children to play withall.</p>

                  <p>I proue it first, because he graunteth as much as I desire or affirme; for these are his wordes: (Wee willingly graunt it; bee it so: what then?) This
<pb facs="tcp:1607:28"/>
forsooth; you graunt the dissention among your best Doctours, which is all that I tooke vpon me to proue. O sweet Iesus! who seeth not these Iesuites so besotted and blinded with malice, that they cannot perceyue their owne dotage? They impugne that in one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which they graunt in another. Who will not perswade himselfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>They doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify my bookes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly. Who cannot see it?</hi>
                     </note> that my booke of Motiues (being the first I writ) is most sincerely and soundly penned? No man can but doe it: the reason is euident, because all that the malicious Iesuite durst impugne, (who no question made choyce of his best aduantage) is (by his owne confession) as true, as the trueth it selfe: but (sayth he) it is no dissention in matters of fayth.</p>
                  <p>Fye, fye, fye; Popery cannot stand, vnlesse it bee supported and vnderpropped with slaunderous lyes. He would haue his Reader to beleeue, that I affirmed the dissention to be a matter of fayth: which if I had done, as I did not, yet would it nothing serue his turne. This is one notorious lye, that I affirmed it to bee a matter of fayth.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:1607:29"/>Loe, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> with sundry learned Papists, taught this doctrine: That none but Bishops could be the true Ministers of Confirmation.</p>

               <p>ABout three yeres agoe, <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> that scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Libeller &amp; traytrous Iesuite (who will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme or deny any thing, as his owne deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the secular Priests write of him) published a sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous &amp; rayling libell, which he termed a Detectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. in which libel he findeth himself grieued, for the books which I haue written against their Popes, &amp; their late Romish Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for which respect he frameth himselfe this way, that way, and euery way, to find out some fit matter against me, &amp; so to be aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of me. At the last, he hath stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled on a silly so supposed contradiction, in my book of the Suruey of Popery.

                  </note> the silly Libeller (alas for pity) hath made choyce, not of one sentence, but of one onely piece of one sentence: to what end and purpose, let the Reader iudge; for it passeth my skill to diuine. <hi>Dauus sum, non Oedipus.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>This is all that the Libeller hath against my booke, touching the 5. things wherof he made his choyce. If it bee demaunded, to what end hee brought this patch or piece of one only sentence? I answere, as before in the title of the chapter, that it is a monster without either head or foote, and so aboue my reach. <hi>Quae supra nos, nihil ad nos.</hi> My sentence,<note place="margin">

In the Down-fall of Popery, my words against <hi>Bellarmine</hi> are these: The Iesuite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (a wonderfull thing to be heard, &amp; almost incredible, sauing that the truth must needs in time haue the vpper hand) confesseth so much vnwares, as is able sufficiently to proue and conclude my intended scope &amp; propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

they may safely contemne all vnwritten traditions, as nothing needfull or pertayning to them. But let vs heare our Cardinall-Iesuite once againe speake for himselfe, and for the honour of his holy father the Pope.</p>

The sole &amp; only difference is, or ought to be this: <hi>viz</hi> that the Pulpit hath euer the prick of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation annexed, which the schoole wanteth. For the Preacher may not speake at randon in the Pulpit, but euen there must he haue the girdle of truth about his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> loynes.

               <p>Hee belyeth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (saith our Libeller:) he sayth not, that women and rustickes doe vnderstand
<pb facs="tcp:1607:37"/>
the Scriptures, so farre forth as pertaineth to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of their Redemption. Nay, he saith the contrary in the wordes by him alledged. Although many, quoth he, vnderstand not the sentences of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. In which number, I thinke Rusticks &amp; women must be contained. If then they vnderstand not the sentences of the Scriptures, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth, how doe they vnderstand the Scriptures, so far forth, as pertaineth to the mysteries of their Redemption?</p>
               <p>Thus reasoneth our Libeller, or more truly sayd; thus prateth our insolent Sycophant, thus babbleth our false accuser: for, when hee hath corrupted <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> nipping and cutting the sentence asunder, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only the fore part, and omitting the latter, which would soone haue discouered his falshood;<note place="margin">

                  </note> he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with tryumpheth, as though he had the victory: But if a very child do but ioyne the latter part of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which he omitted like a coozener &amp; deceitful Sycophant, to the former; he shall behold as cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Sunne shining at noone tyde, the victory to be on my side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wordes are these, sayth the Libeller; Although many vnderstand not the sentences of the Scriptures: And then he crieth out, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, they doe not vnderstand the mysteries of their Redemption in the Scriptures. But here is plaine le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gierdemaine, &amp; deepe coozenage, euen coozenage in graine: for <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words are these: But in the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose words, because they giue a deadly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, our libelling Iesuite, <hi>Bellarmines</hi> brother in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, not daring to reiect his doctrine, citeth (as the Reader may easily behold) only the mids of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. First, he omitteth the former part, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the reason; that is to say, these words; But in the new Testament, because Christ hath fulfilled the figures and the prophesies.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Behold a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knaue in grayne.</hi>
                  </note> Then he cutteth away the last part, which ministreth the true sence &amp; meaning, that is to say, these words; Yet do they vnderstand the mysteries of our Redemption, euen the rusticks and women. Who would not be ashamed, thus to mangle a sentence which is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie? If I were a Papist, this kind of dealing would cause me to renounce Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
               <p>Although they vnderstand not the sentences of the Scriptures, saith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Popery must needs be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropped with cooze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.</hi>
                  </note> and there the Libeller resteth himselfe, because he was wearied in hearing the truth; yet doe they vnderstand the mysteries of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen the country fellowes &amp; women. So then, 3. things must be obserued; First, that there is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> one thing, which the vulgar people do vnderstand, to wit, the mysteries of our redemption; and this is the point which I defend, &amp; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmeth it in very plain termes, &amp; expresse words. Secondly, that there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is an other thing, which the vulgar people do not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; to wit, the sentences of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1607:38"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, a third thing must be remembred, to wit, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doeth not say at all, that the common people do not vnderstand the Scriptures, but the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Scriptures; which doubtlesse was not done of him, but for some end and purpose: for hee might sooner haue sayd, They vnderstand not the Scriptures, then the sentences of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Two things therefore are most euident in <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>: first, that the Scriptures are so obscure in many places thereof, that the common people doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the sentences therin contained. Secondly, that sundry places of the Scriptures are so plaine and manifest, that the very country fellowes and women doe vnderstand the same, and the things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned are called of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the mysteries of our Redemption.</p>
               <p>The former obseruation, the Libeller doeth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly admit;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>col.</hi> 129.</note> and the latter, I shall proue out of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> owne words abundantly: for first, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answering to the ninth argument, touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the old &amp; new Testament, affirmeth plainly the difference to be this: <hi>viz.</hi> that in the old Testament, the people did neither vnderstand the sentences of the Scriptures, nor yet the mysteries of Christ. But in the new Testament, it is far otherwise: where though the people vnderstand not the senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scriptures (generally) yet doe they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the mysteries of mans Redemption. Secondly, the same <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expoundeth his own meaning in his answere to the sixt argument, where he hath these
<pb facs="tcp:1607:38"/>
expresse words: <hi>Quaedam reperiuntur obscurissima,</hi>

And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith nothing, but that which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayd long before <hi>Bellarmine was</hi> borne, in far more plain &amp; manifest termes. These are his expresse words: <hi>In his,</hi>

                  <head>The Reply.</head>
                  <p>My Reply or confutation standeth thus. First, that the shamelesse Iesuite durst not deale with my whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> article, but only with one silly patch or piece thereof, which he hath guilefully and corruptly singled out.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Libeller neuer taketh the whole sentence.</hi>
                     </note> O strange and most dastardly cowardnesse! Fye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your shamelesse dealing. What a Religion and fayth doe you Papists hold, who dare not for your liues answere directly to any one booke, chapter,

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that I haue indeede ouerthrowne them with their own Doctors; yea, euen with their chiefest Doctors, and that al the world doth now perceiue the same. For which respect they haue now at the last deemed it better, to snatch heere a piece and there a piece out of my books, and so to face out the matter with coozenage, slaundering, railing, lying, and most notorious corruption, rather then to be wholy silent, as they haue bene in former yeres.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that seeing <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> the trayterous Iesuite (whom I challenge to haue penned the Libel) is euen by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the popish secular priests, an arrant Traitor, a Priests bastard, a monster of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,<note place="margin">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, that in the fourth article, handled in the Downe-fall of Popery at large, I haue proued very soundly by the Scriptures, fathers, and best approued Popish writers, as also by many plaine testimonies out of <hi>S. Austens</hi> bookes, that concupiscence remayning
<pb facs="tcp:1607:46"/>
after Baptisme in the regenerate, is both called sinne, and is properly sinne indeed; that the first motions of concupiscence, which are connaturall to the corrupt man, &amp; can no way be auoyded, are flatly forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this commaundement, (Thou shalt not couet;) that though the said rebellious motions bee voluntary in the worke, yet are they voluntary in the original; that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> not able truly to answere S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens</hi> words,<note place="margin">

But such beggerly shifts &amp; silly euasions, are the props and stayes of late Romish Religion. This done, I haue confuted the exposition of the Rhemists,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rhem.

For, if only the consent of our reason &amp; mind to obey and to follow the lusts therof, were sin indeed; then should <hi>S.

Where I told the Reader, that it will not serue or help the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists to obiect that, which is euer in their mouths, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is inuoluntary, &amp; can no way be auoyded, and therefore no sinne at all.</p>
                  <p>Many strong reasons I alleadged for the proofe hereof, in the Down-fall of Popery: amongst which
<pb facs="tcp:1607:47"/>
the Libeller found one only, with which his courage serued him to grapple. But alas, all that he hath gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is nothing els in very deed, but to proue himselfe a malicious foole, and the master. Noddy of all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish noddies in the world. For the very next words in Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> set downe in the Downe-fall, (which the shamelesse Libeller maliciously and guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully omitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) condemne him for a notorious coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zener; as which doe proue Saint <hi>Austen</hi> flatly on my side, and wholy against himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus writeth Saint <hi>Austen; Quod si quisquam, &amp;c.</hi> But if any man say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See the Downe-fall.</hi>
                     </note> that concupiscence is nothing else, then a will that is vicious and seruing sinne, there is no resistance to bee made; neither must controuersie bee in words, when the thing is cleere and euident. For so wee proue euerie sinne to bee voluntary, eyther in the act, or in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</p>
                  <p>These are the expresse wordes of Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> with which our Libeller durst not deale; although in my booke they bee immediatly annexed to the former:<note place="margin">

                  <p>Alas, alas, the case is too manifest. For the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller confesseth, that hitherto they haue not answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee. And hee addeth a toy for young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                  <p>What a thing is this? the like was neuer heard, knowne, or seene. All the Iesuites haue layd their heads together to answere my books. About which answere, (as due circumstances will conuince,) they haue spent sixe whole yeeres, <hi>plus minus</hi>; in which space of time, (as our Fore-runner telleth vs,) they haue (though long first) answered my bookes. But what followeth? Marry sir, that the answere hath hitherto beene suppressed, euen for the space of fiue yeres, and no lesse.</p>
                  <p>Is this possible? It is most true; read his booke, page 15. and you shall find it to be so.<note place="margin">

                     </note>) I haue confuted Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, euen by the testimony of the best approued Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish writers. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we affirme with S. <hi>Austen</hi> &amp; <hi>S.

To this obiection, I replyed out of S. <hi>Austen</hi> in many places of his works; that albeit such motions were vnuoluntary in the act, yet were the same voluntary in the originall. To which I added, that the Papists may as well deny co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence to be sin in vnbaptized infants, as in them that are baptized, vpon this their falsely supposed grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for it is as inuoluntary in the one, as it is in the other; neither can it be any more auoided in the one, then in the other.

               <p>THE Libeller is here in great iolity, and tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth before the victory. howbeit, I haue reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this Dispensation for the last end, which he placed in the beginning. My reason is this; because I hope in God to giue him such a Down-fall therby, as all the Papists in England and elsewhere, shall not bee able to lift him vp again. Marry, if the Popes holinesse
<pb facs="tcp:1607:48"/>
will dispense with him therein,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>It is sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the Popes power</hi>
                  </note> (of whose power it is sacriledge to dispute,) to that can I say nothing. In the Down-fal of Popery, I haue proued most euidently, euen by the testimony of most famous Popish Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that the Pope hath often by his most execrable dispensations, taken vpon him to dissolue that matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which is most firme and stable by Christs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly institution.</p>
               <p>One onely example the Libeller espied, with the which his courage serued him to deale,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Papists may sing Dirge for the soule of their Forerunner.</hi>
                  </note> not daring for his guts to answer the article directly, though it be a very short one. No, no, this one example will bee y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him, if not too much. It wil make his heart pant, his neck crack, his belly ake, and his bowels to gush out; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shal read or heare my Reply, which I haue directly and soundly framed to the same. The controuersie standeth thus. I affirmed out of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> that Pope <hi>Martin</hi> gaue one licence to marry his owne naturall sister. The Libeller answereth, that I haue belyed their Arch-bishop, and that their Pope gaue no such dispensatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now, that the controuersy may bee examined <hi>ad amussim,</hi> I purpose in God to proceed in this maner. First, I wil purge my selfe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> retort the lie vpon the Libellers head; as vpon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor &amp; the person, that best deserueth the same.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An in esra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</hi>
                  </note> And this I wil perform (God willing,) by the testimony of most famous, and best approued Popish writers. This being truly &amp; soundly effected; al wise men (I weene) wil deeme the Libeller worthy for his iust reward, to keepe continually a whetstone about his neck, a cox-combe

in his forhead,<note place="margin">

                  </note> he may henceforth be a fit Counseller for the Pope. Howbeit, if he shall vse no better dexterity in counselling, then hee hath practised in defending the Pope; it may be feared, that his final reward wil be a rope.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I wil answere directly and fully to euery thing and things, reasons, causes, circumstances, and imaginations, which the Libeller with the ioynt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his friends, possibly could deuise in his owne defence, and for the honour of their Pope and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  <p>I Answere; first, that I yeeld to the first part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this answere, so it be taken in a true and godly sence, for so it maketh against the Libeller, but not against my selfe. The reason is euident; because the Popes errors in faith and maners, doe only hurt himselfe and the Papists, who beleeue him and depend vpon him, taking that for the Catholique Church,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ma.</hi> 16.18 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note> which followeth him and beleeueth as he doth. But his Errours are nothing preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the true Chatholike Church indeed, which is built vpon a most sure rocke, (euen Christ Iesus) &amp; neuer swarueth from the Truth. Secondly, that it is the Libellers best course, not to defend all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> perticular facts of their Popes, for else hee must defend Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> who entred into his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as a Foxe, liued in it as a Woolfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full crie of Rome.</hi>
                     </note> and dyed out of it as a Dogge. Yea, he must defend much other most execrable &amp; abhominable stuffe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue written else where at large. Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1607:51"/>
that he must either defend this fact now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, (as it shall appeare in the due place, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;) or else crie fire and faggot for the Pope, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> so an end. Fourthly, that seeing the pope by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish graunt, may erre by wronge information; it standeth all good Christians in hand, to looke nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly vnto his fingers, to examine diligently his dealings, and not to venture too boldly vpon his decrees.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vbi supra.</hi>
                     </note> For else, they may perhaps, (as I haue prooued elsewhere,) adore and worship damned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> spirits, in stead of holy Saints. Fiftly, that seeing the pope by popish graunt, may erre of wilfull malice;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>O bloody &amp; cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant!</hi>
                     </note> it must needs be a most intollerable tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and cruell villanie, to tye mens soules to his decree of faith and manners. For, whether his Holynesse decides matters of wilfull malice, or not; God and his owne conscience onely can tell, all others must remaine perplexed and in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> what to say or thinke thereof. Sixtly, this was such a matter of fact, as concernes saluation; and consequently, if the pope should erre herein, (as vndoubtedly he did,) the Romish faith should be ouerthrowne, and turned vp-side downe. For (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the popes mouth teacheth vs,<note place="margin">

                     </note>) this is the Romish faith. <hi>Non solum in decretis fidei er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare non potest summus pontifex, sed neque in precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis morum quae toti ecclesiae praescribuntur, &amp; quae in rebus necessarijs ad salutem, vel in ijs quae per se bona vel mala sunt, versantur.</hi> The pope cannot erre, not only in the decrees of faith, but neither in the

Now so it is, that this dispensation of pope Martin, concernes a matter of faith and saluation. For after the popes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, the man was bound to beleeue,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I Answere: first, that this silly kinde of reasoning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which the Libeller vseth, sheweth euidently his backe to be at the wall,<note place="margin">

                     </note> himselfe at a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> and his wits not at home. For if <hi>Antoninus</hi> may not intreat of consanguinite, because the Title of the Chapter is of affinitie: great absurdities may iustly be imputed to many, not onely prophane, but also most holy Writers: euen to those, whose pennes were directed by the holy ghost. For, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Moses</hi> intituled, The first Booke of his Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tench, (<hi>Bereshith</hi>) to which Title, the first word only was answerable.

                     </note>) to which title, one onely part of the first Chapter, is fitly answerable. Yea, the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler intituleth his rayling and slaunderous pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, (<hi>The Fore-runner of Bels Downefall:</hi>) and for all that, small fore running can be found in it, but great store of lyes, slaunders, cosening trickes, and I cannot tell what.<note place="margin">

I prooue it, because he graunteth, that if <hi>Antoninus</hi> had sayd, (<hi>cum Germana sua</hi>) and not (<hi>eius;</hi>) the meaning had beene, as I doe hold. And therefore, seeing so many learned papists did chaunge (<hi>eius</hi>) into (<hi>sua;</hi>) it followeth of necessitie, that it must needs be as <hi>I</hi> say, and not as the Libeller would haue it. To which I adde, that the Libeller, though he seeme to glorie in his skill of Grammar,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is a poore Gramarian.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:1607:54"/>
to that which goeth afore, because it is reciprocal, yet may they be vsed mutually in <hi>antecedentibus,</hi> the one for the other, as I could prooue by infinite authoritie.

It hath in verie many places, <hi>eius</hi> for <hi>sua.</hi> It is fiue times at the least,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 11.13 14.20.21.</note> in one onely Chapter. So in the 4. Chapter, vers. 21. chap. 10, vers. 3. Luk. 6.14. Act. 16.15. Iob, 5.4. Iob. 14.21. Ezech. 46.17. Psal. 108. vers. 7.9. Prou. 31. vers. 27.28. (<hi>eius</hi>) and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>(<hi>sua</hi>) are vsed indifferently. Sixtly, that the true sense &amp; meaning, may be cleerely gatherd out of <hi>Antoninus</hi> his owne wordes. For first, he graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, (as is alreadie prooued) that the pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dispense with mariage betweene brother and sister. Secondly, because <hi>Antoninus</hi> sayth, that the learned men with whom the pope consulted,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>This is a strange rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
                     </note> cold not agree: some of them holding that he could dispense therewith, others that he could not, who doubtlesse would all haue agreed roundly, that the pope could haue dispensed therewith, if the case had been as the Libeller wold haue it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Antoninus, Syluester, Fumus,</hi> and <hi>Angelus,</hi> doe all conclude: that because it is as sacriledge to dispute of the popes power, they must referre the iudgement thereof to God, as being a thing farre aboue the capacitie and reach of man.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fumus in verbo, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensat. pag.</hi> 221.</note>

                     <pb facs="tcp:1607:54"/>
when such a dispensation is graunted, we must beleeue that it is of force. But why it is so, God onely knoweth. Here I wish the Reader to obserue two memorable things with me: thone against the Libeller, denying the Popes dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for marriage betweene brother and sister. Thother, against all papists in general,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Poperie is a fond Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and a verie hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potch of om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigitherum.</hi>

And to make this controuersie out of doubt: let the Reader perswade himselfe vndoubtedly, that great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned papists, euen Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> for one, doe hold it for a constant position, that the pope may dispense with the brother to marrie his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sister.<note place="margin">

            <p>The Popes necke is alreadie broken; his fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is prepared; and no remedie, but he must in all hast be interred.

            <head>A Caueet, or Christian admonition to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter my Reply against a shamelesse Libel, intituled the Fore-runner of <hi>Bels</hi> downe-fall, was sent to the the Presse, beeing authorized by higher powers to bee imprinted; a sincere Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good esteeme, (the Lord of Heauen and earth reward his godly zeale,) acquainted me with a new Fore-runner of <hi>Bels</hi> downefall, (so eagerly doe the Papists wish my downe-fall,) with this newe addition in the Title. The second time set forth, and such faults corrected as escaped in the first Print, as in the Preface is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. To this second Fore-runner of Antichrist, and to the Catch-poll of Satan, the Preface addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for an ornament in that behalfe; I haue deemed it <hi>Operaepertium,</hi> to adde a briefe censure therunto, for the instruction and necessarie satisfaction of the godly and well affected Reader; albeit it came so lately to my hands, as very hardly I could effect the same. A great wonderment it is to mee, (and if I be not deceiued,) to all the Sages and wise men of the Christian world; what should moue the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Fore-runner, so suddenly to set foorth a second Fore-runner immediately after the former. If <hi>I</hi> may diuine, and without offence to the Popes holinesse, &amp; the grauitie of his sanctified Popelings, this is the true cause indeed; &amp; not that with which the Libeller would gladly dazell the eyes of his Reader, viz. The Iesuits who rule and ouer-rule all papists in <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> world, (I dare not say the Pope himself.)
<pb facs="tcp:1607:63"/>
&amp; who haue their spies in euery corner of this land, hauing receiued intelligence by their saide Spies, that I was in hand with a Reply or answere to their saide Fore-runner, and their owne consciences withall condemning them, and telling them that they are not able to endure the force and truth of my reply, haue laid their heads together, &amp; deuised the best shift they could to seduce the simple papists which depend vpon them, and hang the saluation of their soules vpon their shoulders. For thus the case standeth with them. They may not read any Booke, no, nor heare any read vnto them, which either my selfe or any other good Christian shall set forth against the Pope, or any one iote of Popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. If otherwise, the partie that shall so doe, (vnlesse hee haue the Popes dispensation,) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated <hi>Ipso facto,</hi> deliuered vp to Satan, and cast out of the Popish Church.</p>
            <p>Now sir, when these simple and sillie Papists, (alas, alas, for pitty, shall heare of my Reply, and shall tell the Iesuits and Iesuited Priests, what report flyeth abroad of the condemnation of their Fore-runner and Religion, they will tell them roundly a tale of <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> and little <hi>Iohn</hi>: viz. That I haue not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered their Booke at all, but another counterfeit Pamphlet deuised by mine owne braine. This to be so, I proue by a triple meane.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because the Libeller denyeth to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hat Pamphlet to be his owne, against which <hi>I</hi> haue framed my Replye.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because the second Fore-runner is
<pb facs="tcp:1607:63"/>
in euery Chapter, in euery Page, in euery sentence and Period, the very same in true sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with the former Fore-runner, of <hi>Bels</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall: yea, so many faults haue escaped in the latter Print, as in the first.</p>
            <p>To which I must needes adde, that as I did not once touch their faults escaped in the first Print, no more doe I say any thing against the faultes es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped in the second Print. For I doe and euer did scorne to take any aduantage against the Author, by reason of that which chanceth through the default of the Printer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because himselfe freely granteth, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doth not so much lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the losse of the books of the first Print,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
               </note> as it grieueth him to think <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> any be esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to carry newes vnto <hi>Bel.</hi> And why, (I pray you) doth he desire and wish, that all his books had bene burnt, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had escaped to bring newes to <hi>Bel?</hi> doubtlesse, because his own conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him for that silly patched answere which hee had framed against <hi>Bell,</hi> &amp; which he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe very vnable to defend. And for that end, if all the Copies had beene consumed vp of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> he would haue rested in peace, and neuer haue bic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered with <hi>Bel</hi> at all. Marry, seeing all the Copies, could no way bee kept from <hi>Bels</hi> knowledge, hee thought it a matter of great consequence &amp; pollicie, to inuent some cozening trick &amp; point of legierde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, by help wherof he might set such a braue face on the matter, as though he were innocent, and no
<pb facs="tcp:1607:64"/>
way to be touched. This is the first point, which <hi>I</hi> haue thought good to intimate to the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Libeller in one place of his first Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner telleth vs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 25.</note> that wee shall haue more choyse of wares at the next Mart: and in another place he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that by the next Poste we shall know more of his meaning. Now sir, both the next Poste is come,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page.</hi> 30.</note> and the next Mart is past, and yet haue wee receiued no other wares, nor any further meaning, saue that onely which is already touched. The Libeller therefore must perforce, either confesse that this cozening tricke and point of Legierde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, was the thing which hee intended: or else, that he is a notorious lyar. <hi>Vtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>horum mavis, accipe,</hi> gentle Fore-runner. This is the second point, which I haue obserued for the good of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The Libeller in his second Fore-runner, telleth his Reader, that vnlesse <hi>I</hi> stay my selfe from answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him,<note place="margin">

Oh sweete <hi>Iesus,</hi> what maner of people are our English Iesuits, and other Iesuited Popelings? My Bookes haue beene in their hands many yeares: they haue volued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued them; they haue read and perused them againe and againe; they haue tossed and turned them ouer and ouer: they haue a long time borne all simple Papists in hands, that my books haue bene answered many yeares agoe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1607:64"/>To which most impudent and false assertion, the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ignorant Papists (who dare not once reade or turne ouer one leafe of any booke, which looketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry against the Pope or popish doctrine,) haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such credite, that they haue audaciously affirmed to my face, that my bookes were answered by the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites.

Now, if you demand of me what occasion that is, <hi>I</hi> knowe not doubtlesse how to answere you more truly, then in this plaine and simple maner. <hi>viz.</hi> That either they haue no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere at all in store; or else that it is such a sillie one, that they are ashamed to publish it; or at the least, that the answere which they speake of, is meere &amp; deepe sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And so I grant willingly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Silence is the answere to my bookes.</hi>
               </note> that my books haue receiued their answere in very deede. For as they haue hitherto answered me with silence, so I thinke they mean to do in future times; vnlesse perhaps they purpose to publish some sillie counterfeit answere, after it shall please God to call me to his mercie, and to take me out of this vale of mortalitie. For indeed they haue no reall answere in store, as I haue proued out of their own bookes; which the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will perceiue with all facilitie, in due peruse of this my present discourse: This is the third point,<note place="margin">

            <p>The Libeller telleth his Reader, (if hee may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

him,) that in this spirituall fight we haue the aduantage of the ground, and they both sunne and wind against them. And the Iesuits with their Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Popelings, doe often complaine of the inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of time. But it is a false complaint, and wholy swaruing from the truth, in this present case of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; publishing of bookes. For first, they are many, and my selfe but one. Secondly, they either al or the best learned amongst them, haue consulted and laid their heades and wits together, how and in what sort to answere me; as I haue already proued, in this short discourse.

               </note> how or in what sort to writ against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I protest vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they haue better store of bookes, (though they complaine of want therein, so to saue their credite if it would be,) then I either haue, or am able any way to procure. I proue it many waies. First, because the Iesuites in other countries haue most excellent Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, &amp; are indeed many of them very profound &amp; learned men. By meanes whereof, our English Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are able to write and publish moe bookes in three moneths, then my self can do in three whole yeares, if the truth were on their sides. For their father gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, hath all the Iesuites in the world at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand: who must lay their heades and wits together to doe at a becke whatsoeuer hee shall designe to be done. Hence commeth it, that our English Iesuites haue written and published, &amp; this day doe write &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish bookes at their good pleasure. But the truth doth and will preuaile, maugre their malice, and in spight of the diuell. Secondly, the Iesuits haue all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries
<pb facs="tcp:1607:65"/>
of all the Papists in this land, to vse them at their pleasures and commaunds. Thirdly, the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its can command the purses of the ablest and richest Papists in this kingdome, for the prouision and buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all such bookes as they desire. Fourthly, they can haue what bookes they will to be sent out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries to them. Fiftly, they haue such store of Gold and mony, that (as the secular Priests their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren write of them,) the Iesuite <hi>Garnets</hi> pompe &amp; expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces amounted yearely, to fiue hundred pounds at the least. The extraordinarie excesse of <hi>Iohn Gerard</hi> that gallant and swaggering Iesuite, was valued at an higher rate, then the priests could for shame expresse: the horses of the same <hi>Gerard</hi> were many, and of no small price. He had two Geldings in a Gentlemans stable, at <hi>30.</hi> pounds a Gelding, besides other else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and horses of good vse.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>All this is proued at large in my anatomie.</hi>
               </note> When he was Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the <hi>Clinke,</hi> he rode into the countrie at his own pleasure, (oh grieuous imprisonment,) and he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained two horses in the towne, with seruants in them continually. The apparell of the Iesuite <hi>Oldcorne,</hi> (though but a pettie Iesuite,) was sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome lesse worth, then thirtie or fortie poundes. Beside hee had eight good geldings, at one and the selfe same time. Another Iesuite had a girdle &amp; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, at the price of thirtie pounds. O braue Iesuites. O poore begging Fryers. Where is that pouertie, which you professe? the Iesuite <hi>Holt</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions gathered of the Papists in this Realme,<note place="margin">50000. <hi>pounds giuen for dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </note> the full summe of fiftie thousand pounds for English dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations; which (as the secular Priests their brethren doe reckon it) make two hundred millions of Italian scuts. Al this which I here affirme of the gallantrie of

our poore begging Fryers the Iesuites, is to be seene in my anatomie of popish tyrannie; euen <hi>verbatim,</hi> as it came from the Pennes of the Popish Seminary-Priest.
